            "extracted_content": "It would be good if for the participants they can take them modularly and that each of them has a certification project that's clear so we can confirm that the job can be done and is real. which means that in 5 days it can't be too intense, yet has to be pretty practical and we need to find people who can develop those skills in that time \nlet's review our options based on this initial work and then let's update this doc attached, let's add our goals (building assessment, design, and implementation) into the training, people don't need to take all of them, they leave and they can add a new skills that they can be paid for when they're done (install a panel, assess a house, etc) - the home audit might be done by another element of the BEIT project, so we should potentially keep that as an option. Also, we have a big open question about how to do the architecture merging of the old heritiage sustainable design and the new heritage designs, we need new architectural floor plans and design ideas - so either it can be a module where the final certification process is to design a new home that does this balance, or that needs to be added to the BEIT project to develop that. what could a module where people come and do this be like?EditRestructured training modules to align with job-ready skills.13sLet me analyze the current state of our work and the new inputs/requirements to provide a thoughtful review of our options.\nCurrent Structure (from the attached document):\n\nEnergy Generation & Independence\n\nFocus: Solar PV design, installation, and business readiness\nJob Pathways: Solar System Designer, PV Installation Technician, Solar Entrepreneurship\n\n\nThermal Comfort & Heritage Integration\n\nFocus: Passive cooling, insulation, and traditional retrofitting\nJob Pathways: Thermal Performance Consultant, Heritage Retrofitting Specialist, Green Building Inspector\n\n\nSustainable Materials\n\nFocus: Low-impact materials, circular building, and enterprise development\nJob Pathways: Sustainable Construction Contractor, Recycled Materials Specialist, Green Building Product Entrepreneur\n\n\n\nKey Requirements from the New Input:\n\nEach module should be modular and standalone\nEach should have a clear certification project that proves job readiness\nShould focus on practical, achievable skills within a 5-day timeframe\nShould align with one of the three goals: assessment, design, implementation\nShould address the heritage/sustainable design integration question\nShould consider how to incorporate architectural planning in a module or suggest it as additional work\n\nLet me think about how to reorganize the modules to better align with the assessment-design-implementation framework while maintaining as much of our current work as possible.\nApproach Considerations:\n\nModule 1 (Energy Generation) is already mostly implementation-focused and could be maintained with slight adjustments to emphasize practical installation skills.\nModule 2 (Thermal Comfort & Heritage) has elements of both assessment and design. We could potentially shift this to be either more assessment-focused or more design-focused.\nModule 3 (Sustainable Materials) could be repositioned to better address the architectural design integration challenge between heritage and modern sustainable approaches.\n\nLet me consider some options for restructuring:\nOption 1: Maintain current thematic structure but clarify role orientations\n\nModule 1: Energy Systems Implementation\nModule 2: Building Envelope Assessment\nModule 3: Sustainable Architectural Design\n\nOption 2: Reorganize completely by role\n\nModule 1: Green Building Assessment & Certification\nModule 2: Sustainable Architectural Design & Integration\nModule 3: Green Building Systems Implementation\n\nOption 3: Hybrid approach - keep themes but clarify role pathways\n\nModule 1: Energy Generation & Implementation\nModule 2: Building Performance Assessment & Retrofitting\nModule 3: Sustainable Design & Heritage Integration\n\nLet me evaluate each of these options against our requirements.\nRegarding the question about a module focused on merging heritage and sustainable design principles through architectural design:\nThis could be a focused 5-day module where participants:\n\nStudy traditional Iraqi architectural plans and passive design elements\nLearn modern sustainable design principles\nAnalyze case studies of successful integration\nDevelop design criteria for contemporary + heritage integration\nCreate architectural concept plans using both traditional and modern approaches\nPresent and defend their designs to a panel\n\nThe certification project could be a complete conceptual design for a small home or building that demonstrates successful integration of heritage elements with modern sustainability features.\nNow let me provide a comprehensive review of the three options I've outlined and make a recommendation.Review of Module Structure Options with Job-Ready Focus\nAfter reviewing our existing work and your new requirements, I've developed three approaches that maintain much of our previous content while ensuring each module delivers clear, practical job skills within the assessment-design-implementation framework.\nCurrent Status Analysis\nOur current three-module structure is well-developed but could benefit from clearer alignment with specific job roles and certification outcomes:\n\nModule 1 (Energy Generation) is primarily implementation-focused\nModule 2 (Thermal Comfort) combines both assessment and design elements\nModule 3 (Sustainable Materials) includes implementation and entrepreneurship components\n\nThree Potential Approaches\nOption 1: Role-Based Restructuring\nCompletely reorganize modules by professional role:\n\nGreen Building Assessment & Certification\n\nBuilding performance evaluation techniques\nIraqi Green Building Code application\nEnergy and thermal auditing\nCertification documentation\n\n\nSustainable Architectural Design & Integration\n\nClimate-responsive design principles\nHeritage-modern integration techniques\nSystem planning and specifications\nArchitectural concept development\n\n\nGreen Systems Implementation\n\nSolar system installation and testing\nThermal improvement implementation\nSustainable material application\nQuality assurance and verification\n\n\n\nPros: Clear job pathways; fits assessment-design-implementation framework\nCons: Requires significant restructuring of existing module content\nOption 2: Modified Thematic Structure\nMaintain thematic organization but refocus each module on a specific role:\n\nEnergy Generation & Installation\n\nFocus on implementation skills\nHands-on PV system installation\nSystem testing and commissioning\nClient delivery and maintenance\n\n\nBuilding Performance Assessment\n\nFocus on audit and evaluation skills\nGreen Building Code certification process\nThermal and energy performance testing\nRetrofit recommendations development\n\n\nSustainable Design & Heritage Integration\n\nFocus on architectural design skills\nTraditional-modern design fusion\nMaterial selection and specification\nComplete building concept development\n\n\n\nPros: Preserves most existing content; clear role delineation\nCons: Some content realignment needed between modules\nOption 3: Current Structure with Enhanced Role Focus\nKeep the current module themes but clarify job pathways and certification outcomes:\n\nEnergy Generation & Independence\n\nEmphasize hands-on installation skills\nCertification Project: Complete working solar installation\nJob Outcome: Qualified solar installer/technician\n\n\nThermal Comfort & Performance Assessment\n\nEmphasize evaluation and certification skills\nCertification Project: Complete building performance audit\nJob Outcome: Building assessor/performance consultant\n\n\nSustainable Materials & Construction Methods\n\nRemove entrepreneurship focus, emphasize application skills\nCertification Project: Material selection and installation plan\nJob Outcome: Sustainable construction specialist\n\n\n\nPros: Minimal disruption to existing content; clearer job outcomes\nCons: Less perfect alignment with assessment-design-implementation framework\nRecommended Approach: Option 2 - Modified Thematic Structure\nI recommend Option 2 because it:\n\nMaintains thematic organization while creating clearer role distinctions\nAddresses the assessment-design-implementation framework directly\nCreates a dedicated module for architectural design that can address the heritage integration challenge\nRequires moderate rather than extensive content reorganization\nProvides clear certification projects aligned with real job requirements\n\nAddressing the Heritage-Modern Architecture Integration\nModule 3 (Sustainable Design & Heritage Integration) would specifically address the architectural challenge you've highlighted. The 5-day structure could include:\nDay 1: Analysis of Traditional Iraqi Architecture\n\nDocumentation of heritage design principles\nPerformance analysis of traditional elements\nCase studies of successful preservation\n\nDay 2: Modern Sustainable Design Techniques\n\nContemporary green building approaches\nPerformance standards and requirements\nDigital design tools and methods\n\nDay 3: Integration Methodologies\n\nFusion of traditional and modern principles\nAdaptation strategies for heritage elements\nMaterial selection for balanced performance\n\nDay 4: Concept Development\n\nDesign studio workshop\nDevelopment of integrated building concepts\nTechnical specifications and details\n\nDay 5: Presentation and Certification\n\nFinalization of design concepts\nPresentation to expert panel\nDocumentation and defense of design approach\n\nCertification Project: Complete architectural concept for a small residence that successfully integrates heritage elements with modern sustainability requirements.\nThis creates a clear pathway for architects to develop specialized skills in heritage-modern integration while producing tangible design outcomes that could inform broader initiatives within the BEIT project.\nWould you like me to update the attached document with this recommended structure?RetryBGit's ok to make 4 modules if needed if we opened that avenue what might a better design be, I was sort of hoping to have something less ambiguous for the Iraqi market, for instance, home audit, solar power, insulation ventilation thermal envelope, green architecture or something like that - and not exactly that. that way it's clear what people are getting into - i know when we talk about \"solar training\" people line up out the doorEditReimagined training modules to align with Iraqi market needs8sThe request is asking me to reconsider our module structure, potentially expanding to 4 modules instead of 3, and making the names/focus areas more clearly defined for the Iraqi market. The user specifically mentions that when they offer \"solar training,\" people are very interested.\nThey suggest a structure like:\n\nHome audit\nSolar power\nInsulation/ventilation/thermal envelope\nGreen architecture\n\nI need to reconsider our modules with this feedback in mind.\nLet me think about a potential 4-module structure that:\n\nHas clear, market-friendly names\nMaintains the assessment-design-implementation framework\nAddresses the heritage-modern integration\nCreates tangible certification outcomes\nLeverages our existing work\n\nFor the 4 modules, I could develop something like:\n\nGreen Building Assessment & Certification\nSolar Energy Systems Installation\nThermal Envelope & Ventilation Improvement\nSustainable Architectural Design\n\nThis seems close to what the user is suggesting. Let me flesh out each module to ensure they have clear job outcomes and certification projects.Four-Module Structure with Clear Market Focus\nI understand your desire for clearer, market-friendly module titles that immediately communicate value to potential participants. A four-module approach could indeed better separate the specialized skills while keeping each module focused and achievable within 5 days.\nRecommended Four-Module Structure:\nModule 1: Green Building Assessment & Home Energy Auditing\nMarket Appeal: \"Learn to certify buildings under Iraq's Green Building Code\"\nJob Outcome: Certified Building Assessor/Energy Auditor\nCertification Project: Complete home assessment with recommendations report\n5-Day Structure:\n\nIraqi Green Building Code fundamentals\nEnergy consumption analysis and benchmarking\nThermal performance and air quality assessment\nWater and waste system evaluation\nCertification documentation and client reporting\n\nModule 2: Solar Energy System Design & Installation\nMarket Appeal: \"Design and install solar power systems for homes and businesses\"\nJob Outcome: Solar System Installer/Technician\nCertification Project: Functioning solar installation (small-scale)\n5-Day Structure:\n\nSolar resource assessment and system sizing\nComponent selection and system design\nElectrical connections and safety protocols\nInstallation techniques and mounting systems\nTesting, commissioning and maintenance\n\nModule 3: Building Envelope & Thermal Improvement\nMarket Appeal: \"Create comfortable, energy-efficient buildings using modern and traditional techniques\"\nJob Outcome: Insulation/Ventilation Specialist\nCertification Project: Thermal retrofit implementation plan with material samples\n5-Day Structure:\n\nBuilding envelope assessment and thermal imaging\nInsulation materials and installation methods\nNatural ventilation and cooling strategies\nTraditional passive cooling integration\nPerformance verification and quality control\n\nModule 4: Heritage-Inspired Sustainable Architecture\nMarket Appeal: \"Design beautiful buildings that honor Iraqi heritage while meeting modern sustainability standards\"\nJob Outcome: Sustainable Design Specialist\nCertification Project: Complete architectural concept for a small residence integrating heritage and modern elements\n5-Day Structure:\n\nDocumentation and analysis of traditional Iraqi architecture\nModern sustainable design principles and standards\nIntegration strategies for heritage and contemporary elements\nMaterial selection and performance optimization\nDesign development and presentation\n\nBenefits of This Structure:\n\nClear Market Positioning: Each module has an obvious skill focus that potential participants can immediately understand\nComplete Skills Framework: Covers the assessment-design-implementation spectrum with distinct professional roles\nHeritage Integration: Module 4 specifically addresses the architectural fusion challenge while Module 3 incorporates traditional cooling techniques at the implementation level\nPractical Certification Outcomes: Each module produces a tangible work product demonstrating job-ready skills\nModular Participation: Participants can take individual modules based on their interests or complete the full program for comprehensive skills\n\nImplementation Consideration:\nThe modules build in a logical sequence from assessment to implementation to design, but can be taken independently:\n\nModule 1 teaches how to evaluate buildings against standards\nModule 2 focuses on implementing solar energy systems\nModule 3 addresses improving building envelope performance\nModule 4 develops integrated architectural design skills\n\nThis approach keeps most of our existing content while reorganizing it into more market-friendly modules with clear employment outcomes for each.\nWould you like me to fully develop any particular module in this structure, or update the document with this new four-module approach?Retryinal Module List (Best of Both Worlds):\n\nModule\tTitle\tBased on\tTarget Role\n1\tGreen Building Assessment & Home Energy Auditing\tModule 1\tGreen Home Assessor\n2\tSolar Energy System Design & Installation\tModule 2\tSolar Installer\n3\tBuilding Envelope & Thermal Improvement\tModule 3\tInsulation & Ventilation pastedBGCan you use all our content to make a new curriculum update description using the four, the certiifcation project and reasoning should be present, the potential jobs people in Iraq could should be present, the way the modules evolve the modules we've already made should be present, make the learning objectives summary page for each one and Key Iraqi Green Building Code References and the 5 day overview as well as who are the targetted invited personas and their educational background EditArchitected comprehensive sustainable construction curriculum for Iraqi training3sI need to create a comprehensive curriculum update description for a four-module structure for sustainable construction training in Iraq. The document should include:\n\nOverview of the four modules\nHow they evolve from our existing three-module structure\nCertification projects for each module\nPotential jobs in Iraq for graduates\nLearning objectives for each module\n5-day breakdown for each module\nKey Iraqi Green Building Code references\nTarget personas and their educational backgrounds\n\nI'll organize this information in a professional document format using the information provided in the previous conversations and documents.\nThe four modules are:\n\nGreen Building Assessment & Home Energy Auditing\nSolar Energy System Design & Installation\nBuilding Envelope & Thermal Improvement\nHeritage-Inspired Sustainable Architecture\n\nLet me work through this systematically.BEIT Project - Sustainable Construction Curriculum: Four-Module FrameworkDocument ∙ Version 3 # BEIT Project - Sustainable Construction Curriculum\n## Four-Module Framework for Green Building Skills\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nThis document presents the refined curriculum framework for Objective 3.3 of the Building Equitable and Inclusive TransforBEIT Project - Sustainable Construction Curriculum\nFour-Module Framework for Green Building Skills\nExecutive Summary\nThis document presents the refined curriculum framework for Objective 3.3 of the Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq. Building on our previous work, we have restructured the curriculum into four clearly defined modules that directly address specific job roles in Iraq's emerging green building sector. Each module delivers practical, employment-ready skills while maintaining alignment with the Iraqi Green Building Code (مدونة العمارة الخضراء).\nThe revised curriculum creates distinct professional pathways while preserving the core content from our previous modules. Each module is designed as a standalone 5-day intensive program that culminates in a certification project demonstrating job-ready skills.\nCurriculum Evolution\nThe following table shows how our new

Germanها كابل على الصندوق الكهربائي، ربط البطارية، والإمفرتر على صندوق البروتكشن إللي بيفيوزات وبيجوزات بمراقبة للتيار الفولتية، تحويل الحمل ما للبيت على الحمل مع المنظومة، فيكون شخص عملي يكون وظيفته أخطر من وظيفة المهندس، لهذا لازم يكون يعرف إي أساسيات كهرباء يعرف ال. يعرف كيف إنه ما يفجر الباتري على عينه. وتصير مشكلة كبيرة، فهذا الشخص آه هو ال اللي راح ي يأخذ الشغل من المهندس ويبتدي يشتغل هنا الصوت، غالبا هذا التكنيشن هنا ال هو مخرج التدريب المهني\n\nBILAL\n.أنا عندهم تدريب مهني\n\nSALIH\n.يشتغل مادة مال الطاقة الشمسية خاصة بال بال اللي هي خاصة بال. إحنا ال مالنا من إنه نخرج هذا ال. بالضبط، وهذا الشخص يكون على شوية يكون هو عنده الأساسيات أكثر الهندسية والهيج والهيج، وهذا الشخص من الممكن إنه بالسوق راح يواجه أيض ا خريجين من بيت، لكن هم يشتغل وياهم، فأعتقد الماركت بالنسبة للسولار هو كلش واضح إي. نفس الوقت، سيستيم هو كلش واضح بالنسبة لنا، و آ و نفس الوقت يعني هو لأنه خمسة أيام على التك على التكنيكات يمارس، شوية. بتكفي فأي شي آخر. ما نقدر نخليه، حتى مدونة بناء أخضر، ما أعرف شنو أنا أشوفها، بعيدة عن ال. لأنه ال هو مو تحسين بالبناء، وإنما عملية استبدال لمصدر الطاقة. ما لها علاقة بموضوع التصميم والكوت وال، يعني هاي هذا اللي أعتقده، فهذه\n\nBILAL\n.مربوطين على ال على الخمسة أيام، وإحنا اختاريناه هيتشي من. من وين؟ ما أعرف وين اختاريناه؟ لو أكو سبب، يعني أنت اختاريت الرقم الخمسة الموصل بشكل يعني لا\n\nSALIH\n.ما عدنا، نحنا حاولنا إنه نخلي. تكون حتى التدريبات ستاندرد ستاندرد، بس إحنا إذا نشوف إنه نفسنا إنه نحنا نحتاج سبع أو ثمانية أيام بالسولار، ماكو مشكلة\n\nBILAL\n.خلينا نشوف\n\nSALIH\n.بالضبط، فممكن إنه نسويها استيام، ممكن نسويها ثمانية أيام، ماكو مشكلة كبيرة يعني. بالموضوع، بس إحنا حاليا أهم نقطة، أهم، أهم نقطة إنه إحنا فاهمين ال. الموجودين مع السولار هي وين رايحة؟ منو؟ خريجها من الناس اللي يدخل بيها، والسوق أكو سوق إلها\n\nBILAL\n.إي\n\nSALIH\n.وال solar سيستم أحسن ال المهندس الإنزليشن عزت، وغالبا يكون سيفيل إنجنير أو ميكانيكي إنجينير مرات يكون أصلا إي مختص أكثر بهذا المجال. لأنه الميكانيكال إنجنير هو يشتغل على مواضيع ال والتكييف والحرارة والمواقع، وكل هذه الأمور وأيض ا المهندس المدني بإمكانه إنه يشتغلوا بحكم إنه هو يبني البيت. فيكون قريب على. فكرة ال البناء البناء، هذا الشخص هو غالبا يشتغل بال. مهندس العزل. هو غالبا ما الناس تجيبوه حتى يصلح لها مشاكل. فهاي المشاكل إما تكون هي مشاكل حرارة، إما تكون هي مشاكل الطاقة، إما تكون هي مشاكل أصل ا أكو تسريب للمياه. فلازم. فلازم، فهذا الشخص من يجي يسوي بالمنازل لازم يعرف الهدف من ال من ال آ ال العزل العزل إللي شنو هو الحرارة، وتسريب مياه بنفس الوقت له، هل ها العزل، بعدين راح يقرر شنو نوع المادة إللي يستخدمها خمس تكنيكس مثل ا مختلفة للعزل، تختلف باختلاف موادها، شنو نوع المواد اللي يستخدمها لازم يتخذ قرار كلفة المواد لازم ي يبلغ بيها صاحب المنزل مباشرة؟ أو يصير عليها اتخاذ قرار. هل العزل راح يكون للأسطح؟ راح يكون للجدران؟ هل إذا هو كان للأسطح أو للجدران هل هو راح يكون عزل داخلي من داخل المنزل؟ ولا عزل خارجي من خارج المنزل؟ كل هذه هي قرارات لازم تعتمد على التكلفة، معتمدة على. المكان والمساحة معتمدة على القدرة الإقتصادية لسحب المنزل، فهذا وظيفة الشخص المهندس. إنه يسوي ال يسوي سيليكشن ال بنفس الوقت هو اللي يخلي الوصفة مال مادة، إيش قد يخلط مي مع هاي المادة، إيش قد المزيج يكون فيه نسبة من هذه المادة، وهذه المادة. لكم درجة حرارة مثلا، يصهر فد شيء معين حتى يخلوا هاي ال ال المواد البلاستيكية اللي تستخدم بالعز وغيرها وغيرها، فهذه القرارات هو ياخدها\n\nBILAL\n.هذا المجال عندها اسم بالسوق الحالي، يعني أكو فد شي اسمها\n\nSALIH\n.العوازل هو ماكو، ماكو كلمة، بس كل المكاتب. العوازل في السيكا وما سيكا، ومكاتب الكيماويات بها جزء كلش كبير منها مكاتب الكيمياويات. البناء يشتغل على عزل أكو كيمياويات أخرى لها علاقة بال بسد الفطور بسد ال آ. مشاكل البناء نفسه نفسه تمام تمام، لكن هذه مو سعر واحد\n\nBILAL\n.يريد يخابر عنده مشكلة بالعزل. صار فد شي يريد يخابر واحد يدور على واحد عنده، راح أعطيك\n\nSALIH\n.مثال هسه أكو مكتب اسمه\n\nBILAL\n.الاسم ماكو اسم. هاهاها\n\nSALIH\n.مكتب الهدف تلقي لي واحد، أبو العز، الناس ما تعرف الناس ما راح تعرف مثلا إم الشخص، ولا تهتم بالشخص لأنه كله عم تحكي عن قطاع سيمي فورمال أو بالحقيقة رح يجي على سيكا. يقول هذولا يشتغلون بالعوازب. أو راح يجي على مثلا واحد اسمه مكتب الهدف في الهندسي، هذا مكتب هو يسوق لنفسه إنه مختص بالعوازل، عنده وكالة من شركات تركية لمواد عازل، راح يجي عليك يك أو يخابره يقول له سوي لي زيارة للبيت، أني عندي مشكلة تسريب مياه إم. أو عندي مشكلة أريد أسوي سطح مالي عازل، راح المهندس إللي موجود في مكتب الهدف. ب بغض النظر عن التايتل مانو، بغض النظر عن شنو هو عنده، راح يروح للبيت يسوي كشف. كل هذا وزير الإتفاق، وينتظر قرار من أبو البيت يصير بعدين يمشون لقدام يخلون موعد، هذا المهندس يجيب التيم ماله؟ يختار المواد، يسوي الميكس ويسوي إشي كذا، ويسرد السجن عليها، ممكن يروح للسايت معاهم، يشرحلهم كذا وكذا وكذا، يشرف عليهم ويعوفهم ويكملون الشغل. تمام، but technicians تقريبا\n\nBILAL\n.أنه لما كنت أحكي ويا السيكا this was one of. The things اللي هم شجعوا بها هواية لأنه يريدون ناس يروحون يقدرون يشوفون الوضع عشان هي بالبيت، وبعدين ويا ال. هذه المشكلة، وبعدين يرجعون على الكرلاق مالتهم\n\nSALIH\n.هو، هو، هو، هذا. هذا. هذا الشي ح تمام، صحيح بهذا السكتور إم حتى بالسولار إنيرجي إيتز سام إم السولار إنيرجي أنت تروح للبيت وأسس كم غرفة كم طفل، كم يدفع حالي ا للمولدة، كم أمبير عنده حاليا وأسس وضعه الاقتصادي، وبداما أنت. Technical and visibility situation لهذا الشخص إذا أنطيت شيء أكبر من الثوب ماله أغلى من حجمه. راح ينهزم يقول أنت تبيع غالي. إذا أنطيته شي أقل راح يضوج لأنه هو ما راح يكفي. فهي البروسيس كلها هي. هو بكل ال منها الستيجات إلى هذا الزبون، يقرر إنه إي، أوكي أنا راح أروح وياه هذا الشخص أو هذولا الناس فهي\n\nBILAL\n.ما نحتاج بعد؟ لازم ايكون كلش واضح. اهنانا ناس يعرفون يعني و\n\nSALIH\n.حسابات هي هاي المفاهيم الأساسية، كفايننشال ترسيه إللي إحنا نحتاج، نحتاج إنه الشخص المهندس يعرف يتواصل مع الزبون، يبين له الجدول، اقتصاديا، يبين له مثلا آ الرجال، و أيضا بعد تقني آخر، مثلا الناس حاليا قد يكون يستخدمون العوازل دون قياس. لمقدار العزل مالها وتأثيرها على الطاقة، بالإمكان إنه نحنا باستخدام الموارد الموجودة نعرفهم إنه هذا العزل إذا زاد نسبة ال وبهالجت إي راح يكون إلها تأثير ها القد على الطاقة. راح ت تقلب الطاقة ال طاقة، التبريد والتدفئة بحلقته، وهذا ينعكس على ال والكوست مالها بحلقة، فهاي أيضا هي هي مهمة جدا موضوع التصميم لمن؟ أنا أصمم، ليش أختار هذه المادة عن هديك المادة، وممكن يكون الهاي أفضل إي بنفس الوقت هي مفيدة بالساس، لأنه راح تتحسس الزبون إنه العزل، هو مو بس راحة، وإنما هو جدوى اقتصادية. من خلال إنه هو راح يحتاج طاقة أقل للتبريد، راح يحافظ على برودة البيت لمدة أطول. أو حرارة البيت لمدة أعطوه\n\nBILAL\nواحد من الأشياء إللي طلعت من الأساس، إنت مالتنا إنه هو من الطاقة البيت، آه يعني تروح على تدفئة المي آه ندخلها هذا هنا بال؟\n\nSALIH\n.الحلول، شو اسمه، أعتقد يعني ممكن واحد يتكلم عن شيء بسيط عن العوازل إللي موجودة، هو الجيزر، مال ماي هي عازل إم صراحة؟ لعزال وكل شيء تمام. ف. ااا الناس. الشتاء تحتاج مي حار، فتشغل ال الكيزة، لكن هل أكو بديل؟ أكو سخان شمسي بديل؟ كفاءة أقل؟ بس هل أكو طريقة إنه أنت تزيد بالعزل مع التانكي و ما تحتاج بعد الطاقة بهذه الكمية؟ صراحة لأ، لأنه هو معزول بالزجاج ال آ ال الألياف الزجاجية إي إي كلها مصنعة، صح؟ بالضبط، فهو يحافظ على نفسه ممكن يوم كامل 24 ساعة إم ممكن أكثر بس آ لازم لا بد إنه أنت ت تحمل مياه للمياه هي تكون باردة، ممكن أكو ناس يستخدمون ال هذه الألياف الزجاجية على ال التانكيات إللي موجودة بالأسطح إم في الصيف، لأنه الشمس لمن تضربها تكون حارة جدا، تنكيات من معدن تحت حافظ على درجة زينة للماي. آ يكونون يلفوها؟ هذا يعني ممكن واحد يطرق على بعض من استخدامات الألياف الزجاجية كمادة عازلة. تمام\n\nBILAL\nزين لعاد يجوز نحرك الفكرة، مال نينهو، آه طلعت هذه الفكرة إنه نحتاج نسوي فد شي أكثرية الطاقة مع البيت، ينكب المي إللي ما تستعمل، ويعني بيها إستهلاك هواية آه مو بال؟\n\nSALIH\n.بال بالصيف، الناس تطفي الجيزر، يعني أنا بالصيف هسه هسه بعد شهر راح أطفي الكيزر، ما أصرف طاقه ع الحرارة، مال المياه، ليش؟ لأنه الشمس رح تحميل المياه، ال. كل مياه البيت\n\nBILAL\nعندك طاقات؟ لو حد لك للتدفئة المياه؟\n\nSALIH\n.لا، لأن التانكي السطح من معدل، فلما تضرب الشمس ناتشرلي هو راح يصير حار\n\nBILAL\n.لعاد ليش هذا؟ ديقولون ناس يعني بالبحوثات إنه\n\nSALIH\nبالشتاء، صحيح؟\n\nBILAL\n.الشتا. ها بس بالشتاء\n\nSALIH\n.و بالشتاء بس\n\nBILAL\nع السنة كله يطلع واحد من أكثر الاستهلاك ال آ، يعني ذي بلاسيز، و the most waste happens\n\nSALIH\n.ما أنت ما تقدر تكون ها الشكل، لكن ال الحمل بالشتاء يكون أعلى، لأنه في هيترات للماي وهيتارات إللي هي التدفئة فهاي المجموع ها يكون مستهلكة أكثر من ااا مجموعة المبردات وأجهزة التبريد. فأوفر all هو\n\nBILAL\n.فالإنسليشن إنجنير ما عندها مثل واحد يعني آه ديريكتير واحد إمبلمنتر واحد ديزاينر إمبلمنتر، هو الواحد إللي يروح يسوي الأسا وإللي يبيع و يطبق كله نفس الشخص\n\nSALIH\n.لأ، التطبيق. لأ، التطبيق أيضا أكو تكنيشنز، وهذا ال. هذا الشيء رح يجون عليه. إم راح نسوي تدريب أيضا بعد الطاقة الشمسية. آ إللي هو عن ال إنسليش أني شلت البنت، ليش ما له وجدوة كبيرة، لأنه ال. هو يعني حتتخلى بكل غرفة وهي حتلعب الدور الأساسي؟ في استبدال الهواء، تنقية الهواء و. والربط بين الداخل والخارج\n\nBILAL\nيعني. يعني لما طلعنا ال إينتريبينورشيب تشيك it doesn't make any sense إنه إنخلي كل كل واحد من عندهم يشوف شلون ال ال البيت التراثي كان يدبر هذول الأمورات، يعني شلون البيت، التراث كان يس يسوي ال آه برج الرياح، و فما فوق ال بس إنت\n\nSALIH\nيعني ونستعملها هذه الشغلات\n\nBILAL\n.بس\n\nSALIH\n.ماكو هذه الشغلات صراحة يعني\n\nBILAL\n.ماكو شي بالسوق، إنه الناس يقدرون يشتروها\n\nSALIH\n.ما راح تكون عملية بالضبط، ما راح تكون عملية. مع هدول الناس، هذول الناس يفتهمون شي بال بال يعني مجرد بالإيد هسة، راح نجي على هذا الموضوع، إم فالتكنشنز ياخذون ال ال الوصفة والتفاصيل من المهندس إي، وهما إللي راح يمسكون الهاند تولز، هما إللي راح يخطوهم بإيدهم، هما إللي راح يروحون. بالسايت ولازم تكون عندهم معرفة أيضا تقنية كيف ينفذون هذا العمل، كيف يصلون لأفضل تفاصيل للوصفة، وكل شي آه ويبدون يشتغلون، أيضا لازم تكون عندهم معايير للسيفتي للنفسهم ولأصحاب المنزل خلال العمل، معايير للنظافة، إي كل شي\n\nBILAL\nإثنين التكنيشن واحد، وال فوقاه ال ال إنجنير، يعني مثل آه مثل ال سوسم الجنير تكنيشن\n\nSALIH\n.تكنيشن، إحنا رح نستهدف ال مفاهيم\n\nBILAL\nيعني إحنا ما. لازم. جايين نقدر جايين يعني بالضبط، أوكي؟\n\nSALIH\n.الشيء الأخ الأخير. اللي هو ال. هم عادة يشتغلون مكاتب هندسية، المكاتب الهندسية، كيف؟ شنو فكرتها؟ إنه هي تيجي عليها، تريد تبني بيت عندك قطعة عرض أو تبني عمارة تطلب من عندهم إنه في البداية يقولوا لك إحنا ترى 10% إم، إش قد تصرف؟ أون؟ 1,000,000 دولار، نحنا ناخد 100,000. If، he's interesting that's\n\nBILAL\n.A very interesting pricing model ok hey i'm moving\n\nSALIH\n.كم تصرف؟ إيش تريد يسوولك؟ إيش قد ال هما ياخدون إسمه أقل نسبة، ممكن تكون 67 بالمية تصل إلى 12، ممكن أكو ناس تصل إلى أكثر ما أعرف، بس هذه النسب تتراوح بين عشرة 912. شنو اللي يصير؟ يبدي يبدي يأخذ ال المعماري بهذا الم ال المكتب هو اللي يصمم تصميم لخريطة البيت، تصميم لي واجهة البيت تصميمين. هذه التصميمين القرار، مال الزبون مهم جد ا بيها. هو يقرر عليها. بعض ال. بعض البيوت، بعض ال ال يعني المكاتب بدرجة أقل تأخذ ااا تسوي تصميم داخلي، بس هذه كلش يعني معناها إللي تبون حتى تأثيث رح يطلب منه تمام الأسماء اللي هي تصميم الواجهة وتصميم المنزل\n\nBILAL\nبس فهل بهالبيزنيس مارو يعني؟ آه ماكو آه أي إنسينتيفي واحد يسوي إبداع ولا يجرب يسوي جديد ولا أيز يعني as quickly as possible get the design done with this is a problem آه\n\nSALIH\n.أنت. أنت إيش؟ قد تسوي إبداع؟ إيش قد تسوي؟ شغلات جميلة وعملية تقدر تسوقها حتى تجيب تباين أكثر. إم. لأنه أكو كثير مكاتب هندسية\n\nBILAL\n.يعني معروفين وأكوب مكاتب، يعني ناس يقولون لا تروحون على هذا. هاهاها\n\nSALIH\n.إي أكو أكو حتى أكو اختصاصات، أكو مكاتب تأخذ فلوس مع الزناجيل فتشتغل بأريحية أكثر، أكو مكاتب تبني كل شي، أكو مكاتب تبني بنار رخيص، مقاولين إم يعني و. أكو أي، فأكو بدت بال\n\nBILAL\n.لو. بال يعني آ خلينا نقول\n\nSALIH\n.لأ أزيد شي. سووه ينسبوا لك ويا البيت طاقة الشمسية يستعينون بالشركات الموجودة، ونسبون طاقة الشمسية، فهنا أحلى الروم، مالنا إنه. To use، both sustainable a greenhousing and heritage tools. And in in، the modern houses، فهنا هذه بعد ما تنتقل طبعا العملية من ال يوافق الزبون يبدون مهندسين مدنيين وياخذون أفكار وتفاصيل من المعماري، ويبدي المعماري أيضا يشرف على البيت على المدنيين، ويبدو هاي المكاتب عندها عمال تشتغل باختصاصات مختلفة، هم ما موظفينهم هم، لكن يشتغلون باليومية ويشتغلون بال. كمية هل كانت متر من السيراميك؟ سافوا؟ هل كانت؟ هلقيت؟ من اللبخ؟ من اللي ما أعرف إيش حسابه؟ كل شيء بحسابه يعني؟ هم الناس اللي يلتقون بال يأخذون من عندهم. وعادة يكون كلش بسيط لأنه ال هم مو. عندي\n\nBILAL\n.طفلين، وزوجة\n\nSALIH\n.إي آ يأخذون يعني هي ما أكثر ترى من هاي طفلين وزوجة، وإنه أحتاج هاي الغرفة، وما أعرف شنو والحديقة أريدها، لو ما أريدها، والواجهة أريدها إم بيضاء وفخمة، لو الواجهة عادية، يعني هاي ال فري فيري يعني إم في حالة المكاتب يصممون تصميم إذا ما عجبوا الشخص يسموه من ثاني أو مرات ينطوا خيارين أو ثلاثة للتصميم مال المنزل. تمام، وبعث ما يوافق ويسأل كل شيء تمام، تنتقل العملية مثل ما ذكرنا. فآني بدي أشوف يعني من هذا ال. للسوق، لأنه هذا يعني. حاولت أفكر بالسوق بالسوق ونرجع لورا. صح؟ from this very basic abstraction to the rule of these different personas. In the local arraqian muscle market i recommend that we have three module. الأول. Focus only، on solar energy with، the عرفنا شنو هي يعني هي عملية استخدام المعادلات والأرقام لإيجاد الجدوى. بالضبط للزبون، وللشركة نفسها. إي. نفس الحجم. تمام. And the third we'll focus on sustainable housing including aspect of korean code and heritage architects architecture يعني شنو إحنا ال. ممكن يكون فيها يوم كامل يخص المدونة البناء الأخضر العراقي، أو ممكن مدونة البناء الأخضر العراقي تتوزع على المادة لأنه فيها أكثر من جزء، والبناء التراثي، العناصر التراثية من الممكن إنه تنطب يوم أو يومين. تمام\n\nBILAL\n.الثالث مال مال أركيتيكت آه\n\nSALIH\nفأنا شنو رح يصير عندي؟\n\nBILAL\n.ويا اللي أنا؟ واحد كان واحد كان إنسلاشن وبإنتوليشن، والثالث كان أركيتك، بس الرابع إنت ما أعرف إذا تتوقع نقصه، لو لأ مال ما تتوقع، نحتاج، لو هدول جايين من مكان ثاني\n\nSALIH\n.آه شنو هاي هسا؟ آني؟ أخذت الأفكار اللي أنت سويتهم ورجعت للسوق، بعدين رجعت دمجت يعني بعض الشغلات، فطلعت إنه أنا عندي. وواحد هو تجميعه لكل أدوات الاستدامة اللي تخص المعماري تخص التصميم\n\nBILAL\n.مال العراق عراق دييز. إي\n\nSALIH\n.The other thing. إحنا ليش نتعب على شي؟ و الريدي أكو ديجيتال طول راح يسووها، وراح يجي دكتور حسام يدرب مجموعة من المهندسين من نقابة المهندسين، وأني راح أحاول أحضر التدريب معاهم حتى أفهم هذه الديجيتال تول كيف تشتغل، والديجيتال تول، هذه إذا اشتغلت واستخدمناها بالمنازل مع إم. راح أحاول أستخدمها. لوين أجيب مهندسين من. من؟ مكاتب هندسية؟ وأنطيهم تدريب عليها ليتر مو ضمن المواد لي. ف ذا بوسينيس، يعني إنه\n\nBILAL\nناس يعني مقارنة بكل البقية، يعني هذا تأخذ هاي من كلية وتجي تدربها ويسوي فد شي اللي بيها فائدة، وهم أنا اللينكس هم اللي دشتغل عليها. فقلت يعني إذا نحتاج نسوي جابز؟ easy location، بس either it's going to happen somewhere or another is going to happen because i just هو موجود؟\n\nSALIH\n.إحنا موجود وما. ما يعني هو موجود ب راح يتطور العدات، ما بس يتطور، تدريب، تطور، يعني. يعني للماركت العراقي، والبيت العراقي، إم راح يصير تدريب عليها، راح تستخدم من قبل عشرة إنجنير حتى يسوون. لي، أعتقد 500 منزل، فهذا إذا إحنا جينا سوينا. راح يرجعون علينا كيف؟ والجماعة يقولون أنتو بدها تعيد، بدها تسوون دوبل وورك معانا، فراح نف يعني راح نفوت بمكان إنه نسوي يابا، إحنا ليش؟ فمن البداية حتى إحنا نكون عارفين هما وين رايحين وإحنا وين رايحين ويفوكس. م إنجنير إنجنير وال نعطي حقيبة متكاملة من العناصر والأدوات والمعلومات والتقييمات للعناصر المختلفة إللي ممكن يوظفها في عملية تصميم ولأي مبنى وأي فناء. آه، أو أي هاوس حتى تكون أكثر إستدامة؟ هذه أتوقع\n\nBILAL\n.تكون حلو، آه، وأنا بس ال أون أو ذي إستراتيجيز for the three parts أشوف إنه أح إحنا ما نحتاج نشتغل على ال هذا رح يروح مع فنحنا. كان أساس\n\nSALIH\n.بلال. ح. حتى نكون واقعيين واقعيين بدون بدون شي براكتيكال. مستحيل، أي إنسان يتعلم يشي يعني أني أنت بإمكانك أن تشرحلي خمس أيام عن الإنفرتر، وإذا أنا ما أمسك الإنفرتر بيدي وما أشوف النوعية اللي موجودة بالسوق، طول عمري ما رح. ما رح أعرف يعني مثل\n\nBILAL\n.ما يكون عمليين، حتى يقدرون يحكون، أكيد الناس إللي دا يشتغلون همينة، إي والله\n\nSALIH\n.طبعا، طبعا الديزاينر يحتاجون. يعرفون كل شي يسويه ال. بس التكنيشن يدويا عنده مهارة أفضل منه. لأن الديزاين عملية الدزاين هي عملية، إن أنت تعرف كل شيء، إن ديتلز وتحط يعني حتى تحصل. فالفرق بين التكنشنز عندهم مهارة يدوية أفضل، يعني ممكن الكابل إذا المهندس يمده إم بترايكيبل يحتاج يجوز ساعة 1/2 ساعة التق التكنيشن يجوز ب10 دقايق يكمل، لأن هو س يعني حرك. بروح مكانات كلش بعيدة، يستغرق على السطح، يتسلق على جدار، يتوقف على حايط، هو عنده هاي، لكن بنفس الوقت المهندس هو لازم يعرف إيش، تيسير بال شنو تصميمه، كيف يتنفذ، شنو العاكسات\n\nBILAL\n.بالنهاية\n\nSALIH\nتهز لمن؟ ي يطبق؟\n\nBILAL\n.آ، وأني إذا أشوف إنه فرق لأنه ب بالطريقة التدريب مالتي بشكل عام. قبل ما نطبق وأنت تريدني أركز يعني لأنه هو ما عنا وقت هواية و مليانة أشياء لازم نعلم يعني يعني. نقطة ع كل ال. يعني ونركز بس على التطبيق إي بس\n\nSALIH\n.خلينا نشوف يعني بلال أعتقد بالنسبة إلي يعني بحكم إنه هاي موجودين بالسوق بدها نتفاعل مع الناس إي يعني بال مثلا هاي طولت شهرين بالفترة السابقة، آ أسوي إنترفيو ساعتين وثلاثة مع. إم. فأني وأروح شركاتهم. حضرت عملية تنصيب أكثر من آ من هاوس ومن كذا. ودا شوف شو يصير بيها ومن دا يشتغل. إي شنو ال يعني عمليا شنو دا يصير؟ فبالنسبة إلي خصوصا السولر سيستم. أنا أعرف المشا المشكلة، وأعرف ال التفاصيل كلها، فما أريد أعيد البروسس أكثر، هسه أني بالنسبة لي رح أقضي وقت أكثر، بالفترة الجاية أقرأ عن الإنسوليشن إي، حتى إذا هو ما اختصاص الهندسي إم راح أقرأه عن نوع المواد، أريد تكون عندي فهم توكاليتي على الأقل حتى لمن ألتقي مع ناس أو أحاورهم في. في سوق المدينة. أني أعرف بالضبط شنو هم ديحكون، فهذه بالنسبة إلي راح. حكوا عنها شوية أكثر. بس أعرف وحدة من ال اللي س سويناها، شفنا إنه واتس ذاكستنغ سولوشن that people adopting in the greenhousing تقريبا 60% حكوا إن هم مسوين فدعة وازم. فمعناها هو it's an existing solution، بس هو exists بطريقة informal بطريقة ما منظمة نحنا بنحاول نطلع ناس عندهم التكنيكالات الصحيحة، عندهم ال الصحيحة يفهمون هذه المواد أصولها كيف باستخدامها، كيف؟ وشنو إيجابياتها وسلبياتها وأسعارها وكل شي، حتى لمن يسوون عملية تصميم أو معالجة. عدهم الفكر الصحيح\n\nBILAL\n.وإذا اتقول إنه ب. إذا، إن هذول الناس يجدون يطورون يعني القابليات مالتهم حتى يلقون عمل، وما رح يهملهم إذا يعرفون، يعني المشكلة ال بالبيئة بالعراق، وشو حيصر بالخمس سنين الجاية، يعني مو مهم\n\nSALIH\nأنت تعرف المشكلة الوحيدة؟\n\nBILAL\nلأنه أنا أحب أشوف الناس أكثر، يعني عندهم فهم ما تعرف هذا اللي راح يجوز يسوي هذا أربع سنين، خمس سنين بس شلون رح نقدر نبدي؟ يخليه يفكر بالمستقبل بلا ما نقول لأي شي على ما يعرف إنه أكو فد شي ال ال القابلية مال مال اي لو؟ نحكي اي بوقت قصير عن برج الرياح، يجوز ما كانوا يعرفون عنها كثير، ويجوز يفتحوا العيون، يجوز ما رح يطبقوها، بعمل، هم، بس أريد أفتح بيبان للمستقبل. Either this is not the right place for it low. شنو رأيك يستوعبوها؟\n\nSALIH\n.لو أني أعتقد. أعتقد إنه بالتصميم مال الماديول، هذه كلها ما تكون موجودة إم، لكن يبقى الخيار، يبقى الخيار إنه بعدين أكو مقدمة إم مثل ما ذكرنا، هذا مو. مو موجود بالموجود، كل موجود ومختص، لكن ال حيجمع معلومات من ديفرانت مودلز، ويكون مقدمة جلسة مثلا من ساعة أو 1:30 ساعة. مقدمة عن السيستانيبلتي إيراك تشالنج آ. ن كود؟ about this and، this and، this module two we highlight، the main ideas of things how do we can do it in the presentation. Yeah\n\nBILAL\n.لمن؟ أنا رايح على؟ سوت يعني فيلم 3 دقايق لو أقل، آه يوضح إحنا ليش هنا؟ all، the different pieces there's like three different modules يعني gives the big picture، وبعدين نقدر نكمل it could be just a nice little thing to do\n\nSALIH\n.إحنا نقدر هذه الأدوات كلها نقدر نسويها، نقدر نسوي فيديو مقدمة. بداية كل تدريب نستخدمه و يكون آه بالبراند مال إي و آي تي سي، وكل شي كل هذول الشغلات آ، لكن آ يعني هذا؟ مو فد شي آ يعني؟ خلي نقول لازم يكون موجود بال. آه لأ، عادي، يعني ممكن يكون ميديا ستاف، أنا راح أشير وياك فيديو هسه همينا\n\nBILAL\nبيبي. يا خ. خلينا انشوف. راح أروح أحاول أشوف what the modules look like with all of the things removed will i am really يبقى، وإذا يكفي، يعني أنا حبيت الفكرة مالتك إنهم بقي على خمسة أيام. وكيف يعني ال. حتى ال يعرفون أوكي راح نسوي واحد من هدول، نحتاج خمس أيام، هذا الرذم يتعودون عليها إي وأي س for each of them أكو إحتمال؟ seems like it has to be bigger يعني إذا راح نسوي كل اللي حكيت عنها ب. ما أعرف شلون؟\n\nSALIH\nيعني إحنا ممكن نركز على يعني. الشغلات الأكثر أهمية. إيه؟ رزبط ف ممكن ست أيام، ممكن سبع أيام ماكو مشكلة كبيرة، إذا شفنا إنه أكو شغلات كل مهمة لازم تكون موجودة ب بهذا ال آ المكان إم مع هذا أني بس أردت أقول لك شنو ال بصورة عامة إحنا الجرين هاوسينج سكتر وبنفس الوقت فهذا يتضمن عملية ال. اللي يشتغلون على. يشتغلون على رح يبنون ميتين منزل بالموصل. كلفة واطئة بمعايير استدامة، إحنا كتدريب عدنا السيستاني. Mom يشتغل، يشتغل فيورلي على موضوع ال نيو هاوسينج. يعني ما راح احذفها اللي شبيته على مد يسوي مشربيا ولا يسويه؟ كوليدورما الهوى ولا كل شي صح؟ فهو كيرلي يشتغل على السيستانيبل هاوسينج ديزاين. Module يشتغل على الإثنين إم يشتغل بالمنازل الجديدة، وال. هو 99% يشتغل على المنازل الموجودة. ايه معناها ال يعني اللدائن المواد المقاومة للحرارة والهتش؟\n\nBILAL\nأه إي يعني؟\n\nSALIH\n.إي and you can't check، the term، this is، just the suggestion. Title and i مو title أصلا هاي بس keywords عن الموديو\n\nBILAL\nيشتغلون، يعني هذول إثنين بال. أكثر شيء على، والهدف بشكل عام، هذا، فراح نقطع ال. لأنه. نركز. على ال. And yeah بدي أشوف ال الطريقة اللي نقدر. الحلو بيها إنبسطتلنا إياه. ز. Multi factorial as. It used to be بنفس الوقت. كان عندي سؤال، خلينا نشوف إذا كتبت هنا. الميتين بيت الجديد منو يسوي لها ال شلون نقدر يعني نشوف إذا نقدر نشتغل وإياهم حتى نتعلم من عينهم؟\n\nSALIH\n.لحد الآن، هو واحد من الشغلات إللي لازم نشتغل وياهم، حتى بالثري بوينت ثري واحد من إنه أني أسوي معاهم، و ونطلع هذا البروتوتايب نستفاد منه بالتدريبات وبكل شي، بس على أرض الواقع، لحد الآن ماكو أحد حتى فوكل بوينت من اليونان هابيتات يعني عراقي بعد ما معينين أحد بدها ننتظر يصير من عندهم شي؟ حاليا ماكو شي من يوم\n\nBILAL\n.Yeah هذا ال un projects بيهم، هذول المشاكل هواي مرات يعني. بس الحلو بيناتنا إن شاء الله، نقدر دائما نتعاون ميتنج بالصبح، وميتينج إن ذا أفدرون نغير أفكارنا دائما، وأدابتبه، إي، بس إي راح آخذ هاي وأغيرها. وبعدين نشوف شلون نقدر نحكي وياه موصل سبيس\n\nSALIH\nأني بالنسبة ليا أهم شي إنه هسه نحنا اتفقنا هاي ل صح؟\n\nBILAL\n.يا. يا نقطع ال آ ال آ، ونركز على السولو إنسليشن\n\nSALIH\n.بالظبط، أه، و الفانتاليشن تيك، بس هل أنت مثلا الفيتاليشن مثلا هسع أني قاعد بموصل سبيس؟ آه؟ غالبا ما المكان ب؟ أكثر من مكان، وهاي سبليت إير كونديشن دتكون إمفرتر مثلا شوي شوي بدها تتحول، أكو بعض المكانات الواطئة التكلفة، يخلون هذه المبردات\n\nBILAL\n.إي شايفهم مرات يحطوها بره\n\nSALIH\nهي دائما لازم بره لأنه ما تتخلى جوها تسوي رطوبة عالية لأنه المي يدور بيها إم تمام؟ فهذه هي تقنية قديمة، آ الناس بدها تبدي شوية شوية تروح باتجاه آ. أكثر تنلغي يعني مثلا أني بالبيت ما عندي ولا مبردة؟ استعد إنه أبقى بحرارة، بس ما أجيك مبردة، لأنه مشاكلها كثيرة وبر البيت وكذا، فهل الفنتلاشن؟ شنو المواضيع إللي رح يغطيها؟ آه من هاي الناحية يعني؟\n\nBILAL\nمشان يعني راح نحركها إلى لأنه هوي من عندها كان عن ال بيوت أو جاردن أوبن سبيس، يعني هواية أشياء هيتشي ف\n\nSALIH\n.إذ ا هي صح رح تكون مع الاركتش، لأنه أنا ليش قلت لك يعني قلت خليني أكتب البرسونة، مال هذول الناس حتى أنا أخلي نفسي بمكانه بالتدريب، أنت بدها تحكي لي عن و و للجدار والعزل إم وشنو تخليك قد رح يفرق وال كلها، بعدين تقول تصميم المشروبية أو ما أعرف شنو يعني مو دماغي، ما رح آه بعيد عن هذا الشيء\n\nBILAL\nمو آه ناس إذا يدورون عمل، آه كان عندي سؤال ثاني، ي يجوز تعرف ل من وين جايين كل الفرن يعني البيت الفرن، أكيد أكو واحد صمام عنده ديزاين بلانز فتشي، وهذول ال يعني؟ do we replace their templates with even very very minor better templates ronnie نعزمهم هذولا على architecture thing مو الناس الزناقيين اللي عندهم\n\nSALIH\n.إستديو معروف وما أدري شنو أنت بتعرفه مين جاية، هاي الفكرة، الفكرة جاية إنه عدد كلش كبير من الناس إي يبنون بيوتهم بنفسهم، إم بدون ما يستخدمون. معماريين، ولا يريدون تصميم ولا مهندسين، وأكو ما بس ها الشكل، أكو مابس يبنونه بنف بيوتهم بنفسهم كمقاولين، أكو سيراميك، هو يشتغلوا أء البناء، وممكن هو يشتغلوا، خصوصا الناس اللي جايين من بالقرى تكون عندهم هاي ال. كانت مو كلش قوية، بس هو بالنسبة له توفر فلوس، فلهذا الناس يروحون إنه هو شايف خريطة مكان، فهو يعرف بدماغه هذه وهي سهلة البناء، بس مربعات إم، فيروح يبنيها. هذا أكبر سبب\n\nBILAL\nيعني شلون أي أي طريقة نقدر نلمس هذا المشكله؟ شلون نقدر إنتراكت و؟\n\nSALIH\n.إحنا ممكن إنه نخلي الناس بالتدريبات يسوون لي لي خرائط منطقية مثل ا بيت مساء 150 م، واجهت من أمتار إم، ويكون التصميم مثلا ينشر في مكان ما، أو هو الشخص يشيره بالسوشال ميديا ماله بال وات إيفر ماله، فهو يمتلك حقوق التصميم، لكن هو مفتوح للناس، إنه. فهذا. ي الناس تشوف شغلات جديدة وهيك أنت الاستثمار بالمعماريين هو الاستثمار الأفضل، لأنه المساحات بدها تصغر، كلفة الأرض بدها تغلى، إم الناس بدها تواجه مشاكل، فتري المعماريين بشكل أكثر. أعتقد الاستثمار بالمعماريين هو على المدى البعيد مجدي\n\nBILAL\nإي بس you just not the best for creating jobs but maybe better at creating an impact but تغيير وتفكير. ولازم يكون ال ال أتوقع يعني أوبن سورس، هم بس مو بس رخيص يعني بالبناء، بس رخيص على السنين الجاية يعني. شلون واحد يقدر يحكي على ناس يفتحمون هذا الفكرة بالعراق؟ يفكرون بيها إنه البيت مو بس بيت البيت بيها ال مالتها يأثر بالكلفة ال الثانوية؟\n\nSALIH\n.اي طبعا هم ليش يشترون من سيارات تويوتا؟ لأنه تعطى للسيارة والأوبراشن روست مالها يكون كلش قليل بينما. إي بينما أكو يعني آه سيارات أخرى أرخص، لكن مشاكلها كثيرة\n\nBILAL\nLet's create، the open source toyota house my molecule، بس إنت تقول هذا يطلع من خلال الورشة، يجوز أول مرة نسويها ثاني مرة نسويها، كل كل مرة نسويها إي ال. مال هذول الثلاثة كل واحد؟ و مال بيت، إي فواحد يسوي أساسا مال ال بيجوز بيتها، وهذه رح يكون ال نفس الشي، مال إنسوليشن\n\nSALIH\n.هو راح يكون أكو إكسبسيزز بالإن كلاس ويكون كل واحد يسوي لل. إيه يكون إيه؟ يدعبر يأخذ؟ هذا ال يكون عبارة عن شيء عملي، وبنفس الوقت فيه مساحة بسيطة للابتكار، فهنا أنت خليت الناس يطلعون خارج الصندوق، إي يستخدمون المعرفة والأدوات، بي إيجاد شيء يعني نوعا ما جدتي\n\nBILAL\n.وتاك شنو؟ إهنا نقدر نخ نحط ال يعني نقدر نعطيهم باكيتات؟ لو معلومات لو جوجل درايف بيها، يعني معلومات عن ال بيت التراث، لو فيديو لو أي شي، ولمن يوصلون على الأسايمنت يعني تفضلوا عندكم أخذتوا الدرس وسووها. تصميم جديد\n\nSALIH\n.التصميم الجديد، مثلا، لمنزل مستدام، تصميم لليوات، والواجهة بمساحة قد تكون ما تتجاوز 150 م مثلا، لأن المساحات بدت تصغر مثل ا. يعني هذا أحد\n\nBILAL\n.ال ال. ال. إحنا ممكن\n\nSALIH\nنحسب أيضا إنه هذا ال. المنزل راح يعيشون بأربع أشخاص، طفلين و وزوج وزوجة. إي. فكم يحتاجون طاقة؟ خلال السنة، مثل ا شو كنت رح تكون كلفة الطاقة لهذا المنزل؟ لأنه هي أعلى؟\n\nBILAL\nطول على مدة السنة، إيش قد رح يكلف حتى وي ال ال البيت ك كشكل عام؟\n\nSALIH\nإي، ولازم يعني همين لترسي هنا، راح تكون مهمة، فهو لازم يفكر بطريقة منطقية إم بجدوة الطاقة إللي موجودة حلو بالمنسب، شكرا أكو كثير أفكار آ\n\nBILAL\n.رجعت. وال آ شو اسمه ال؟ narrowing of the criteria for that's why that now why inshallah\n\nSALIH\n.ال اسامينت أبد ليكون مشكلة، يعني خلي نسوي

Germanها كابل على الصندوق الكهربائي، ربط البطارية، والإمفرتر على صندوق البروتكشن إللي بيفيوزات وبيجوزات بمراقبة للتيار الفولتية، تحويل الحمل ما للبيت على الحمل مع المنظومة، فيكون شخص عملي يكون وظيفته أخطر من وظيفة المهندس، لهذا لازم يكون يعرف إي أساسيات كهرباء يعرف ال. يعرف كيف إنه ما يفجر الباتري على عينه. وتصير مشكلة كبيرة، فهذا الشخص آه هو ال اللي راح ي يأخذ الشغل من المهندس ويبتدي يشتغل هنا الصوت، غالبا هذا التكنيشن هنا ال هو مخرج التدريب المهني\n\nBILAL\n.أنا عندهم تدريب مهني\n\nSALIH\n.يشتغل مادة مال الطاقة الشمسية خاصة بال بال اللي هي خاصة بال. إحنا ال مالنا من إنه نخرج هذا ال. بالضبط، وهذا الشخص يكون على شوية يكون هو عنده الأساسيات أكثر الهندسية والهيج والهيج، وهذا الشخص من الممكن إنه بالسوق راح يواجه أيض ا خريجين من بيت، لكن هم يشتغل وياهم، فأعتقد الماركت بالنسبة للسولار هو كلش واضح إي. نفس الوقت، سيستيم هو كلش واضح بالنسبة لنا، و آ و نفس الوقت يعني هو لأنه خمسة أيام على التك على التكنيكات يمارس، شوية. بتكفي فأي شي آخر. ما نقدر نخليه، حتى مدونة بناء أخضر، ما أعرف شنو أنا أشوفها، بعيدة عن ال. لأنه ال هو مو تحسين بالبناء، وإنما عملية استبدال لمصدر الطاقة. ما لها علاقة بموضوع التصميم والكوت وال، يعني هاي هذا اللي أعتقده، فهذه\n\nBILAL\n.مربوطين على ال على الخمسة أيام، وإحنا اختاريناه هيتشي من. من وين؟ ما أعرف وين اختاريناه؟ لو أكو سبب، يعني أنت اختاريت الرقم الخمسة الموصل بشكل يعني لا\n\nSALIH\n.ما عدنا، نحنا حاولنا إنه نخلي. تكون حتى التدريبات ستاندرد ستاندرد، بس إحنا إذا نشوف إنه نفسنا إنه نحنا نحتاج سبع أو ثمانية أيام بالسولار، ماكو مشكلة\n\nBILAL\n.خلينا نشوف\n\nSALIH\n.بالضبط، فممكن إنه نسويها استيام، ممكن نسويها ثمانية أيام، ماكو مشكلة كبيرة يعني. بالموضوع، بس إحنا حاليا أهم نقطة، أهم، أهم نقطة إنه إحنا فاهمين ال. الموجودين مع السولار هي وين رايحة؟ منو؟ خريجها من الناس اللي يدخل بيها، والسوق أكو سوق إلها\n\nBILAL\n.إي\n\nSALIH\n.وال solar سيستم أحسن ال المهندس الإنزليشن عزت، وغالبا يكون سيفيل إنجنير أو ميكانيكي إنجينير مرات يكون أصلا إي مختص أكثر بهذا المجال. لأنه الميكانيكال إنجنير هو يشتغل على مواضيع ال والتكييف والحرارة والمواقع، وكل هذه الأمور وأيض ا المهندس المدني بإمكانه إنه يشتغلوا بحكم إنه هو يبني البيت. فيكون قريب على. فكرة ال البناء البناء، هذا الشخص هو غالبا يشتغل بال. مهندس العزل. هو غالبا ما الناس تجيبوه حتى يصلح لها مشاكل. فهاي المشاكل إما تكون هي مشاكل حرارة، إما تكون هي مشاكل الطاقة، إما تكون هي مشاكل أصل ا أكو تسريب للمياه. فلازم. فلازم، فهذا الشخص من يجي يسوي بالمنازل لازم يعرف الهدف من ال من ال آ ال العزل العزل إللي شنو هو الحرارة، وتسريب مياه بنفس الوقت له، هل ها العزل، بعدين راح يقرر شنو نوع المادة إللي يستخدمها خمس تكنيكس مثل ا مختلفة للعزل، تختلف باختلاف موادها، شنو نوع المواد اللي يستخدمها لازم يتخذ قرار كلفة المواد لازم ي يبلغ بيها صاحب المنزل مباشرة؟ أو يصير عليها اتخاذ قرار. هل العزل راح يكون للأسطح؟ راح يكون للجدران؟ هل إذا هو كان للأسطح أو للجدران هل هو راح يكون عزل داخلي من داخل المنزل؟ ولا عزل خارجي من خارج المنزل؟ كل هذه هي قرارات لازم تعتمد على التكلفة، معتمدة على. المكان والمساحة معتمدة على القدرة الإقتصادية لسحب المنزل، فهذا وظيفة الشخص المهندس. إنه يسوي ال يسوي سيليكشن ال بنفس الوقت هو اللي يخلي الوصفة مال مادة، إيش قد يخلط مي مع هاي المادة، إيش قد المزيج يكون فيه نسبة من هذه المادة، وهذه المادة. لكم درجة حرارة مثلا، يصهر فد شيء معين حتى يخلوا هاي ال ال المواد البلاستيكية اللي تستخدم بالعز وغيرها وغيرها، فهذه القرارات هو ياخدها\n\nBILAL\n.هذا المجال عندها اسم بالسوق الحالي، يعني أكو فد شي اسمها\n\nSALIH\n.العوازل هو ماكو، ماكو كلمة، بس كل المكاتب. العوازل في السيكا وما سيكا، ومكاتب الكيماويات بها جزء كلش كبير منها مكاتب الكيمياويات. البناء يشتغل على عزل أكو كيمياويات أخرى لها علاقة بال بسد الفطور بسد ال آ. مشاكل البناء نفسه نفسه تمام تمام، لكن هذه مو سعر واحد\n\nBILAL\n.يريد يخابر عنده مشكلة بالعزل. صار فد شي يريد يخابر واحد يدور على واحد عنده، راح أعطيك\n\nSALIH\n.مثال هسه أكو مكتب اسمه\n\nBILAL\n.الاسم ماكو اسم. هاهاها\n\nSALIH\n.مكتب الهدف تلقي لي واحد، أبو العز، الناس ما تعرف الناس ما راح تعرف مثلا إم الشخص، ولا تهتم بالشخص لأنه كله عم تحكي عن قطاع سيمي فورمال أو بالحقيقة رح يجي على سيكا. يقول هذولا يشتغلون بالعوازب. أو راح يجي على مثلا واحد اسمه مكتب الهدف في الهندسي، هذا مكتب هو يسوق لنفسه إنه مختص بالعوازل، عنده وكالة من شركات تركية لمواد عازل، راح يجي عليك يك أو يخابره يقول له سوي لي زيارة للبيت، أني عندي مشكلة تسريب مياه إم. أو عندي مشكلة أريد أسوي سطح مالي عازل، راح المهندس إللي موجود في مكتب الهدف. ب بغض النظر عن التايتل مانو، بغض النظر عن شنو هو عنده، راح يروح للبيت يسوي كشف. كل هذا وزير الإتفاق، وينتظر قرار من أبو البيت يصير بعدين يمشون لقدام يخلون موعد، هذا المهندس يجيب التيم ماله؟ يختار المواد، يسوي الميكس ويسوي إشي كذا، ويسرد السجن عليها، ممكن يروح للسايت معاهم، يشرحلهم كذا وكذا وكذا، يشرف عليهم ويعوفهم ويكملون الشغل. تمام، but technicians تقريبا\n\nBILAL\n.أنه لما كنت أحكي ويا السيكا this was one of. The things اللي هم شجعوا بها هواية لأنه يريدون ناس يروحون يقدرون يشوفون الوضع عشان هي بالبيت، وبعدين ويا ال. هذه المشكلة، وبعدين يرجعون على الكرلاق مالتهم\n\nSALIH\n.هو، هو، هو، هذا. هذا. هذا الشي ح تمام، صحيح بهذا السكتور إم حتى بالسولار إنيرجي إيتز سام إم السولار إنيرجي أنت تروح للبيت وأسس كم غرفة كم طفل، كم يدفع حالي ا للمولدة، كم أمبير عنده حاليا وأسس وضعه الاقتصادي، وبداما أنت. Technical and visibility situation لهذا الشخص إذا أنطيت شيء أكبر من الثوب ماله أغلى من حجمه. راح ينهزم يقول أنت تبيع غالي. إذا أنطيته شي أقل راح يضوج لأنه هو ما راح يكفي. فهي البروسيس كلها هي. هو بكل ال منها الستيجات إلى هذا الزبون، يقرر إنه إي، أوكي أنا راح أروح وياه هذا الشخص أو هذولا الناس فهي\n\nBILAL\n.ما نحتاج بعد؟ لازم ايكون كلش واضح. اهنانا ناس يعرفون يعني و\n\nSALIH\n.حسابات هي هاي المفاهيم الأساسية، كفايننشال ترسيه إللي إحنا نحتاج، نحتاج إنه الشخص المهندس يعرف يتواصل مع الزبون، يبين له الجدول، اقتصاديا، يبين له مثلا آ الرجال، و أيضا بعد تقني آخر، مثلا الناس حاليا قد يكون يستخدمون العوازل دون قياس. لمقدار العزل مالها وتأثيرها على الطاقة، بالإمكان إنه نحنا باستخدام الموارد الموجودة نعرفهم إنه هذا العزل إذا زاد نسبة ال وبهالجت إي راح يكون إلها تأثير ها القد على الطاقة. راح ت تقلب الطاقة ال طاقة، التبريد والتدفئة بحلقته، وهذا ينعكس على ال والكوست مالها بحلقة، فهاي أيضا هي هي مهمة جدا موضوع التصميم لمن؟ أنا أصمم، ليش أختار هذه المادة عن هديك المادة، وممكن يكون الهاي أفضل إي بنفس الوقت هي مفيدة بالساس، لأنه راح تتحسس الزبون إنه العزل، هو مو بس راحة، وإنما هو جدوى اقتصادية. من خلال إنه هو راح يحتاج طاقة أقل للتبريد، راح يحافظ على برودة البيت لمدة أطول. أو حرارة البيت لمدة أعطوه\n\nBILAL\nواحد من الأشياء إللي طلعت من الأساس، إنت مالتنا إنه هو من الطاقة البيت، آه يعني تروح على تدفئة المي آه ندخلها هذا هنا بال؟\n\nSALIH\n.الحلول، شو اسمه، أعتقد يعني ممكن واحد يتكلم عن شيء بسيط عن العوازل إللي موجودة، هو الجيزر، مال ماي هي عازل إم صراحة؟ لعزال وكل شيء تمام. ف. ااا الناس. الشتاء تحتاج مي حار، فتشغل ال الكيزة، لكن هل أكو بديل؟ أكو سخان شمسي بديل؟ كفاءة أقل؟ بس هل أكو طريقة إنه أنت تزيد بالعزل مع التانكي و ما تحتاج بعد الطاقة بهذه الكمية؟ صراحة لأ، لأنه هو معزول بالزجاج ال آ ال الألياف الزجاجية إي إي كلها مصنعة، صح؟ بالضبط، فهو يحافظ على نفسه ممكن يوم كامل 24 ساعة إم ممكن أكثر بس آ لازم لا بد إنه أنت ت تحمل مياه للمياه هي تكون باردة، ممكن أكو ناس يستخدمون ال هذه الألياف الزجاجية على ال التانكيات إللي موجودة بالأسطح إم في الصيف، لأنه الشمس لمن تضربها تكون حارة جدا، تنكيات من معدن تحت حافظ على درجة زينة للماي. آ يكونون يلفوها؟ هذا يعني ممكن واحد يطرق على بعض من استخدامات الألياف الزجاجية كمادة عازلة. تمام\n\nBILAL\nزين لعاد يجوز نحرك الفكرة، مال نينهو، آه طلعت هذه الفكرة إنه نحتاج نسوي فد شي أكثرية الطاقة مع البيت، ينكب المي إللي ما تستعمل، ويعني بيها إستهلاك هواية آه مو بال؟\n\nSALIH\n.بال بالصيف، الناس تطفي الجيزر، يعني أنا بالصيف هسه هسه بعد شهر راح أطفي الكيزر، ما أصرف طاقه ع الحرارة، مال المياه، ليش؟ لأنه الشمس رح تحميل المياه، ال. كل مياه البيت\n\nBILAL\nعندك طاقات؟ لو حد لك للتدفئة المياه؟\n\nSALIH\n.لا، لأن التانكي السطح من معدل، فلما تضرب الشمس ناتشرلي هو راح يصير حار\n\nBILAL\n.لعاد ليش هذا؟ ديقولون ناس يعني بالبحوثات إنه\n\nSALIH\nبالشتاء، صحيح؟\n\nBILAL\n.الشتا. ها بس بالشتاء\n\nSALIH\n.و بالشتاء بس\n\nBILAL\nع السنة كله يطلع واحد من أكثر الاستهلاك ال آ، يعني ذي بلاسيز، و the most waste happens\n\nSALIH\n.ما أنت ما تقدر تكون ها الشكل، لكن ال الحمل بالشتاء يكون أعلى، لأنه في هيترات للماي وهيتارات إللي هي التدفئة فهاي المجموع ها يكون مستهلكة أكثر من ااا مجموعة المبردات وأجهزة التبريد. فأوفر all هو\n\nBILAL\n.فالإنسليشن إنجنير ما عندها مثل واحد يعني آه ديريكتير واحد إمبلمنتر واحد ديزاينر إمبلمنتر، هو الواحد إللي يروح يسوي الأسا وإللي يبيع و يطبق كله نفس الشخص\n\nSALIH\n.لأ، التطبيق. لأ، التطبيق أيضا أكو تكنيشنز، وهذا ال. هذا الشيء رح يجون عليه. إم راح نسوي تدريب أيضا بعد الطاقة الشمسية. آ إللي هو عن ال إنسليش أني شلت البنت، ليش ما له وجدوة كبيرة، لأنه ال. هو يعني حتتخلى بكل غرفة وهي حتلعب الدور الأساسي؟ في استبدال الهواء، تنقية الهواء و. والربط بين الداخل والخارج\n\nBILAL\nيعني. يعني لما طلعنا ال إينتريبينورشيب تشيك it doesn't make any sense إنه إنخلي كل كل واحد من عندهم يشوف شلون ال ال البيت التراثي كان يدبر هذول الأمورات، يعني شلون البيت، التراث كان يس يسوي ال آه برج الرياح، و فما فوق ال بس إنت\n\nSALIH\nيعني ونستعملها هذه الشغلات\n\nBILAL\n.بس\n\nSALIH\n.ماكو هذه الشغلات صراحة يعني\n\nBILAL\n.ماكو شي بالسوق، إنه الناس يقدرون يشتروها\n\nSALIH\n.ما راح تكون عملية بالضبط، ما راح تكون عملية. مع هدول الناس، هذول الناس يفتهمون شي بال بال يعني مجرد بالإيد هسة، راح نجي على هذا الموضوع، إم فالتكنشنز ياخذون ال ال الوصفة والتفاصيل من المهندس إي، وهما إللي راح يمسكون الهاند تولز، هما إللي راح يخطوهم بإيدهم، هما إللي راح يروحون. بالسايت ولازم تكون عندهم معرفة أيضا تقنية كيف ينفذون هذا العمل، كيف يصلون لأفضل تفاصيل للوصفة، وكل شي آه ويبدون يشتغلون، أيضا لازم تكون عندهم معايير للسيفتي للنفسهم ولأصحاب المنزل خلال العمل، معايير للنظافة، إي كل شي\n\nBILAL\nإثنين التكنيشن واحد، وال فوقاه ال ال إنجنير، يعني مثل آه مثل ال سوسم الجنير تكنيشن\n\nSALIH\n.تكنيشن، إحنا رح نستهدف ال مفاهيم\n\nBILAL\nيعني إحنا ما. لازم. جايين نقدر جايين يعني بالضبط، أوكي؟\n\nSALIH\n.الشيء الأخ الأخير. اللي هو ال. هم عادة يشتغلون مكاتب هندسية، المكاتب الهندسية، كيف؟ شنو فكرتها؟ إنه هي تيجي عليها، تريد تبني بيت عندك قطعة عرض أو تبني عمارة تطلب من عندهم إنه في البداية يقولوا لك إحنا ترى 10% إم، إش قد تصرف؟ أون؟ 1,000,000 دولار، نحنا ناخد 100,000. If، he's interesting that's\n\nBILAL\n.A very interesting pricing model ok hey i'm moving\n\nSALIH\n.كم تصرف؟ إيش تريد يسوولك؟ إيش قد ال هما ياخدون إسمه أقل نسبة، ممكن تكون 67 بالمية تصل إلى 12، ممكن أكو ناس تصل إلى أكثر ما أعرف، بس هذه النسب تتراوح بين عشرة 912. شنو اللي يصير؟ يبدي يبدي يأخذ ال المعماري بهذا الم ال المكتب هو اللي يصمم تصميم لخريطة البيت، تصميم لي واجهة البيت تصميمين. هذه التصميمين القرار، مال الزبون مهم جد ا بيها. هو يقرر عليها. بعض ال. بعض البيوت، بعض ال ال يعني المكاتب بدرجة أقل تأخذ ااا تسوي تصميم داخلي، بس هذه كلش يعني معناها إللي تبون حتى تأثيث رح يطلب منه تمام الأسماء اللي هي تصميم الواجهة وتصميم المنزل\n\nBILAL\nبس فهل بهالبيزنيس مارو يعني؟ آه ماكو آه أي إنسينتيفي واحد يسوي إبداع ولا يجرب يسوي جديد ولا أيز يعني as quickly as possible get the design done with this is a problem آه\n\nSALIH\n.أنت. أنت إيش؟ قد تسوي إبداع؟ إيش قد تسوي؟ شغلات جميلة وعملية تقدر تسوقها حتى تجيب تباين أكثر. إم. لأنه أكو كثير مكاتب هندسية\n\nBILAL\n.يعني معروفين وأكوب مكاتب، يعني ناس يقولون لا تروحون على هذا. هاهاها\n\nSALIH\n.إي أكو أكو حتى أكو اختصاصات، أكو مكاتب تأخذ فلوس مع الزناجيل فتشتغل بأريحية أكثر، أكو مكاتب تبني كل شي، أكو مكاتب تبني بنار رخيص، مقاولين إم يعني و. أكو أي، فأكو بدت بال\n\nBILAL\n.لو. بال يعني آ خلينا نقول\n\nSALIH\n.لأ أزيد شي. سووه ينسبوا لك ويا البيت طاقة الشمسية يستعينون بالشركات الموجودة، ونسبون طاقة الشمسية، فهنا أحلى الروم، مالنا إنه. To use، both sustainable a greenhousing and heritage tools. And in in، the modern houses، فهنا هذه بعد ما تنتقل طبعا العملية من ال يوافق الزبون يبدون مهندسين مدنيين وياخذون أفكار وتفاصيل من المعماري، ويبدي المعماري أيضا يشرف على البيت على المدنيين، ويبدو هاي المكاتب عندها عمال تشتغل باختصاصات مختلفة، هم ما موظفينهم هم، لكن يشتغلون باليومية ويشتغلون بال. كمية هل كانت متر من السيراميك؟ سافوا؟ هل كانت؟ هلقيت؟ من اللبخ؟ من اللي ما أعرف إيش حسابه؟ كل شيء بحسابه يعني؟ هم الناس اللي يلتقون بال يأخذون من عندهم. وعادة يكون كلش بسيط لأنه ال هم مو. عندي\n\nBILAL\n.طفلين، وزوجة\n\nSALIH\n.إي آ يأخذون يعني هي ما أكثر ترى من هاي طفلين وزوجة، وإنه أحتاج هاي الغرفة، وما أعرف شنو والحديقة أريدها، لو ما أريدها، والواجهة أريدها إم بيضاء وفخمة، لو الواجهة عادية، يعني هاي ال فري فيري يعني إم في حالة المكاتب يصممون تصميم إذا ما عجبوا الشخص يسموه من ثاني أو مرات ينطوا خيارين أو ثلاثة للتصميم مال المنزل. تمام، وبعث ما يوافق ويسأل كل شيء تمام، تنتقل العملية مثل ما ذكرنا. فآني بدي أشوف يعني من هذا ال. للسوق، لأنه هذا يعني. حاولت أفكر بالسوق بالسوق ونرجع لورا. صح؟ from this very basic abstraction to the rule of these different personas. In the local arraqian muscle market i recommend that we have three module. الأول. Focus only، on solar energy with، the عرفنا شنو هي يعني هي عملية استخدام المعادلات والأرقام لإيجاد الجدوى. بالضبط للزبون، وللشركة نفسها. إي. نفس الحجم. تمام. And the third we'll focus on sustainable housing including aspect of korean code and heritage architects architecture يعني شنو إحنا ال. ممكن يكون فيها يوم كامل يخص المدونة البناء الأخضر العراقي، أو ممكن مدونة البناء الأخضر العراقي تتوزع على المادة لأنه فيها أكثر من جزء، والبناء التراثي، العناصر التراثية من الممكن إنه تنطب يوم أو يومين. تمام\n\nBILAL\n.الثالث مال مال أركيتيكت آه\n\nSALIH\nفأنا شنو رح يصير عندي؟\n\nBILAL\n.ويا اللي أنا؟ واحد كان واحد كان إنسلاشن وبإنتوليشن، والثالث كان أركيتك، بس الرابع إنت ما أعرف إذا تتوقع نقصه، لو لأ مال ما تتوقع، نحتاج، لو هدول جايين من مكان ثاني\n\nSALIH\n.آه شنو هاي هسا؟ آني؟ أخذت الأفكار اللي أنت سويتهم ورجعت للسوق، بعدين رجعت دمجت يعني بعض الشغلات، فطلعت إنه أنا عندي. وواحد هو تجميعه لكل أدوات الاستدامة اللي تخص المعماري تخص التصميم\n\nBILAL\n.مال العراق عراق دييز. إي\n\nSALIH\n.The other thing. إحنا ليش نتعب على شي؟ و الريدي أكو ديجيتال طول راح يسووها، وراح يجي دكتور حسام يدرب مجموعة من المهندسين من نقابة المهندسين، وأني راح أحاول أحضر التدريب معاهم حتى أفهم هذه الديجيتال تول كيف تشتغل، والديجيتال تول، هذه إذا اشتغلت واستخدمناها بالمنازل مع إم. راح أحاول أستخدمها. لوين أجيب مهندسين من. من؟ مكاتب هندسية؟ وأنطيهم تدريب عليها ليتر مو ضمن المواد لي. ف ذا بوسينيس، يعني إنه\n\nBILAL\nناس يعني مقارنة بكل البقية، يعني هذا تأخذ هاي من كلية وتجي تدربها ويسوي فد شي اللي بيها فائدة، وهم أنا اللينكس هم اللي دشتغل عليها. فقلت يعني إذا نحتاج نسوي جابز؟ easy location، بس either it's going to happen somewhere or another is going to happen because i just هو موجود؟\n\nSALIH\n.إحنا موجود وما. ما يعني هو موجود ب راح يتطور العدات، ما بس يتطور، تدريب، تطور، يعني. يعني للماركت العراقي، والبيت العراقي، إم راح يصير تدريب عليها، راح تستخدم من قبل عشرة إنجنير حتى يسوون. لي، أعتقد 500 منزل، فهذا إذا إحنا جينا سوينا. راح يرجعون علينا كيف؟ والجماعة يقولون أنتو بدها تعيد، بدها تسوون دوبل وورك معانا، فراح نف يعني راح نفوت بمكان إنه نسوي يابا، إحنا ليش؟ فمن البداية حتى إحنا نكون عارفين هما وين رايحين وإحنا وين رايحين ويفوكس. م إنجنير إنجنير وال نعطي حقيبة متكاملة من العناصر والأدوات والمعلومات والتقييمات للعناصر المختلفة إللي ممكن يوظفها في عملية تصميم ولأي مبنى وأي فناء. آه، أو أي هاوس حتى تكون أكثر إستدامة؟ هذه أتوقع\n\nBILAL\n.تكون حلو، آه، وأنا بس ال أون أو ذي إستراتيجيز for the three parts أشوف إنه أح إحنا ما نحتاج نشتغل على ال هذا رح يروح مع فنحنا. كان أساس\n\nSALIH\n.بلال. ح. حتى نكون واقعيين واقعيين بدون بدون شي براكتيكال. مستحيل، أي إنسان يتعلم يشي يعني أني أنت بإمكانك أن تشرحلي خمس أيام عن الإنفرتر، وإذا أنا ما أمسك الإنفرتر بيدي وما أشوف النوعية اللي موجودة بالسوق، طول عمري ما رح. ما رح أعرف يعني مثل\n\nBILAL\n.ما يكون عمليين، حتى يقدرون يحكون، أكيد الناس إللي دا يشتغلون همينة، إي والله\n\nSALIH\n.طبعا، طبعا الديزاينر يحتاجون. يعرفون كل شي يسويه ال. بس التكنيشن يدويا عنده مهارة أفضل منه. لأن الديزاين عملية الدزاين هي عملية، إن أنت تعرف كل شيء، إن ديتلز وتحط يعني حتى تحصل. فالفرق بين التكنشنز عندهم مهارة يدوية أفضل، يعني ممكن الكابل إذا المهندس يمده إم بترايكيبل يحتاج يجوز ساعة 1/2 ساعة التق التكنيشن يجوز ب10 دقايق يكمل، لأن هو س يعني حرك. بروح مكانات كلش بعيدة، يستغرق على السطح، يتسلق على جدار، يتوقف على حايط، هو عنده هاي، لكن بنفس الوقت المهندس هو لازم يعرف إيش، تيسير بال شنو تصميمه، كيف يتنفذ، شنو العاكسات\n\nBILAL\n.بالنهاية\n\nSALIH\nتهز لمن؟ ي يطبق؟\n\nBILAL\n.آ، وأني إذا أشوف إنه فرق لأنه ب بالطريقة التدريب مالتي بشكل عام. قبل ما نطبق وأنت تريدني أركز يعني لأنه هو ما عنا وقت هواية و مليانة أشياء لازم نعلم يعني يعني. نقطة ع كل ال. يعني ونركز بس على التطبيق إي بس\n\nSALIH\n.خلينا نشوف يعني بلال أعتقد بالنسبة إلي يعني بحكم إنه هاي موجودين بالسوق بدها نتفاعل مع الناس إي يعني بال مثلا هاي طولت شهرين بالفترة السابقة، آ أسوي إنترفيو ساعتين وثلاثة مع. إم. فأني وأروح شركاتهم. حضرت عملية تنصيب أكثر من آ من هاوس ومن كذا. ودا شوف شو يصير بيها ومن دا يشتغل. إي شنو ال يعني عمليا شنو دا يصير؟ فبالنسبة إلي خصوصا السولر سيستم. أنا أعرف المشا المشكلة، وأعرف ال التفاصيل كلها، فما أريد أعيد البروسس أكثر، هسه أني بالنسبة لي رح أقضي وقت أكثر، بالفترة الجاية أقرأ عن الإنسوليشن إي، حتى إذا هو ما اختصاص الهندسي إم راح أقرأه عن نوع المواد، أريد تكون عندي فهم توكاليتي على الأقل حتى لمن ألتقي مع ناس أو أحاورهم في. في سوق المدينة. أني أعرف بالضبط شنو هم ديحكون، فهذه بالنسبة إلي راح. حكوا عنها شوية أكثر. بس أعرف وحدة من ال اللي س سويناها، شفنا إنه واتس ذاكستنغ سولوشن that people adopting in the greenhousing تقريبا 60% حكوا إن هم مسوين فدعة وازم. فمعناها هو it's an existing solution، بس هو exists بطريقة informal بطريقة ما منظمة نحنا بنحاول نطلع ناس عندهم التكنيكالات الصحيحة، عندهم ال الصحيحة يفهمون هذه المواد أصولها كيف باستخدامها، كيف؟ وشنو إيجابياتها وسلبياتها وأسعارها وكل شي، حتى لمن يسوون عملية تصميم أو معالجة. عدهم الفكر الصحيح\n\nBILAL\n.وإذا اتقول إنه ب. إذا، إن هذول الناس يجدون يطورون يعني القابليات مالتهم حتى يلقون عمل، وما رح يهملهم إذا يعرفون، يعني المشكلة ال بالبيئة بالعراق، وشو حيصر بالخمس سنين الجاية، يعني مو مهم\n\nSALIH\nأنت تعرف المشكلة الوحيدة؟\n\nBILAL\nلأنه أنا أحب أشوف الناس أكثر، يعني عندهم فهم ما تعرف هذا اللي راح يجوز يسوي هذا أربع سنين، خمس سنين بس شلون رح نقدر نبدي؟ يخليه يفكر بالمستقبل بلا ما نقول لأي شي على ما يعرف إنه أكو فد شي ال ال القابلية مال مال اي لو؟ نحكي اي بوقت قصير عن برج الرياح، يجوز ما كانوا يعرفون عنها كثير، ويجوز يفتحوا العيون، يجوز ما رح يطبقوها، بعمل، هم، بس أريد أفتح بيبان للمستقبل. Either this is not the right place for it low. شنو رأيك يستوعبوها؟\n\nSALIH\n.لو أني أعتقد. أعتقد إنه بالتصميم مال الماديول، هذه كلها ما تكون موجودة إم، لكن يبقى الخيار، يبقى الخيار إنه بعدين أكو مقدمة إم مثل ما ذكرنا، هذا مو. مو موجود بالموجود، كل موجود ومختص، لكن ال حيجمع معلومات من ديفرانت مودلز، ويكون مقدمة جلسة مثلا من ساعة أو 1:30 ساعة. مقدمة عن السيستانيبلتي إيراك تشالنج آ. ن كود؟ about this and، this and، this module two we highlight، the main ideas of things how do we can do it in the presentation. Yeah\n\nBILAL\n.لمن؟ أنا رايح على؟ سوت يعني فيلم 3 دقايق لو أقل، آه يوضح إحنا ليش هنا؟ all، the different pieces there's like three different modules يعني gives the big picture، وبعدين نقدر نكمل it could be just a nice little thing to do\n\nSALIH\n.إحنا نقدر هذه الأدوات كلها نقدر نسويها، نقدر نسوي فيديو مقدمة. بداية كل تدريب نستخدمه و يكون آه بالبراند مال إي و آي تي سي، وكل شي كل هذول الشغلات آ، لكن آ يعني هذا؟ مو فد شي آ يعني؟ خلي نقول لازم يكون موجود بال. آه لأ، عادي، يعني ممكن يكون ميديا ستاف، أنا راح أشير وياك فيديو هسه همينا\n\nBILAL\nبيبي. يا خ. خلينا انشوف. راح أروح أحاول أشوف what the modules look like with all of the things removed will i am really يبقى، وإذا يكفي، يعني أنا حبيت الفكرة مالتك إنهم بقي على خمسة أيام. وكيف يعني ال. حتى ال يعرفون أوكي راح نسوي واحد من هدول، نحتاج خمس أيام، هذا الرذم يتعودون عليها إي وأي س for each of them أكو إحتمال؟ seems like it has to be bigger يعني إذا راح نسوي كل اللي حكيت عنها ب. ما أعرف شلون؟\n\nSALIH\nيعني إحنا ممكن نركز على يعني. الشغلات الأكثر أهمية. إيه؟ رزبط ف ممكن ست أيام، ممكن سبع أيام ماكو مشكلة كبيرة، إذا شفنا إنه أكو شغلات كل مهمة لازم تكون موجودة ب بهذا ال آ المكان إم مع هذا أني بس أردت أقول لك شنو ال بصورة عامة إحنا الجرين هاوسينج سكتر وبنفس الوقت فهذا يتضمن عملية ال. اللي يشتغلون على. يشتغلون على رح يبنون ميتين منزل بالموصل. كلفة واطئة بمعايير استدامة، إحنا كتدريب عدنا السيستاني. Mom يشتغل، يشتغل فيورلي على موضوع ال نيو هاوسينج. يعني ما راح احذفها اللي شبيته على مد يسوي مشربيا ولا يسويه؟ كوليدورما الهوى ولا كل شي صح؟ فهو كيرلي يشتغل على السيستانيبل هاوسينج ديزاين. Module يشتغل على الإثنين إم يشتغل بالمنازل الجديدة، وال. هو 99% يشتغل على المنازل الموجودة. ايه معناها ال يعني اللدائن المواد المقاومة للحرارة والهتش؟\n\nBILAL\nأه إي يعني؟\n\nSALIH\n.إي and you can't check، the term، this is، just the suggestion. Title and i مو title أصلا هاي بس keywords عن الموديو\n\nBILAL\nيشتغلون، يعني هذول إثنين بال. أكثر شيء على، والهدف بشكل عام، هذا، فراح نقطع ال. لأنه. نركز. على ال. And yeah بدي أشوف ال الطريقة اللي نقدر. الحلو بيها إنبسطتلنا إياه. ز. Multi factorial as. It used to be بنفس الوقت. كان عندي سؤال، خلينا نشوف إذا كتبت هنا. الميتين بيت الجديد منو يسوي لها ال شلون نقدر يعني نشوف إذا نقدر نشتغل وإياهم حتى نتعلم من عينهم؟\n\nSALIH\n.لحد الآن، هو واحد من الشغلات إللي لازم نشتغل وياهم، حتى بالثري بوينت ثري واحد من إنه أني أسوي معاهم، و ونطلع هذا البروتوتايب نستفاد منه بالتدريبات وبكل شي، بس على أرض الواقع، لحد الآن ماكو أحد حتى فوكل بوينت من اليونان هابيتات يعني عراقي بعد ما معينين أحد بدها ننتظر يصير من عندهم شي؟ حاليا ماكو شي من يوم\n\nBILAL\n.Yeah هذا ال un projects بيهم، هذول المشاكل هواي مرات يعني. بس الحلو بيناتنا إن شاء الله، نقدر دائما نتعاون ميتنج بالصبح، وميتينج إن ذا أفدرون نغير أفكارنا دائما، وأدابتبه، إي، بس إي راح آخذ هاي وأغيرها. وبعدين نشوف شلون نقدر نحكي وياه موصل سبيس\n\nSALIH\nأني بالنسبة ليا أهم شي إنه هسه نحنا اتفقنا هاي ل صح؟\n\nBILAL\n.يا. يا نقطع ال آ ال آ، ونركز على السولو إنسليشن\n\nSALIH\n.بالظبط، أه، و الفانتاليشن تيك، بس هل أنت مثلا الفيتاليشن مثلا هسع أني قاعد بموصل سبيس؟ آه؟ غالبا ما المكان ب؟ أكثر من مكان، وهاي سبليت إير كونديشن دتكون إمفرتر مثلا شوي شوي بدها تتحول، أكو بعض المكانات الواطئة التكلفة، يخلون هذه المبردات\n\nBILAL\n.إي شايفهم مرات يحطوها بره\n\nSALIH\nهي دائما لازم بره لأنه ما تتخلى جوها تسوي رطوبة عالية لأنه المي يدور بيها إم تمام؟ فهذه هي تقنية قديمة، آ الناس بدها تبدي شوية شوية تروح باتجاه آ. أكثر تنلغي يعني مثلا أني بالبيت ما عندي ولا مبردة؟ استعد إنه أبقى بحرارة، بس ما أجيك مبردة، لأنه مشاكلها كثيرة وبر البيت وكذا، فهل الفنتلاشن؟ شنو المواضيع إللي رح يغطيها؟ آه من هاي الناحية يعني؟\n\nBILAL\nمشان يعني راح نحركها إلى لأنه هوي من عندها كان عن ال بيوت أو جاردن أوبن سبيس، يعني هواية أشياء هيتشي ف\n\nSALIH\n.إذ ا هي صح رح تكون مع الاركتش، لأنه أنا ليش قلت لك يعني قلت خليني أكتب البرسونة، مال هذول الناس حتى أنا أخلي نفسي بمكانه بالتدريب، أنت بدها تحكي لي عن و و للجدار والعزل إم وشنو تخليك قد رح يفرق وال كلها، بعدين تقول تصميم المشروبية أو ما أعرف شنو يعني مو دماغي، ما رح آه بعيد عن هذا الشيء\n\nBILAL\nمو آه ناس إذا يدورون عمل، آه كان عندي سؤال ثاني، ي يجوز تعرف ل من وين جايين كل الفرن يعني البيت الفرن، أكيد أكو واحد صمام عنده ديزاين بلانز فتشي، وهذول ال يعني؟ do we replace their templates with even very very minor better templates ronnie نعزمهم هذولا على architecture thing مو الناس الزناقيين اللي عندهم\n\nSALIH\n.إستديو معروف وما أدري شنو أنت بتعرفه مين جاية، هاي الفكرة، الفكرة جاية إنه عدد كلش كبير من الناس إي يبنون بيوتهم بنفسهم، إم بدون ما يستخدمون. معماريين، ولا يريدون تصميم ولا مهندسين، وأكو ما بس ها الشكل، أكو مابس يبنونه بنف بيوتهم بنفسهم كمقاولين، أكو سيراميك، هو يشتغلوا أء البناء، وممكن هو يشتغلوا، خصوصا الناس اللي جايين من بالقرى تكون عندهم هاي ال. كانت مو كلش قوية، بس هو بالنسبة له توفر فلوس، فلهذا الناس يروحون إنه هو شايف خريطة مكان، فهو يعرف بدماغه هذه وهي سهلة البناء، بس مربعات إم، فيروح يبنيها. هذا أكبر سبب\n\nBILAL\nيعني شلون أي أي طريقة نقدر نلمس هذا المشكله؟ شلون نقدر إنتراكت و؟\n\nSALIH\n.إحنا ممكن إنه نخلي الناس بالتدريبات يسوون لي لي خرائط منطقية مثل ا بيت مساء 150 م، واجهت من أمتار إم، ويكون التصميم مثلا ينشر في مكان ما، أو هو الشخص يشيره بالسوشال ميديا ماله بال وات إيفر ماله، فهو يمتلك حقوق التصميم، لكن هو مفتوح للناس، إنه. فهذا. ي الناس تشوف شغلات جديدة وهيك أنت الاستثمار بالمعماريين هو الاستثمار الأفضل، لأنه المساحات بدها تصغر، كلفة الأرض بدها تغلى، إم الناس بدها تواجه مشاكل، فتري المعماريين بشكل أكثر. أعتقد الاستثمار بالمعماريين هو على المدى البعيد مجدي\n\nBILAL\nإي بس you just not the best for creating jobs but maybe better at creating an impact but تغيير وتفكير. ولازم يكون ال ال أتوقع يعني أوبن سورس، هم بس مو بس رخيص يعني بالبناء، بس رخيص على السنين الجاية يعني. شلون واحد يقدر يحكي على ناس يفتحمون هذا الفكرة بالعراق؟ يفكرون بيها إنه البيت مو بس بيت البيت بيها ال مالتها يأثر بالكلفة ال الثانوية؟\n\nSALIH\n.اي طبعا هم ليش يشترون من سيارات تويوتا؟ لأنه تعطى للسيارة والأوبراشن روست مالها يكون كلش قليل بينما. إي بينما أكو يعني آه سيارات أخرى أرخص، لكن مشاكلها كثيرة\n\nBILAL\nLet's create، the open source toyota house my molecule، بس إنت تقول هذا يطلع من خلال الورشة، يجوز أول مرة نسويها ثاني مرة نسويها، كل كل مرة نسويها إي ال. مال هذول الثلاثة كل واحد؟ و مال بيت، إي فواحد يسوي أساسا مال ال بيجوز بيتها، وهذه رح يكون ال نفس الشي، مال إنسوليشن\n\nSALIH\n.هو راح يكون أكو إكسبسيزز بالإن كلاس ويكون كل واحد يسوي لل. إيه يكون إيه؟ يدعبر يأخذ؟ هذا ال يكون عبارة عن شيء عملي، وبنفس الوقت فيه مساحة بسيطة للابتكار، فهنا أنت خليت الناس يطلعون خارج الصندوق، إي يستخدمون المعرفة والأدوات، بي إيجاد شيء يعني نوعا ما جدتي\n\nBILAL\n.وتاك شنو؟ إهنا نقدر نخ نحط ال يعني نقدر نعطيهم باكيتات؟ لو معلومات لو جوجل درايف بيها، يعني معلومات عن ال بيت التراث، لو فيديو لو أي شي، ولمن يوصلون على الأسايمنت يعني تفضلوا عندكم أخذتوا الدرس وسووها. تصميم جديد\n\nSALIH\n.التصميم الجديد، مثلا، لمنزل مستدام، تصميم لليوات، والواجهة بمساحة قد تكون ما تتجاوز 150 م مثلا، لأن المساحات بدت تصغر مثل ا. يعني هذا أحد\n\nBILAL\n.ال ال. ال. إحنا ممكن\n\nSALIH\nنحسب أيضا إنه هذا ال. المنزل راح يعيشون بأربع أشخاص، طفلين و وزوج وزوجة. إي. فكم يحتاجون طاقة؟ خلال السنة، مثل ا شو كنت رح تكون كلفة الطاقة لهذا المنزل؟ لأنه هي أعلى؟\n\nBILAL\nطول على مدة السنة، إيش قد رح يكلف حتى وي ال ال البيت ك كشكل عام؟\n\nSALIH\nإي، ولازم يعني همين لترسي هنا، راح تكون مهمة، فهو لازم يفكر بطريقة منطقية إم بجدوة الطاقة إللي موجودة حلو بالمنسب، شكرا أكو كثير أفكار آ\n\nBILAL\n.رجعت. وال آ شو اسمه ال؟ narrowing of the criteria for that's why that now why inshallah\n\nSALIH\n.ال اسامينت أبد ليكون مشكلة، يعني خلي نسوي المادة كلها، دائما أكو أفكار تخلي الناس يسوون شغلات، بالنسبة لل بكل موجود، أما نقدر نسوي جلسة خاصة بعدين إم، أهم شي بالنسبة لي إنه أنت كبلال آ يعني مقتنع بما أني طرحته، ما أريد أن أعاني آ ألعب دور إنه

I've organized each module around specific job roles that Salih confirmed exist in the Iraqi market, with day-by-day breakdowns that emphasize practical skills development.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the updated curriculum, or would you prefer to discuss implementation strategies with Mosul Space as you mentioned in your conversation?",

              "content": "# BEIT Curriculum 3.0\n## Practical Skills for Iraq's Sustainable Construction Sector\n\n### **Overview**\n\nThis document presents the updated BEIT Curriculum for Objective 3.3 of the Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq. Based on extensive stakeholder consultation, especially insights from Salih Mahmood, the curriculum has been restructured to reflect actual job market demands, practical skills needs, and implementation realities in Iraq's construction sector.\n\nThe new structure focuses on three independent modules that align with specific job roles in the sustainable construction market, emphasizing hands-on skills, market relevance, and direct pathways to employment.\n\n### **Key Changes from Previous Versions**\n\n1. **Consolidation to Three Modules**: Streamlined from four modules to three, each with clearer job alignment\n2. **Extended Duration**: Each module now spans 5-6 days for deeper technical content\n3. **Practical Focus**: Greater emphasis on hands-on application and technical skills\n4. **Integrated Financial Literacy**: Financial concepts embedded within technical context rather than as separate modules\n5. **Market-Driven Approach**: Content shaped by actual construction practices and job opportunities in Iraq\n\n### **Core Principles**\n\nThe following principles guide the updated curriculum:\n\n* **Job-Ready Skills**: Each module prepares participants for specific, existing roles in Iraq's construction sector\n* **Standalone Value**: Modules function independently, allowing participants to select what aligns with their career goals\n* **Hands-On Learning**: At least 60% of training time dedicated to practical exercises and applications\n* **Local Market Relevance**: Content reflects materials, techniques, and business practices found in Iraq\n* **Heritage Integration**: Traditional architectural elements taught as practical solutions to modern challenges\n\n## **Module Structure**\n\n### **Module 1: Solar Energy System Design & Installation (5-6 days)**\n\n**Target Job Roles:**\n* Solar System Engineer (system sizing, design, client consultation)\n* Solar PV Technician (installation, wiring, safety implementation)\n* Maintenance Provider for solar systems\n\n**Participant Profile:** Electrical engineers, electricians, technical diploma holders, construction professionals\n\n**Certification Project:** Complete solar system design and

            "text": "\n\nLooking at your conversation with Salih, I've identified several key points that shaped this update:\n\n1. **Market-driven approach**: Salih emphasized designing around actual job roles that exist in Iraq's construction market today, not hypothetical future positions.\n\n2. **Module restructuring**: Consolidating from four modules to three more focused ones:\n   - Solar energy module focused on practical skills and system installation\n   - Insulation module focused on thermal improvement techniques\n   - Green architecture that incorporates heritage elements with practical value\n\n3. **Practical application**: Salih stressed the importance of hands-on learning with real tools, materials, and scenarios, noting that \"no one learns something without touching it.\"\n\n4. **Technical depth**: Extending each module to 5-6 days to provide more in-depth technical training.\n\n5. **Role differentiation**: Recognizing the distinction between engineers (who design systems) and technicians (who implement them), and providing relevant training for both.\n\n6. **Financial integration**: Embedding financial literacy throughout each module rather than as a separate component.\n\n7. **Local partnership**: Leveraging local expertise and creating a sustainable training ecosystem.\n\nThe updated curriculum I've created reflects these insights while maintaining the core objectives of the BEIT project. I've organized each module around specific job roles that Salih confirmed exist in the Iraqi market, with day-by-day breakdowns that emphasize practical skills development.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the updated curriculum, or would you prefer to discuss implementation strategies with Mosul Space as you mentioned in your conversation?",
