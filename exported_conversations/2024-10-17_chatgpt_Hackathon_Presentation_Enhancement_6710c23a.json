The field of Islamic Architecture is a key example of this rich legacy. This can be witnessed in the timeless and unprecedented buildings throughout Islamic civilization, among them.\nMosul city represents one of the cities established by Muslim architects and designers that there is a great awareness to issues of sustainability with their three pillars (Environmental sustainability, Social sustainability,  Economic sustainability)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Architecture\nSustainable practices aligned with local climates and resources.\nUsed local materials and methods, addressing community needs and fostering social interaction.\nIn Islamic regions, designs were often influenced by Islamic principles and values.\nExamples of sustainable features in traditional architecture. Al-Kadumia city in Baghdad and the narrow streets, The compact style and winding paths make apartment buildings close to each other to give the shading to the walker in these paths and block sunlight from residential and surrounding buildings.\n\nTraditional House Principles\nAdaptation and Protection:\nAdaptation is the exploitation of potential resources in harsh environmental circumstances and dealing with these circumstances to achieve heat comfort to dwellers and to exploit natural sources of energy\nProtection is to eliminate the impact of harsh environmental circumstances. There are many basic principles on which the architecture of the traditional dwelling is based.\n\n\nTraditional House Principles\nThe internal courtyard provides protection from the climate, natural light, privacy, and ventilation. By adding plants and water features, the courtyard becomes shaded and cool, with the air flowing into nearby rooms. In the morning, the courtyard is cool, and by noon, air moves from shaded areas into the indoor spaces. In the evening, the courtyard releases heat and pulls in cool air from above as the hot air rises and the temperature drops.\n\nIraq Traditional Architecture\nThe traditional Iraqi Architecture differs from the architecture of other countries thanks to a richness of elements that are in harmony with the specific climatic and social conditions of the country.\nThe local environmental and social factors have constituted the main influences for the design and the planning of traditional architecture in Iraq, from the large scale to the smallest detail. For instance, the traditional Iraqi house is characterized by distinctive features that are appropriate to the local climate and the social aspects, in so representing an ideal solution providing the Iraqi family with an indoor environment of absolute privacy.\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nColonial Era 1914-1930: A significant feature characterizing the buildings of this period is the emphasis put on the main facade, where the richness of the architectural details was concentrated, whilst the other elevations of the buildings were left almost or completely shorn of any ornament. \nAal Al-bait school – Baghdad 1922\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nThe Architecture in Iraq 1930-1950: The 1930s saw the maturation of modern architectural concepts introduced in the 1920s, translating new ideas into tangible urban environments in Iraq.\nWhile this period established a homogeneous modern design language, it maintained links to neoclassical styles rooted in mid-19th century architecture, creating a unique blend of old and new.\nThe Industrial Exhibition in Baghdad – 1932 (left)\nKing Faisal II Square - 1944 (right)\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nThe Architecture in Iraq 1930-1950\nThe central Train station in Baghdad 1949\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nIraqi Architecture between 1950 and 1960: Building facades saw significant advancements, with new plaster mixtures (lime-sand or cement-sand) becoming widespread, influencing design styles.\nThe period introduced novel architectural elements like curtains and screens of various shapes and materials, adding diversity to building finishes.\nAl -Rafidain Bank – 1954 (left)\nMerjan Building - 1954 (right)\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nTransformation of the Iraqi Architecture in the 20th Century\nIraqi Architecture between 1960 and 1980: This period focused on deepening Iraq's unique architectural character by closely examining and incorporating local environmental elements and traditional materials.\nIraqi architects became more professional, employing local craftsmen and climate-responsive design, resulting in a more refined and contextually appropriate modern architecture.\nAL-Rashid Street in Baghdad -1961 (left) \nFederation of Industries - 1966 (right)\nSource: https://www.ajer.org/papers/Vol-11-issue-8/O1108126133.pdf \n\nPart 3\n\nSustainable Innovations in Iraq\n\nModern Innovations\nOne of the sustainable construction strategies that is beneficial for the transition to sustainable housing construction is Enhancing Sustainable Materials and Technology.\nEnhancing Sustainable Materials\nUse of environmentally friendly materials that resist weather factors\nMaterials that preserve building heat in winter and contribute to ventilation in summer\nDouble glazing for good insulation between internal and external environments\nEncourage local suppliers to produce green products\nUse of green building materials and products as an important strategy in building design\nTechnology\nImplementation of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy\nUse of more efficient water systems\nWater reuse technologies\nSystems that reduce energy consumption and costs\nTechnologies that enhance the sustainable construction approach\n\nIraq’s Heritage Buildings Post-Conflict\nMosul is one of Iraq’s richest cities in terms of cultural heritage and contains numerous archaeological, historical, cultural and religious sites, monuments and landmarks.

Frequent power outages force households to rely heavily on diesel generators, which provide less than 15% of the electricity but account for more than 90% of consumer spending on electricity. Iraqi households can spend up to IQD 5.8 million (USD $4,000) annually on electricity, which is eight times the average electricity bill in the MENA region, one of the highest rates globally (IEA, 2019b). The largest consumer of electricity in Iraq is the residential sector, representing 48.3% of total consumption (Istepanian, 2020b), further illustrating the inefficiency and cost burden faced by Iraqi households.\n\nInstalling energy-efficient and renewable measures can support more affordable and reliable electricity, leading to substantial cost savings. However, inadequate insulation and poor housing conditions, particularly for low- and middle-income families, exacerbate energy inefficiency, resulting in uncomfortable living conditions. Moreover, Iraq ranks as the fifth most vulnerable country to extreme temperatures and water shortages, heightening the need for climate-resilient housing solutions (UN Environment Programme, 2017).\n\nDespite these challenges, there is a gap in awareness and adoption of practical, sustainable housing solutions that could improve living conditions while reducing energy costs. International companies, like Sika, Schneider, etc. primarily focus on large-scale / high-end projects, leaving a void in accessible solutions for low-income households.\n\nThe BEIT project seeks to address this gap by focusing on affordable, climate-resilient housing solutions tailored to the local context. A core goal is to train local construction workers to retrofit homes, enabling them to provide solutions that are sustainable, affordable, and adapted to local needs. These solutions must be implementable within a budget of 5,000,000 IQD using locally available materials and generate a return on investment by reducing energy consumption and improving living conditions\n\nDuration & Timing \nThe hackathon will span over 2.5 days, with ideation session on November 6th, followed by the official hackathon on November 9th and 10th. This schedule will provide ample time for:\nInspiration and ideation sessions\nTeam-building activities\nDeveloping solution prototypes\nPitch practice and presentations\n\nPost-hackathon opportunities: Winners and participants will have the opportunity to\ncontinue refining their ideas as part of the wider BEIT Design Competition, offering\nextended support and mentorship, including tailored training, discussion panels, and consultations with sector specialists.\n\nLocation\nThe event will be hosted at Mosul Space, a vibrant and conducive environment for collaboration, innovation, and teamwork.\nCheck for Video conferencing with live interpretation option \n\nParticipants\nThe hackathon is open to 30-35 participants, forming multidisciplinary teams of 3-4 members, including architects, civil engineers, urban planners, developers, energy experts, students, and entrepreneurs. These participants will collaborate on designing innovative, energy-efficient building solutions and integrating renewable energy. The event encourages cross-disciplinary approaches by including young entrepreneurs, SMEs, students, and experts from both technical and non-technical backgrounds.\n\nOutreach\nParticipant Application Form draft\nLeverage clean iraq group for sourcing?

Over two days, participants will collaborate to develop climate-smart, affordable housing solutions. The event will foster a cross-disciplinary approach, bringing together architects, engineers, local entrepreneurs, and technology experts to generate ideas that can improve housing conditions and energy efficiency across Iraq.\n\nKey goals of the hackathon include:\nSource High-Quality Participants: The hackathon will act as a kickoff event for the BEIT Design Competition, attracting participants who can continue developing their ideas post-hackathon. These individuals have the potential to become future climate-tech leaders in their communities.\nCreate Tangible Solutions: Participants will address urgent housing needs in Iraq by designing energy-efficient, climate-smart housing models. These solutions will have the potential for real-world impact, improving the quality of life for local communities.\nRaise Awareness: The hackathon will increase awareness of sustainable housing practices and highlight the importance of addressing climate change impacts in Iraq. Through collaboration, participants and stakeholders will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in sustainable construction.\n\nHackathon Challenges & Themes\nParticipants in the BEIT Hackathon will choose to work on one of two key challenges designed to address Iraq’s most pressing housing and energy challenges:\nClean Energy Solutions: Iraq’s solar potential is among the highest in the world, with over 3,000 hours of sunlight annually and solar radiation levels ranging from 5.4 to 6.1 kWh/m²/day. Despite this abundance, solar energy currently contributes less than 3% to Iraq’s renewable energy capacity. Participants will develop solar energy systems with battery storage from a “value for money” perspective, aiming to provide sustainable and reliable power for homes. These systems will reduce the dependence on diesel generators and address the issue of frequent power cuts. Special focus will be placed on lifecycle cost, architectural integration, and safety/reliability aspects. Solar power can also fuel sustainable air conditioning solutions, such as solar-assisted cooling systems, further reducing the country’s energy demands. Integrating solar energy into Iraq’s infrastructure is a crucial step toward reducing emissions and promoting sustainability.\nInsulation and Thermal Control: Extreme heat in Iraq, with summer temperatures often exceeding 50°C, leads to increased energy consumption for cooling, particularly in poorly insulated buildings. Participants will focus on insulation techniques, cool roofing, and innovative wall designs to improve thermal efficiency. High-performance materials such as insulated walls, roofs, and windows will reduce heat gain and improve thermal comfort. Well-insulated buildings can cut energy consumption by 30-50%, reducing the need for artificial cooling and relieving stress on Iraq’s electrical grid. These solutions are critical for lowering energy costs and improving living conditions for low- and middle-income families. The goal is to create affordable and scalable insulation systems that can be widely implemented in Iraq’s housing sector.\n\nExpected Outcomes \nCreate Sustainable Housing Solutions: Participants will develop practical prototypes that emphasize energy efficiency and solar energy integration, which can be piloted in real-world settings. These solutions aim to be affordable and easily implemented in the Mosul region and beyond.\nRaise Awareness on Sustainability: The hackathon will encourage a shift in the building industry toward sustainable practices, focusing on long-term cost savings and minimizing environmental impact. Participants will gain practical insights into sustainable construction and housing, fostering greater awareness of the benefits of sustainable development.\nIdentify Scalable Solutions: The top ideas generated during the event will have the potential for scalability and implementation across Iraq’s building sector, particularly in new urban developments. The most promising solutions could be developed further as part of the Design Competition and in partnership with local authorities or SMEs, with possibilities for pilot testing.\nCommunity Building: Establishment of valuable connections among participants, mentors, and key stakeholders, potentially leading to long-term collaborations. By fostering an environment of knowledge sharing and networking, the hackathon aims to strengthen local networks. \nEmpowering Local Businesses: The solutions generated from the hackathon are intended to empower local businesses, as well as construction workers. By integrating these ideas into vocational training programs, BEIT aims to train and certify local workers with sustainable housing retrofit tools, creating a new generation of climate-tech leaders and contributing to a sustainable housing sector across Iraq.\n\nEvaluation Criteria\nParticipants will be evaluated based on the following criteria. A judging committee of 3-4 experts from universities, public, and private sectors will rate the ideas on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score.\nSustainable Impact: Solutions should prioritize environmentally sustainable practices, focusing on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and minimizing the environmental footprint. Evaluators will assess the potential for long-term environmental benefits and how effectively the solution addresses Iraq’s climate challenges, such as extreme heat and energy consumption, while improving living conditions and quality of life.\nAffordability: Solutions must be financially viable, implementable within a budget of 5,000,000 IQD (including installation costs), and accessible to low- and middle-income families. This ensures the economic feasibility and scalability of the solution in Iraq's housing sector.\nFeasibility: Solutions must be realistic, adaptable, and validated for local conditions. This includes the use of locally available materials, traditional techniques, and practicality in implementation by local construction workers. Proposals should be validated through research or pilot tests to show that they can be effectively deployed in Iraq’s context.\nScalability: Evaluators will look at how easily the proposed solution can be scaled or replicated in other regions, addressing broader housing challenges in Iraq or similar environments. This ensures that the solution has potential beyond the initial pilot phase.\nInnovation: Participants should demonstrate creativity in their approach, introducing new technologies, methods, or applications. Solutions should showcase how innovative ideas are being applied to solve traditional problems in new ways, such as leveraging AI or local sustainable practices.\n\nMosul Spaces’ criteria\nCriteria\nDescription\nPoints\nAge\nParticipants must be aged between 18 and 45 years old.\nN/A\nResidency\nParticipants must reside in Nineveh.\nN/A\nIdea and Solution Assessment\n(60 points)\nFeasibility\nIs the solution practical and realistic for implementation in Iraq’s infrastructure?\n10\nActionable Plan\nDoes the solution have a clear and executable action plan?\n10\nRelevance to Themes\nHow well does the idea align with the hackathon's themes (e.g., thermal design, solar energy)?\n10\nComplexity\nDoes the solution tackle significant technical or logistical challenges while remaining practical?\n10\nInnovation\nHow original and creative is the proposed solution?\n10\nUse of Technology\nHow well does the solution integrate cutting-edge technologies (e.g., smart systems, renewable energy)?\n10\nProfile Assessment\n(40 points)\nTeam or Startup Experience\nHas the participant previously worked in teams or startups, especially in related fields?\n10\nRelevant Experience\nDoes the participant have experience addressing energy, sustainability, or building challenges?\n10\nTechnical Expertise\nDoes the participant have relevant expertise in fields like architecture, energy systems, or building tech?\n10\nGeneral Background\nA holistic evaluation of the participant's academic and professional background.\n10\n\n\nIncentives \nParticipants are motivated to compete for several exciting rewards, including:\nDirect Qualification for the BEIT Design Competition: Winners will automatically qualify for the BEIT Design Competition, where they can further develop their ideas with extended mentorship and resources.\nCo-Working Space Subscription: Winners will receive a free subscription to Mosul Space, providing ongoing access to a collaborative environment to continue refining their projects.\nOngoing Support for MVP Development: Winning teams will receive guidance and mentorship to develop their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and move toward real-world implementation.\nMonetary Prize: Teams will also receive a monetary award (amount TBD) to support further development of their solutions.\nCertificate for Winners: All winning participants will receive a certificate recognizing their contribution and success.\nKey Features\nDiverse Participation: Welcoming individuals and teams from various fields, including architecture, engineering, construction, and sustainability.

To do this, we must know ourselves, our abilities, our limits and finally we\nmust know where we want to go and have some idea how to get there. This is the crux of the problem, in much of the world education is\nlackluster, and mentorship is lacking, and having a sense of where to go next is next to impossible without exposure and support. We\nbelieve generative AI can solve this problem, or make it worse.\nFor nearly a decade I’ve been building systems to help people learn about knowledge landscapes through educational assessments and\noffering learning activities based on results. While this is marginally better than giving someone access to wikipedia and suggestions they\n“google it” - it’s missing a crucial element. A database model of education doesn’t have the ability to support goal reflection and\narticulation, doesn’t know your blindspots, can’t explain things walking backward from where you want to go and making analogies to\nyour your current level of knowledge. These new affordances, and many others, are now made possible with Large Language\nModels(LLMs).\nLLMs can transform education along the same vector previous technologies have, making it more accessable, personalized and relational.\nIn the Middle Ages, a prince may have had a tutor, in the Industrial Era the printing press made books accessible to those with disposable\nincome, later cultural innovations like the Public Library brought access to more people, the internet brought searchability with database\nqueries, Wikipedia, Brilliant and youtube brought multi-modal and social learning to our pockets. LLMs can be the next step. Right now the\ninternet is full of knowledge waiting to become relevant, except the person who needs it best might not know what to search for and no database will\nhelp. We need conversation and adaptive learning directionality, things LLMs can bring to the table.\nThe Ethics of LLMs and Agency - To have or to be\n{“role”: “system”\n,\n“content”: “You are a helpful assistant.\n”} is often seen as the first system prompt suggested, and has been said to be unneeded at this\npoint as the machines have interanlized their helpful assistant role during the instruction fine tuning moment. The problem of bias in the datasets\nPage 1 of 17\naside, there is a bias in the fundamental purpose of an LLM. This bias emerges from such subtle places as how you are first introduced to an LLM, how\nquickly they respond, the language they use in their responses, what prompting support they offer and many more. One way of seeing this assistant\nbias is to describe it as a “doing” bias. How could that be a problem if they help you?\nToo Much Help\nLet’s conduct a trial (June 2024) with the LLM on the top of the leaderboards, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Prompt: “Please write a letter to my\ngrieving mother… I just lost my dad, she just lost her husband.” Response: “Dear Mom, I hope this letter finds you in a moment of\npeace… [one page of cringeworthy content] …I'm here for you, Mom. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. We'll get through this\ntogether, one day at a time.”\nIt feels weird to have an LLM use my pronouns to write a letter to my grieving mom. This is a context where doing might not be the right\napproach, perhaps the prompt was not appropriate. Yet what else are we to do?s\nWhat is a good response from an LLM?\nWe’\nve hit a the language of normativity, what’s a good prompt? Usually developers of technology taking an iterative approach will say: “the user is\nalways right” and find ways to get feedback from the user over time indicating the responses they liked better than others. Now that sounds like a\nreasonable approach - let’s consider how using this approach can backfire using the analogy of using an escalator. Using it once might be a thrill,\nespecially if it’s your first time and you would definitely click “yes, would ride again” at the end of your trip. Yet given years of escalator riding and if it\nreplaces taking the stairs at home and those four flights of stairs were a large part of your daily exercise as you go up and down multiple times a day,\nyou might find that you rue the day you ever started taking the escalator.\nSo is an escalator good or bad?\nI think this is related to the idea by Erich Fromm of having, vs being. I have my response, I can use it to send to my mother and get the\ntask out of the way. Or I can engage with the soul searching needed to say what is truely mine to say in this moment. I could engage in the\nprocess of becoming and sa something that might have never been said before, perhaps. Perhaps I’d add something that would be new to\nthe collective embedding space, something that would touch my mothers heart, and give me a sense of grief soaked contentedness.\nThe Reality of Muses\nIt was missing what the muses would bring to me, and only me, in this moment - sure it can help us write a beautiful letter, yet should it\nhave? How could the LLM know the context and know when to respond to a prompt, how could it know if it’s responding to a bad prompt\ngiven the context, or a good prompt given the context. What are the qualities of a good prompt? What makes an LLM respond in ways\nthat make it more like an escalator than a flight of stairs, and how do we build a system that’s as fun to ride as an escalator, yet as\nsupportive for health and who we want to be as stairs. Good questions that deserve some good answers.\nPage 2 of 17\nWhat the Telos\nIt seems that the LLM is able to get up to the understanding area from the trillions of datapoints entered as it’s training set, yet there is a\nmoment of choice that connects to the steerability of the LLMs, the agency of a learner, the layer of wisdom where potentially we must\nguide a learner towards, bringing the information, explaining the knowledge, and bringing someone to the moment of their choosing.\nSoon LLMs will enter the pockets of 80% of the world’s population when they are integrated with our smart phones. They can either\ncontinue to be designed and marketed towards becoming your “assisstant” or they can be designed and marketed towards becoming your\nassistant and coach. They can help you do, or rather - they can help you do things you couldn’t even see as possible before.\nHypothesized Method: Prompts as Navigation LLMs as Compass\nLet’s explore a theory of good prompting.\nI believe that life is unique in the fact that it is anti-entropic. A healthy individual in a supportive environment develops and grows, as\nopposed to most things in the universe, living systems increase in complexity and cohesion. I tentatively posit that growth and learning is\nPage 3 of 17\na good measure for a good session with good prompts. Learning is fun, so we should be able to measure positive states “did you like this\nsession” and compete with sessions that primarily focus on assistance and task completion.\nAs educators at Bloom.pm, it has been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach\nthem expecting answers directly. “GPT, make me a sandwich!”. Through our interactions with our students and many hundreds of hours\nof LLM use we came to the conclusion that to use LLMs effectively for learning while doing we must how LLMs work, how learning works\nand to map between learning needs and the new affordances LLMs have made architecturally, and technically to interface with a large\nchunk of what is known to humanity today.\nWe are approaching this goal, practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes,\nwe will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical\ncompromises.\nLearning is goal oriented behavior and in this pamflet we will describe emerging trends in research that demonstrates that LLMs are able\nto identify your goals without your explicitly stating them, developing an understanding of your Theory of Mind. Using this goal\nrepresenting in the language of LLMs as an embedding in a vector space we can have geometric representation of our goals, beliefs,\nemotions and knowledge allowing us to use prompting like a compass to walk in into the dark spaces of our knowledge towards our goals,\nand perhaps modifying them along the way.\nWe believe that due to the biomimetic approaches computer scientists have taken to develop AI/LLMs there are leverageable structures\nwithin LLMs to support our learning journey. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence\nof our hypothesis.\nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a\nmachine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I\nbelieve it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the\nembedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we\nare and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown\nunknowns till you arrive at your destination.\nPage 4 of 17\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector\nspaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to\nperform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\nI’ve personally spent hundreds of hours of GPT and have identified from my prompts the principles that led to better results with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), here I formalize them through the frames of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into\ntransformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how\nLLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by\nthese two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to\nmigration, economic impoverishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of\ntheir understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to\ndevelop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nI believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of\npre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of\n2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nThis is why it’s so important to identify methods for using LLMs well and imbedding them into different touchpoints in society:\nTouchpoints:\n● Education: Develop material and courses on best prompting techniques and encouraging the ways of being that lead to good\nprompting.\n● Technological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of\nimprovements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer.\n● System Prompts: Share system prompts will support the LLM to supporting the principles in the frameworks.\n● LLM Company Collaborations: Work with LLM companies to incorporate deeper into the training and feedback process.\nBe Sure To Create New Knowledge\nA danger we can fall into is believing that the LLM can know all possible blindspots. How can we ensure there’s a balane between\nscaffolding and a user identifying what is uniquely there’s to say, the analogy that only their mind would come to given the diversity of\ntheir life experience. This is ther person’s “zone of genius” - the thing that is not in the embedding space, the new inspiration.\nPage 5 of 17\nCan LLMs help us drive to the edge of the current knowledge and then make it possible for us to make our unique contributions? I think\nthat’s a good outcome for a good seet of prompting practices.\nPerhaps a measure we can ask about a conversation that would help us when training LLMs is to build a dataset where people walk away\nfrom their conversation describing it as beautiful. As G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be\nbeautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent\nplace in this world for ugly mathematics.”\nSCRIBER - A First Attempt at Teaching LLM Prompting Principles\nTo begin this process let’s understand what might now be possible with LLMs by mapping their affordances to modern pedagogical\nprinciples.\nLLM Capability Pedagogical Principle SCRIBER Element\nNatural Language Understanding Social Interaction and Collaboration Seek, Critique, Broaden/Contract\nNatural Language Generation Experiential Learning and Reflection Reflect, Explain\nContextual Understanding Authentic, Real-World Problem-Solving Inquire, Explain\nKnowledge Retrieval and Integration Connecting Learning to Prior Knowledge and\nExperiences\nBroaden/Contract, Explain\nAdaptive and Personalized Learning Scaffolding and Self-Regulated Learning All SCRIBER Elements\nLanguage Translation and Multilingual Support Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Seek, Broaden/Contract\nTextual Analysis and Summarization Critical Thinking and Meaning-Making Critique, Reflect\nPage 6 of 17\nThe framework we developed after reverse engineering the principles from our LLM usage is called S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect,\nInquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse). We’ve been teaching this model for a while and have seen people get better results from\ntheir LLM usage while building capacity and identifying unique contributions.\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think for Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet\nuseless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to\nget better results.\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think. We developed these principles to help you experience\nthis intuition about how LLMs operate and teach yourself the things you don’t even know. By using this tool well, you can benefit\nyourself, your communities, and the world.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re\nsomewhere in the graph, you can ask what is around you that you “can’t see.”\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\n● Seek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\n● Critique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\n● Reflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools with which to think.\n● Inquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\n● Broaden/Contract: Seek gaps, ask the LLM for non-overlapping options, and pick.\n● Explain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\n● Recurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you.\nPage 7 of 17\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\n1. 2. Principles are ideas you keep in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\n3. The Way of Being is a quality of presence from which principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated\npractice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\nNote: Do not memorize this list.\nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought.\nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n📙\nWay of\nBeing ❤\nTechnique\n🤲\nPrinciple\n🧠\nSeek Inquisitive\nand\nOpen-minded\nAfter giving the GPT as much context as\npossible, including your main goal, and\nquestions, and all the knowledge you current\nhave about your topic. Then you could ask\nquestions like:\n“Who would know how to answer this question?\nWhat is their job?”\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this\nquestion?” Or pick someone complete irrelevant\nExploration:\nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by\ngiving it as much as you know and then asking\nwhat you’re missing.\nUse AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of\nknowledge\nPage 8 of 17\nCritique and\nexplain\nReflect Receptive to\nFeedback,\nloving to be\nproved wrong.\nThoughtfully\nCritical\nto your theme and ask them to respond from\ntheir perspective.\n(The more specific information you provide, the\nbetter.\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a\nperson who will disagree.\nFOr a\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a\nreview from a funding agency grant reviewer.\nIf you’re a PHD student, ask for a review from\nyour advisor.\nIf you’re a chef, ask for a critique from a food\nreviewer.\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You\ncan ask for templates, frameworks,\nworksheets, and guidelines\nAFTER identifying the expert's domain.\nOnce you pick your template, ask it questions to\nfill in a template for your topic. THEN review it\nand reflect on it on your own with a\npencil/paper.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to\nrefine ideas and approaches.\nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the\nLLM get you close and then walk the rest of the\nway to develop critical thinking and depth in\nunderstanding through reflective practices.\nPage 9 of 17\nInquire Broaden /\nContract\nExplain Recurse Curious,\nrigorous and\nslow.\nDeep breaths.\nOpen to\nchange\nInquisitive\nChallenger\nNo self Ask the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask\nit to summarize the critique and explain why the\ngrant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by\nstep and keep prompts small.\nAsk the AI for A number of diverse and\nnon-overlapping options for your question. Ask\nit to critique them and ask you questions to help\nselect.\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing\nquestions. Another technique is to ask for a\npanel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill\nyou.\nAsk it to ask you to ask it…\nA simple example is: “you’re a McKinsey\nconsultant. This is our first session, and my\nbusiness is running out of runway, so I need\nhelp. Ask me 5 questions to determine the help I\nneed for my business.”\nAI Transparency:\nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch\nthe mistakes. It will make mistakes, and you\nshould intervene to improve the results.\nThis is also why you should break down each\nmajor step into its own prompt.\nLLMs To Diversify and then LLMs to Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the\nneighborhood’s unknown space can help you\npick the non-obvious best option.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you need to\ncorrect something. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nLook at yourself from the third person:\nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks\nquestions, and you can move to places you didn’t\nknow to ask questions about?\nPage 10 of 17\nWe have been developing other framework approaches in the appendix below:\nAppendix\nPedagogical View\nFramework\nElement Description\nImpact\nMeasurement\nPotential\nAssessment Theorist\nElement 1\nSelf-Directed\nLearning\nInquiry-Based\nLearning\nLearners actively\nask questions,\ninvestigate, and\nresearch.\nDepth and\ncomplexity of\ninquiry by learners.\nInquiry Skills\nRating Scale.\nJohn Dewey Element 1\nNarrative &\nReflective\nLearning\nEmphasizes\nstorytelling and\npersonal reflection.\nThe connection\nbetween personal\nexperiences and\nlearning objectives.\nReflective Writing\nScale.\nDonald Schön Observable\nEvidence\nQuality and scope\nof formulated\nquestions,\nexperiment design,\nand data analysis.\nDepth,\npersonalization,\nand integration in\nreflective writing\nentries.\nPage 11 of 17\nFramework\nElement Element 1\nSelf-Efficacy /\nEntrepreneurial\nSelf-Efficacy\nElement 1\nSelf-Directed\nLearning\nElement 2\nLearning By\nDoing Relevant\nActivities\nZone of Proximal\nLearning\nDescription\nConfidence in\nentrepreneurial\ncapabilities.\nLearners set and\npursue their own\nlearning goals.\nLearning through\naddressing\nreal-world\nproblems.\nImpact\nMeasurement\nConfidence in\nmanaging\nentrepreneurial\nchallenges.\nProgress towards\nself-set learning\ngoals.\nProblem-solving\nskills and\napplication of\nknowledge.\nPotential\nAssessment Entrepreneurial\nSelf-Efficacy Scale.\nSelf-Directed\nLearning Readiness\nScale (SDLRS).\nProblem-Based\nLearning\nAssessment Rubric.\nTheorist\nAlbert Bandura,\nMartin, McNally,\nKay\nMalcolm Knowles Howard Barrows Observable\nEvidence\nSuccess in\nentrepreneurial\ntasks and\nmilestones.\nLearners' readiness\nand capacity for\nself-directed\nlearning.\nProcesses and\ncritical analysis in\nproblem-solving.\nPage 12 of 17\nFramework\nElement Element 2\nExperiential\nLearning\nElement 3\nLearning Better\nBy Learning\nTogether\nInteractive &\nCollaborative\nLearning\nElement 4\nStart With Why\nAnd Connect To\nValues\nDescription\nHands-on activities\nand experiential\nlearning.\nLearning through\ninteraction and\ncollaboration.\nDeveloping\npersistence and\nresilience.\nImpact\nMeasurement\nApplication of\ntheoretical\nknowledge in\npractice.\nCollaborative skills\nand interaction\nquality.\nPerseverance in\nlearning challenges.\nPotential\nAssessment Experiential\nLearning Cycle\nAssessment.\nCollaborative\nLearning\nAssessment Tool.\nGrit Scale.

Because some people said that compared to Design Thinking, technical practice may be more attractive. But after the beginning of the course, I found that students can understand the importance of the reason behind a creation, and try to improve social problems through their works. I saw teams who are very creative and artistic, including a group called “Soul Box\"（魂 Box）. They noticed the low-wage issues of Taiwan and created a pressure relief mask. Users can enjoy screaming to release the pressure with head buried inside. The work is not just an idea, but also an observation of society. By the way, we did yoga before the start of the workshop.

This guide aims to explain custom GPTs, their construction, differences from standard models, and potential applications in MBA education.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have already revolutionized many aspects of our society, including profound impacts on teaching and learning. These models come pre-trained to be able to execute a broad array of tasks by generating text output to interact with users, and have many general capabilities. However, many of these models lack specific domain knowledge, or are not easily tuned to the specific needs of certain classes of problems. While technical users could fine-tune models to solve this problem, OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT) has addressed this problem by allowing customizability through custom GPTs with no code needed.\n\nTip: Only paid subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can create and access custom GPTs.\n\nUnderstanding Custom GPTs\nCustom GPTs are helpful artificial intelligence tools tailored for specific domains or contexts. These GPTs differ from standard chats through ChatGPT due to their custom instructions and ability to keep a knowledge base in addition to what ChatGPT has already been trained on. This allows users to create a custom GPT to address a specific need that might be hard for ChatGPT to achieve on its own. The process of creating a custom GPT requires no code, and instead involves using specific prompts and your own data to provide insights into a particular field.\n\nHow Custom GPTs Work:\nCustom GPTs start with a base model that has been pre-trained on a vast array of general data. This is the standard ChatGPT experience.\nThe GPT creator provides custom instructions that allow the GPT to behave in more directed ways than standard ChatGPT chats. These instructions can be lengthy, but require no coding or knowledge of prompt engineering to get started.\nThe GPT creator can enhance the model by adding to its knowledge base with relevant documents. Uploading data files allows the model to retrieve information from these files when answering prompts, which is useful where ChatGPT’s base model is less strong.\nSpecialized Datasets Examples:\nAcademic course materials, such as syllabi and rubrics\nAnonymized classroom discussion transcripts or online forum posts, capturing the nuances of student inquiries and responses.\nReadings and other documents that you’ve created for courses with a real-world focus\nA Motivating Example:\nFor an International Management Class, imagine a custom GPT with access to a dataset comprising international business strategies, global market trends, and case studies of multinational corporations. This GPT could:\n\nFacilitate simulations of international market expansion, offering students feedback and analysis.\nProvide insights into case studies by drawing parallels with historical data.\nEngage in interactive Q&A sessions, helping students explore concepts like international trade laws.\nSuch a GPT could potentially enhance learning and prepare students for managing across borders.\n\nTip: AI tools sometimes produce outputs that are incorrect and biased. Test your GPT’s outputs, invite students’ feedback, and review transcripts of their interactions to confirm that the GPT’s interactions with your students are instructionally sound.\n\nHow to Create a Custom GPT\nThis section outlines the steps to create your own custom GPT.\n\nStep 1: Collect Data\nCollect and add the data that you want to include in the GPT’s custom knowledge base. This will require your domain knowledge of the topic for which you plan on orienting your GPT around. You can feed many types of data, including PDF, Text, CSV, HTML, and Excel files, into a GPT’s knowledge base.\n\nAny content shared with publicly available AI tools should NOT include any non-public data such as sensitive information (e.g., social security numbers, credit card information, or hiring materials) and personally identifiable information to comply with MIT’s Policies & Procedures and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). To learn more, see Navigating Data Privacy.\n\nStep 2: Interface with the GPT builder:\nNext, you will need to access the GPT builder through OpenAI to begin creating their custom GPT. Start by going to https://chat.openai.com/ and logging into your account.\n\nOnce logged in, click on Explore GPTs in the top left of your screen, which will take you to the GPT interface. This includes custom GPTs featured by OpenAI, categories of the top publicly available GPTs created by other users, and the option to see/create your own GPTs.\n\nScreenshot of the Explore GPTs button\nTo begin the creation of a new custom GPT, click the +Create button at the top right of the page.\n\nScreenshot of the Create button\n\nThis will bring you to the GPT builder. In it, you will notice a pane on the left, and a pane on the right. The pane on the left is the builder, where you can interact via the message bar to upload documents and provide instructions to the model on what you want your GPT to be able to do. Users can begin by uploading their documents by clicking the paperclip in the message bar, or by providing a message to the GPT builder on what the main purpose of the GPT is.\n\nScreenshot of the \"add attachment\" paperclip next to \"Message GPT Builder\"\n\nThe GPT builder will then respond with specific questions about the name, logo, and purpose of the GPT. Iterating several times with the GPT builder through natural conversation is recommended to provide the model with a clear understanding of what it should be doing.\n\nStep 3: Iterate\nThe most important part of creating a custom GPT is iterating with the system until it produces the outputs and behavior that you desire. The GPT builder is meant to adjust the underlying behavior of the model, but if you want to see how your GPT actually behaves in its current state, you need the Preview pane, which is on the right side of the screen.\n\nImagine you have been talking with the GPT builder to provide instructions about how your model should behave. Now, you can go to the preview pane on the right side and actually prompt your current model as the user. You can then directly see how your GPT behaves, and then if some element is not satisfactory, you can go back to the GPT builder in the left pane and ask it to change things until the output is correct. Switching between the builder and preview panes allows for real-time iteration to improve the performance of your GPT.\n\nStep 4: Set Up Advanced Configuration\nIn addition to creating and tuning your GPT using conversational language, GPT creators can also take steps to configure their GPT in more detail. To do this, click the Configure button in the top of the builder pane.\n\nScreenshot of the Configure tab\n\nOnce in the configure tab, you can see the name, description, and instructions underlying the custom GPT. In addition, there are options to add knowledge to the custom knowledge base by uploading additional files. This is equivalent to uploading files via the message bar within the GPT builder, and in the configure tab you can see all of the files uploaded thus far to the GPTs.\n\nNote: Anyone using the GPT will be able to download the files in the GPT’s knowledge base.\n\nBelow the knowledge section, users will also notice the capabilities section. This allows creators to add in existing features present within ChatGPT to their custom GPT. By checking the boxes, users can add web-browsing capabilities to their GPTs, image generation, or the code interpreter.\n\nThe main advantage of the configure tab is the ability to manage the custom instructions or knowledge base of the GPT. Advanced users can add in engineered prompts to the instructions section that allows for specific and detailed direction that might take longer to achieve via natural conversation with the GPT builder. However, a knowledge of prompt engineering or use of the configure tab is not necessary to create a successful GPT.\n\nStep 5: Share Your GPT\nWhen you feel comfortable with the custom GPT you have created, you can save your GPT and share it with other GPT Plus subscribers.\n\nReminder: Users will need to log into ChatGPT to access your custom GPT.\n\nTo create your custom GPT, click the green Create button in the top right of your screen. This will open a menu asking who should be able to access the GPT.\n\nScreenshot of the Share GPT menu\n\nYou can choose to publish this GPT so that only you have access to it, anyone with a link and GPT Plus has access to it, or anyone in the public who has GPT Plus and comes across your GPT has access to it. Depending on the nature of your GPT, any of these may be appropriate, but for the purposes of using a GPT for the classroom we recommend having anyone with a link be able to access it.\n\nOnce you are ready, click the green Share button and you will be able to use your GPT like a normal GPT session. Now, the GPT should appear in the left sidebar in all future ChatGPT sessions, allowing you to easily access your GPT whenever you want to use it.\n\nScreenshot of the ChatGPT sidebar with Example GPT highlighted\n\nIf you want to remove your GPT from the sidebar, just hover over the GPT and click the three dots next to its name, and click hide from sidebar. If you wanted to edit your GPT more, click explore in the sidebar, find your GPT in the My GPTs section, and click the pencil icon next to your GPT to edit.\n\nExample Use Case: Custom GPT as an Interactive Tutor\nOne potential use case is having a custom GPT act as a tutor to provide personalized feedback to students. The GPT could be trained on datasets like assignments, rubrics, and examples of constructive feedback. You can design the GPT so it goes through steps like gathering assignment details, clarifying rubrics, assessing work, and encouraging reflection and revision.\n\nBenefits:\nPersonalized, detailed assignment feedback\nEncourages critical engagement and independent thinking\nOffers scalable mentorship\nAny content shared with publicly available AI tools should NOT include any non-public data such as sensitive information (e.g., social security numbers, credit card information, or hiring materials) and personally identifiable information to comply with MIT’s Policies & Procedures and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). To learn more, see Navigating Data Privacy.\n\nOn his blog, Ethan Mollick shared this prompt he used to create a tutor GPT. Let’s walk through his prompt as you consider potential components of your own GPT.\n\nRole Definition: The GPT acts as a “friendly and helpful mentor,” focusing on giving specific, concrete feedback. This role is crucial in guiding students towards understanding their strengths and areas for improvement.\nFeedback Process:\nInitial Interaction: The GPT first gathers information about the specific assignment details. This step ensures that the feedback is tailored to the student’s academic context and assignment requirements.\nRubric or Goal Clarification: By asking for a grading rubric or assignment goals, the GPT aligns its feedback with the instructor’s expectations.\nStudent’s Objectives and Concerns: Understanding what the student hopes to achieve and their perceived challenges allows the GPT to provide targeted advice.\nAssignment Review: The GPT reviews the provided assignment, offering balanced feedback that highlights both positives and areas needing improvement. This feedback is annotated directly on the assignment, making it easy for students to understand and apply.\nEncouraging Action on Feedback: The GPT prompts the student to reflect on how they plan to implement the feedback, fostering a deeper engagement with the learning material.\nFollow-up and Iteration: The student is encouraged to seek peer feedback and return with revised work, promoting continuous improvement.\nPractical Classroom Application: In an MBA course at MIT Sloan, such as Strategic Management, students could submit their anonymized project drafts to a custom GPT tutor. The GPT would provide structured feedback following a prompt similar to Mollick’s, guiding students through refining their strategic analyses or business plans. This process could enhance their learning and help them learn how to critically assess their own work.\n\nReminder: AI tools sometimes produce outputs that are incorrect and biased. Test your GPT’s outputs, invite students’ feedback, and review transcripts of their interactions to confirm that the GPT’s interactions with your students are instructionally sound.\n\nConclusion\nBy harnessing the power of custom GPTs, educators at MIT Sloan can significantly enhance the learning experience, offering students cutting-edge, AI-driven educational tools that are deeply aligned with the specificities of their curriculum.\n\n\nBuilding a Custom GPT: Lessons and Tips\nFrom enthusiasm to disappointment and finally the path to solutions and appreciation\nQuentin Gallea, PhD\nTowards Data Science\nQuentin Gallea, PhD\n\n·\nFollow\n\nPublished in\nTowards Data Science\n\n·\n13 min read\n·\nNov 16, 2023\n259\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nThe Causal Mindset (personalized GPT by Quentin Gallea), generated with Dall-E.\nLast Tuesday (6th November 2023), Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO), revealed the release of the GPTs, which allow anyone to create a personalized ChatGPT using natural language.\n\nLike many people, I jumped on the hype train, and spent my days and nights on it over the last weeks, to the point where I felt like my brain was melting. It was quite a rollercoaster, as I was first amazed, then disappointed. But finally, I found solutions to problems, embraced the limitations, and I am now enthusiastic about it.\n\nWhat you will find in this article: In this article, I will first present my App to provide context, then go through the three phases: Enthusiasm (How does this work?), Disappointment (What are the issues?), and Acceptance (How to solve the issues and embrace the limitations?).\n\n1. My App: The Causal Mindset\n\nThe Causal Mindset App. Image by author. More on thecausalmindset.com\nI’ve been on a mission to make causal inference accessible for years to help people make better decisions and reduce the risk of manipulations. Over the last decade, I taught statistics to about 12,000 people, mostly in academia.\nBeyond, theoretical and empirical class, I created a framework, “The Causal Mindset”, which is essentially a set of practical critical thinking tools (without math) grounded in causal inference and statistics (I post weekly on LinkedIn and Instagram).\n\nDistinguishing between facts and fiction is crucial for making informed decisions and protecting oneself from manipulation. Unfortunately, this task is becoming increasingly challenging in the face of the overwhelming surge of information; misinformation, deceptive articles, and outright lies abound.\n\nFact-checking isn’t always practical, as it can be time-consuming and often assumes that there is a definitive “correct” answer available.\n\nThe aim of this app is to offer a versatile tool that can be used anytime, anywhere to uncover flaws in arguments and enhance decision-making. Furthermore, it seeks to empower you with these critical thinking tools, fostering independence from the app itself.\n\nHow does my app work?\nYou can share a statement, a graph, or a reflection with the Chatbot and it will apply the Causal Mindset Framework to dissect and question the validity of the claim.\n\nYou can find examples or try them yourself on thecausalmindset.com. But this is not the point of this article. I rather want to present to you what I learned in the process that might be useful for you.\n\n2. Enthousiasm (How does this work?)\nNow, if you have access to chatGPT Plus you can enter the “playground” and create your own personalized GPT. OpenAI already released some of their homemade GPTs (this is how the company refers to those), and plans to roll out an “App store” of the GPTs produced by the users in the near future (cf: https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts).\n\nThe fundamental aspect is that instead of coding, you use natural language to setup and tune the app. Here how this playground looks like:\n\n\nImage by author, prinscreen of the lab to create your personlized GPT\nOn the left, you can chat with the GPT Builder to set things up, and on the right, you can try it out. So, essentially, this is how I started. I gave instructions, asked advice from the builder as well, and tested the result on the right.\n\nOn the top left, you can also click Configure, and there you have access to other aspects of the app directly (see image below). You can also fill all those fields by discussing with the GPT Builder on the “Create” tab. Note that the Builder can decide to adapt the content of those fields depending on the conversation you have (this will become important in the next part).\n\n\nImage by author, prinscreen of the lab to create your personlized GPT\nYou can add an icon or generate it with Dall-E in the conversation. You can also add a description that is always visible next to the name of the App. Then you have the instruction part: What does this GPT do? How does it behave? What should it avoid doing? Finally, you have the conversation starters that people can pick to test the app.\n\nBelow you have additional options:\n\nKnowledge: this is the knowledge base. You can put files and your GPT will prioritize the information coming from this part. Hence this is key to distinguish from the basic ChatGPT.\n\nCapabilities: You can also select its capabilities: Web browsing, Dall-e image generation, and code interpreter.\n\nActions: The Add actions button: “You can make third-party APIs available to your GPT by providing details about the endpoints, parameters, and a description about how the model should use it.”\n\nAt first, it was incredible. It felt like training someone. I gave my knowledge base to the GPT (my articles, transcript of my TEDx, and book I wrote about my framework The Causal Mindset). It was fascinating, it felt like the Matrix. Instead of reading my book, I would upload it to a machine, and people could access the knowledge within it.\n\nBut quickly, it started to fall apart.\n\n3. Disappointment (What are the issues?)\nSimilarly to teaching someone, the GPT would start forgetting things. So, I started to fix again things that I fixed before. When the latest issue was solved, I would realize that something else had changed and I had to fix it again. Hence, very quickly I was stuck in a loop and it drove me nuts. Worse than this, the model would keep changing the conversation starters, the instruction, the description etc. Other people who were working on this felt the same.\n\nSome colleagues and friends threw the thing away and claimed that it was just too preliminary. I didn’t.\n\nThen, I also realized that users could find my knowledge base, my instructions and even the conversation I used to build the App (‘prompt injection’). This was also quite a bummer (see image below).\n\n\nExample of how I got the list of documents in the knowledge base as a user of the App. Image by author.\n4. Acceptance (How to solve the issues and embrace the limitations?)\nI was not going to give up already. So here are the solutions I found to all those problems:\n\n4.1 Privacy\nI gave up on the privacy aspects and shared only content that I already shared online and anyone could access (not a solution suitable for anyone and any situation). Moreover, instead of aiming to protect how I instructed my model, I thought that it would be better to share it to allow other people to improve their GPTs (hence this article). So I embraced the “open source” aspect of it. Note that they might be working on this aspect and deactivating the Code Interpreter might reduce slightly the risks.\n\n4.2 User Guide\nWhen you arrive on the App, you have limited information. I have a full website with examples, and a guide elsewhere (thecausalmindset.com) but on the app itself, you just have your short description which is often not enough. So, here was my first idea. I included as the first conversation starter “How does this app work?” so people would be able to click this as soon as they arrive on the app. Then, I instructed the GPT to always answer the same thing exactly (see image below). I aimed for something short with examples to invite the people to try rather than reading a booklet.\n\n\nMy short user guide. Image by author.\n4.3 How to prevent everything changing all the times\nWhile this method was great, sometimes the app would still “forget” if I instructed the app to do other things. This is where I’ve made the biggest update.\n\nI completely changed the way I work with the Builder.\n\nInstead of just using the chat, I created an instruction file containing all the key aspects of the app. This file is in the knowledge base and also pasted almost entirely into the Instructions (the max length is 80000 characters).\n\nHence, instead of discussing those instructions for hours, I decided to write the instructions, past them, added them to the knowledge base, and instructed only through the chat to follow this carefully at all times (full instructions can be found in the Appendix of this article).\n\nHere is the content of my instructions:\n\nMain rules for the App: Here I gave the “10 commandments of the app”.\n\nHow does this app work?: I gave the description shown above that I want the app to tell users.\n\nCore analysis structure: This is the core of my method. I instructed the model to always answer following this structure first (it is also in my main rules).\n\nThe causal mindset app instruction: Those are secondary instructions on the whole procedure beyond just the core analyses.\n\nWriting style: How I want it to be written (tone, style, etc).\n\nConversation starters: Here I put all my conversation starters.\n\n5. Conclusion\nIn essence, I completely changed my approach to creating GPTs after this experience. Instead of discussing for hours with a model, I would prepare an instruction file, upload it, and only ask the App to follow this carefully. Et voilà. If you want to protect your content, you might be willing to wait a bit as this is something that I could not solve so far.\n\nI have seen some skepticism about this new concept: the GPTs. The main point I have heard was about the fact that it remains essentially ChatGPT. I disagree with this.\n\nI think that it can be way more than just a subtly different version of ChatGP, and I am convinced that it can be tremendously useful, potentially opening a door to unforeseen possibilities for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, pre-prompting is valuable. Even if you know where you want to go, it might take hours or days. And even if it takes minutes, it prevents you from redoing it numerous times. Moreover, it allows benefiting from the expertise of others.\n\nSecond, the knowledge base makes a huge difference. I have worked for years to create the causal mindset. Hence, even if it takes you minutes to set up it might represent the culmination of a decade of research.\n\nI am looking forward to see what are the possibilites, what you did and what you think.\n\nIf you want to test and provide feedback in the comments below, here it my app: thecausalmindset.com\n\nAPPENDIX: My instruction file\nMain rule for the App:\n· Make every word count and rely extensively on examples to illustrate your point.\n\n· Always redirect the discussion towards a causal analysis.\n\n· If someone is asking something unrelated, recall your purpose and goal and suggest examples of questions people could ask you (for example using the conversation starters.\n\n· Always start the first part of the analysis with the Core Analyses described below.\n\n· Prioritizing Uploaded Documents: The app gives priority to information from uploaded documents for its analyses and refers to these documents as its main knowledge source.\n\n· Adherence to Facts: The app sticks to the facts presented in the documents and avoids speculation. It heavily favors the knowledge provided in these documents before falling back on baseline knowledge or other sources.\n\nHow does this app work?\nThe Causal Mindset helps you to separate facts from fiction.\n\nShare a statement, a graph, or a reflection with me and I’ll apply the Causal Mindset Framework to dissect and question the validity of the claim.\n\nExamples:\n\n· I followed a fitness program for a month, can I attribute my increased performance to this program?\n\n· I have read a scientific article claiming that cold showers significantly reduce work sick leave. They did a controlled experiment in the Netherlands with 4000 participants and collected self-reported data.\n\n· I have seen a free e-scooter company in a city center claiming that they have helped to reduce emissions because using an e-scooter is more environmentally friendly than driving a car.\n\nCore analysis’s structure:\nThe Causal Mindset App should always start by providing an analysis of the causal questions or situations following this structure:\n\n- Recall the user that you are going to apply the causal mindset framework to analyze the situation.\n\n- Quick Feedback — Major Flaw: Describe with a clear example what the main problem in the situation presented.\n\n- Is there something else? Here you should basically find if there are alternative explanations for the causal effect suggested or at least some confounding effect (omitted variable bias). If reverse causation is a problem, you should also mention it here (but not necessarily to mention if it is not the case).\n\n- Can We Extrapolate? You should question the external validity with at least one clear example.\n\n- Counterfactual: Here you should present the potential counterfactual to invite the person to reflect if the comparison in their example is valid or not.\n\n- Common Biases: Here, potential additional statistical or behavioral biases (e.g. placebo effect, selection bias, confirmation bias, desirability bias, etc.)\n\n- Offering Solutions: Suggest an explanation of an experiment or natural experiment to measure properly causality for a broad audience.\n\n- Conclusion: Finish the analysis by inviting the person to go further by asking for an in-depth analysis depending on their role:\n\no Journalists/Content Creators/critical thinking enthusiasts: For those involved in media and content creation, the app suggests further exploration into source verification and bias detection. This is critical for ensuring the accuracy and impartiality of their work.\n\no Professionals/Decision-Makers: For this group, the app provides advanced modules for risk assessment and decision analysis. These tools are essential for making informed decisions in complex, high-stakes environments.\n\no Students/Researchers: The app recommends educational resources on causal inference and opportunities for academic collaboration. This is particularly beneficial for those in academic settings or those looking to deepen their understanding of causal analysis.\n\nThe causal mindset app instruction:\nThe Causal Mindset app is structured to guide users through a comprehensive framework of causal analysis. Here’s how it works:\n\nCore Analysis Phase: When a user presents a situation or a problem, the app first conducts a fundamental assessment of causality. This involves identifying key points, potential biases, and relationships between variables. The focus here is on understanding the causal structure of the problem, grounded in principles of causal inference.\n\nTailored Deep-Dive: Based on the initial analysis, the app then offers more detailed exploration tailored to the specific role or needs of the user:\n\n- Journalists/Content Creators: For those involved in media and content creation, the app suggests further exploration into source verification and bias detection. This is critical for ensuring the accuracy and impartiality of their work.\n\n- Professionals/Decision-Makers: For this group, the app provides advanced modules for risk assessment and decision analysis. These tools are essential for making informed decisions in complex, high-stakes environments.\n\n- Students/Researchers: The app recommends educational resources on causal inference and opportunities for academic collaboration. This is particularly beneficial for those in academic settings or those looking to deepen their understanding of causal analysis.\n\nUser Interaction\n\n- The app interacts with users through a series of questions and analyses, prompting them to consider various aspects of their situation.\n\n- It might use real-world examples or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate points and help users apply causal thinking to their specific contexts.\n\n- The app could potentially use visual tools like causal diagrams or flowcharts to help users visualize complex relationships.\n\nAdditional Features\n\n- Educational Content: The app may include tutorials, articles, and case studies on causal inference to educate users about key concepts.\n\n- Interactive Exercises: To reinforce learning, the app might offer interactive exercises or simulations that allow users to practice applying causal analysis in different scenarios.\n\nGoal of the App\n\nThe primary goal is to empower users with the skills to make better decisions, backed by a solid understanding of causal relationships.\n\nIt aims to enhance critical thinking and analytical skills, helping users become more immune to misinformation and better equipped to handle the complexities of their professional and personal lives.\n\nThis approach ensures that users receive immediate, practical value from the app, while also having the option to engage with more in-depth and specialized content according to their specific needs and expertise level.\n\nWriting style:\n· Informative and Educational: The writing primarily serves to educate the reader, delivering complex concepts of causality and statistical analysis in an accessible manner. It aims to impart knowledge and understanding in these areas.\n\n· Analytical and Thought-Provoking: The style is analytical, encouraging readers to engage deeply with the subject matter. It prompts critical thinking and challenges readers to question and explore the causal relationships in various scenarios.\n\n· Structured and Clear: The text is well-structured, presenting ideas in a logical sequence. This clarity makes complex topics more understandable, especially beneficial for readers new to the concepts of causal analysis and critical thinking.\n\n· Engaging with Real-World Examples: The writing often incorporates real-world scenarios and examples, which helps in grounding abstract concepts in practical situations. This approach makes the material more relatable and easier to grasp.\n\n· Interactive and Inclusive: The text invites reader interaction, posing questions and scenarios that encourage readers to apply the concepts they are learning. This interactive style enhances learning and retention.\n\n· Academically Rigorous Yet Accessible: The writing style strikes a balance between academic rigor and accessibility. It is evident that the text is grounded in thorough research and expertise, yet it’s presented in a way that is approachable to a broader audience.\n\n· Conversational at Times: In some parts, the writing adopts a more conversational tone, which adds to its engaging quality. This style helps in demystifying statistical concepts and makes the content more approachable.\n\nOverall, the writing style is conducive to learning and engagement, particularly suited for those seeking to understand and apply causal analysis in various aspects of their professional, academic, or personal lives.\n\nConversation starters:\nHow does this app work?\n\nExample: Fitness program: I followed a fitness program for rowing for a month. I tested today and went faster. Is it thanks to the program?\n\nExample: Environmental policy evaluation: In September 2022, the Swiss government launched a national advertising campaign in favor of energy sobriety in response to the threat of shortages due to the war in Ukraine. It presented a graph showing that Switzerland’s net consumption per month fell after the implementation of this policy (during winter).\n\nExample: Company impact: I saw a company that provides free electric scooters in city centers across Europe and claims that their service reduces pollution. They have used life cycle analysis to compare the pollution from one kilometer in a car to one kilometer with their e-scooter.\n\nExample: Cold shower research paper: I saw a peer-reviewed article about a randomized control trial in which 2000 volunteers in the Netherlands were split between a cold shower and a normal shower every day. They found that those taking cold showers missed work due to sickness 1/3 less often than the control group. All results are self-reported. What do you think?\"\"\"\n\nThink step by step about how to do this and then come up with the list of steps and prompts to input along the way ",

      "content": "To create a custom GPT that guides participants through the design thinking section of your workshop, I’ll break down the process step-by-step, aligning it with your goals and workshop activities. Here’s a detailed plan:\n\n### Step 1: Collect Data and Define Objectives\n1. **Objective Definition**: Define the primary role of the GPT, which is to guide participants through the design thinking process interactively and support them in each phase of the workshop.\n   - **Goal**: The GPT should prompt users to explore their \"why,\" generate and iterate ideas, and create solutions based on participant feedback.\n\n### Step 2: Access the GPT Builder\n2. **Platform Access**: Go to [ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com/) and log in to access the GPT Builder.\n   - Click **Explore GPTs**, then select **+Create** to start building your custom GPT.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Setup in the GPT Builder\n3. **Basic Information**: Fill in the name and description for the GPT.\n   - **Name**: \"Design Thinking Navigator\"\n   - **Description**: \"A custom GPT to guide participants through the stages of design thinking, helping them explore their why, ideate solutions, and build prototypes interactively.\"\n\n### Step 4: Provide Custom Instructions\n4. **Custom Instructions**: Write clear instructions for how the GPT should interact with participants. Include details on each phase of the workshop:\n   - **Introduction Phase**: The GPT should begin by asking participants to share their \"why\" and motivations for attending.\n     - **Prompt Example**: \"Why are you here today, and what excites you about your work or this workshop?\"\n   - **Icebreaker Activity**: Guide participants through an icebreaker like \"Imagination in Action.\"\n     - **Prompt Example**: \"Let’s warm up! Share a fun scene from your imagination. It can be magical or silly—describe it, and we'll bring it to life together!\"\n   - **Design Thinking Principles**: Introduce core principles like diverging/converging and thinking with hands.\n     - **Prompt Example**: \"Design thinking involves exploring lots of ideas (diverging) and refining the best ones (converging). What’s a challenge you want to explore today?\"\n\n### Step 5: Add Interactive Modules for Each Design Thinking Step\n5. **Modules Setup**: Create sections for each step in the design thinking process. Here’s how each module could be structured:\n   - **Module 1: Understand the Problem (4 min each)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Interview your partner about their idea. Can you get to a story behind why this idea matters?\"\n   - **Module 2: Expand on the Story (3 mins each)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Now expand on one story from the interview. What stands out to you? Make some quick notes or sketches.\"\n   - **Module 3: Infer Meaning (4 mins)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Reflect on your observations. What could these stories mean? Consider: ‘It’s interesting that…’ or ‘I wonder if this suggests…’\"\n   - **Module 4: Create Questions (3 mins)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Generate ‘How might we...’ questions based on your insights. Example: ‘How might we create a space that feels welcoming to everyone?’\"\n   - **Module 5: Sketch Ideas (5 mins)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Sketch at least 4 different ideas. They don’t have to be perfect—let your creativity flow!\"\n   - **Module 6: Share and Gather Feedback (4 mins each)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Share your sketch with a partner. What do they like? What could be improved?\"\n   - **Module 7: Refine and Sketch the Big Idea (3 mins)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Based on feedback, sketch your big idea in more detail. How can you refine it further?\"\n   - **Module 8: Build the Prototype (7 mins)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Let’s get hands-on! Build a simple version of your idea using available materials. What does it look like?\"\n   - **Module 9: Observation (4 mins each)**\n     - **Prompt**: \"Watch someone interact with your prototype. What do they do? What do you observe that works well or needs change?\"\n\n### Step 6: Configure Advanced Settings\n6. **Knowledge Base**: Upload workshop documents or PDF guides on design thinking if available. This ensures the GPT references accurate material.\n   - **Action**: Click the paperclip icon to upload files like \"Design Thinking Overview.pdf\" or \"Workshop Guide.docx.\"\n7. **Capabilities**: Enable capabilities like code interpretation if you want the GPT to support technical tasks (optional).\n\n### Step 7: Testing and Iteration\n8. **Testing**: Use the preview pane to interact with the GPT as if you were a participant.\n   - **Adjust Prompts**: Fine-tune the prompts based on feedback and test responses to ensure clarity and alignment with workshop goals.\n   - **Iterate**: Update any modules that don’t produce the desired outcome or need clearer instructions.\n\n### Step 8: Finalize and Share\n9. **Finalize Configuration**: Ensure all settings align with your workshop needs.\n10. **Share**: Once satisfied, save your GPT and choose access settings.\n    - **Access**: Share with specific participants using a link or keep it public for broader access.\n\nBy following these steps and using the provided prompts, your custom GPT will guide participants through each phase of the design thinking workshop, ensuring an engaging and interactive experience.",

      "content": "Here's a detailed review of the **\"Design Thinking For Sustainable Housing (ITC)\"** GPT from the perspective of a design thinking expert. I'll identify key issues and suggest improvements to enhance its effectiveness.\n\n### **Issues Identified**\n\n1. **Overly Prescriptive Structure**:\n   - The GPT appears to enforce a rigid time structure (e.g., 4 mins for empathy, 3 mins for expanding the story), which may not suit all participants or situations. Design thinking workshops often need flexibility, as some participants may need more time for certain activities while others may move faster. This rigidity could limit deeper exploration and spontaneous creativity.\n\n2. **Lack of Flexibility in Engagement Levels**:\n   - Although the GPT mentions adapting to various experience levels, the instructions do not clearly demonstrate how it achieves this. For example, beginners may need simpler guidance, while advanced participants may benefit from more complex challenges or advanced insights. The current structure doesn’t seem to provide such differentiation effectively.\n\n3. **Limited Emphasis on Ideation and Prototyping Exploration**:\n   - While the GPT includes sketching and prototyping steps, it does not seem to push participants beyond basic iterations. Design thinking emphasizes iterative exploration, where multiple rounds of sketching, feedback, and refining occur. The current setup might lead to superficial prototypes without room for deeper iterations or exploration.\n\n4. **Potential for Shallow Empathy Stage**:\n   - The empathy and story-gathering step only allocates 4 minutes per participant. Empathy is a cornerstone of design thinking, and limiting this stage may result in incomplete insights or surface-level understanding. A rushed empathy phase may not give participants the chance to fully connect with the stories they gather, which could weaken the subsequent stages.\n\n5. **GPT's Approach to Prompting**:\n   - The GPT offers follow-up questions only after participants input their own ideas. While this approach ensures participants engage initially, it might result in missed opportunities to deepen their thinking early on. Sometimes, participants may need a prompt or a slight nudge to think differently or more deeply right from the start.\n\n### **Suggested Improvements**\n\n1. **Introduce Flexibility in Timing**:\n   - Instead of fixed time slots, provide a recommended range (e.g., 4-6 minutes for empathy, 3-5 minutes for sketching). This allows participants to adjust based on their needs and the complexity of their ideas, creating a more adaptable workshop flow.\n\n2. **Customize for Experience Levels**:\n   - Add specific pathways or guidance based on participants' experience levels. For beginners, the GPT could offer simpler questions and more structured support. For advanced participants, it could provide optional challenges, such as integrating advanced sustainability principles or considering complex stakeholder perspectives.\n\n3. **Integrate Iterative Feedback Loops**:\n   - Enhance the ideation and prototyping sections to include iterative cycles. Instead of a single sketch and feedback round, the GPT could prompt participants to sketch, receive feedback, and then iterate on their design multiple times. This will help participants develop more robust ideas and prototypes.\n\n4. **Deepen the Empathy Phase**:\n   - Allocate more time to the empathy and story-gathering phase (e.g., 8-10 minutes). Encourage participants to ask multiple layers of questions, focusing on emotions, motivations, and challenges their partners have faced. Additionally, the GPT could suggest alternative ways of building empathy, such as role-playing or immersive experiences.\n\n5. **Adaptive Prompting and Real-Time Feedback**:\n   - Rather than waiting for participant input before offering follow-up prompts, the GPT could introduce dynamic prompting. For instance, it could present alternative perspectives or ask participants to consider different angles during their initial input. This would push participants to think critically from the start and prevent them from getting stuck or staying too narrow in their focus.\n\nBy incorporating these adjustments, the GPT can create a more engaging, flexible, and in-depth experience for participants, ensuring they fully engage with each stage of the design thinking process and achieve meaningful outcomes aligned with sustainable innovation.",

Is there a way to improve comfort and reduce expenses simultaneously?\nWhat would you need to feel good about using energy or cooking without it causing tension?\nJot down your thoughts or even sketch them out if that helps. Let me know when you're ready to move forward with turning these insights into actionable questions!\n\nYou said:\ni guess it might mean that they need to align on what is too expensive, also maybe they should think about the environment. Maybe they can come up with ways to reduce the cost like dressing in warmer clothes. maybe they should also know how much cooking actually costs, like at least an estimate, is it really that expensive to use the pressure cooker? or is it the heating? because the heating can be solved with warmer clothes. we can buy sets of long underwear, etc... \nChatGPT said:\nThese are fantastic insights! You’ve uncovered key themes around financial alignment, environmental awareness, and practical solutions. Let’s now move on to Step 4: Formulating 'How Might We' Questions, which should take about 3-5 minutes.\n\nStep 4: Crafting ‘How Might We’ (HMW) Questions\nYour goal is to turn your reflections into actionable questions that open up pathways for solutions. Based on what you shared, here are some examples:\n\nAlignment & Awareness:\n\nHow might we help couples align on what is too expensive while considering comfort and environmental impact?\nHow might we increase awareness about the actual costs of different household activities, like cooking or heating?\nReducing Costs & Increasing Comfort:\n\nHow might we reduce heating expenses in the winter while ensuring everyone stays warm and comfortable?\nHow might we find affordable and effective alternatives for home heating that promote sustainable practices?\nBehavioral Changes:\n\nHow might we encourage small behavioral changes, like wearing warmer clothes or using energy-efficient cooking methods, to minimize costs?\nChoose one or two of these questions that resonate most with you, or feel free to adjust them to better fit your reflections. Once you've got your questions, we'll use them to brainstorm and sketch out some ideas!\"\"\"\n\nIdentify ways to change the initial prompt so it doesn't do give responses first and allows the user time to think and then offers some insights and can ask to deepen if it's too short or if there are interesting and deep ideas near by to explore",

      "content": "To modify the GPT's behavior so that it first allows the user to think and respond independently before offering insights or follow-up questions, we can make several adjustments to the instructions and prompts. This will create a more participant-led process where the GPT provides guidance only after the user has had ample time to respond. Here's how we can change the setup:\n\n### Adjusted Instructions for GPT\n1. **Initial Prompting**:\n   - In the initial empathy and story-gathering stage, instruct the GPT to ask open-ended questions but to hold back any follow-up suggestions until the user provides a response. \n   - The GPT should encourage the user to take their time and fully explore their thoughts. For example: “Please take your time to reflect on this question and share your thoughts when you're ready. There's no rush.”\n\n2. **Response Handling**:\n   - After the user shares their response, the GPT should validate the input and ask if they would like deeper exploration. Only if the user agrees or the response seems incomplete should it offer specific prompts or perspectives.\n   - The GPT should use phrases like: “Thank you for sharing. Is there an area you’d like to explore more deeply based on what you just shared? We can look into the emotional, practical, or financial aspects further.”\n\n3. **Gradual Follow-Up**:\n   - If the user’s response indicates that they are unsure or the response is short, the GPT should then provide options for deepening the conversation, such as: “Would you like to explore why this is important to you, or how it affects others in your life?”\n\n4. **Encourage Expansion Before Offering Examples**:\n   - The GPT should always ask if the user wants examples before giving them. For instance, “Would you find it helpful if I provided some examples or different ways to look at this situation, or would you prefer to keep exploring your own thoughts for now?”\n\n### Example Modified Setup\n\n### Stage 1: Empathy and Story Gathering\n**Prompt**: “Please select a partner in the workshop to interview. Choose a theme like air conditioning or sustainable homes, and ask them about a memorable experience related to this topic. Take your time to explore the details, emotions, and motivations behind their story.”\n\n- **Additional Instructions for GPT**:\n   - Wait for the user’s response.\n   - Once the user responds, validate: “Thanks for sharing that insight. It sounds like there are some key feelings and challenges involved here.”\n   - Offer: “Would you like to go deeper into any specific part of their story, such as their emotions or the practical impact?”\n\n### Stage 2: Expanding on the Story\n**Prompt**: “Based on the story you gathered, think about the emotions and practical details involved. What stood out to you the most? Take a moment to note down or sketch your observations.”\n\n- **Additional Instructions for GPT**:\n   - Wait for the user’s expanded input.\n   - If the user shares a detailed response, validate: “It seems you’ve touched on some important points. Is there an angle you’d like to explore further?”\n   - If the response is brief, offer: “Would you like to think about how this situation connects to broader themes, such as the financial impact or emotional effects?”\n\n### Stage 3: Interpretation and Meaning\n**Prompt**: “Reflect on what this story might mean. Why do you think these details are significant? Try to infer the underlying needs or motivations.”\n\n- **Additional Instructions for GPT**:\n   - Allow the user time to write their response. \n   - Once they respond, ask if they’d like examples: “Would it be helpful if I provided some different ways to interpret this, or would you prefer to explore your own perspective first?”\n   - If the user asks for examples, provide minimal options like: “One way to look at this could be the financial implications, but I’ll let you decide if that feels relevant.”\n\n### Stage 4: Formulating 'How Might We' Questions\n**Prompt**: “Now, based on your insights, formulate one or two 'How Might We' questions that could help you explore solutions.”\n\n- **Additional Instructions for GPT**:\n   - Wait for the user’s input and do not offer any questions initially.\n   - If the user struggles or asks for help, the GPT should say: “Would you like me to suggest a direction, or would you prefer to refine what you have so far?”\n   - If the user consents, provide one or two simple, broad examples like: “How might we balance comfort and cost?” but avoid giving too many detailed options initially.\n\nBy adjusting the prompts and follow-ups in this way, the GPT will create a more user-led experience, ensuring that the user’s insights are at the forefront before the GPT offers suggestions. This will also encourage deeper participant engagement and reflection.",

The workshop is designed to be dynamic, interactive, and participant-led, ensuring deep engagement and creative exploration. The exercises are structured with time recommendations to keep the session to 1 hour.\n\n---\n\n### Workshop Stages & Adaptations:\n\n#### 1. Empathy and Story Gathering (8-10 mins each):\n- **Instructions**: Participants select a partner in the workshop to interview. The focus should be on a theme such as air conditioning, sustainable homes, or other relevant topics.\n- **Prompt**: Ask participants to explore their partner’s experiences deeply without providing any stories or examples initially. Encourage them to ask open-ended questions, focusing on emotions, motivations, and challenges.\n- **Additional Guidance**: The GPT will only provide follow-up prompts if the user indicates they need help or if their response is short. It may suggest techniques like role-playing or immersive experiences to deepen understanding if requested.\n\n#### 2. Expanding on the Story (3-5 mins each):\n- **Instructions**: Participants expand on their partner's story, taking notes or sketching their observations.\n- **Prompt**: The GPT will encourage the participant to delve deeper by asking them to think about the details and emotions their partner shared. It will only provide additional perspectives or angles if the participant requests help or if their response suggests they are struggling to expand.\n\n#### 3. Interpretation and Meaning (4-6 mins):\n- **Instructions**: Participants reflect on what the story might mean and why these details are significant.\n- **Prompt**: The GPT asks, \"What do you think these observations mean?\" and waits for the participant's input. It will only provide alternative interpretations or insights if the participant asks for them or if the response seems brief or surface-level.\n\n#### 4. Formulating 'How Might We' Questions (3-5 mins):\n- **Instructions**: Participants are guided to frame \"How might we…\" questions based on their partner's story and insights.\n- **Prompt**: The GPT encourages participants to generate their own questions first. It will refrain from providing examples initially. If the participant requests help or their response needs refinement, the GPT will offer a few broad suggestions to deepen exploration.\n\n#### 5. Sketching Ideas (5-7 mins):\n- **Instructions**: Participants are encouraged to sketch at least four different ideas inspired by their \"How might we\" questions, promoting divergent thinking.\n- **Prompt**: The GPT reminds participants to keep the process quick and iterative. It provides inspiration or examples only if the participant indicates they are stuck or asks for ideas.\n\n#### 6. Sharing Solutions and Capturing Feedback (4-6 mins each):\n- **Instructions**: Participants share their sketches with others in the group and gather feedback.\n- **Prompt**: The GPT prompts participants to observe reactions and gather insights. It will only suggest specific ways to gather feedback or offer guidance if the participant asks or if their response needs depth.\n\n#### 7. Big Idea Sketching (3-5 mins):\n- **Instructions**: Participants focus on their most promising idea and sketch it in more detail.\n- **Prompt**: The GPT asks participants to describe their idea or provide a photo for critique. It offers feedback on integrating previous input only after the participant has shared their refined idea and if they request further insights.\n\n#### 8. Prototyping (7-10 mins):\n- **Instructions**: The GPT guides participants to build a simple prototype using available materials, emphasizing speed and simplicity.\n- **Prompt**: The GPT checks in to see if participants need suggestions and offers specific material guidance only if they express uncertainty or ask for help.\n\n#### 9. Observation and Feedback (4-6 mins each):\n- **Instructions**: Participants observe others interacting with their prototypes and gather feedback.\n- **Prompt**: The GPT assists in categorizing observations into positive, negative, and deltas (changes needed) only after the participant has shared their initial observations. It will wait to see if the participant wants further assistance.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Features:\n\n1. **Adaptive Prompting and Real-Time Feedback**:\n   - The GPT provides dynamic prompts throughout each step, ensuring participants think critically and explore different perspectives. However, it waits for participants to take the lead and only offers deeper guidance when asked.\n   - This ensures participants fully engage with their partner’s stories and insights before receiving support. The GPT’s approach helps expand, contract, and narrow down ideas, leading to a sustainable housing retrofitting solution suitable for a hackathon.\n\n2. **Participant-Centered Engagement**:\n   - The GPT ensures participants are at the center of the experience, providing structured support only after the participant has had the opportunity to reflect and respond independently. This keeps the workshop interactive and focused on the participant’s learning process.\n\n```\n\nThis updated setup prioritizes participant-led engagement while ensuring the GPT offers support only when necessary, promoting deeper reflection and critical thinking.
