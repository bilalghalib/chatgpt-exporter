      "content": "That’s a beautiful question, and it shows a sincere heart wanting to maintain the spirit of Ramadan.\n\n**Yes, it's very good to do Qiyam (night prayer) on the night of Eid**, not as a specific sunnah of Eid, but to continue the habit and maintain your connection with Allah. Scholars generally agree that while there is no *special* Qiyam al-Layl for the night of Eid with a specific format, praying at night out of love, gratitude, and consistency is always beloved to Allah.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:\n\n> *\"The most beloved deeds to Allah are those that are consistent, even if small.\"* (Sahih al-Bukhari)\n\nSo praying Qiyam on the night of Eid — especially if you’ve been doing it throughout Ramadan — is a beautiful way to show that your worship wasn’t seasonal, but heartfelt and sincere.\n\nIf your intention is to thank Allah, ask Him to accept your Ramadan, and continue walking in the light of that training, then yes — it’s very good.\n\nWould you like a short dua or prayer format you could use on the night of Eid?",

      "content": "Great follow-up — and it brings us closer to the heart of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) practice.\n\n**There is no authentic narration that the Prophet (PBUH) specifically prayed Qiyam on the night of Eid** (i.e. Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha) in a distinct or emphasized way. Unlike Laylat al-Qadr or the first ten nights of Dhul-Hijjah, the night before Eid doesn't carry a unique prescribed form of worship.\n\nHowever, the Prophet **was consistent in praying Qiyam throughout the year**, and he would **not leave it off, even while traveling**. So, it's understood that if a person has been doing Qiyam regularly — especially in Ramadan — then **to continue on the night of Eid is in line with the Prophet’s general practice** of maintaining consistent night prayer.\n\nThere’s also a weak narration attributed to Ibn Abbas:\n\n> *\"The five nights in which dua is not rejected: the night of Friday, the night of Eid al-Fitr, the night of Eid al-Adha, the first night of Rajab, and the night of mid-Sha'ban.\"*  \n> (Ibn 'Asakir — classified weak by scholars)\n\nEven though it’s not strong, many scholars encouraged worship on the night before Eid — not as a ritual of Eid itself, but as an act of gratitude, continuation, and consistency.\n\n**In short:**\n- **Did the Prophet (PBUH) pray Qiyam on Eid night specifically as a Sunnah?** Not that we know from authentic reports.\n- **Would he have prayed night prayer on that night?** Very likely, as part of his regular habit.\n- **Should you?** Absolutely, especially to maintain the sweetness and rhythm of Ramadan.\n\nWant a gentle plan for a simple Eid night Qiyam?",

      "content": "That’s a wise and heartfelt question, and your concern for both **carefulness in worship** and **unity with the community** shows real spiritual maturity.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the situation from the **Maliki perspective**, combined with the **ethics of travel and community**:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Fasting on the Day of Eid Is Forbidden**\nAcross all madhahib, including the **Maliki school**, it is *haram* (prohibited) to fast on the **Day of Eid**, whether it's Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha. Even if you are uncertain, the ruling holds.\n\nSo if the masjid you're with is **praying Eid and treating that day as Eid**, **you should not fast**, even if in your own town Eid is announced the next day.\n\n> **Imam Malik** said:  \n> *\"If the people are fasting and break the fast together (on Eid), follow them. And if they fast together, follow them.\"*\n\nThis shows that **unity in action** (like praying Eid and breaking fast with the local community) is given importance, even over individual calculations — especially when you're **traveling**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What About \"Precautionary Fasting\"?**\nYou might be wondering: *\"Should I fast just in case it's not really Eid yet?\"*  \nIn Islam, **precaution** is important — but so is **clarity and not opposing the collective action of the ummah**, especially in things like Eid.\n\nFasting out of \"caution\" **on a day when people are celebrating Eid and praying Eid salah is not valid**, and could actually be sinful — even if you personally believe it *might* still be Ramadan.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What Should You Do?**\n**As a Maliki traveling to a place where Eid is being prayed on the 29th:**\n\n- **Join the Eid prayer with them.**\n- **Do not fast.**\n- Make your intention: *“O Allah, I am following the prayer and celebration of this community out of love for unity and following the Sunna. If today is Ramadan, then accept it from me as obedience. If it’s Eid, then accept my joy and celebration as worship.”*\n\nThat intention preserves sincerity **without breaking the bounds of the Shari’ah**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a short du’a to say that morning, to center your heart in that intention?",
