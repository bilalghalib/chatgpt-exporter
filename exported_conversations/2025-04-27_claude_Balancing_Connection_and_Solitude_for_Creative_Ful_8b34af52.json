            "extracted_content": "se the process here to checkin, here's my first checkin: \ni'm just returning from visitng my parents in michigan and i'm feeling a bit low and sad and i'm startiing work and i feel like I'm back in france to the getting through the days sort of feeling and i'm a bit heavy and i enjoyed the conference yet the failure of the kindness kiwis just makes me feel like i'm going to be a small idiot for the rest of my life doing lame things no one cares about and the world is on fire and baies are being killed in palestine and i don't know if I'm doing right by my parents and worried about the religious consequences - i want to do right by my parents yet there's also a tension of being there and feeling chaos and america seems to be falling apart so i don't want ot move there and i like the village feel of france and josephines kind and stable and gentle family vs my chaotic one yet should that matter - in the quran it says listen to them and be kind and help them as they helped you when you were a baby and only don't listen to them if they tell you to disbelieve yet otherwise listen ot them - so my dad says he wants me to be closer and live with them or closer to them, how? what can i do ? am i just being rebellious, i feel bad and i have work and Nur creative studios is growing slowly and my book is going no where and i'm disorganized and unable to get things together and i'm turning 40 and my body is in pain in a few places and i don't know what to do, can you help?EditGood morning. I hear that you're carrying a lot right now. Your energy feels quite low after returning from visiting your parents, and there's a heaviness in how you're describing your day ahead.\nI can sense several interconnected tensions in what you're sharing:\nFirst, there's the tension between honoring your parents' wishes to be closer to them (which you connect to religious values) versus your life that you've built in France with Josephine's \"kind and stable\" family versus what you describe as your \"chaotic\" one.\nSecond, I'm hearing a tension around your creative work and purpose - feelings about the \"failure\" of your Kindness Kiwis project, your book not progressing, and a sense of disorganization as you approach 40.\nAnd underneath it all, I hear existential questions about whether what you're doing matters in a world where there's so much suffering.\n[System Note: I'm noticing a recurring tension between family obligation/religious values and your built life in France. This appears to be a CAP vs CAP tension - both represent meaningful values to you, not just obligations.]\nWhat you might not see is how these tensions are actually pointing toward something important - they're not just problems to solve, but signals about what truly matters to you. The fact that you care so deeply about honoring your parents while also creating a stable life speaks to your values around both family connection and creating peace.\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore what specific aspects of being with your parents felt meaningful versus difficult?\nConsider a small experiment that might honor both your parents' desire for closeness and your need for your life in France?\nReflect on how these family tensions might connect to the creative frustrations you're experiencing?\nRetryBG2 3EditLet me help you explore both options you've selected.\nSmall Experiment for Family Closeness\nWhat if we designed a small experiment that honors both your parents' desire for closeness and your established life in France? This tension doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing choice.\nConsider these possibilities:\n\nRegular video calls at times when you have good energy (perhaps morning for you when you're fresher, rather than evening when you might feel depleted)\nA scheduled longer visit every few months with clear boundaries\nCreating shared projects or rituals that can happen remotely (cooking the same meal together on video, reading the same book)\nExploring if your parents might visit France for extended periods instead of you always traveling there\n\nThe key is finding a rhythm that feels alive and meaningful rather than obligatory. What small experiment along these lines might feel both honoring to them and sustainable for you?\nConnection Between Family Tensions and Creative Blocks\nThere's an interesting parallel between what you described in your family dynamics and your creative frustrations. In both areas, I notice a tension between:\n\nExternal expectations (parents wanting you closer, perhaps expectations around your book and creative projects)\nYour authentic path and rhythm (the life you've built in France, your natural creative process)\n\nWhat you might not see is how resolving one might help unlock the other. When we feel caught between conflicting loyalties (to parents, to ourselves, to our work), our creative energy often gets fragmented or blocked.\nThe feeling of being \"disorganized and unable to get things together\" might be connected to this larger tension about where your energy and attention should flow. It's hard to build something coherent when part of you feels pulled in another direction.\nWould it be helpful to explore how establishing clearer boundaries and rhythms with your parents might actually free up more coherent energy for your creative work? Or would you prefer to go deeper into one of these areas specifically?RetryBGi feel like i also did nothing with my parents maybe because i thought i needed to be there and do no work because i'm so rarely there, but also they're chaotic and i want to develop a literary life of reading, learning, writing, working out, contributing with knowledge and engaging in food making and community rather than the constant buzz and driving and consumerism i saw in america, yet that's where my parents are... \nvideo isn't the same, i call them once a day, they're getting older and need physical help sometimes and they are having trouble with computers and its.... sad. some of it might just be sadness of the reality of seeing them age. also the fact i've been gone so long. although I had a tough time at home, i'm sad they were who they were and i became who i needed to become to get healthy enough to be the kind of son that wants to help yet now they're far away and everything they taught me is now part of what tells me not to live in america and to consider moving to a muslim country. and they are in america, it reminds me of when they told me music was haram and would listen to fairuz and wouldn't let me play guitar, we're all growing up i guess - and now what?EditI hear the deep sadness and complexity in what you're sharing. There's a poignancy in watching your parents age while simultaneously processing your own history with them - the ways they shaped you that both connect and separate you from them now.\nWhat strikes me is the way you describe wanting \"a literary life of reading, learning, writing, working out, contributing with knowledge and engaging in food making and community\" versus the \"constant buzz and driving and consumerism\" you observed in America. This feels like a core tension that goes beyond just geography.\nThe daily calls seem meaningful but insufficient given their aging and occasional need for physical help. And there's something particularly touching about the example you gave - them telling you music was haram while listening to Fairuz, and now you finding yourself in a similar position of living principles that create distance.\nWhat you might not see is that this tension around \"growing up\" contains wisdom. The very values they instilled in you (faith, principles, seeking meaning) have led you to conclusions that create physical distance. There's a paradoxical honoring happening even in the separation.\nWould you consider exploring:\n\nWhether there are ways to create longer, more meaningful visits (perhaps 2-3 weeks quarterly rather than shorter, more frequent trips) where you can provide physical help while maintaining your own literary life rhythms?\nHow you might find moments of connection around the values you share rather than the differences in how you express them?\nWhether there might be a way to acknowledge the sadness directly with them - not to solve it, but to honor that this natural evolution of family relationships contains loss even when it's necessary?\nRetryBG1 that'd be exhausting, part of my heaviness now might be jet lag\n2 i read quran with my mom over the phone, that's nice, although it doesn't feel super deep - maybe because i generally have a difficult time iwth presence - not sure how to fix that, if eel floaty, lost, i don't know what to do with my business in lebanon, Bloom.pm as my co founder turns and focuses our social enterprise startup accelerator into a tech company focusing on selling the software uwe built to run sclable educational programs - my business nur creative studio, feeling distant from my wife, wanting to leave france yet liking the comfort of being far and quiet and ... alone, i used to be flown around the world to speak and lived on couches for years and made lots of \"friends\" yet always felt on the inside of out and outside of in, and now i'm alone... and i like that, even my wife is asleep and i'm here writing - it's ... nice although also what makes me sad i guess. i think i'm anxious avoidant - i know i am- so i want connection and it's annoying at the same time so i'd rather be alone - and being alone makes me feel badEditI'm sensing a deeper pattern emerging around connection and aloneness in what you're sharing. There's something meaningful in how you describe enjoying the quiet solitude of writing while your wife sleeps, yet simultaneously feeling sad about it.\nThe pattern seems to be what you yourself recognized - an anxious-avoidant attachment style where connection feels both necessary and overwhelming at the same time. I notice this shows up across multiple areas:\n\nWith your parents (wanting to honor them but finding visits exhausting)\nIn your business relationships (the shift with your co-founder)\nWith your wife (feeling distant yet valuing the space)\nIn your past (making \"friends\" while feeling \"on the inside of out and outside of in\")\n\n[System Note: This appears to be a core tension pattern around connection vs. solitude that manifests across multiple relationships. It's not just about geography or logistics but about a fundamental way of being.]\nWhat you might not see is that this tension doesn't necessarily need to be \"fixed\" but rather understood and worked with. The very quality that makes you feel \"floaty\" and \"lost\" might also be what allows you to bridge multiple worlds - between cultures, between religious practice and contemporary life, between creative vision and practical execution.\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore a small experiment around presence that might help with the feeling of being \"floaty\" during connections like reading Quran with your mom?\nConsider how this connection/solitude pattern might be influencing your creative and business decisions?\nReflect on what your ideal rhythm might look like - one that honors both your need for deep connection and meaningful solitude?"

            "extracted_content": "You've shared something rich and complex, so let's gently unpack it step-by-step, integrating your framework clearly, and then directly address the three critical questions you've posed:\n\nBlind spots\n\nLikely trajectories\n\nWhat elements your system prompt is missing\n\n🪞 Step 1: Gentle Reflection & Appreciation\nFirst, I see you clearly:\nYou're tired, emotionally and physically. The idea of long quarterly trips feels exhausting, compounded by jet lag. You appreciate reading Quran with your mom, yet even that doesn't fully alleviate a deeper floaty, anxious, avoidant tension. You feel distant from your wife and torn about France, yet the quiet, solitude, and distance bring comfort even as they intensify your sadness.\n\nYour openness about loneliness, anxiety-avoidance, and this inner tension between connection and solitude shows profound self-awareness, and also the courage to name difficult truths.\n\n🌳 Step 2: Identifying the Core Tensions Clearly (CAP vs CAP)\nYou're in a CAP vs CAP tension:\n\n\nCAP #1: Connection & Service (Parents, Community, Faith)\tCAP #2: Authentic Solitude & Creative Life (Literary, Quiet, Independent)\nWant to honor parents, community, be physically present, serve.\tNeed quiet solitude to nurture creativity, write, reflect.\nDeep religious-cultural values around filial piety and responsibility.\tPersonal value of independence, mental clarity, and authenticity.\nYour framework rightly identifies that these two meaningful impulses are inherently valuable but require thoughtful integration—not simple solutions.\n\n🔦 Step 3: Blind Spot Detection (What You Might Not See)\nHere's what may be invisible to you right now:\n\nSolitude ≠ Disconnection: You see your solitude as isolating or selfish. However, solitude can also enhance the depth of your connections when chosen consciously, allowing you to show up more fully when connecting.\n\nBelief that Presence = Location: You may unconsciously equate “doing right by parents” with physical closeness. Could deeper emotional presence—more intentional and less frequent—offer greater depth than constant proximity?\n\nSense of permanence about your current state: \"I'm almost 40,\" \"I'm anxious-avoidant,\" \"I'll always be alone.\" You might underestimate your ability to gently evolve your emotional patterns and relationships through small, intentional shifts.\n\n🚦 Step 4: Likely Trajectories (Your Future Scenarios)\nGiven your situation, these are realistic pathways, including both positive and negative outcomes:\n\n🌧️ Difficult Scenario (If tensions remain unaddressed):\nPersistent anxiety grows, relationships feel distant and fragmented.\n\nFeeling trapped between worlds, draining creativity and emotional energy.\n\nContinued dissatisfaction with connection strategies (short visits, daily calls without deep presence).\n\n🌤️ Moderate Scenario (Likely if partially addressed):\nYou find pragmatic but imperfect solutions (e.g., regular short visits with conscious rituals, somewhat helpful but still emotionally mixed).\n\nOccasional resentment or exhaustion from \"in-between\" state remains.\n\nCreative work happens intermittently; periods of flow are fragile, interspersed with disruptions.\n\n🌈 Best Scenario (With conscious integration and self-awareness):\nYou establish clear, loving boundaries and rhythms with parents (shorter, intentional visits; meaningful rituals).\n\nYou actively cultivate deep presence practices (mindfulness, intentional solitude) which gradually improve your emotional availability when connecting with loved ones.\n\nYou allow your creative solitude to blossom, becoming an authentic voice with meaningful contributions, including writing, community engagement, and family relationships.\n\nYou gradually build a community around shared values (literary, faith-based, creative).\n\n📝 Step 5: Elements Missing from your Aliveness Advisor System Prompt\nYour current \"Aliveness Advisor\" system prompt is excellent, detailed, and nuanced. But given your situation, it misses some critical elements:\n\n\nMissing Element\tWhy it Matters\tHow to Include\nAcknowledgement of Loss and Grief\tYour current tension includes deep grief (parents aging, loss of youthful freedom, etc.). Tensions aren't just opportunities; they often require grieving and gentle acknowledgment.\tExplicitly add guidance on naming and holding grief as a legitimate part of working through tensions.\nRole of Physicality (e.g., body signals)\tYour physical exhaustion and jet lag significantly shape emotional and relational capacity. Body signals aren't clearly integrated yet.\tExplicitly instruct advisors to ask: \"What is your body telling you?\" in every tension or check-in.\nSolitude vs. Loneliness nuance\tYour tension around solitude (valuable and painful) isn't explicitly captured yet.\tAdd explicit recognition of solitude as a CAP in itself: \"Moments when solitude nurtures authentic expression.\"\nIntegration Practices\tYour framework currently suggests experiments but might under-emphasize structured rituals or integration practices that bridge CAPs.\tExplicitly define a category: \"Integration Rituals\"—regular activities that bridge seemingly opposing CAPs.\nExample YAML (for integrating above elements):\n\nyaml\nCopy\nEdit\ncap:\n  description: \"Authentic Solitude\"\n  attention_policies:\n    - \"MOMENTS when solitude nurtures authenticity\"\n    - \"SPACES where quiet fuels creativity without loneliness\"\n  integration_rituals:\n    - \"Daily intentional quiet hour (reading, journaling)\"\n    - \"Brief mindful presence practice before parental interactions\"\n🎯 Step 6: Gentle, Practical Invitations for Today\nGiven all this, consider one of these manageable invitations today:\n\nIntegration Ritual: Spend just 15 minutes today in intentional solitude (reading or journaling), followed by a brief moment of reflection before your call with your parents, noting how your emotional presence shifts.\n\nSmall Experiment in Presence: In your next Quran reading call, practice mindful breathing to deepen your presence, gently noticing if it changes the quality of your connection.\n\nWrite Briefly About Grief: Take 10 minutes to write privately about the sadness and loss you've expressed. Don’t try to solve it, just hold space for it as a legitimate feeling.\n\n💾 Step 7: Updated Context (Your JSON/YAML for Integration)\nyaml\nCopy\nEdit\ncontext:\n  meaning_sources:\n    - title: \"Authentic Solitude\"\n      discovered: \"2025-04-28\"\n      description: \"Quiet solitude fosters deeper creative and relational presence.\"\n      attention_policies:\n        - \"MOMENTS when solitude feels nourishing, not isolating\"\n      integration_rituals:\n        - \"Brief solitude practice before calls with family\"\n        - \"Regular protected quiet time daily\"\n      ground_truth:\n        quotes: [\"It’s nice to sit alone, even if it feels sad.\"]\n        stories: [\"Early morning writing alone\"]\n  \n  tensions:\n    active:\n      - type: \"CAP vs CAP\"\n        description: \"Family Connection vs. Authentic Solitude\"\n        emotions:\n          - \"sadness\"\n          - \"guilt\"\n          - \"longing\"\n        attention_policies:\n          - \"SPACES where solitude and connection conflict\"\n        from:\n          current_state:\n            emotions: [\"lonely\", \"anxious\", \"avoidant\"]\n        to:\n          potential_values:\n            - \"Integration rituals balancing solitude and family presence\"\n          description: \"Building intentional moments of solitude and family interaction to gradually harmonize these CAPs\"\n  \n  patterns:\n    active:\n      - description: \"Anxious Avoidance around Connection\"\n        shows_up_as: [\"desiring connection yet avoiding it\", \"feeling distant even when connected\"]\n        potential_shift: \"Explore mindful presence practices to gradually ease anxiety in connection\"\n  \n  context_metadata:\n    last_updated: \"2025-04-28T09:45:00Z\"\n    version: \"1.0.2\"\n🗝️ Gentle Closing Reflection\n\"The tensions you feel aren't proof of failure.

I'll maintain a thoughtful, reflective tone while offering practical experiments and insights that honor both the solitude and connection aspects of their life.\n\nI appreciate you wanting to explore all three areas. Let's weave them together while honoring that connection-solitude tension that runs through your sharing.\n\n## A Small Presence Experiment During Quran Reading\n\nThe \"floaty\" feeling you describe during connections like reading Quran with your mom might be addressed through a simple anchoring practice:\n\nTry this: Before your next call, take 3-5 minutes of intentional solitude first - perhaps sitting quietly with your physical Quran. Place one hand on it, close your eyes, and take several deep breaths while noticing sensations in your body. When you begin the call, keep this physical connection - touching your Quran or even placing a hand on your chest or abdomen.\n\nThe key insight: Your body can serve as an anchor for presence. The floaty feeling often comes when we disconnect from physical sensations. This small experiment uses your solitude (a few minutes of preparation) to actually enhance connection.\n\n## How This Pattern Influences Your Creative/Business Decisions\n\nWhat struck me is how you described your business ventures and creative projects alongside your relationship patterns. There's a fascinating parallel:\n\nYour anxious-avoidant pattern seems to manifest as:\n- Starting projects with enthusiasm but feeling disconnected later\n- Building business relationships that shift unexpectedly\n- Wanting to create but feeling \"disorganized\" when it comes to execution\n\nThis might be why your book feels \"going nowhere\" - the same pattern of connection and withdrawal might be playing out in your relationship with your own creative work.\n\nWhat you might not see: The rhythm that works for your relationships might also work for your creative process. Perhaps your writing needs both deep immersion AND purposeful distance - not as a problem, but as your natural creative cycle.\n\n## Your Ideal Connection-Solitude Rhythm\n\nBased on everything you've shared, your ideal rhythm might look something like:\n\n1. **Protected Morning Solitude** - A daily period (perhaps 1-2 hours) of reading, writing, or reflection that's non-negotiable\n2. **Intentional Connection Windows** - Scheduled times for calls with parents, work meetings, time with your wife where you're fully present\n3. **Transition Rituals** - Brief practices (2-3 minutes) that help you move between solitude and connection more gracefully\n4. **Weekly Integration** - Perhaps one day a week where you deliberately bring together solitude and connection (like writing while in a café, or reading/discussing something meaningful with your wife)\n\nThe key insight isn't about finding the \"perfect balance\" but rather recognizing that both solitude and connection are essential CAPs for you - they're both meaningful ways of being that need integration, not elimination.\n\nWould you like to select one of these areas to explore further, or perhaps try a small experiment in one of these directions this week?",

Perhaps your writing needs both deep immersion AND purposeful distance - not as a problem, but as your natural creative cycle.\n\n## Your Ideal Connection-Solitude Rhythm\n\nBased on everything you've shared, your ideal rhythm might look something like:\n\n1. **Protected Morning Solitude** - A daily period (perhaps 1-2 hours) of reading, writing, or reflection that's non-negotiable\n2. **Intentional Connection Windows** - Scheduled times for calls with parents, work meetings, time with your wife where you're fully present\n3. **Transition Rituals** - Brief practices (2-3 minutes) that help you move between solitude and connection more gracefully\n4. **Weekly Integration** - Perhaps one day a week where you deliberately bring together solitude and connection (like writing while in a café, or reading/discussing something meaningful with your wife)\n\nThe key insight isn't about finding the \"perfect balance\" but rather recognizing that both solitude and connection are essential CAPs for you - they're both meaningful ways of being that need integration, not elimination.\n\nWould you like to select one of these areas to explore further, or perhaps try a small experiment in one of these directions this week?",

Let me search for information on these frameworks first.\n\nI'll search for information on the Broaden and Build theory, which I believe is from positive psychology.\n\nI'll search for information on these frameworks to help identify new \"toppings\" for your Aliveness Advisor system.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nNow let me search for information on ACT Therapy to understand that framework:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nNow let me search for \"come alive\" framework to complete my research:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nNow let me search specifically for the Aliveness framework that you're referring to:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nBased on my research into the Broaden and Build theory, ACT therapy framework, and what I can find about the \"Aliveness\" framework, I'll analyze their connections and develop new \"toppings\" for your Aliveness Advisor system.\n\n# Understanding the Frameworks\n\n## Broaden and Build Theory\nThis theory, developed by Barbara Fredrickson, explains how positive emotions:\n- Broaden our attention, thinking, and behavioral repertoires\n- Build enduring personal resources over time (physical, intellectual, social, psychological)\n- Create \"upward spirals\" of wellbeing rather than narrow fight-or-flight responses that come with negative emotions\n\n## ACT Therapy Framework\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy focuses on:\n- Psychological flexibility through six core processes: acceptance, cognitive defusion, being present, self-as-context, values, and committed action\n- Accepting difficult thoughts and feelings while committing to actions aligned with personal values\n- Moving beyond mere symptom reduction to living a meaningful, values-driven life\n\n## Aliveness Framework\nYour Aliveness Advisor framework distinguishes between:\n- Constitutive Actions (CAPs): Actions done for their own sake, reflecting deeper meaning/values\n- Instrumental Actions (IAPs): Actions done primarily to achieve another end\n- Tensions as growth guides: CAP vs. CAP and IAP to CAP\n- Aliveness as a value \"honors sensation and exhilaration and celebrates all the experiences that make our human existence feel alive\"\n\n# Integration Points Between Frameworks\n\n1. **Values-Driven Action**: Both ACT and Aliveness emphasize identifying and acting according to personal values rather than simply avoiding discomfort.\n\n2. **Accepting Tensions**: Both ACT and Aliveness recognize that difficult emotions contain important information rather than obstacles to be eliminated.\n\n3. **Broadening Attention**: Broaden-and-Build's expansion of awareness aligns with the Aliveness framework's attention policies (\"MOMENTS\" and \"SPACES\").\n\n4. **Building Resources**: The resources accumulated through positive emotions (Broaden-and-Build) can be seen as similar to discovering CAPs in the Aliveness framework.\n\n5. **Present-Moment Awareness**: ACT's \"being present\" process connects with the Aliveness framework's focus on moments and spaces of engagement.\n\n# 15 Potential New \"Toppings\" for Responses\n\n## Awareness-Based Toppings\n\n1. **Sensory Activation Prompt** - Brief guided exercise to notice sensations in the body to anchor awareness and reduce \"floaty\" feelings\n   \n2. **Tension Mapping** - Visual representation of where tensions are felt physically and how they shift during conversation\n\n3. **Value-Moment Spotlighting** - Highlighting tiny moments when values are already being expressed, even if subtle\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition Timeline** - Noting when patterns first developed and how they've evolved\n\n5. **Bifocal Vision** - Simultaneously acknowledging both what's difficult AND what's alive in any situation\n\n## Action-Based Toppings\n\n6. **Micro-Experiments** - Tiny, low-stakes attempts to test new behaviors aligned with values (30-60 seconds)\n\n7. **Immediate Applicability Check** - \"What's one small way you could apply this insight in the next 24 hours?\"\n\n8. **CAP Stretching** - Identifying how a current CAP could expand slightly beyond its current expression\n\n9. **Attention Shifting Practice** - Specific technique to redirect attention from IAP-focus to CAP-focus\n\n10. **Values-Action Bridge** - Explicit connection between abstract value and concrete next action\n\n## Integration-Based Toppings\n\n11. **Broaden-and-Build Spirals** - Identifying potential upward spirals that could be initiated by small changes\n\n12. **Defusion Reframe** - Helping separate from thought patterns through linguistic shifts (\"I notice I'm having the thought that...\" rather than \"I am...\")\n\n13. **Psychological Space Creation** - Techniques for creating inner psychological space around difficult experiences\n\n14. **Metaphor Generation** - Collaborative creation of meaningful metaphors that capture the essence of the person's experience\n\n15. **Between-Session Integration** -

both being meaningful to you - the Bifocal Vision topping seems most relevant for our current conversation.\n\n## Applying Bifocal Vision to Your Situation:\n\n**What it is**: Bifocal Vision means holding two seemingly contradictory truths simultaneously - acknowledging both what's difficult AND what's alive/meaningful in any given situation.\n\n**How it works in your case**:\n- You value deep connection with your parents AND you value your authentic solitary creative life\n- You feel guilty about distance AND you recognize that distance enables important aspects of your life\n- You miss close presence AND you find meaningful ways to connect across distance\n\n**The shift**: Rather than seeing this as a problem to solve (either/or), Bifocal Vision invites you to see it as a rich complexity to navigate (both/and).\n\nWhat if both your need for meaningful solitude AND your desire for family connection are valid, important CAPs? What if the tension between them isn't a problem but a creative edge where something new wants to emerge?\n\nWould you be willing to explore this bifocal perspective on your situation - seeing both the challenge AND the aliveness in this tension between connection and solitude?",

Positive emotions help build long-term personal resources, improving resilience & wellbeing. Cultivating positivity can foster personal growth & enhance life satisfaction through increased flexibility & resourcefulness. Throughout history, psychologists have typically focused on negative human states. This focus ultimately influenced the way psychologists studied the experience of emotions; for years, investigations typically targeted negative emotions like anxiety, anger, and depression. Consequently, one critical question remained unanswered: What good are positive emotions? This question was the title of a groundbreaking article by Barbara Fredrickson, published in the Review of General Psychology in 1998. In the article, Fredrickson forwards a novel theory of positive emotions, arguing that they serve to broaden individuals’ momentary thought-action rep\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore some key differences between positive and negative emotions, outline the core principles of Fredrickson’s Broaden-and-Build Theory, and point you toward additional resources to learn more about your emotions.

These science-based exercises will not only enhance your ability to understand and work with your emotions but will also give you the tools to foster the emotional intelligence of your clients, students, or employees. ... Everyone wants to feel positive emotions like happiness, excitement, and love. Despite this, research on how to cultivate such emotions has only recently begun to flourish with the rise of movements like positive psychology. So why have scholars chosen to neglect such an important dimension of the human experience?\n\nFollowing Fredrickson’s development of the Broaden-and-Build Theory, many studies emerged across several sub-disciplines of psychology, serving to test the theory’s key propositions. These studies also provide initial evidence for some of the practical benefits of experiencing positive emotions (see Fredrickson, 2004 for a review). First, experimental findings have repeatedly demonstrated that those experiencing positive emotions exhibit thought patterns consistent with those put forward by the Broaden-and-Build Theory. Namely, people tend to think more unusually, flexibly, and creatively, while also being more open-minded (see Isen, 2000 for a review). Findings have also shown that positive emotions facilitate an expanded locus of attention (Basso, Schefft, Ris, & Dember, 1996; Derryberry & Tucker, 1994). Likewise, those experiencing positive emotions appear to be better able to focus on a big picture as opposed to small details compared to those primed to experience negative or neutr\n\nFor a useful summary of these and other findings on Broaden-and-Build Theory, take a look at this talk by Barbara Fredrickson herself, who discusses the importance of positive emotions for strengthening our awareness of happenings around us and tuning into others’ needs. Barbara Fredrickson: positive emotions open our mind - Greater Good Science Center · As research on positive psychology grows, managers are increasingly exploring the role of positive states in contributing to a thriving workplace. Positive emotions have an important role to play in such a work environment. In an interview with Gallup, Fredrickson offered several pieces of advice for helping managers conduct business in such a way that cultivates and leverages the benefits of positive emotions (Robinson, 2003): Look for ways to enable employees to connect with others on a human level at work.",

The broaden-and-build theory describes the form and function of a subset of positive emotions, including joy, interest, contentment and love. A key proposition is that these positive emotions broaden an individual's momentary thought-action repertoire: joy sparks the urge to play, interest sparks the urge to explore, contentment sparks the urge to savour and integrate, and love sparks a recurring cycle of each of these urges within safe, close relationships. The broadened mindsets arising from these positive emotions are contrasted to the narrowed mindsets sparked by many negative emotions (i.e. specific action tendencies, such as attack or flee).\n\nA second key proposition concerns the consequences of these broadened mindsets: by broadening an individual's momentary thought-action repertoire--whether through play, exploration or similar activities--positive emotions promote discovery of novel and creative actions, ideas and social bonds, which in turn build that individual's personal resources; ranging from physical and intellectual resources, to social and psychological resources. Importantly, these resources function as reserves that can be drawn on later to improve the odds of successful coping and survival. This chapter reviews the latest empirical evidence supporting the broaden-and-build theory and draws out implications the theory holds for optimizing health and well-being.

This is in comparison to negative emotions which narrow our attention and behaviors to the threat in our environment so that we can behave in such a way as to avoid or reduce the threat. In general, Fredrickson means that positive emotions help us to become more aware of our surroundings and to take in more of our external environment. In addition, she states that during this broadening period our possible behaviors are “flexible” (Fredrickson & Cohn, 200, p. 782). By flexible, she means that there are many possible approach behaviors we could exhibit for a positive emotion. Again, in comparison to negative emotions which typically result in one behavior – attack, avoidance, etc. Table 25 displays some examples of the cognitive and behavioral responses for specific positive emotions.\n\nFigure 34 graphically displays the broaden-and-build theory based on the study we just reviewed. Make a note that broadening thoughts/behaviors and buidling personal resources are both mediators of the relationship between increasing positive emotions and increasing satisfaction/reducing depression.

These personal resources, in turn, have a direct impact on improved health, life satisfaction, and depressive symptoms. So, Fredrickson views broadening and building as adaptive processes that improve survival and well-being. The broaden hypothesis states: “Positive emotions broaden the scopes of attention, cognition, and action, widening the array of percepts, thoughts, and actions presently in mind” (Fredrickson & Branigan, 2005 p. 315) The narrow hypothesis states that negative emotions narrow attention to focus on the threat in the environment. Studies have confirmed the broaden hypothesis by demonstrating that positive emotions cause greater awareness of the visual field and by showing that positive emotions cause people to process information at a more global (vs.\n\nFredrickson and Branigan (2005) tested the broaden hypothesis in two experiments. In experiment 1, participants were randomly assigned to watch one of five watched film clips to elicit an emotion. Two clips elicited a positive emotion (amusement, contentment/serenity), two clips a negative emotion (anger/disgust, anxiety/fear), and one clip a neutral state. After watching their assigned film clip, participants completed the visual processing task. After completing the experimental tasks, participants reported their subjective feelings. In the Experiment 1 visual processing task, participants were shown a standard image and two possible response options – A or B (see Figure 24). In the example below, the standard image is three square elements that together make up a triangle. Participants were asked if the standard image was more similar to the A or B figure.",

Later theorists give more weight to the importance of psychological narrowing in addition to broadening when building personal resources. Narrowing is typically associated with negative ...\n\nThe broaden-and-build theory in positive psychology suggests that positive emotions (such as happiness, and perhaps interest and anticipation) broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this broadened behavioral repertoire builds useful skills and psychological resources. The theory was developed by Barbara Fredrickson around 1998. Positive emotions have no immediate survival value, because they take one's mind off immediate needs and stressors. However, the skills that broadened behavior strengthens over time enhance survival. For example, curiosity about a landscape becomes navigational knowledge, pleasant interactions with a stranger become a supportive friendship, and aimless physical play becomes valuable exercise. According to Fredrickson, the resources gained through positive emotions outlive the emotions from which they were acquired.\n\nFredrickson's original broaden-and-build theory focused solely how positive emotions broaden one's attention. Later theorists give more weight to the importance of psychological narrowing in addition to broadening when building personal resources. Narrowing is typically associated with negative emotions, but their adverse effects can be counterbalanced by positive emotions. Therefore, the beneficial aspects of narrowing can be experienced without harmful effects if both positive and negative emotions are experienced in proportion. The creative process is often studied in relation to this, as it involves a widening of the mind, building of personal resources, and both sides of the emotional spectrum. A 2005 study found that naturally creative people experience wider mood swings, spending a lot of time in both positive and negative emotional spaces depending on what they are trying to accomplish at the time.\n\nThe whole-brain hypothesis of creativity also promotes the importance of psychological narrowing. The theory states that the defocused stage uses a greater portion of the right side of the brain, whereas the focused process uses more of the left side. Creativity necessitates communication between the two hemispheres to form coherent theories and develop personal skills. Fredrickson has conducted randomized controlled lab studies in which participants are randomly assigned to watch films that induce positive emotions such as amusement and contentment, negative emotions such as fear and sadness, or no emotions. Participants who experience positive emotions show heightened creativity, inventiveness, and \"big picture\" perceptual focus. Longitudinal intervention studies show that positive emotions help develop long-term resources such as psychological resilience and flourishing.\n\nThe hedonic treadmill theory argues that positive emotions are always temporary, and that people must constantly search for new ways to experience positivity as old techniques become ineffective. The study was performed over a nine-week period, which let researchers see that loving-kindness meditation did not develop positive emotions immediately, but over time. The slow progression provided evidence that the positive effects built resources that allowed for more positive experience in the future. A broaden-and-build approach to positive emotions sidesteps this: positive emotions do not directly contribute to life satisfaction (and as a result lose their effectiveness over time), but instead build beneficial psychological resources which can be drawn upon for extended periods of time. A 2004 study found that writing about intensely positive experiences improved subjects' happiness and health.\n\nThat is, they do not compel individuals to initiate some behavior or act immediately. These positive emotions, consistent with broaden and build theory, broaden attention. In this state, individuals attend to many objects or to abstract concepts. In contrast, other positive emotions, like excitement, are high in approach motivation. These emotions compel individuals to initiate some act. These positive emotions, contrary to broaden and build theory, narrow attention. Presumably, as individuals approach an object, they have evolved to disregard irrelevant distracters. Prior studies by the researchers found similar results: participants who watched films about desirable desserts faced narrowed attention, and a 2009 neurophysiological study found that activation of the left prefrontal cortex is associated with both approach motivation and psychological narrowing.",

                "text": "The broaden-and-build theory posits that experiences of positive emotions broaden people&#x27;s momentary thought-action repertoires, which in turn serves to build their enduring personal resources, ranging from physical and intellectual resources to social and psychological resources.\n\nTo advance understanding in this area, I formulated a new theoretical model to better capture the unique effects of positive emotions. I call this the broaden-and-buiid theory of posiiive emotions (Fredrickson, 1998). This theory states that certain discrete positive emotions—including joy, interest, contentment, pride, and love—although phenomenologically distinct, all share the ability to broaden people's momentary thought-action repertoires and build their enduring personal resources, ranging from physical and intellectual resources to social and psychological resources. I contrast this new theory (o traditional models based on specific action tendencies. Specific action tendencies work well to describe the function of negative emotions and should be retained for models of this subset of emotions. Without loss of theoretical nuance, a specific action tendency can be redescribed as the outcome of a psychological process that narrows a person's momentary thought–action repertoire by c\n\nPlay also builds enduring social resources: Social play, with its shared amusement, excitement, and smiles, builds lasting social bonds and attachments (Aron, Norman, Aron, McKenna, & Heyman, 2000; Lee, 1983; Simons, McCluskey-Fawcett, & Papini, 1986), which can become the locus of subsequent social support. Childhood play also builds enduring intellectual resources by increasing levels of creativity (Sherrod & Singer, 1989), creating theory of mind (Leslie, 1987), and fueling brain development (Panksepp, 1998). Other positive emotions, like interest, contentment, pride, and love, similarly augment individuals' personal resources, ranging from physical and social resources to intellectual and psychological resources. (Fuller descriptions of the broaden-and-build theory are available in Fredrickson, 1998, 2000a, in press; Fredrickson & Branigan, 2001.) It is important to note that the personal resources accrued during states of positive emotions are conceptualized as durable.\n\nIn doing so, the theory provides a new perspective on the evolved adaptive significance of positive emotions. Human ancestors who succumbed to the urges sparked by positive emotions to play, explore, and so on would have by consequence accrued more personal resources. When these same ancestors later faced inevitable threats to life and limb, their greater personal resources would have translated into greater odds of survival, and, in turn, greater odds of living long enough to reproduce. To the extent, then, that the capacity to experience positive emotions is genetically encoded, this capacity, through the process of natural selection, would have become part of universal human nature. Empirical support for several key propositions of the broaden-and-build theory can be drawn from multiple sub-disciplines within psychology, ranging from cognition and intrinsic motivation to attachment styles and animal behavior (for a review, see Fredrickson, 1998).\n\nAs predicted by the theoretical definition of psychological resilience, more resilient participants exhibited significantly faster returns to baseline levels of cardiovascular activation following the speech task. Moreover, as predicted by the broaden-and-build theory, this difference in time needed to achieve cardiovascular recovery was mediated by differences in positive emotions (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2000). These data suggest that positive emotions may fuel psychological resilience. In effect, then, resilient individuals may be—wittingly or unwittingly—expert users of the undoing effect of positive emotions. Again, questions arise from this initial study: Do resilient individuals intentionally recruit positive emotions to cope? If so, how do they do it? Folkman and Moskowitz (2000) identified three kinds of coping that can generate positive affect during stressful circumstances: positive reappraisal, problem-focused coping, and the infusion of ordinary events with positive meaning.",

Fredrickson, Ph.D. earned her undergraduate degree from Carleton College and her doctorate from Stanford University. Fredrickson is a leading scholar within social psychology, affective science (the study of emotion), and positive psychology. She has received more than 16 consecutive years of research funding from the National Institutes of Health, and her research and teaching have been recognized with numerous honors. Fredrickson’s work on the study of positive emotions, like love, began in 1998. Her foundational research led to her to develop a theory on positive emotions called Broaden and Build Theory. The substance of this theory lies in the notion that positive emotions play an essential role in our survival. Positive emotions, like love, joy, and gratitude, promote new and creative actions, ideas, and social bonds. When people experience positive emotions, their minds broaden and they open up to new possibilities and ideas.\n\nFredrickson, B. L. (2001).

This theory was one of the earliest attempts to bring the conglomerate of positive feelings, openness to the environment, positive social interactions, positive ideas about the future, optimistic thinking, resilience to negative emotions etc. into a systematic theoretical concept beyond “simple” well-being. At its core, it describes four components that make up the functions of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 1998). (1) Positive emotions cheer up our mind and thus broaden our attention toward our environment and possible actions we could take. This cheered-up and (2) broadened mind (broadening component) helps us to (3) build resources over time, just like social connections, optimism, or resilience.\n\nUnderstanding the influence of emotion on both time and money: applying the broaden and build theory.

Clients identify the ways they have tried to get rid of or avoid unwanted private experiences. They are then asked to assess for each method: “Did this reduce your symptoms in the long term? What did this strategy cost you in terms of time, energy, health, vitality, relationships? Did it bring you closer to the life you want?” Michael was a 35-year-old accountant who suffered from significant social anxiety, and had seen a number of therapists to no avail.

Clients learn to stop avoiding, denying, and struggling with their inner emotions and, instead, accept that these deeper feelings are appropriate responses to certain situations that should not prevent them from moving forward in their lives. With this understanding, clients begin to accept their hardships and commit to making necessary changes in their behavior, regardless of what is going on in their lives and how they feel about it. ACT was developed in the 1980s by psychologist Steven C. Hayes, a professor at the University of Nevada. The ideas that coalesced into ACT emerged from Hayes’s own experience, particularly his history of panic attacks. Eventually, he vowed that he would no longer run from himself—he would accept himself and his experiences.\n\nYou can then decide if a problem requires immediate action and change or if it can, or must, be accepted for what it is while you learn to make behavioral changes that can modify the situation. You may look at what hasn’t worked for you in the past, and the therapist can help you stop repeating thought patterns and behaviors that can cause you more problems in the long run. Once you have faced and accepted your current challenges, you can make a commitment to stop fighting your past and your emotions and, instead, start practicing more confident and optimistic behavior, based on your personal values and goals. ACT aims to develop and expand psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility encompasses emotional openness and the ability to adapt your thoughts and behaviors to better align with your values and goals. The six core processes that promote psychological flexibility are: ...\n\nThe theory behind ACT is that it is counterproductive to try to control painful emotions or psychological experiences; suppression of these feelings ultimately leads to more distress. ACT adopts the view that there are valid alternatives to trying to change the way you think, and these include mindful behavior, attention to personal values, and commitment to action. By taking steps to change their behavior while, at the same time, learning to accept their psychological experiences, clients can eventually change their attitudes and emotional states. Look for a licensed, experienced therapist, social worker, professional counselor or other mental health professional with additional training in ACT. There is no special certification for ACT practitioners. Skills are acquired through peer counseling, workshops, and other training programs. In addition to these credentials, it is important to find a therapist with whom you feel comfortable.\n\nForman EM, Herbert JD, Moitra E, Yeomans PD, Geller PA.

Exercises may include thinking about things in a new way, reevaluating past situations or exploring your values, among others. The six core processes of acceptance and commitment therapy are: Acceptance: You accept that you’ll have a range of thoughts or emotions that can be positive, negative or anything in between. Cognitive defusion: You detach or distance yourself from negative thoughts and beliefs. You see a thought as a passing event instead of a truth that drives your actions. Being present: Your focus is on how you feel in the moment. You minimize planning for future “what ifs” so you can see more of what’s happening around you. Self-as-context: You see yourself as a whole person with an identity. You aren’t solely defined by your experiences, thoughts or feelings.\n\nCommitting to making changes in your life that match your values. It’s normal to have negative thoughts and emotions. Having them doesn’t make you a bad person. Sometimes, your brain is wired to spend more time brooding in negative thoughts than moving on from them. This can affect your mental and physical health, work or school performance, and social life. Mental health professionals can help you rewire your brain so negative thoughts don’t take over. Imagine you’re scheduled to give a presentation at work. You might think, “I’m nervous, and I’m going to mess it up.” Feeling nervous before a presentation is a realistic expectation to have. ACT can help you reframe your thoughts to: “I know I feel nervous, and that’s OK. I’m going to practice giving my presentation before the meeting so I feel more confident.” · During acceptance and commitment therapy, you learn to recognize that your emotions are part of the human experience.",

Psychological inflexibility is the opposite: fusion, ...\n\nPromoting health behavior change presents an important challenge to theory and research in the field of health psychology. In this paper, we introduce a context-driven approach, the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) model which is built on Relational Frame Theory. The ACT-based intervention aims to promote individuals’ new health behavior patterns through the improvement of the key construct of psychological flexibility, which is defined as the ability to contact the present moment more fully with acceptance and mindfulness as a conscious human being. Building on the psychological flexibility model, implemented through the six core ACT processes, individuals improve maintenance of long term health behavior change through committed acts in service of chosen values while acknowledging and accepting the existence of contrary thoughts, rules, and emotions as part of themselves but not determinant of their behaviors.\n\nFor example, the effectiveness of a randomized brief physical-activity-focused ACT-based intervention produced significant increases in individuals’ levels of physical activity. The skills taught in this intervention were mindfulness, values clarification, and willingness to experience distress via face-to-face intervention (Butryn et al., 2011) or via DVD (Moffitt and Mohr, 2015). In smoking cessation treatment, the effectiveness of ACT as compared to other interventions (e.g., nicotine replacement treatment, functional analytic psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy) has been demonstrated in a series of RCTs (e.g., Gifford et al., 2004, 2011; Hernández-López et al., 2009; Bricker et al., 2014, 2017). ACT has been recommended as an acceptance-based self-regulation framework for weight management (Lillis and Kendra, 2014), with awareness of decision-making thoughts and commitment to chosen values viewed as two key components (Forman and Butryn, 2015).\n\nPsychological flexibility model is a behavior change model based on RFT and its applied extensions that is used for understanding how rule-following behavior can affect behavior (Hayes et al., 1999; Gross and Fox, 2009) based on how people interact with their own language processes (Bond et al., 2006). According to the psychological flexibility model, which underpins ACT, psychological flexibility consists of six primary components: defusion, acceptance, self as context, contact with the present moment, values, and committed action. Psychological inflexibility is the opposite: fusion, experiential avoidance, the conceptualized self, rigid attention to the past or future, unclear values, and inaction, impulsivity, or persistence avoidance. Psychological flexibility promotes behavior that aligns with the individual’s values rather than allowing thoughts about events to dominate regardless of their usefulness.\n\nTraditionally, health behavior change interventions target the social cognitive and belief-based variables to increase individuals’ intention (i.e., a person’s motivation toward the target behavior in terms of direction and intensity) and self-efficacy (i.e., one’s confidence in being capable of performing a novel behavior) in the hopes of maintaining the health behavior change (Schwarzer, 2008). While these approaches can be helpful to a degree, the magnitude of health problems and the maintenance of health behavior change suggests that alternatives are needed (Kwasnicka et al., 2016). One important approach that gains more and more momentum is to apply the context-driven approach to understand and predict health behavior change (Hayes, 2004). In the current mini review, the authors aim to introduce the context-driven approach of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes et al., 1999) along with the description of how and why Relational Frame Theory (RFT; Hayes et al., 2001) and p",

Learn how ACT therapy works.\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a type of psychotherapy that emphasizes acceptance to deal with negative thoughts, feelings, symptoms, or circumstances. ACT therapy encourages increased commitment to healthy, constructive activities that uphold your values or goals.  · \"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave cognitive-behavioral therapy approach that focuses on helping people accept difficult thoughts, feelings, sensations, and internal experiences while guiding them to commit to values-based actions,\" explains Avigail Lev, PsyD, a licensed clinical psychologist who specializes in acceptance-based treatments. ACT therapists operate under a theory that suggests that increasing acceptance can lead to increased psychological flexibility. This approach carries a host of benefits, and it may help people stop habitually avoiding specific thoughts or emotional experiences, which can lead to further problems.\n\nUnlike cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the goal of ACT is not to reduce the frequency or severity of unpleasant internal experiences like upsetting cognitive distortions, emotions, or urges. Rather, the goal is to reduce your struggle to control or eliminate these experiences while increasing your involvement in meaningful life activities (i.e., those that are consistent with your personal values). \"ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) utilizes six processes to help people create psychological flexibility, meaning the freedom to choose our actions regardless of our internal experiences, \" Lev explains. She describes the six processes of ACT therapy as: These are the areas of your life that are important enough to you to motivate action. It is about recognizing what you want to be about and stand for. This process involves changing your behavior based on principles covered in therapy.\n\nYour therapist may assign homework to practice between sessions, such as mindfulness, cognitive, or values clarification exercises.

Research has shown that ACT can improve symptoms for people with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and it may also be a particularly good fit for older adults with the condition. The Best Online Therapy for Anxiety, Tried and Tested · One core benefit of ACT is the impact it has on psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility is the ability to embrace your thoughts and feelings when they are useful and to set them aside when they are not.\n\nExercises that can help with this include imagining your thoughts on clouds and then watching them drift away, making connections between thoughts and values, or singing thoughts in silly voices. This means allowing your inner thoughts and feelings to occur without trying to change or ignore them. Acceptance is an active process. Specific skills that are used in ACT therapy to help clients learn acceptance include: ... Instead of trying to change your thoughts, Lev says, the goal is to create a non-judgemental relationship with them. ACT therapy encourages you to stay mindful of your surroundings and learn to shift your attention away from internal thoughts and feelings. This involves a conscious and deliberate effort to focus on the world around you in the moment. Staying engaged with the present can help you build greater awareness and prevent past experiences, memories, and conditioning from negatively affecting your interactions in the here and now.",

Powerful alternatives are available in the ACT model through the skills of acceptance, cognitive distancing, perspective-taking, mindfulness, values, and committed action. Research is increasingly showing that these same ACT processes can help us understand and change a diverse set of problems and symptoms, including the sequelae of medical illnesses. ACT is rooted in a philosophy of science that highlights the role of contextual factors in influencing behavior—a perspective that is gaining appreciation in the medical community.\n\nUnderstanding the specific mechanisms or processes that mediate clinical improvement in psychiatric symptoms, functional status, and/or quality of life allows for intervention optimization by refining and emphasizing the components responsible for change, and also eliminating nonactive ingredients [61]. Fundamental to the scientific basis of ACT is an emphasis on elucidating the processes that predict human behavior and examining whether influencing those processes leads to changes. In the ACT model, psychological inflexibility is posited to underlie diverse problems, including mental health, behavioral, and comorbid complications; and there has been substantial research examining the role of psychological inflexibility in difficulties across patient populations [62, 63]. Thus, ACT interventions aim to foster increased psychological flexibility (i.e., greater ability to persist in or change behavior when in service of valued ends in a particular context) by cultivating the 6 core ACT p\n\nThese include identifying novel treatment delivery methods that increase treatment adherence, developing new strategies to more effectively address the ever-growing population of patients with comorbid conditions, and elucidating the mechanisms by which effective treatments work in order to further refine their design. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an empirically supported psychotherapy that offers promise for patients suffering from a wide range of mental and physical conditions, while addressing these gaps and challenges in the field. ACT rests on the fundamental premise that pain, grief, disappointment, illness, and anxiety are inevitable features of human life, with the therapeutic goal of helping individuals productively adapt to these types of challenges by developing greater psychological flexibility rather than engaging in counterproductive attempts to eliminate or suppress undesirable experiences.\n\nThis is achieved through committed pursuit of valued life areas and directions, even in the face of the natural desire to escape or avoid painful and troubling experiences, emotions, and thoughts. ACT is transdiagnostic (applies to more than one condition), process-focused, and flexibly delivered. In a relatively short period of time, ACT has been effectively implemented across a broad range of therapeutic settings, including mental health, primary care, and specialty medical clinics. ACT has also been delivered in a variety of formats, including 1-day group workshops, online and smartphone applications, and telehealth. Focus on how best to package and deliver treatment to meet the unique needs of different patient populations helps to ensure treatment adherence and has fostered successful application of ACT for patients in everyday clinical settings.",

Given that a foundation of ACT is being committed to appropriate, values-guided action, we can remind clients that, to create a meaningful life, we must take action, and the power to act exists only in the present moment. As the Arab saying goes, “One cannot mount a camel which has not yet arrived (the future), nor one which has already departed (the past)”. “Taking action” means effective action, not just any old action. Effective action in ACT is defined as that which helps us to move in a valued direction. To find out in which way lies that direction, we must be psychologically present to be aware of what is happening, how we are reacting, and therefore how it is right for us to respond. Harris advocates recalling a mnemonic for ACT: “Accept your internal experience and be present; Choose a valued direction; and Take action”: ACT (Harris, 2007, p.",

It emphasizes cultivating meaning, vitality, and psychological flexibility in clients’ lives by exploring what truly matters to them. Some core values emphasized in ACT include compassion, connection, contribution, and vitality. These values guide clients towards living a meaningful life while increasing psychological flexibility. Therapists engaging in values-based work should also reflect on their own values and how they want to embody those values in their professional practice. Self-awareness and modeling values-congruent behavior can enhance the therapeutic relationship. Make sure to check back with this list whenever you feel the need. Our values may change with each year, month, day, or even in hourly increments.\n\nRuss Harris, author of ACT Made Simple.) If you don’t know what a value is, think of one word that describes how you want to behave now and continuously. When I ask about values, most clients give me goals. That’s fine. It’s an excellent place to start. We can later tease out the underlying values underlying. Good questions to kick off this conversation include: Who do you care about? Who do you like to hang out with? ... Our values are like the continents on a globe of the world. No matter how fast you spin that globe, you can never see all the continents at once; there are always some at the front, some at the back. From moment to moment, you get to choose: which values come to the front, and which move to the back? In Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), values play a crucial role in guiding an individual’s behavior and decision-making processes.\n\nBook a free 30-minute consultation with an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy specialist. ... Finally an article about ACT values that is simple, reads well and is not looking like it’s from 1999 😉 Great job and thanks ... DITTO. I have been looking for this for some time. ... Behavior analysis is a pragmatic discipline, and is persuasive because of the efficacy of its procedures, and not through explanation. Nonetheless, an explanation of how affective states ‘work’ can demonstrate that ‘Acceptance and Commitment’ is not only a byword for a set of psychotherapeutic procedures, but demonstrably also for a very simple procedure for mental hygiene, or the control of positive affect. This provides not only a new procedure for emotional control, but a validation of ACT as the most efficacious way for self-control. To wit, ‘acceptance’, as reflected in mindfulness procedure, induces relaxation, which is marked by a feeling of pleasure as reflected by opioid release.\n\nBelow you’ll find a list of common core values as defined by Russ Harris. Try to choose, let’s say 5 values, that are close to your heart.  ... Acceptance: to be open to and accepting of myself, others, and life. Adventure: to be adventurous; to actively seek, create, or explore novel or stimulating experiences. Assertiveness: to respectfully stand up for my rights and request what I want. Authenticity: to be authentic, genuine, real; to be true to myself. Beauty: to appreciate, create, nurture, or cultivate beauty in myself, others, and the environment. Caring: to be caring towards myself, others, and the environment. Challenge: to keep challenging myself to grow, learn, and improve. Compassion: to act with kindness towards those who are suffering. Connection: to engage fully in whatever I am doing and be fully present with others. Contribution: to contribute, help, assist, or make a positive difference to myself or others.",

Psychological flexibility, the main goal of ACT, typically comes about through several core processes. Developing creative hopelessness involves exploring past attempts at solving or getting away from those difficulties bringing an individual to therapy. Through recognition of the workability or lack of workability of these attempts, ACT creates opportunity for individuals to act in a manner more consistent with what is most important to them.

Practitioners of ACT help individuals recognize ways in which their attempts to suppress, manage, and control emotional experiences create challenges. By recognizing and addressing these challenges, individuals can become better able to make room for values-based actions that support well-being. ... For decades, researchers in the field of psychology have worked to develop science-based, time-limited interventions for people who wish to overcome mental health conditions. As a result, many people have had significant success in addressing and managing a range of concerns and experience greater well-being as a result. Still, long-term recovery and prevention of relapse remain significant as areas of potential difficulty for those seeking therapy for mental health conditions.\n\nIn countries other than the United States, organizations similar to ABCT may be a good place to look for providers who deliver ACT or who can make referrals to ACT-trained therapists. ...

Association for Contextual Behavioral Science.\n\nAcceptance is the ability to allow internal and external experience to occur instead of fighting or avoiding the experience. If someone thinks, “I’m a terrible person,” that person might be asked to instead say, “I am having the thought that I’m a terrible person.” This effectively separates the person from the cognition, thereby stripping it of its negative charge. When people experience painful emotions, such as anxiety, they might be instructed to open up, breath into, or make space for the physical feeling of anxiety and allow it to remain there, just as it is, without exacerbating or minimizing it. Values clarification can help people define what is most important—their values, in other words—and take effective action guided by those values. A mental health professional will generally employ a variety of exercises to help those in therapy identify chosen values.",

Cultivating self-actualization enhances wellbeing & drives individuals toward achieving their highest potential. The concept of self-actualization was brought into the mainstream by Abraham Maslow when he introduced his “hierarchy of needs.” · Today, self-actualization is a bit more widely known, but most psychology students still learn of it as the top level of Maslow’s pyramid. This article will define self-actualization, review the relevant research on self-actualization, and discuss its relevance to the positive psychology movement and to the average person. Before you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Self-Compassion Exercises for free. These detailed, science-based exercises will not only help you increase the compassion and kindness you show yourself but will also give you the tools to help your clients, students, or employees show more compassion to themselves.\n\nWhen do you feel most self-actualized, and what does it feel like? Do you think self-actualization is necessarily linked to wellbeing? If so, is it a vital piece of the wellbeing puzzle or only one of many ways to achieve wellbeing? Thanks for reading! We hope you enjoyed reading this article. Don’t forget to download our three Self Compassion Exercises for free. ... Self-actualization is the process of realizing one’s fullest potential by pursuing personal growth, creativity, and self-fulfillment. It represents the peak of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, where an individual’s focus shifts from fulfilling basic needs to achieving personal meaning, self-expression, and purpose. ... An example of a self-actualized person might be a scientist who dedicates their life to research out of pure passion, regardless of fame or financial gain, or an artist who creates for the joy of expression.\n\nThe concept of self-actualization ties into positive psychology through its connection with wellbeing; as you might imagine, those who are considered self-actualized are also generally high in wellbeing. According to Bernard et al. (2010), the work of another renowned humanistic psychologist, Albert Ellis, indicated that “self-actualization involves the pursuit of excellence and enjoyment; whichever people choose to desire and emphasize.” · This focus on excellence and enjoyment as a symptom of the realization of potential explains the link between self-actualization and wellbeing; if reaching your full potential is enjoyable and fulfilling, it logically follows that wellbeing will also be positively affected. Multiple studies within the field of positive psychology have examined self-actualization as a component of wellbeing (Compton, 2001; Kim et al., 2003), suggesting that it’s a topic that is perfectly at home amongst the other popular positive topics.",

One day I got to the point where I was overwhelmed by information. I felt stuck and did not know what the missing piece was or what I needed to address first in order to improve my life. I did not have an information shortage, I had a lack of clarity, disordered priorities, and a shaky grounding framework. I needed to figure out how to use my time more effectively on the things that enhance my life. Moreover, I needed something I could use to act as a filter and guidance for all my actions.

                "text": "Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are: physiological (food and clothing), safety (job security), love and belonging needs (friendship), esteem, and self-actualization. Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up.\n\nNeeds Hierarchy: The original hierarchy includes physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs. Later expansions add cognitive, aesthetic, and transcendence needs. Not Strictly Linear: While Maslow initially proposed that lower needs must be relatively satisfied before higher ones, modern research suggests people often pursue multiple needs simultaneously. Cultural Variations: Different societies may prioritize needs differently. Individualistic vs. collectivist cultures, for example, can shape which needs take precedence. Practical Applications: In fields like education, healthcare, and workplace management, Maslow’s framework helps identify barriers to motivation and guides strategies to fulfill various needs. Criticisms: Maslow’s biographical approach, cultural biases, and the debate over rigid vs. flexible ordering highlight the importance of viewing his theory as a starting point rather than an absolute rule.\n\nGrowth Needs (G) – focusing on personal development and self-fulfillment (parallels self-actualization). Simultaneous vs. Sequential: Unlike Maslow’s largely sequential framework, ERG theory posits that individuals can pursue multiple levels of needs at the same time. Frustration-Regression Hypothesis: If higher-level needs (Growth) are not met, people may refocus on lower-level (Existence or Relatedness) needs with renewed intensity, rather than simply stalling. Flexibility: Because ERG theory does not require that one need be “fully satisfied” before addressing another, it can accommodate cultural and personal variations more readily. Herzberg’s theory parallels Maslow’s distinction between basic (deficiency) needs and growth (fulfillment) needs but emphasizes that satisfying lower needs only neutralizes dissatisfaction. True motivation emerges from meeting “higher” motivators.\n\nIvtzan, I. (2008). Self actualisation: For individualistic cultures only? International Journal on Humanistic Ideology, 1, 113–140.

Beyond self-actualization, they represent the human desire to connect with a higher reality, purpose, or the universe. This level emphasizes altruism, spiritual connection, and helping others achieve their potential. Individuals seek experiences that move beyond personal concerns, aiming to achieve a deep sense of unity, understanding, and belonging within the vast expanse of existence. Examples of transcendence needs include mystical experiences and certain experiences with nature, aesthetic experiences, sexual experiences, service to others, the pursuit of science, religious faith, etc.). Instead of focusing on psychopathology and what goes wrong with people, Maslow (1943) formulated a more positive account of human behavior which focused on what goes right.",

                "text": "Most of us were raised with a survival mindset. The focus was on meeting basic physical needs, and setting ourselves up to continue meeting those needs successfully in the future. That requires a specific set of skills and beliefs. Optimizing for survival means: choosing safety, predictability, and agreeability over anything else there is little margin […]\n\nThat set of beliefs and strategies is extremely effective. It’s what’s kept the human species alive for all these generations. These are all positive, well-adapted strategies in environments where basic physical needs are in jeopardy. We’re talking about life near the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy here. But once those basic needs are met predictably, we naturally want to move higher up on the hierarchy. Feelings of connection, creativity, purpose, and self-expression become increasingly important and sought-after. I’ll call this the self-actualization mindset. The self-actualization mindset also requires a specific set of skills and beliefs. Optimizing for self-actualization means: choosing vulnerability, experimentation, self-expression, and risk-taking · developing a lot of emotional self regulation and compassion to bounce back when the experiments don’t always work out ·\n\nDemonizing either mindset – survival or self-actualization – doesn’t make any sense. Instead, I think about it in terms of evolutionary adaptation, like animals fine-tuned to survive in very different climates. Both mindsets are useful, in the right ecosystem. The problem for our generation, is that the ecosystem has changed dramatically within our lifetimes. The mindset and strategies that kept humanity alive all this time aren’t working anymore. Compared to our forebears, the demands of the current moment – culturally, economically, ecologically, politically, emotionally, personally – are dramatically different. Without deliberate intervention, our internalized beliefs and coping mechanisms take multiple generations to shift. But our generation is being called to rewire almost overnight. So, many of us are caught in the messy middle – where the strategies we internalized from our upbringing are out of sync with the current world around us.\n\nI’m my toughest critic. I beat myself up every day because that’s how I learned to motivate myself to work harder. But now it’s just wearing me down and I’m too exhausted and discouraged to actually improve any further. Intellectually I know I have a financial safety net, but my family money story has always been about deprivation and poverty. How can I feel safe to take the next leap? I know I’ve taken on too much work. But unless I keep hustling, I’ll fall behind and at the end of the day. I’m the only one I can count on to support me. The worst part? Every one of them is down on themselves for not being able to rectify the disconnect. The first, most important step is to realize the contextual reason WHY this disconnect exists in the first place. You’re not lazy, crazy, or dumb. It’s because you were trained to use an antiquated set of tools that are, now, often irrelevant.",

                "text": "The key to Maslow&#x27;s writings is understanding that there are no quick routes to self-actualization: rather it is predicated on the individual having their lower deficiency needs met. Once a person has moved through feeling and believing that they are deficient, they naturally seek to grow into who they are, i.e. self-actualization. Elsewhere, however, Maslow (2011) and Carl Rogers (1980) both suggested necessary attitudes and/or attributes that need to be inside an individual as a pre-requisite for self-actualization. Among these are a real wish to be themselves, to be fully human, to fulfill \n\nWhile Goldstein defined self-actualization as a driving force, Maslow uses the term to describe personal growth that takes place once lower order needs have essentially been met, one corollary being that, in his opinion, \"self-actualisation ... rarely happens ... certainly in less than 1% of the adult population.\" The fact that \"most of us function most of the time on a level lower than that of self-actualization\" he called the psychopathology of normality. Maslow's usage of the term is now popular in modern psychology when discussing personality from the humanistic approach. Maslow's work is considered to be part of humanistic psychology, which is one of several frameworks used in psychology for studying, understanding, and evaluating personality. The humanistic approach was developed because other approaches, such as the psychodynamic approach made famous by Sigmund Freud, focused on unhealthy individuals that exhibited disturbed behavior; whereas the humanistic approach focuses on h\n\nGoldstein sets this notion of self-actualization in contrast to \"self-preservation\" (Selbsterhaltung). \"Self-actualization\" for Goldstein means something that comes close to realization of one's \"essence\", one's identity, one's felt sense of oneself; which may in consequence mean that a person is willing to risk his or her life in order to maintain \"self-actualization\" (Selbsverwirklichung), the realization of his or her \"essence\" of the person he or she feels that she/he IS.\n\nSelf-actualization, in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, is the highest personal aspirational human need in the hierarchy. It represents where one's potential is fully realized after more basic needs, such as for the body and the ego, have been fulfilled. Long received in psychological teaching as the peak of human needs, Maslow later added the category self-transcendence (which, strictly speaking, extends beyond one's own \"needs\"). Self-actualization was coined by the organismic theorist Kurt Goldstein for the motive to realize one's full potential: \"the tendency to actualize itself as fully as possible is the basic drive ... the drive of self-actualization.\" Carl Rogers similarly wrote of \"the curative force in psychotherapy – man's tendency to actualize himself, to become his potentialities ... to express and activate all the capacities of the organism.\"\n\nThis tendency might be phrased as the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.\" He used the term to describe a desire, not a driving force, that could lead to realizing one's capabilities. He did not feel that self-actualization determined one's life; rather, he felt that it gave the individual a desire, or motivation to achieve budding ambitions. Maslow's idea of self-actualization has been commonly interpreted as \"the full realization of one's potential\" and of one's \"true self.\" A more explicit definition of self-actualization according to Maslow is \"intrinsic growth of what is already in the organism, or more accurately of what is the organism itself ... self-actualization is growth-motivated rather than deficiency-motivated.\" This explanation emphasizes the fact that self-actualization cannot normally be reached until other lower order necessities of Maslow's hierarchy of needs are satisfied.",

Some adverse effects of the pandemic are depression and other mental illnesses. To attain positive well-being, self-actualization in the social determinants of health plays a crucial role.

The pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges and major impact on health and wealth of nations.1 It shattered many dreams, halted normalcy and brought pain to many families who lost their loved ones. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate has peaked as high as 16%.2 Economy experience recession due to strict community lockdowns to mitigate the spread of the virulent disease. Jobs were scarce, and ordinary people lost financial capabilities to provide basic needs for their families.\n\nMaslow described self-actualization as the highest in the human’s hierarchy of needs.4 It is viewed as the level where one is motivated to seek the ideals in life. Self-actualization involves the need to progress and grow rather than to be static. It is seeking meaning and purpose in life. A recent study shows that treatment process that seeks self-actualization, like logotherapy, reduce death anxiety and depression in some patients with depression.5 By pursuing self-actualization through finding meaning and happiness in life, individuals lead themselves towards positive well-being. During this trying time, every person exhausts themselves to fill the individual human needs. Basic needs ought to be achieved, including physiological, safety, belonging, esteem and cognitive. However, one must go beyond the basics and discover a higher purpose in life.\n\nMoreover, every individual can provide care towards other people by showing compassion to those struggling with emotional and mental problems. It is the duty and responsibility of being human to be compassionate. Duty is actualizing the recognition that we are our sisters’ and our brothers’ keepers. Hence, we have to motivate ourselves to do higher purpose to find meaning and happiness in life. With the rising toll of death and cases of COVID-19, the world needs more people who are self-actualized and compassionate to battle against despair and achieve positive well-being.

We show that self-actualizing people can be found by means of an instrument for assessing levels of emotional development. People who are assessed at or near Dabrowski's Level 4 meet the criteria of self-actualizing growth. The degree of self-actualization can be assessed with the intensive interview guide developed for this purpose. The interview guide successfully met the objectives of this study. We have found that our self-actualizing individuals share a number of characteristics in common. They have a similar outlook and concern for humanity and its future. They have intensity, energy, and the persistence to work toward high ideals and a capacity to inspire others toward similar ideals.\n\nFollowing an overview of Maslow's theorizing on self-actualization (SA), this chapter surveys subsequent expansions of SA via incorporation of existential, transpersonal, and constructivist/postmodern theorizing.

From the literature on well-being the emergence of two distinct philosophical traditions is evident over the last three decades, namely hedonia and eudaimonia.

                "text": "The capability approach is a theoretical framework that entails two normative claims: first, the claim that the freedom to achieve well-being is of primary moral importance and, second, that well-being should be understood in terms of people’s capabilities and functionings. Capabilities are the doings and beings that people can achieve if they so choose – their opportunity to do or be such things as being well-nourished, getting married, being educated, and travelling; functionings are capabilities that have been realized. Whether someone can convert a set of means – resources and public goods\n\nWhether someone can convert a set of means – resources and public goods – into a functioning (i.e., whether she has a particular capability) crucially depends on certain personal, sociopolitical, and environmental conditions, which, in the capability literature, are called ‘conversion factors.’ Capabilities have also been referred to as real or substantive freedoms as they denote the freedoms that have been cleared of potential obstacles, in contrast to mere formal rights and primary social goods. Within philosophy, the capability approach has been employed to the development of several conceptual and normative theories within, most prominently, development ethics, political philosophy, public health ethics, environmental ethics and climate justice, and philosophy of education.\n\nThe capability approach purports that freedom to achieve well-being is a matter of what people are able to do and to be, and thus the kind of life they are effectively able to lead. The capability approach has its origins in a number of articles in which Sen (1974; 1979a; 1979b; see also Walsh 2003 and Sen 2005b) criticizes the limited informational bases of the traditional economic models and evaluative accounts (i.e., utilitarianism and resourcism). What is missing from these traditional models, Sen argues, is a notion of what activities we are able to undertake (‘doings’) and the kinds of persons we are able to be (‘beings’). Sen calls this notion capabilities. Capabilities are the real freedoms that people have to achieve their potential doings and beings. Real freedom in this sense means that one has all the required means necessary to achieve that doing or being if one wishes to.\n\nIn this way, the capability approach changes the focus from means (the resources people have and the public goods they can access) to ends (what they are able to do and be with those resources and goods). This shift in focus is justified because resources and goods alone do not ensure that people are able to convert them into actual doings and beings. Two persons with similar sets of goods and resources may nevertheless be able to achieve very different ends depending on their circumstances. One of the most prominent illustrations within the capability literature of the need to move beyond a focus on goods and resources is found in Sen’s (1979a) “Equality of What?” Tanner lecture. Here, Sen asks us to consider two persons with the same set of resources. Yet, one person suffers from a disability. This disability makes her unequal to the able-bodied person in two regards, which cannot be captured by a sole focus on resources.\n\nPhilosophical accounts of well-being, freedom, and justice should thus recognize the diversity of human needs and personal contexts. This is exactly what the notions of capabilities and functionings do. By focusing on what people are able to do and be, rather than merely on the distribution of goods and resources, the capability approach recognizes the diversity of people’s ability to convert those resources and goods into real opportunities and achievements – the kind of life they are effectively able to lead - without necessarily relying on an account of their preferences and values. The capability approach is generally conceived as a flexible and multi-purpose framework, rather than a precise theory of well-being or distributive justice (Qizilbash 2008; Robeyns 2005, 94–96; Sen 1992; 2009).",

                "text": "The capability approach (also referred to as the capabilities approach) is a normative approach to human welfare that concentrates on the actual capability of persons to achieve lives they value rather than solely having a right or freedom to do so. It was conceived in the 1980s as an alternative approach to welfare economics. In this approach, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum combine a range of ideas that were previously excluded from (or inadequately formulated in) traditional approaches to welfare economics. The core focus of the capability approach is improving access to the tools people us\n\nGiven Nussbaum's contention that the goal of the capabilities approach is to produce capabilities for each and every person, the capabilities below belong to individual persons, rather than to groups. The capabilities approach has been very influential in development policy where it has shaped the evolution of the human development index (HDI), has been much discussed in philosophy, and is increasingly influential in a range of social sciences. More recently, the approach has been criticized for being grounded in the liberal notion of freedom: This is a fundamentally reductive view of the human condition. Moreover, the emphasis on freedom betrays a profoundly modern orientation. The compound problem is that freedom in Nussbaum's hands is both given an intrinsic and primary value (a reductive claim), and, at the same time, the list is treated as a contingent negotiated relation in tension with other virtues such as justice, equality and rights.\n\nThe capability approach (also referred to as the capabilities approach) is a normative approach to human welfare that concentrates on the actual capability of persons to achieve lives they value rather than solely having a right or freedom to do so. It was conceived in the 1980s as an alternative approach to welfare economics. In this approach, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum combine a range of ideas that were previously excluded from (or inadequately formulated in) traditional approaches to welfare economics. The core focus of the capability approach is improving access to the tools people use to live a fulfilling life. Sen initially argued for five components to assess capability: The importance of real freedoms in the assessment of a person's advantage · Individual differences in the ability to transform resources into valuable activities · The multi-variate nature of activities giving rise to wellbeing ·\n\nSubsequently, in collaboration with political philosopher Martha Nussbaum, development economist Sudhir Anand and economic theorist James Foster, Sen has helped propel the capabilities approach to appear as a policy paradigm in debates concerning human development; his research inspired the creation of the UN's Human Development Index (a popular measure of human development that captures capabilities in health, education, and income). Additionally, the approach has been operationalized to have a high income country focus by Paul Anand and colleagues. Sen also founded the Human Development and Capability Association in 2004 in order to further promote discussion, education, and research on the human development and capability approach. Since then, the approach has been much discussed by political theorists, philosophers, and a range of social scientists, including those with a particular interest in human health.\n\nThe approach emphasizes functional capabilities (\"substantive freedoms\", such as the ability to live to old age, engage in economic transactions, or participate in political activities); these are construed in terms of the substantive freedoms people have reason to value, instead of utility (happiness, desire-fulfillment or choice) or access to resources (income, commodities, assets). An approach to wellbeing using utility can be found in utilitarianism, while access to resources is advocated by the Rawlsian approach. Poverty is understood as capability-deprivation. It is noteworthy that proponents emphasize not only how humans function, but their access to capabilities \"to achieve outcomes that they value and have reason to value\". Everyone could be deprived of capabilities in many ways, e.g. by ignorance, government oppression, lack of financial resources, or false consciousness.\n\nAs a result, living may be seen as a set of interrelated functions. Essentially, functionings are the states and activities constitutive of a person's being. Examples of functionings can vary from elementary things, such as being healthy, having a good job, and being safe, to more complex states, such as being happy, having self-respect, and being calm. Moreover, Amartya Sen contends that functionings are crucial to an adequate understanding of the capability approach; capability is conceptualized as a reflection of the freedom to achieve valuable functionings. In other words, functionings are the subjects of the capabilities referred to in the approach: what we are capable of, want to be capable of, or should be capable of being and/or do. Therefore, a person's chosen combination of functionings, what they are and do, is part of their overall capability set — the functionings they were able to do.",

When I remember my value of courage to be messy, I remember I don’t have to get it right or perfect.\n\nFor the last 30 years the Co-Active Training Institute (CTI) has been offering the gold-standard in coach training and leadership development for individuals and organizations. Now we are creating a new language of leadership. Let's do this together.  ... One of the first things we do in Co-Active coaching with clients is to identify their core values. When you know what your core values are, they can help you to stay grounded in who you are and what you believe in, especially when challenges come up. For example, I just found out I am about to lead a series of 15 virtual training sessions, back-to-back, for a massive corporate client. I’m terrified. The project is bigger than anything I have attempted before, both in the number of leaders to train and the financial payoff. I had raised my hand two months ago, before I could second guess myself, throwing my hat in the ring and blinking hard when it actually happened.\n\nGia Storms specializes in developing leaders, transforming teams and bringing meaning and purpose to the workplace.

Brief guided exercise to notice sensations in the body to anchor awareness and reduce \"floaty\" feelings\n   \n2. **Tension Mapping** - Visual representation of where tensions are felt physically and how they shift during conversation\n\n3. **Value-Moment Spotlighting** - Highlighting tiny moments when values are already being expressed, even if subtle\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition Timeline** - Noting when patterns first developed and how they've evolved\n\n5. **Bifocal Vision** - Simultaneously acknowledging both what's difficult AND what's alive in any situation\n\n## Action-Based Toppings\n\n6. **Micro-Experiments** - Tiny, low-stakes attempts to test new behaviors aligned with values (30-60 seconds)\n\n7. **Immediate Applicability Check** - \"What's one small way you could apply this insight in the next 24 hours?\"\n\n8. **CAP Stretching** - Identifying how a current CAP could expand slightly beyond its current expression\n\n9. **Attention Shifting Practice** - Specific technique to redirect attention from IAP-focus to CAP-focus\n\n10. **Values-Action Bridge** - Explicit connection between abstract value and concrete next action\n\n## Integration-Based Toppings\n\n11. **Broaden-and-Build Spirals** - Identifying potential upward spirals that could be initiated by small changes\n\n12. **Defusion Reframe** - Helping separate from thought patterns through linguistic shifts (\"I notice I'm having the thought that...\" rather than \"I am...\")\n\n13. **Psychological Space Creation** - Techniques for creating inner psychological space around difficult experiences\n\n14. **Metaphor Generation** - Collaborative creation of meaningful metaphors that capture the essence of the person's experience\n\n15. **Between-Session Integration** - Specific structure for carrying insights forward between conversations\n\n# Clustering the Toppings\n\n## Cluster 1: Embodiment Toppings\n- Sensory Activation Prompt\n- Tension Mapping\n- Micro-Experiments\n- Attention Shifting Practice\n\n## Cluster 2: Meaning-Making Toppings\n- Value-Moment Spotlighting\n- CAP Stretching\n- Values-Action Bridge\n- Metaphor Generation\n\n## Cluster 3: Metacognitive Toppings\n- Pattern Recognition Timeline\n- Bifocal Vision\n- Defusion Reframe\n- Psychological Space Creation\n\n## Cluster 4: Integration Toppings\n- Immediate Applicability Check\n- Broaden-and-Build Spirals\n- Between-Session Integration\n\n# Best Topping for This Session: Bifocal Vision\n\nGiven that you're experiencing a tension between connection and solitude - both being meaningful to you - the Bifocal Vision topping seems most relevant for our current conversation.\n\n## Applying Bifocal Vision to Your Situation:\n\n**What it is**: Bifocal Vision means holding two seemingly contradictory truths simultaneously - acknowledging both what's difficult AND what's alive/meaningful in any given situation.\n\n**How it works in your case**:\n- You value deep connection with your parents AND you value your authentic solitary creative life\n- You feel guilty about distance AND you recognize that distance enables important aspects of your life\n- You miss close presence AND you find meaningful ways to connect across distance\n\n**The shift**: Rather than seeing this as a problem to solve (either/or), Bifocal Vision invites you to see it as a rich complexity to navigate (both/and).\n\nWhat if both your need for meaningful solitude AND your desire for family connection are valid, important CAPs? What if the tension between them isn't a problem but a creative edge where something new wants to emerge?\n\nWould you be willing to explore this bifocal perspective on your situation - seeing both the challenge AND the aliveness in this tension between connection and solitude?",

      "content": "\nLet me apply the enhanced Aliveness Advisor framework to the check-in that was shared in the earlier conversation. I'll identify elements related to CAP vs. CAP, IAP vs. CAP and potential IAP to CAP transformations. Then I'll address the second part of the request about why the user might rush through things, struggle to implement advice from LLMs, and how they might approach this differently.\n\nFirst, let me locate the original check-in from the document context:\n\nFrom the documents, here's the check-in I'll work with:\n\n\"i'm just returning from visitng my parents in michigan and i'm feeling a bit low and sad and i'm startiing work and i feel like I'm back in france to the getting through the days sort of feeling and i'm a bit heavy and i enjoyed the conference yet the failure of the kindness kiwis just makes me feel like i'm going to be a small idiot for the rest of my life doing lame things no one cares about and the world is on fire and baies are being killed in palestine and i don't know if I'm doing right by my parents and worried about the religious consequences - i want to do right by my parents yet there's also a tension of being there and feeling chaos and america seems to be falling apart so i don't want ot move there and i like the village feel of france and josephines kind and stable and gentle family vs my chaotic one yet should that matter - in the quran it says listen to them and be kind and help them as they helped you when you were a baby and only don't listen to them if they tell you to disbelieve yet otherwise listen ot them - so my dad says he wants me to be closer and live with them or closer to them, how? what can i do ? am i just being rebellious, i feel bad and i have work and Nur creative studios is growing slowly and my book is going no where and i'm disorganized and unable to get things together and i'm turning 40 and my body is in pain in a few places and i don't know what to do, can you help?\"\n\nThere are also mentions later of:\n- Reading Quran with the mother\n- Feeling \"floaty\" and not fully present\n- Anxious-avoidant attachment style\n- Feeling distant from wife\n- Liking yet being sad about solitude\n- Wanting connection yet finding it annoying\n\nI'll use this information to craft a response using the enhanced framework, applying the toppings appropriately.\n\nIn terms of the tensions here, I can identify:\n1. CAP vs. CAP: Honoring parents/religious values vs. living authentic life in France\n2. CAP vs. CAP: Desire for connection vs. need for solitude\n3. IAP to CAP: Disorganized work approach → creative expression\n4. IAP to CAP: Duty-based calls with parents → meaningful connection\n\nFor the second part of the request, I'll need to address why someone with ADD might struggle to implement advice from LLMs and how to approach this differently.\n\n# Demonstration of Enhanced Aliveness Advisor Check-in Response\n\n## Opening Response to Your Check-in\n\nI notice your energy feels quite low today – perhaps a 2/5 after returning from visiting your parents. There's a heaviness in your words, with physical pain in a few places and emotional weight around family obligations, creative work, and finding your place between cultures and continents.\n\nI appreciate the raw honesty in how you're sharing both your religious values and your practical realities – that tension feels very alive and meaningful, not just a simple problem to solve.\n\n[System Note: I'm recognizing multiple tensions here – a significant CAP vs. CAP tension between honoring parents/religious values and creating an authentic life in France that feels nourishing. There's also a deeper pattern around connection and solitude that appears contradictory but might actually be complementary.]\n\n### Primary Topping: Bifocal Vision\n\nWhat stands out is how you're holding two equally true and important realities simultaneously:\n\n1. The genuine desire to honor your parents and religious values around family obligation\n2. The authentic need for the stability, creativity, and life you've built in France\n\nBoth of these impulses are deeply meaningful CAPs – not just \"should\" obligations. The tension isn't evidence of failure but of depth. You care deeply about multiple meaningful things, and that's what makes this challenging.\n\n### Action Topping: Micro-Experiment\n\nRather than trying to solve the entire parents-vs-France dilemma, what if you tried a 60-second experiment during your next Quran reading with your mom?\n\nBefore the call, place your hand on your chest, take three deep breaths, and silently say: \"I honor my connection to my family AND my authentic path.\" Then during the call, notice one moment when you feel genuinely present rather than \"floaty.\" What changes when you approach the connection from this \"both/and\" perspective rather than an \"either/or\" problem?\n\n### Integration Topping: Defusion Reframe\n\nI notice thoughts like \"I'm going to be a small idiot doing lame things nobody cares about\" and \"I'm disorganized and unable to get things together.\" These thoughts feel like absolute truths when we're fused with them.\n\nWhat happens if you shift to: \"I notice I'm having the thought that I'm going to be a small idiot...\" Does that create even a millimeter of space between you and the thought? The thought can be there without being YOU.\n\n### Would you like to:\n1. Explore how your anxious-avoidant attachment style might be influencing both family relationships AND creative work patterns?\n2. Try the micro-experiment with your next parent call and notice what happens?\n3. Dig deeper into what \"doing right by parents\" means to you beyond physical proximity?\n\n## Addressing ADD and Implementation Challenges\n\nThe struggle to implement advice from LLMs reflects something important about how your brain works. This isn't a failure but valuable information:\n\n[System Note: This pattern of engagement without implementation suggests a mismatch between how advice is delivered and how this person's neurodivergent brain processes and acts on information.]\n\n### Reasons This Happens With ADD:\n\n1. **Novelty-Driven Attention**: Your brain lights up with new ideas but may lose interest before implementation\n\n2. **Ownership Gap**: External suggestions don't activate the same neural pathways as self-generated insights\n\n3. **Working Memory Challenges**: Detailed advice overwhelms your working memory, making it hard to retain and act on\n\n4. **Emotional Resonance**: ADD brains often need visceral, emotional connection to information to prioritize it\n\n### How To Approach This Differently:\n\n1. **Co-Creation Instead of Advice**: Ask the LLM questions that help YOU generate the insight rather than receiving it passively\n\n2. **Anchor to Body Sensations**: When an idea resonates, immediately notice physical sensations – where do you feel \"yes\" in your body?\n\n3. **One Micro-Action**: Choose just ONE tiny step (30 seconds or less) and do it immediately while still in conversation\n\n4. **Voice Memo Capture**: When something feels important, immediately record a 10-second voice memo to yourself about why it matters to YOU specifically\n\nWhat strikes me about your pattern is that it's not just about ADD – it's about how you come alive. You need ideas that feel like \"gut punches\" because those are moments when your body is telling you something has meaning. That physical resonance is a CAP signal worth tracking.\n\nWhat one tiny action could you take right now – while reading this – that would feel different from your usual pattern?",

I'll identify elements related to CAP vs. CAP, IAP vs. CAP and potential IAP to CAP transformations. Then I'll address the second part of the request about why the user might rush through things, struggle to implement advice from LLMs, and how they might approach this differently.\n\nFirst, let me locate the original check-in from the document context:\n\nFrom the documents, here's the check-in I'll work with:\n\n\"i'm just returning from visitng my parents in michigan and i'm feeling a bit low and sad and i'm startiing work and i feel like I'm back in france to the getting through the days sort of feeling and i'm a bit heavy and i enjoyed the conference yet the failure of the kindness kiwis just makes me feel like i'm going to be a small idiot for the rest of my life doing lame things no one cares about and the world is on fire and baies are being killed in palestine and i don't know if I'm doing right by my parents and worried about the religious consequences - i want to do right by my parents yet there's also a tension of being there and feeling chaos and america seems to be falling apart so i don't want ot move there and i like the village feel of france and josephines kind and stable and gentle family vs my chaotic one yet should that matter - in the quran it says listen to them and be kind and help them as they helped you when you were a baby and only don't listen to them if they tell you to disbelieve yet otherwise listen ot them - so my dad says he wants me to be closer and live with them or closer to them, how? what can i do ? am i just being rebellious, i feel bad and i have work and Nur creative studios is growing slowly and my book is going no where and i'm disorganized and unable to get things together and i'm turning 40 and my body is in pain in a few places and i don't know what to do, can you help?\"\n\nThere are also mentions later of:\n- Reading Quran with the mother\n- Feeling \"floaty\" and not fully present\n- Anxious-avoidant attachment style\n- Feeling distant from wife\n- Liking yet being sad about solitude\n- Wanting connection yet finding it annoying\n\nI'll use this information to craft a response using the enhanced framework, applying the toppings appropriately.\n\nIn terms of the tensions here, I can identify:\n1. CAP vs. CAP: Honoring parents/religious values vs. living authentic life in France\n2. CAP vs. CAP: Desire for connection vs. need for solitude\n3. IAP to CAP: Disorganized work approach → creative expression\n4. IAP to CAP: Duty-based calls with parents → meaningful connection\n\nFor the second part of the request, I'll need to address why someone with ADD might struggle to implement advice from LLMs and how to approach this differently.",

There's a heaviness in your words, with physical pain in a few places and emotional weight around family obligations, creative work, and finding your place between cultures and continents.\n\nI appreciate the raw honesty in how you're sharing both your religious values and your practical realities – that tension feels very alive and meaningful, not just a simple problem to solve.\n\n[System Note: I'm recognizing multiple tensions here – a significant CAP vs. CAP tension between honoring parents/religious values and creating an authentic life in France that feels nourishing. There's also a deeper pattern around connection and solitude that appears contradictory but might actually be complementary.]\n\n### Primary Topping: Bifocal Vision\n\nWhat stands out is how you're holding two equally true and important realities simultaneously:\n\n1. The genuine desire to honor your parents and religious values around family obligation\n2. The authentic need for the stability, creativity, and life you've built in France\n\nBoth of these impulses are deeply meaningful CAPs – not just \"should\" obligations. The tension isn't evidence of failure but of depth. You care deeply about multiple meaningful things, and that's what makes this challenging.\n\n### Action Topping: Micro-Experiment\n\nRather than trying to solve the entire parents-vs-France dilemma, what if you tried a 60-second experiment during your next Quran reading with your mom?\n\nBefore the call, place your hand on your chest, take three deep breaths, and silently say: \"I honor my connection to my family AND my authentic path.\" Then during the call, notice one moment when you feel genuinely present rather than \"floaty.\" What changes when you approach the connection from this \"both/and\" perspective rather than an \"either/or\" problem?\n\n### Integration Topping: Defusion Reframe\n\nI notice thoughts like \"I'm going to be a small idiot doing lame things nobody cares about\" and \"I'm disorganized and unable to get things together.\" These thoughts feel like absolute truths when we're fused with them.\n\nWhat happens if you shift to: \"I notice I'm having the thought that I'm going to be a small idiot...\" Does that create even a millimeter of space between you and the thought? The thought can be there without being YOU.\n\n### Would you like to:\n1. Explore how your anxious-avoidant attachment style might be influencing both family relationships AND creative work patterns?\n2. Try the micro-experiment with your next parent call and notice what happens?\n3. Dig deeper into what \"doing right by parents\" means to you beyond physical proximity?\n\n## Addressing ADD and Implementation Challenges\n\nThe struggle to implement advice from LLMs reflects something important about how your brain works. This isn't a failure but valuable information:\n\n[System Note: This pattern of engagement without implementation suggests a mismatch between how advice is delivered and how this person's neurodivergent brain processes and acts on information.]\n\n### Reasons This Happens With ADD:\n\n1. **Novelty-Driven Attention**: Your brain lights up with new ideas but may lose interest before implementation\n\n2. **Ownership Gap**: External suggestions don't activate the same neural pathways as self-generated insights\n\n3. **Working Memory Challenges**: Detailed advice overwhelms your working memory, making it hard to retain and act on\n\n4. **Emotional Resonance**: ADD brains often need visceral, emotional connection to information to prioritize it\n\n### How To Approach This Differently:\n\n1. **Co-Creation Instead of Advice**: Ask the LLM questions that help YOU generate the insight rather than receiving it passively\n\n2. **Anchor to Body Sensations**: When an idea resonates, immediately notice physical sensations – where do you feel \"yes\" in your body?\n\n3. **One Micro-Action**: Choose just ONE tiny step (30 seconds or less) and do it immediately while still in conversation\n\n4. **Voice Memo Capture**: When something feels important, immediately record a 10-second voice memo to yourself about why it matters to YOU specifically\n\nWhat strikes me about your pattern is that it's not just about ADD – it's about how you come alive. You need ideas that feel like \"gut punches\" because those are moments when your body is telling you something has meaning. That physical resonance is a CAP signal worth tracking.\n\nWhat one tiny action could you take right now – while reading this – that would feel different from your usual pattern?",
