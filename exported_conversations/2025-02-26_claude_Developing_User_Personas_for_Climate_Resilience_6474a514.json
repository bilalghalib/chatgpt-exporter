I hope you guys got a chance to talk and get to know each other a little bit better.\nNow, for the rest of the day, we are going to go into the first step of Design Thinking, User research.\n\n\nSESSION OBJECTIVES\nLearn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs.\n\nBuild a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology.\n\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nLearn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs:  We will show you why user research is so important and how it is essential for developing any product or service. \n\nBuild a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology: Next, we will talk about building a research plan. This month is all about understanding your customers needs. We will do that in 3 ways, experiencing what our customers experience, observing them, and listening to them.\n\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends: Finally, we will spend some time on how you should organize your research as you implement your research plan. \n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nDesign Thinking review\nSO, LET’S REVIEW! This morning we talked about design thinking and we ran through a design sprint so you can experience the whole process in just about 1 hour! Can someone tell us what we have learned? What is Design thinking? Why is it one of the most important tools for entrepreneurs? What is it used for?\n\nSome possible answers:\nAllows for creative solutions to problems by defining needs as verbs!\nWe get to know our customers (who they are, where they are, how they behave, what they like/dislike, etc…) \nEmpathize with them\nSome people might mention a few (or all) of the steps\nCreate better products by ensuring that it is designed to meet their needs\n\nGo over the design thinking process briefly touching on points the entrepreneurs missed. Remind them that it is a continuous process that needs to be tested and re-evaluated again and again.\n\n\n4\nMINDSETS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nMindsets: Facilitate a discussion on what mindsets we should have going into the program. Write everyone's answer on the board and see where people are at. At the end, put these points up on the boards and say that in design thinking, there are a few additional mindsets that are really important to have. Point out if they have already said any of them. We operate from these mindsets:\nFocus on human values: Design thinking is human centered design. We look to understand the needs and emotions of people in order to design solutions for them. Empathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these\u000busers is fundamental to good design\nShow don’t tell: Wherever you can, show people what you are doing, don’t explain it to them. You learn more from listening and observing real reactions, than having people respond to your talking. This is essential when we get to prototyping. Communicate your vision in an impactful and meaningful way by creating experiences, using illustrative visuals, and telling good stories.\nEmbrace experimentation: Don’t be afraid to try things. It is ok to fail, in fact, it can be good! The more you experiment and allow yourself to consider different options, the more you will learn and you will get better. Prototyping is not simply a way to validate your idea; it is an integral part of your innovation process. We build to think and learn. \nBe mindful of the process: Know where you are in the design process, what methods to use in that stage, and what your goals are. It is a process for a reason, don’t skip a step, but don’t be afraid to go back if you need more research or to reframe the problem to find better solutions!\nBias towards action: Design thinking is very hands on and action oriented. There will not be a lot of time sitting and learning, we want you to experience everything by doing! Design thinking is a misnomer; it is more about doing that thinking. Bias toward doing and making over thinking and meeting.\nRadical collaboration: In order to get a diversity of ideas and solutions, you have to collaborate. In this room there are so many people with different backgrounds and experiences. Use each other to brainstorm and develop your businesses. Later on, you will even collaborate with your customers or anyone else who would interact with your product/service. Bring together innovators with varied backgrounds and viewpoints. Enable breakthrough insights and solutions to emerge from the diversity.\nCraft clarity: Things are going to get messy. That is normal, take care to reframe the problem to make it clear. Produce a coherent vision out of messy problems. Frame it in a way to inspire others and to fuel ideation.\n\n\n\nUSER RESEARCH\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nEmpathizing is the first step we will look at in the Design Thinking process. We will empathize with our users through user research. It is the phase where you learn about your customers behaviors, needs, pains, and gains. \nAsk: Why is the user research phase of Design Thinking so important?\nUser research helps us to understand how people go about performing tasks and achieving goals that are important to them. \nIt gives us context and perspective and puts us in a position to respond with useful, simplified, and productive design solutions. \nUser research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and motivations through methodical, investigative approaches. \nIt helps us identify unarticulated needs and to fill in any gaps in our knowledge about our users, context of use, challenges, and opportunities. \nIt also helps us to align our product and business strategy with the core needs and goals of our users.\nInsights are then used to ensure that all product design decisions do benefit the user. \n\nWHO IS YOUR USER?\nGOALS\nNEEDS\nPAINS\nWANTS\nDESIRES\n20 minutes: Discussion\n\n5- 10 minutes: Guided discussion on user personas. Who is your user?\nI’m sure by now, you guys already have an idea of who your customers are. We are going to spend some time taking a look at who we think are our customers at this point. \nLet’s take an example from the room.  ___(name person in the room)____, can you tell me a little bit about one of your potential customers? Lets look at this as if they were a real person. Tell me the person’s name, where they are from, and what do they love to do.\nGuide the person to fill out all of the components of a user persona (shown on the next slide). Make sure you are writing what they say on the board in a way that will draw out the user persona as depicted in the next slides. \nContent could include:\nGeographic: Location, city, reach, country, international vs local\nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, ethnic background\nBehavioral: Patterns, usage rates, \nPsychographic: Social class, lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes, \nGoals:  What is this person trying to accomplish? \nCustomer pains: What challenges does this person face? What are the big and small problems they have and how does it affect their lives?\nTell this person’s story: Tell a short story about this person trying to accomplish their goal (related to your business). What challenges do they face on their journey? \nIn market segmentation, you can be general. It is a good way to summarize large groups of your customers. However, in this case with personas, we want to make it as real as possible so we will use very specific information.\n*** If you do not feel comfortable facilitating the discussion with a new business idea, learn what is on the example on the hidden slides and create a user persona around that (it is for a tourism business). Still make sure to engage the audience by asking them to talk about a potential customer for the tourism business you are creating.\n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nEveryone should now fill out a user persona for their business. We want you to be really specific. Find an example of a real person who might use your product/service. Describe them like they are real. Your customers will be real people with needs, values, and feelings. \nAsk 1-2 people to share their persona they have created.\nDebrief: You guys all did a great job here. Actually, what you just did was create a “fake” user persona. I think a lot of these points might be accurate; however, we are assuming that these are accurate. This is just based on who we THINK is our user, and it is not really based on much data. Over the next few weeks, we are going to spend some time doing intensive user research and come up with accurate user personas by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data.\n\n\n\n\n\nPICTURE & NAME\n  DEMOGRAPHIC:\nShe is 22 years old, \nSingle, \nStudies international cultures, \nWorks as a waitress. \n  GEOGRAPHIC:\nChristie is living in a small apartment in New York\nHas a strong online presence and spends 3-4 hours on social media every day.\n  BEHAVIORAL:\nShe likes to try new things\nShe eats out at restaurants on a weekly basis\nShe uses her phone to research user reviews to help her decide what to do and buy\nTravels every summer with her family to the mountains\n  PSYCHOGRAPHIC:\nVegan & animal rights activist\nDoesn’t care about her looks, always dresses down  \nLoves adventure\n\nAlternative example (slides 7-8)\n\n5- 10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nGuided discussion on user personas.

She is 22 years old, single, studies international cultures, and works as a waitress. She dreams of a future where she can combine work and travel. She wants to work in work in a company where she can travel and make a difference in the world. She’s not sure about having kids and a husband. At least it’s not on her radar just yet.\n\nTravel internationally in a sustainable way\nSee the world\nHelp others\nSave money\n\n\nTraveling is too expensive\nShe doesn’t know where to look for sustainable tourism options\nIt is really hard for her to keep track of prices, hotel options, and day trips she is reviewing\n\n\n9\nBREAK\n\nYOUR RESEARCH:\nDO\nLOOK\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nYour research plan: Welcome back from your break. I hope you are feeling re-energized! So, as we said before, we all have an idea of who our customers are and what they want, but really, these are just assumptions. We might be right on some things, but we probably don’t have the whole picture. That’s why it is so important to create a research plan. To help us fill these gaps and give us more insights on what our customers need!\n\nHow will we do this? Through three research methodologies: Do, Look, and Listen.\n\nDo is all about experiential learning. Putting yourself in the shoes of your customers.\n\nLook is learning through observation. Trying to see the behaviors of your customers to pinpoint needs and opportunities.\n\nListen is where we talk to our customers through user interviews. Here we hear from them and try to get to the root of their problems and really understand their behaviors and emotions.\n\nDO\nhttps://www.cleancookingalliance.org/binary-data/RESOURCE/file/000/000/407-1.pdf\n20 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nDO is all about experiencing what your customers experience. In order to understand the pains of your customers, you have to go through the process yourself. For the DO, tell the story of one of IDEO's engineers:\nIDEO is one of the leading companies in product development focusing on design thinking methodology. IDEO was working on creating a new design for a stove in a third world country.  They wanted to design a solution for women to make cooking easier for them. So what did they do? They went to the country and used the stove. They experienced how people cooked every day and got to feel how those women felt using that stove. The lesson in this story is that even if you are an expert, you have to go through the same experience of your users to feel their challenges!\n\n15 minutes: Activity - Immerse (DO)\nHave participants partner up\nGive each pair a task: \nGo into the bathroom and wash your hands, \nWalk around the space, get a book, and put it on the table in the kitchen, \nMake a cup of tea\nDo a lap around the space\nGet a piece of paper and write directions to the bathroom\nYou can do anything, be creative!\n\nOne participant will close their eyes and try to complete the task, while their partner guides them and makes sure they don’t run into things or hurt themselves\nThen switch so that both people go through the process\n\nDEBRIEF: How was that experience? What did it make you learn? How do you think it would be to be blind in a space like this? \nNow think, if you were to design a product for someone who was blind, what are some things you would include? Think about what helped you accomplish the task. Was it useful to hold onto things? Were sounds helpful? Did you like it when someone was in front of you? What were things that frustrated you while you were “blind“, how could that be fixed?\nLESSON: It is important to walk in your customers shoes, especially if you are developing a product for them. To see life from their perspective will allow you to truly understand them and their needs\n\n\nWhat are they doing? \nHow are they doing it?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?\nLOOK\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nAnother form of research is observation. You can learn so much by just observing people in their natural routine. While you are watching, take note of a few things:\nWhat are they doing? What are their actual behaviors? List them step by step. Be detail oriented.\nHow are they doing it? Are they doing something a little odd that needs further explanation? Is it easy for them? Difficult?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?  What are they trying to accomplish? What is the end goal? \n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nObserve (LOOK): What is this a picture of? What do you see?\nSpend 5-10 minutes getting thoughts from people. Take the time to build up a story about this person.\nWrite everyone's thoughts on the board\nRemember to touch on the previous slides questions (what, how, why)\nWhat do you see versus what do you think based on what you see?\n\nLESSON: You can learn so much from just looking, taking a step back and trying to figure out what you’re seeing, what you can learn from watching. Keep in mind that you can only learn some things. You can see their actual behaviors. You can observe body language and make assumptions about WHY they are doing it that way. If you can, get some clarification and speak to the person to understand why they did it in that way. \n\nAsk for stories\nTalk about emotions\nAsk why?\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe last research method we are going to cover is the User Interview. In a user interview, you spend 2-30 minutes to speak with customers to hear from them about their experiences. If you take the time to speak to customers, they will tell you everything you would ever need to know about how to make a great product for them. They will tell you what they like and don’t like, the challenges they have with existing solutions and even more! You just have to listen! \n\n\n\n“Tell me about the last time you…”\n“What was the best/ worse...”\n“Why is that?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\nLISTEN\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBe careful how you phrase questions. It is important that you don’t lead your customers into saying what you want to hear. By doing this, your interview data will be useless. To give you some example of bad interview questions:\nDo you like my idea? People tend to be nice, chances are nobody would want you to feel bad and tell you that you have a bad idea. By asking this, you invite people to say “yes, I like your idea” even though it might not be true. \nWould you buy this product? This is another question that is tricky and usually provides you with false information. Again many people would be tempted to say “yes” or “probably” to this question. The best way to test if people are willing to buy a product is to see if they actually take out their wallet and try. \nDo you have trouble with _____? By posing challenges for them, you are putting words in their mouth. Maybe they do have trouble with that, but you want to hear it from them. Maybe they are facing the challenge differently than you are. Allow them to share their thoughts on their own. Don’t tell or suggest to people how they feel or behave. \nCan you tell me how you normally …..  This question is ALMOST good; however, it is too general. You don’t get any real information. If you ask for generalities (‘what is your normal evening like?’) then you’ll get a false picture, it will be their ‘idealized’ evening. You need to ask a question that allows people to give you a specific story that has real emotions.\n\nSo what are good questions to ask? The questions ask for stories, evoke emotions, and go deeper into their actual behaviors. \n“Tell me about the last time you…”  By asking this question, you are able to get very specific information. They will have details about what they liked and didnt like, there might be a timeline, etc... You will get very rich information with this question. \n“What was the best/ worse...” By asking these questions, you are learning more about what the person likes and doesn’t. As you develop your product, it is important to know what your customers care about and what their problems are.\n“Why is that?” and “Can you tell me more?” These questions are great for going deeper. If your interviewee says something surprising or interesting, you should want to know more about it. Don’t assume anything, ask them about their thoughts. \nAsk why 5 times – keep asking why so that you get to the deeper meaning and emotion behind decisions. Humans make decisions based on emotion, it’s important for you to understand why your users/ customers make their decisions\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW\nIntroduce yourself\nIntroduce project\nBuild rapport\nEvoke stories\nExplore emotions\nQuestion statements\nThank you & wrap up\nTime\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + example\n\nExplain all the steps that go into an interview. Here are some tips on what to ask in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of a user interview:\n\nBeginning: In the beginning of the interview, you should ask opening questions to set people at ease and build rapport. You should not ask about sensitive topics. Instead, focus on setting the stage and bringing your interviewees on board so they’re comfortable enough to be, and remain, open with you. What you do at this stage can include the following:\nTelling participants what topics will be covered\nTelling participants how their data will be used\nAsking innocuous questions such as what their role is in their organization\nAsking concrete questions that are easy to answer\n\nMiddle: In the middle of the interview, you’re hitting high gear. Having established a direct channel with your interviewees (the users), you move on and ask the bulk of your questions, but maybe not in the order you had originally planned. Remember to:\nKeep the flow of the conversation as natural as possible, but cover the topics you want to cover.\nPick up on what participants have said earlier and get full replies to questions they have only partially answered.\nSteer participants back on track if they go too far off topic.\nShow that you have been listening.\nGo deeper where necessary\n\nEnd: At the end of the interview, you wrap up in a way that makes participants feel as though they have said what they wanted to say and that their answers are valuable. By this point, you will have managed to tie up any loose ends on matters that had not been clear before, and both you and they should be satisfied that the interview has brought all the issues out into the open. Things you should do include:\nAsking if there is anything participants would like to add.\nTelling your participants what you are going to do with their data and what the value is for them.\nThanking them for taking the time to help with your research. Above all, remember to conduct a pilot study before you start approaching real-life participants and tackling ‘organic’ interview settings. Also, always be sensitive to the fact that people are different and need different things!\n\n5 minutes: Example\nHave 2 trainers go through a User Interview. Show a good user interview and a bad one. \n\n\nEMPATHY MAP\n8 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nSo after your interview, you should reflect on and reorganize your information. We will do this through an empathy map. \nAfter you give the explanation of the empathy map, fill it in for the practice interview you just had in front of the group (with the trainers). Have it be a conversation and write out the answers as a group on the white board. As you discuss together, highlight some information about each quadrant (no need to explain each point in detail!)\n\nThe Says quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or some other usability study. Ideally, it contains verbatim and direct quotes from research.\n“I love Asiacell because I never have a bad experience.”\n“I want something reliable.”\n“I don’t understand what to do from here.”\nThe Thinks quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. Ask yourself (from the qualitative research gathered): what occupies the user’s thoughts? What matters to the user? Pay special attention to what users think, but may not be willing to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure, self-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?\n“This is really annoying.”\n“Am I dumb for not understanding this?”\nThe Does quadrant encloses the actions the user takes. From the research, what does the user physically do? How does the user go about doing it?\nRefreshes page several times.\nShops around to compare prices.\nThe Feels quadrant is the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What does the user get excited about? How does the user feel about the experience?\nImpatient: pages load too slowly\nConfused: too many contradictory prices\nWorried: they are doing something wrong\n\nYou might encounter inconsistencies — for example, seemingly positive actions but negative quotes or emotions coming from the same user.  This is when empathy maps become treasure maps that can uncover nuggets of understanding about our user. It is our job as UX professionals to investigate the cause of the conflict and resolve it.\n\nSome of these quadrants may seem ambiguous or overlapping — for example, it may be difficult to distinguish between Thinks and Feels. Do not focus too much on being precise: if an item may fit into multiple quadrants, just pick one. The 4 quadrants exist only to push our knowledge about users and to ensure we don’t leave out any important dimension. (If you don’t have anything to put into a certain quadrant, it’s a strong signal that you need more user research before proceeding in the design process.)\n\n**This is important to do together because we consistently have trouble with the entrepreneurs not understanding how to use the empathy map. \n\n\n\n\n\nPRACTICE\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nInterview Your Users (LISTEN)\n5 minutes: prepare questions\nCome up with 3-5 questions you want to learn from your customers about their lives/ about your product (5 minutes)\n10 minutes: 2 rounds of interviews (5 minutes each)\nEach person is matched with a partner\n5 minutes: Plot info on an empathy map\nAsk them to plot results on the empathy map right after the interview. This is a great way to re-think the interview and reflect.\n\n\n\n\nEXTREME USER\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users. Who are the people who use this product every day? \nFor example, if you are making a new cleat, you definitely want to talk to people who play sports (kids, parents who buy them, university students, etc…), but you would probably want to talk to people who LIVE in cleats too. Take professional athletes for example, they know every part of their shoes because they wear them for hours every day. They know about what they love and hate about them. \nLet’s take another example. If we were designing a new type of seat in a car, who would the extreme user be? --- allow them to answer. Taxi drivers live in their cars. All day long they are sitting in the seats and probably know really specific details of what makes them comfortable or not. They might even share ideas on how it could be better.\nWhile creating your user research plan, make sure to include extreme users!\nYou will want to include at least 1-2 extreme users into your research plan.\n\n------------------------------------\nNotes about Extreme Users to help facilitate discussion, no need to explain them all:\n\nWhen considering the user's needs in design, it’s very easy for a designer to fall into the trap of designing for the first, average user they can think of. \nOnly by understanding the viewpoints of a full range of people is it possible to avoid the pitfall of designing for yourself. \nThrough speaking to the extreme users and identifying their amplified needs, it can help pull out more meaningful insights and thus gives the potential to push ideas in different directions that you wouldn’t have previously explored. \nThis group of users can help spark creativity by introducing you to hacks and use cases you wouldn’t have imagined. \nIn the hope of trying to please the mainstream, which is still a very diverse group, it’s all too easy to end up designing something generic and easy to replicate.\nAn idea that suits an extreme user is more likely to please the mainstream users too. \nBy focusing on the extremes, you can find the highest priority issues. Most commonly, the high priority issue is what motivates people to buy this thing, and what is keeping them from buying this thing?\nExtreme user's are most in-tune with their needs, emotions and behaviors when using a product or service and can, therefore, articulate needs/challenges better. \n\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user.\nAsking the user to design for you.\nAsking the user to respond to your idea.\nUSER RESEARCH IS NOT:\n3 minutes: Remember!\n\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user. \nRemember you want to make sure they are talking, not you!\nDon’t assume things, allow them to share their own experiences\n\nAsking the user to design for you\nDon’t ask your interviewer what they think the solution is\nDon’t have them list features\nYOU are the designer! You need to gather information from people to create the solution that will best fit their needs. By asking others to design for you, you stunt your creativity and can come up with generic solutions.\n\nAsking the user to respond to your idea\nAvoid asking the user if they like your idea. Any person will just say “yes, I like it” or “yes, I will use/buy this”\nIn general, people are polite, so you shouldn’t trust what they say in that way. Make sure the questions are framed in a way where you are just focusing on the challenges they are facing and learning about how they are currently dealing with them.\nYou should NOT give an explanation of your idea in a user interview.\n\n\n\n\n3 places to immerse\n30 people to interview \n5 extreme users\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nSpend the rest of the session writing your user research questions and practicing with other people in the cohort  (we will also do this tomorrow morning)\nPractice your user research on at least 5 members of the cohort\nGive each other feedback on their interview style. Help them ask the right questions and dig deeper.\n\nResearch: \nCreate your research plan (They should come tomorrow morning with a DO, LOOK, LISTEN research plan that they will begin to implement tomorrow!)\nHow will you experience your customers' pains (DO?)\nWhere can you observe your customers (LOOK)?\nWhere will you go to speak to users (LISTEN)?At least \n30 user interviews needed (not including friends and family)!\n20-30 minutes per interview\nInclude 5 extreme users\n\nYou will have this week and the next to implement your research plan. You need at least 30 interviews. Go deep in these interviews. They should last 20-30 minutes each! If you are stuck, ask why. Go deeper. \n\nHow to structure a user interview.\nInterview guide.\nInterview examples and extra tips.\n\nHANDOUTS\nInstructions for a qualitative \nuser research interview:\nEmail these resources to the group at the end of the session, or before the session begins. \n"
