      "content": "Summarize the topic of these notes from a discussion. and give one main takeaway from each person in the group: \nWhitney discern meaning purpose in their lives\nEd - LPI - paris working on community supporting inner development for doing and changemaking\nPinar turkey- Private university - teach a first year course on how to transition from highschool/college. Lots of transitions family/political situation in turkey. Transition is front and center at work. National resource center for students u south carolina\nSoyun - mondragon - university is about establishing a company. It’s required to make an ikigai. Each year we moved to a different city we experience a lot of transitions. I am a south korean coming to europe and feeling lots of transitions. To build an kikigai was a challenge. Interested in how to build shared values / personal values in a constructive values. \nFrom Brazil:l Transition is important for me. I work with students How to answer questions about purpose/values in my classroom and curious about Ikigai. \nRandy from Georgetown. 10 years i’ve been leading a unit about innovation in education to reimagine what holistic education looks like. Purpose in life is the center of it. \nPep: Barcelona - business school . Jesuit working on Vocation - trying to offer holistic meaning to students. Discernments vocation in Ikigai - something i like/do easily/that serves the world. \nPascal: What you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, what you can get paid for.\nFor the last 5 years I’ve done 300 workshops for students. How can we help people go through this process and as a facilitator help people facilitate it with the least amount of stress. \nIn sept I’m doing it for 2500 other people by building an app (spacholding technology) do with self, group, larger classroom - reflect with each element in peer to peer discussions. \nContinue around the idea of vocation. \nWhat i’ve learned over the years about what is purpose. What we acn do to find it. \nSoyun: Identity crisis common experience because we’re doing entrepreneurship / innovation. Under pressure to make a project and social impact, throughout the process everyone has different purpose. Team process. Make a shared value, to pursue a shared objective. Make a mission vision value. Lots of input coming in, not enough output something coming from the university. I need to reflect myself. I experienced a lot of things traveling without getting some feedback. Sometimes it’s difficult to have a dialog because we don’t have time to think abou tit. It’s not as valued to talk about things. f\nBilal: Right of passage. What if we don’t know that we are able to be good at something, what’s the meta \nPascal: Responsability - what do you care enough about that you want to care enough about to do something about. Climate change. Can be a deep seated concern. \nPascal: Responsibility - response - ability - dollar and skill. \nIndividual was a child. Rites of passage - member of the community. I make it too easy for people to get to a result. \nBilal: results of passage where people get a new name\nPep: leading a team of 10 professors. Teaching a course makes them reflect on their values. What they have been living in these four years incorporating their vision of life and what actions they want to take in the future. - Rites of passage between the end of university and the start of the working life. Many have taken decisions. When you have an inner noise inside you - it’s a time for a transition. How can you make a right of passage to transition? We do it at the end of the school. Some students say we should have done it at the beginning of the course. \nWe need to convince program managers to share it when they want to go to an internship/exchange. Give them space to ask them fundamental issues, about their values. To use to make good decisions. \nBilal: don’t die young, live your values. Each year you live against your values doesn’t count as life. \nPascal: where money currently lies represents what society currently values. We hopefully get wiser as a society. Old world dollars. New world (world) game B. Game A pays better than Game B. \nPep: U theory - otto sharma - emerging future. Society and individual is stuck. \nBilal: We probably need to get deeper into the value chain (food, construction, infrastructure) - then the money\n",

      "content": "The discussion appears to center around the concept of transitioning, personal growth, and the idea of \"Ikigai\" which is a Japanese concept that means \"reason for being\" and encompasses the intersection of what you love, what the world needs, what you are good at, and what you can be paid for.

      "content": "Here are a few possible action steps that the group could take for their next conversation, based on the points raised in the previous discussion:\n\n1. **Deepen the Discussion on Transitions**: Given the diverse experiences with transitions in the group, more focused discussions could provide deeper insights. Participants could prepare by reflecting on their personal experiences or bring relevant research or case studies.\n\n2. **Explore the Concept of Ikigai Further**: Participants could share their experiences of how they discovered their Ikigai and the impact it has had on their lives. They could also consider discussing how the concept could be integrated into educational curricula or personal development programs.\n\n3. **Share Strategies on Teaching Transitions and Values**: Participants like Pinar, Soyun, and the participant from Brazil who are involved in education could share their strategies for teaching students about transitions and instilling values.\n\n4. **Discuss the Application of Technology in Facilitating Ikigai Discovery**: Pascal could share more about his app, its functionalities, and get feedback from the group. It could open up discussions on how technology can assist in personal development and self-discovery.\n\n5. **Explore Rites of Passage in Different Cultures**: Bilal brought up the concept of rites of passage. It could be enlightening to discuss how different cultures approach rites of passage and what roles they play in personal development and transition.\n\n6. **Dive Deeper into the Concept of Responsibility**: The group could explore what it means to take responsibility, both on an individual level and a societal one, especially in relation to critical issues like climate change.\n\n7. **Plan a Workshop or Simulation**: Pascal, with his experience in running workshops, could lead a practical session where participants go through a process of self-discovery, Ikigai identification, or engage in a simulated transition or rite of passage.\n\n8. **Identify and Discuss Challenges**: From the last conversation, it is clear that the group faces challenges such as lack of time for reflection and dialogue, difficulties in teaching transitions and values, and societal pressures. Addressing these issues head-on could lead to solutions or strategies for improvement.\n\n9. **Create a Follow-Up Plan**: To keep the momentum going, it could be beneficial to decide on what the next steps should be after each discussion – whether that's further research, applying what was learned, or preparing for the next topic of discussion. \n\nThese action steps can create a roadmap for a meaningful and productive conversation in the future.",
