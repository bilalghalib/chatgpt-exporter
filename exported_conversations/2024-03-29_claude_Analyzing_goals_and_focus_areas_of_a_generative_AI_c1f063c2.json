It is a pre-requirement that you have a Live WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) on the WhatsApp Business Platform (API) before the commencement of the Accelerator. Turn.io can assist with onboarding if needed.\nApplicants for the programme should have an existing digital service (not necessarily AI-powered).\nDoes our program need to be at a specific scale?\nWe prefer organizations with a live WhatsApp Business Account and are ready or have the ability to scale via WhatsApp.\nThe Chat for Impact Accelerator exclusively targets the development of services for the WhatsApp Business Platform (API).\nDo we need to have it all figured out yet?\nNo, but we need to be confident that you have a committed and agile team with a suitable starting point and the tenacity and ability to iterate and learn.\nYou will receive input during the 8-week accelerator to help you grow and achieve your goals.\nWe are interested in why you are the right team to support and invest in.\nDo we need to be operating in specific countries?\nNo, but we prefer organizations with the most significant impact and that operate in countries where WhatsApp is socially well-adopted and actively used.\nDo we need to have multilingual or single-language programs?\nIt does not matter how many languages you operate in, but it matters that your program has a clear roadmap on who it is serving and why you are doing it in specific languages.\nDo we need to be tech-savvy to be considered?\nNo, both small and big, tech-savvy or new-to-digital organizations can use WhatsApp successfully.\nYou must have a strong business case/theory of change for using digital messaging such as WhatsApp.\nHowever, applicants for the programme should have an existing digital service (not necessarily AI-powered).\nWhat are we committing to?\nThe 8-week Accelerator Program will require two dedicated team members to attend all weekly sessions (60-90 mins per session).\nThese will be group sessions hosted online on dates made available in advance.\nAttend weekly Office hours with expert team members. (30 -60 min per session)\nComplete all pre-work assignments before each session. It should take 1-2 hours to complete.\nComplete all homework assignments during the Accelerator period.\nThe end goal of the Accelerator is to demo your WhatsApp use case to a selected audience and complete a case study to share learnings.\nPreparing for this will require time outside of the Accelerator hours. Therefore, plan to design and build your demo at least 1-2 hours daily.\nWho in our team should attend?\nThe ideal combination is a business lead (i.e., a team member with a strategic focus and decision-making ability) and a technical lead (i.e., an operational, hands-on team member responsible for implementing your service).\nCan more than two team members attend?\nYes, organizations are encouraged to have a core team of at least two members for consistent attendance, but you can invite additional team members to specific sessions as needed.\nWhat are the attendance requirements?\nApart from the time commitment explained above, you will require a computer with internet access and sufficient data to attend all virtual sessions on a conference tool such as Zoom. Ideally, your connection and data will allow you to attend the sessions with your video on.\nIs signing up for a WhatsApp Business API account compulsory after the Accelerator?\nIt is a selection criteria to have a live WABA account. So please note that your application will only be selected if you have an existing WABA. If a WhatsApp service is not a strategic objective for your organization for 2024, then there will be other opportunities to apply for another accelerator when your organization is ready.\nCan we apply if we are using or planning to use the WhatsApp Business App (not the API)?\nThe Chat for Impact Accelerator exclusively targets the development of services for the WhatsApp Business Platform (API).\nWhat is a Business Service Provider (BSP)?\nBusiness Service Providers (BSPs) are third-party solution providers with expertise in the WhatsApp Business API. BSPs, like Turn.io, can help you communicate with your customers on WhatsApp for the approved use cases of customer support and time-sensitive, personalized notifications.\nDo we need to use Turn.io as a BSP?\nTurn.io is hosting the Chat for GenAI Accelerator, and you will receive a Turn License for the duration of the Accelerator. All hands-on sessions and the building of your chatbot will be on the Turn.io platform. For this purpose, you must use Turn.io as your Business Solution Provider (BSP) after the Accelerator.\nWhat is the WhatsApp Business API, and why select it as the means of communication?\nThe WhatsApp Business API powers communication with users worldwide so that you can connect with them on WhatsApp in a simple, secure, and reliable way.\nThe WhatsApp Business API is a paid product. However, as part of the Accelerator, you will be granted a subsidized license for up to 6 months; further use of the API may result in monthly fees and/or messaging fees.\nWhat type of messaging is allowed on the WhatsApp Business API?\nWhatsApp is designed for simple, secure and reliable messaging. This includes one-on-one communication and chatbots with a clear escalation path to a human. Please refer to the WhatsApp Commerce Policy and WhatsApp Business Policy to familiarise yourself with the types of messages that are and are not allowed on the WhatsApp Business API.\nWill another Chat for Impact Accelerators be hosted?\nWe may or may not do this in the future again. Follow us on LinkedIn to stay up to date with Accelerator news.\nWe were part of a previous Accelerator cohort. Can we apply?\nUnfortunately if you are an Accelerator Alumni, your application will not be considered.\nWe are already a Turn.io client; can we apply?\nYes, you are welcome to apply.\nWhat are the key factors that will be considered for selection?\nIdeal applicants are social impact organizations working in health, education, and economic mobility with a well-defined theory of change or business case. They should be committed to leveraging AI to support a secure, private, personalized WhatsApp chat service. Candidates should demonstrate a strong commitment to building real-world chat applications and possess the organizational capacity to participate in the accelerator programme and sustain the chat service long-term. Applicants for the program should have an existing digital service (not necessarily AI-powered).\nWhy was our application not successful?\nThere is no straightforward answer to this question as there are various factors, and the program is highly competitive, e.g., if you didn’t answer all the questions or did not follow the application guidelines.\nWe were unsuccessful, can we still get started on WhatsApp?\nNothing stops you from applying for a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) through any Business Service Provider (BSP), including Turn.io, or from starting to use the WhatsApp Business App. Furthermore, if we host another Chat for Impact Accelerator and Summit, you are welcome to apply again.\nDo you give feedback on application results?\nYou will receive email communication from us on whether you were successful or not. However, we will not provide detailed feedback on why your application was successful or unsuccessful.\nWhen do applications close?\nAll applications received by midnight on the 31st of March 2024 will be considered."

            "extracted_content": "Based on the detailed information about the GenAI Accelerator program and your goal to pitch a self-mentorship program for entrepreneurs, here's an approach you might consider:\n\nFocus Areas:\nAlignment with Target Sectors: Emphasize how your self-mentorship program can significantly impact economic mobility, which is one of the key sectors of interest for the accelerator. Explain how entrepreneurs empowered through your program can contribute to economic growth and social improvement.\nInnovative Use of AI: Highlight how you plan to incorporate AI, particularly large language models, into your self-mentorship program. For instance, AI could be used for personalized guidance, automated mentor matching, or providing dynamic resources and support.\nScalability and Impact: Detail how your program can be scaled to reach a broader audience. Address how the grant and resources from the accelerator will help in expanding your reach and increasing the program's impact.\nSafety, Privacy, and Ethics: Given the emphasis on AI safety and equity in the accelerator, ensure to mention how your program will adhere to ethical standards, ensure user privacy, and promote inclusive access.\nSustainability and Long-Term Vision: Discuss the long-term sustainability of your program. This includes your business model, plans for post-program growth, and how you intend to maintain and scale the impact beyond the accelerator’s support.\nTechnical and Organizational Readiness: Since existing digital services are a criterion, highlight your team’s expertise and readiness to develop and manage the AI-powered chat service.\nStylistic Elements for Writing:\nClear and Concise: Be straightforward and succinct, avoiding unnecessary jargon or overly complex explanations.\nImpact-Driven Narrative: Use a storytelling approach that underscores the real-world impact of your program. Share potential success stories or testimonials to make it relatable.\nData-Driven: Where possible, include data or statistics to back up your claims, especially when discussing the potential impact or scalability.\nProfessional Yet Passionate Tone: While maintaining professionalism, let your passion for the cause and belief in the program’s potential shine through.\nVisually Engaging: Include infographics or visual aids that can help illustrate your program’s mechanics or projected impact in an easy-to-digest manner.\nCall to Action: End with a compelling call to action that resonates with the goals of the accelerator.\nRemember, your application should reflect not just what you plan to do, but also why it matters in the broader context of education, health, and economic mobility, and how it aligns with the accelerator's mission to transform lives using AI.\nUser\nmake a table of what you think they'd expect in applications and rank them with their impact scores. think step by step about their scoring criteria and make the empty table\n\nChatGPT\nHere is an empty table representing the scoring criteria that the GenAI Accelerator might expect in applications, along with a column for you to fill in the impact scores on a scale of 1 to 10.

Usually, that is the job of a trainer or mentor, someone with experience who can map a space for them and show them how to get from what they know now to where they need to go next. Helping teams understand how genAI’s embeddings work and the implications offers them the ability to “mentor themselves” - while learning in a community with others is fun, being stuck waiting for limited mentor time is not. We are making learning a collective adventure. We believe GenAI can help learners find and surf their growth edge, sustain flow states, and learn what they need to impact their social enterprises positively.\n\n\n\nDescribe your business case/theory of change \n90/150 words\nGenAI will transform education along the same vector previous technologies have -> more democratic, more personalized, with increased human connection. In the Middle Ages, a prince may have had a tutor, in the Industrial Era the printing press made books accessible to those with disposable income, later cultural innovations like the Public Library increased access to knowledge and brought people together in learning spaces, the internet brought Wikipedia and edEx and learning communities to our fingertips, and we genAII has the potential bring us back to each \"prince\" having their own \"tutor”. We believe that chat groups with learner models defined and managed by LLMs can help guide group conversations toward individual and collective learning. I call them parliaments where people can enter rooms and talk to each other, LLMs, and Mentors - depending on the need and context of the current conversation. \n\n\nDescribe your funding sources and financial sustainability plans for the project post-accelerator\n*\nMax 150 words\n\nDescribe the specific solution you are looking to test using GenAi and WhatsApp. E.g. details about the implementation, timelines, key milestones, or any anticipated technical challenges.\nMax 150 words\nWe propose integrating GenAI into WhatsApp Business to enhance self-mentorship within our accelerator program. GenAI will guide participants toward self-discovery and mastery development through customized prompts and interactions. The implementation involves collaborating with GenAI's team to customize responses and ensure seamless integration with WhatsApp. Key milestones include developing and testing the chatbot, piloting with a small group, and scaling up across all cohorts. Challenges include ensuring contextually relevant responses and managing scalability. By leveraging GenAI and WhatsApp, we aim to provide participants personalized guidance, fostering a supportive community where individuals uplift each other.\n\n\nAdditional content for updating/modifying the above\nBloom is working on developing a framework to support self-mentorship and is interested in building tooling around it to help participants in the accelerator have access to a \"24-hour mentor\". Our programs are cohort-based and highly interactive, teams have access to each other, mentors, and Bloom trainers. Coordinating those conversations is done through the principle of the upside-down pyramid, where each learner is encouraged to first ask themselves, then ask their cohort, then ask their mentors before reaching out to a trainer. This allows Bloom to be highly scalable while having participants develop confidence and community. GenAI integrated into WhatsApp will allow us programmatically nudge participants towards the self-authorship and mastery developing part of the pyramid (self, community) by helping teams know the questions they didn't know they needed to ask. GenAI allows participants, through careful prompting, to learn how to \"see in the dark\" by navigating to an embedding vector space and asking the AI to \"look around\" and describe what's there they didn't know to look for. Building this process into WhatsApp business will allow Bloom’s programs to support participants to support each other in the community. \n\n\n\n\n\nScoring table:\nCriterion\nImpact Score (1-10)\nAlignment with Target Sectors\n\n\nInnovative Use of AI\n\n\nScalability and Impact\n\n\nSafety, Privacy, and Ethics\n\n\nSustainability and Long-Term Vision\n\n\nTechnical and Organizational Readiness\n\n\nTeam Experience and Commitment\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT\nYour GenAI Accelerator application is well-structured and aligns nicely with the key areas of interest for the program.

And so what we'd like to do is utilize the context of the new LLMs, the large language models that are out there to help people self-mentor and to do that in cohorts so that we preserve the excitement and the energy of an entrepreneurship program where people are able to Google the things that they didn't even know they had to Google. And to be able to do that, we need to come up with a couple of things. So the problem statement, flow state on their growth edge and that's what our goal is. The way that we're going to do it is we're going to create a progressive summarization of all of the content that Bloom has prepared over the years as a social enterprise accelerator. We have frameworks for mentors and teams and assessments that teams can take to map out their personal learning, their professional learning, their organizational status and structure, all of that content. We used to have to ask people one by one and to fill out assessments and to have mentors verify and look through all of that content and guide them and tell them, okay, given all of the context that you have given me, here's where you can go. And that bottleneck we can remove now with AI where rather than spending so much upfront time filling in all of this information, the artificial intelligence large language model can create a model of the entire backend of Bloom, all of the frameworks that we use, all of the assessments, all of the activities that we use, and then stay extremely curious about the places where it has the most amount of doubt. So the AI starts with a hundred percent doubt about being able to support this team, and then it starts asking questions and updating the model, the backend, the doubt variable, and the risks variable, and have the person that they're working with guided all along the way. So the solution is to stay in cohorts without mentors, without trainers, and be able to train and mentor yourself based on an AI that is very curious about the teams. So it's the program of you, the program of us. That's the Bloom program that we're pitching.\n\nChatGPT\nI've merged the content and written it into a markdown file.

It is hard to find enough mentors, give them enough time, and connect them with teams. Also, it is difficult to know what the teams need and when they need help.\n\nWe think using WhatsApp and special language tools can help us ask the right questions. This way, we can guide people from one step to the next. All right, our problem statement is that social entrepreneurship programs in the Middle East are limited by the number of available mentors, the number of available mentors and the number of hours they have available, and the coordination costs to connect them with the teams at the right place at the right time, as well as the limit of gathering correct and valid information about where the teams are at and what their needs are, and to be able to create that context and that moment of vulnerability for a team and to talk with a mentor and a trainer to identify their next best step.

The main issues are the scarcity of mentors, the limited time available from these mentors, and the complex coordination required to connect them with entrepreneurial teams at critical moments. Additionally, there's a challenge in accurately gauging where teams are in their development and understanding their specific needs. This often leads to missed opportunities for vital mentorship interactions that can greatly impact their growth trajectory. We propose using WhatsApp Business in conjunction with advanced large language models to overcome these challenges. This technology can guide teams through a series of well-structured inquiries, allowing them to progress step-by-step, creating the right context for meaningful mentorship.\n\nAI Mentor's Role\n\nOur AI Mentor will assist in guiding participants' thought processes, acting as an AI Librarian for teams, facilitating chat-based interactions with data, and providing suggestions from an extensive knowledge library.

AI LLMs can help people get to their growth edge, and also find the current \"edge\" of what's posisble to help people think the next thing possible to a challenge that only they can think and see. long term impact will see a more prosperous MENA with stronger leaders caring for themselves and their communities - also probably will totally change how school is done. we need to adapt to always use whatever available technology is made to move more towards the agency of the human. Help the person find and learn what they need by askign questions and being curious and getting answers that suite them - and to always do it in comunity \n\nWe plan to build a chatbot for 1-1 interactions that will help them \"google the things that they didn't even know they had to Google\" by guiding them in questions. IT will also connect them to Bloom resources in the library, fill out their assessments, and request them to post and connect on our community platform. While it's a program for YOU, it's also a program for us - we need each other as we're doing this growth. And to be able to do that, we need to come up with a couple of things. So the problem statement, flow state on their growth edge and that's what our goal is. The way that we're going to do it is we're going to create a progressive summarization of all of the content that Bloom has prepared over the years as a social enterprise accelerator.

So the solution is to stay in cohorts without mentors, without trainers, and be able to train and mentor yourself based on an AI that is very curious about the teams. So it's the program of you, the program of us. That's the Bloom program that we're pitching.\n\nFirst is to build the langchain codebase that can help us convert our SCRIBER framework into a conversational agent. Using this agent we can \"grammarly\" the persons conversation in a proactive way and create a risk minimizing and uncertianty minimizing agent which is modeling risk and uncertainty for the things of priority across all of blooms frameworks for how to run a great social enterprise program, including assessments and library activities to recomment. So the \"progressive summarization\" will include sub agents that talk in a \"family constelation\" system where they each defend reducing risk and uncertianity for priority things and that will define the next question. We have an upside down pyramid framework where the first person to ask is you, then google, then your cohort, and then mentors and trainers, the ai agent will constantly be pushing your questions down the chain and helping the person find and fill the most important things - once they have enough content to fill an entire assessment with high confidence the user can then go and see - wow, i filled this whole assessment, and wow, this activity is actually the perfect one for me on the https://bloom.pm app\n\nFirst model, and create the framework for the guessing engine curiosity mentor flock of agents\nSecond langchain\nThird integrationwith whatsapp and test iwth people\nthen build onboarding 33 at a time and see if we can scale a \"Program of Us\"\n\nChallenges is being th eonly coder and haven't used whatsapp business with agents before \n\nChatGPT\nBased on your detailed input, I've updated your application's Theory of Change and the Specific Solution sections. Let's incorporate your vision into a cohesive narrative.\n\nTheory of Change\nOur program is rooted in the belief that empowering social entrepreneurs to learn autonomously and think innovatively leads to unique, contextually relevant solutions. By utilizing AI Large Language Models (LLMs), we aim to guide participants to their 'growth edge,' exploring the frontier of what's possible in their unique contexts. This fosters novel problem-solving approaches, essential for addressing localized challenges in the MENA region.\n\nThe long-term impact envisaged is a transformation in how education and personal development are perceived and delivered. Our vision includes a MENA region enriched with resilient, self-reliant leaders nurturing their communities, potentially revolutionizing traditional schooling systems. Our adaptability lies in leveraging the latest technology to continually shift towards enhancing human agency, prioritizing individual learning needs within a supportive community.\n\nSpecific Solution with GenAi and WhatsApp\nImplementation Strategy\n\nWe intend to develop a chatbot integrated with WhatsApp Business for personalized interaction with participants. This AI-driven chatbot will guide participants in framing questions they hadn't realized they needed to ask, connecting them to Bloom's extensive resource library. The bot will facilitate filling out assessments and encourage community engagement on our platform, emphasizing the blend of individual learning integrated with WhatsApp Business for personalized interaction with participants. This AI-driven chatbot will guide participants in framing questions they hadn't realized they needed to ask, connecting them to Bloom's extensive resource library. The bot will facilitate filling out assessments and encourage community engagement on our platform, emphasizing the blend of individual learning journeys with the strength of community support.\n\nDevelopment Phases\n\nInitial Development: Build the LangChain codebase to transform our SCRIBER framework into a conversational agent. This agent will engage users in meaningful dialogue, fostering a curious and risk-aware learning environment.\nIntegration and Testing: Integrate this system with WhatsApp Business, followed by rigorous testing with selected users to ensure smooth operation and relevance.\nOnboarding and Scaling: Implement an onboarding process, gradually scaling up to accommodate more participants, while monitoring and refining the AI's interaction quality.\nAnticipated Challenges\n\nThe primary challenge is being the sole coder and lacking prior experience with WhatsApp Business's agent integration. This may require additional learning and potential collaboration for technical expertise. Managing the complexity of the AI's guessing engine, ensuring it remains aligned with the participants' learning priorities, and maintaining a balance between technology-driven guidance and human interaction will also be critical.\n\nBy focusing on these refined sections, your application will present a clear, comprehensive vision of your objectives and methodologies.\n\n\n\nUser\nlet's work on this next:\nDescribe your business case/theory of change\n*\nMax 150 words\n\nFirst review all the content we have and then ask me 4 questions to get a good result that matches their needs and the criteria table we made\n\nChatGPT\nReviewing the content we've discussed, it's clear that your project is focused on leveraging AI and WhatsApp to enhance mentorship in social entrepreneurship, especially in the MENA region. The aim is to enable entrepreneurs to self-mentor and connect with peers, overcoming the limitations of traditional mentorship models.\n\nTo refine your business case/theory of change within the 150-word limit, here are four questions:\n\nCore Impact: How do you envision the AI-enhanced mentorship fundamentally changing the learning and development process for social entrepreneurs in the MENA region?\nScalability and Sustainability: Can you describe how this AI-WhatsApp model can be scaled sustainably, ensuring it remains effective as it grows?\nMeasurable Outcomes: What specific, measurable outcomes do you hope to achieve through this program? How will you track and evaluate its success?\nLong-Term Vision: Beyond the immediate impact, what is your long-term vision for this AI-driven approach? How do you see it evolving and contributing to the broader field of social entrepreneurship education?\nYour answers will help craft a concise, compelling theory of change that aligns with your application's objectives and criteria.\nUser\nanswers:\nEmpowering Minds with AI\n\nOur project will help more people by using WhatsApp AI and a new Socratic method. This way, people can learn to think for themselves and become leaders. Many people in the developing world only learn by memorizing, but our project will help them think better.\n\nWe also want people to understand themselves, the world, and share their values. This will help everyone reach their full potential. Our project can be used by many people, not just for business but also for other things.\n\nWe will make a tool that helps people learn quickly and easily. We want to see if people feel more confident and can solve problems after using our project. Our goal is for people to not need help from WhatsApp in the future, but instead use what they learned from our project.\n\nIn the end, we want our project to teach people how to think and learn better using new technology.\n\n-------\n\nOriginal Transcript\n\n\nOkay, so the core impact of our project is that we will be increasing access and scale through both WhatsApp AI and fundamentally also creating the context where we can now verify a new Socratic method. So the Socratic method used to be hypothetical, it's like a wishful thinking that, ah, all of the knowledge is within you and you could ask it. But an LLM Socrates that helps you ask and Google and find the right information, helps you think for yourself, is really a huge impact and really supports leadership. Most of the developing world has been brought up with rote learning, memorization, and this process will allow people that have been suppressed in their exposure to be exposed and suppressed in terms of their ability to think, to be able to think. And with those two things combined, along with a focus on understanding oneself and understanding the world and speaking publicly about our values, I believe that we will see a unlocking of real human potential. Speaking of sustainability, as long as the model is out there in a way where not only the current WhatsApp business model can use it, but other people can use it, I believe that this conversational AI can be adapted to other use cases and not just entrepreneurship. Anything that we can work with to define the frameworks underpinning the pedagogy and the curriculum can be built in into the single page summarization curiosity engine. I want to measure people's self-confidence before and after. I want to measure people's ability to figure it out and we can ask them these questions before and after, because really I don't want to give them the solutions. I want them to be solutionizing. I want to have a course with them where they leave more empowered, where they actually embody the principles of appropriate GPT usage or appropriate language usage so that they don't even need the WhatsApp business crutch. So the WhatsApp business trains them on using a Scriber framework that creates the Socratic method that comes from within when they use the LLMs in the future. And that's the long term vision, is a backend \"Socratic Grammarly\" langchain process that anyone can install as an accompaniment into their pedagogies which will help people self determine their ideal course through their learning journies in an adaptive way where the choice is with them at all times and the inspiration comes from doing it together in community where peopel can high five each other. Using the single page summarization to include evidence and the kinds of badges that people can have access to if/when they do x/y/z things can add an element of motivation and public visibility - increasing awareness and scale of the Socratic LLM Engine and whatsapp access point\n\nChatGPT\nBased on your detailed responses, here's a concise version for the business case/theory of change section, aligning with your vision and objectives:\n\nBusiness Case/Theory of Change (150 words)\nOur initiative harnesses AI through WhatsApp to revolutionize learning in social entrepreneurship. Moving beyond traditional rote memorization, our approach fosters critical thinking and leadership, crucial for the developing world. This project isn't just about business acumen; it's a transformative journey towards self-awareness, world understanding, and value articulation.\n\nBy implementing a Socratic method powered by AI, we enable individuals to find answers from within, guiding them to think independently. This empowerment is vital for unlocking human potential. Our tool isn't limited to entrepreneurship; its adaptable nature means it can enhance learning in various fields.\n\nWe aim to boost self-confidence and problem-solving abilities, shifting learners from dependency on external aid to self-reliance. Our vision is a community-driven learning model, where the AI acts as a \"Socratic Grammarly,\" seamlessly integrating into diverse educational frameworks, encouraging autonomous learning paths, and celebrating achievements in a supportive environment.

This project isn't just an educational tool; it's a stepping stone towards a more empowered, thoughtful society. \n\nChatGPT\nAs a Tech-Savvy Social Visionary, this persona would provide a critique based on the intersection of technology's cutting-edge potential and its social impact. Here’s how they might score your application according to the original criteria, along with three additional criteria they might consider:\n\nCriterion\tImpact Score (1-10)\tNotes\nAlignment with Target Sectors\t8\tAligns well with educational and social entrepreneurship sectors.\nInnovative Use of AI\t9\tExcellent integration of AI in education.\nScalability and Impact\t8\tPotential for significant impact, but scalability needs clearer articulation.\nSafety, Privacy, and Ethics\t7\tAddresses ethics, but more detail on privacy and safety measures needed.\nSustainability and Long-Term Vision\t9\tVision is strong, focusing on long-term societal transformation.\nTechnical and Organizational Readiness\t7\tSolid, but could benefit from more detail on technical readiness.\nTeam Experience and Commitment\t8\tTeam seems committed, but experience in AI integration could be expanded.\nCommunity Engagement\t8\tGood, but could emphasize more on community feedback mechanisms.\nInclusivity and Accessibility\t7\tAddresses inclusivity; however, more details on accessibility would strengthen it.\nInnovation in Learning Methods\t9\tVery innovative approach to learning, especially with AI-driven Socratic method.\nThe Tech-Savvy Social Visionary might then pose these three questions:\n\nHow will you ensure that the AI-driven Socratic method remains adaptable to diverse cultural and educational backgrounds, ensuring that it is as effective in different global contexts?\nIn what ways are you planning to measure and evaluate the impact of this AI-powered learning tool, particularly in terms of long-term changes in critical thinking and problem-solving skills among learners?\nCan you elaborate on the specific safety and privacy measures you'll implement to protect user data, given the sensitive nature of personal learning paths and the involvement of AI in this process?\nThese questions aim to deepen the understanding of the project's adaptability, effectiveness, and commitment to ethical considerations, crucial factors for a Tech-Savvy Social Visionary.\nUser\nEnhancing Data Privacy Project\n\nWe have a project about keeping private information safe. We change names and IDs into a special code. We save only important parts, not all the details. Tell us your ideas to make it better.\n\n-------\n\nOriginal Transcript\n\n\nThe project and the data structures on our assessments, hashing all private information names and IDs, saving only embeddings, not raw data, and I'd like some opinions on how to do that better as well, actually. So feel free to offer your thoughts.\n\nChatGPT\nEnhancing data privacy in\n\n1 / 2\n\nUser\nWhat do you think the impact measures our persona is most interested in around entrepreneurship and around mentorship and education? And what do you think my impact measures might be that could best align with them? And then ask me three questions that could help me get better alignment with the impact measures the persona wants. Ask me the questions the persona would ask to make sure that there is alignment.\n\nChatGPT\nThe Tech-Savvy Social Visionary likely focuses on impact measures around innovation, scalability, and social impact in entrepreneurship and mentorship. They probably value how technology, especially AI, can transform traditional learning and mentorship processes.\n\nYour impact measures might include the effectiveness of AI in fostering independent thinking, the scalability of your program across different regions or sectors, and the tangible improvements in entrepreneurial skills and self-reliance of participants.\n\nHere are three questions the Tech-Savvy Social Visionary might ask for better alignment:\n\n\"How do you envision your AI tool measuring and demonstrating improved critical thinking and problem-solving skills in participants? Could you provide specific metrics or examples?\"\n\"In terms of scalability, how adaptable is your AI model to different cultural contexts and educational needs outside of entrepreneurship? Can it be effectively implemented in diverse settings?\"\n\"Could you explain how the AI-driven Socratic method will not only aid in immediate learning goals but also ensure long-term retention and application of entrepreneurial skills in real-world scenarios?\"\nThese questions aim to align your project's impact with the persona's interests in innovative education and effective mentorship.\nUser\nYeah, so similar to the way that we are moving assessments off of the platform and into these approaches where the AI is trying to guess and do their best to find reasons that the person scores X, Y, or Z on X, Y, or Z point, we can use similar approaches for validated assessments around self-entrepreneurship, agency, critical thinking, thinking for yourself, and we can have that not be a direct question, but an indirect question that the AI as one of its flock of AIs be constantly inquiring about, and potentially if it finds a way to embed a question that can be in line, in context with the thing that we're trying to measure, we could do that and then have that be a part of it. And this is how we can also make it relevant for other approaches. It's like, it's just a way of thinking with a couple of different elements around this flock of AIs that has the ability to say, OK, what are you interested in measuring while the person's interested in doing the thing that they want to be doing anyway? And let's see how we can get as close to what they're doing anyway to ask a side question that will be able to indirectly answer the question that we're looking for, that we want to measure.\n\nChatGPT\nYour approach to assessments sounds innovative and adaptable. It seems like you're aiming for a method where AI subtly gauges and enhances key skills like critical thinking and entrepreneurship without being intrusive. This could effectively measure participant progress in a more natural, context-driven manner. To further refine this, consider the following:\n\nIntegration with Diverse Learning Styles: How will your AI cater to different learning styles and cultural backgrounds to ensure its questions and guidance are universally effective and relevant?\nBalancing AI Guidance with Human Interaction: How do you plan to balance the AI's role with the human elements in the learning process? While AI can guide and ask questions, the human aspect of mentorship is also crucial.\nLong-Term Impact Tracking: Beyond the immediate program, how will you track the long-term impact of your AI mentorship on the participants' entrepreneurial journey? Do you have a mechanism to follow up and evaluate their progress post-program?\nAddressing these aspects could make your program more robust, ensuring it aligns well with the diverse needs of participants while effectively utilizing AI.\nUser\nRewrite the entire application using the content that I have just given you.\n\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let's revise the application with your insights and content.

Let's go back to using that. Also, can we start thinking about the type of things that we want to do for the impact statement and also funding sources and financial sustainability? I think funding sources would be the projects that are already in our pipeline and the overhead that comes from it. And we already have resources in terms of allocating dev time to this project that would be already paid for and would be a source of funding that is kind of in parallel. And that the post-process accelerator sustainability plan is that it would actually be a way to support Bloom from becoming a non-profit accelerator into a non-profit accelerator that provides value where we incorporate the cost of GPT use cases into the type of applications for the grants that we're getting. And then afterwards, teams can continue to use them. I also believe that in developing this technology, it will make the Bloom pool and the Bloom goal-based learning and flock-of-agents Socratic method to help someone learn while achieving the goal the things that they need to learn but they don't know how to ask to learn. It would be helpful for a general learning platform, and we could actually create an API around it and allow people to use it through an API.\n\nChatGPT\nGreat, let's refine the application with your new insights and directions. We'll reintegrate the robust problem statement and develop the impact statement, funding sources, and sustainability plan:\n\nGen AI Accelerator Application\nApplication for: genai-accelerator-24\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nIn the Middle East, our program aims to transform social entrepreneurship education through AI-driven learning.

It underscores your commitment to enhancing the quality and accessibility of mentorship in social entrepreneurship.\nUser\nSo Bloom has been working to take what would normally be a common curriculum, and to make everyone do the same lesson in sequence from lesson 1 to lesson 10, and create a method so that people can do the lesson that they need to do right now, rather than do the thing that is the easiest for the teacher to do, because you only have one teacher. This, a lot alike, is why schools are the way they are, where custom education is really difficult. Now, usually people try to resolve that by having smaller classroom sizes. We believe that it's possible for a teacher with good frameworks to be able to switch into each and every individual student by taking an assessment, having a view of the knowledge of the student, articulated both by the student in qualitative and quantitative terms by taking an assessment, and then using that assessment map with a database to tag elements in an existing library to create learning experiences by doing that. This is our current system. As you can see, we are still hitting the bottleneck in terms of mentorship and training hours. We do not have a completely autonomous system. When you come into Bloom, nothing happens. Nothing happens until a facilitator asks you a question. Now, with large language models, we can ask questions, and we can turn on the question asking by having a flock of seagulls, a flock of AI agents approach, where each agent has a curiosity variable, a risk variable, and a priority variable. Now, what will someone do when they come onto this engine? Well, it really depends on their goal. So for us, the goals of people that apply to our programs, they're social entrepreneurs. They want to have a successful social enterprise, and often the goal needs to be clarified, and the goal needs to be focused on something that they can do during the time period that they are with us, their resources, and their capacities. And so all of that figuring out usually happens with a mentor and a trainer, and with our system that I'm proposing here is a lot of that could happen through our AI agents, and our AI agents could use the emotions-to-values process to figure out what people care about so that we can create a true goal. And then from that true goal, as someone strives towards it, they usually have to learn stuff. So if you want an apple, you need to figure out how to get into the tree and pick the apple. If you want to scratch your nose and you're a baby, you have to figure that out. If you have gas and pressure, you have to learn to fart. So these have a goal, and sometimes they're externally motivated, sometimes internally motivated, emotionally motivated, and once you have a goal, then you can start learning. And learning happens through these different frameworks. We want to make sure that we have a framework that's robust enough, that contains enough elements inside of it that are holistic to kind of represent the domain that a person is working within, but also allow them to explore. And so it will have these guesses for all of the domains, and their assumed starting point is always zero. I have no idea what the person's skill is or the level of competence is for this levee level of competence is for this level. But because of that, we can use this WhatsApp business AI chat structure so that when somebody comes on the Zoom, they don't just come and nothing happens. They can actually come onto the Zoom, and people will start talking to them. They can send them direct links, because we can store all of that in what I'm calling kind of the participant context window, or the participant frame. And that participant frame has a bunch of different elements in it that Blue has already structured with our processes. So we have the personal and the professional frameworks, and we have the assessments for all of them. And then what we can do is from those assessments, we can then fill in those questions while they talk. And of course, it will be a conversation. We can take in all of the implications of their questions about their family or their backgrounds, even some private and personal information. We can make educated guesses about that are justified. And so this context window not only will have the guess and the confidence measure, it will then have the evidence. And the evidence is going to be a bunch of direct quotes from the participants. And this context window will then have agents for each of the elements. Both the assessments are going to have an agent. An activity is going to have an agent. An individual question will have an agent. And those agents will be second-guessing themselves all the time, and then they'll be talking with each other and trying to coordinate who's going to ask the next best question. And so in this kind of tree-based structure going all the way down to the most granular, everyone's going to be defending their standpoint until we have it percolate all the way up, and then the AI agent will speak to the individual and be able to address that current gap. Now, the AI agent shouldn't be asking all the time. For instance, our mentors, we direct them through an upside-down pyramid process. You have to ask people first what they think, and then you ask them, did they do their homework and research online? And then did you ask your other fellows in the course? And then you can ask the mentor, and then if the mentor wants, they can ask the trainer after that. And so we always, even in our courses, are trying to push people down the upside-down pyramid to be asking themselves first, personally, because that is where their agency is. That's where they're going to develop leadership. That's where we're going to be able to learn how to learn. And if you don't push the arrow down that way, then you just get a bunch of people asking for outside answers, which is not what we want. And then we can even have assessments that frame the impact measures that we're looking for. These are going to be also there defending their right to remove their doubt. And once they have removed their doubt about the different variables and defended with evidence why they think this person is thinking for themselves, then perhaps we don't necessarily need to do it. And the additional element on top of all of this is the Scriber framework, which is a sort of grammarly-like approach to help people prompt. So when they're talking back to the AI, not only will the AI have to ask them the right questions, the AI needs to guide them to respond with the right response. And if they do it naturally, then it's great. But it's sort of like someone holding your pencil and making sure you know how to trace the letters of the alphabet before you do it on your own. Instead of having them ask for answers or write very short sentences that have no real meaning, the AI can not let them send that message or respond, I'm sorry, but that doesn't actually qualify as a good prompt. Please respond again. You violated the X principle of the Scriber framework. Or it could even suggest when it talks back and asks a question, it could suggest one of the elements in the Scriber framework that would be helpful. So for instance, the Scriber framework has a C in the Scribers for converge and diverge. And that is to create a bunch of questions and then ask the AI to help you pick one. And so this way, they will actually use the Scriber framework inside of WhatsApp chat to be able to fill out all of the sub elements that are in the Bloom platform. And this is what we're building.\n\n\nChatGPT\nIntegrating this extensive explanation into your application provides a comprehensive view of Bloom's approach to personalized education, mentorship, and learning autonomy. Your methodology, leveraging AI to enhance individual learning paths, is both innovative and practical. Let's encapsulate this narrative into a cohesive segment for your application:\n\nApplication Segment: AI Integration in Learning and Mentorship\nIntroduction to Bloom's Methodology\n\nAt Bloom, we've evolved beyond conventional curricula that constrain learners to a fixed sequence of lessons. Our aim is to provide education tailored to individual needs, allowing learners to engage with lessons pertinent to their immediate requirements. This personalized approach confronts the traditional limitations of education, where custom learning solutions are typically hampered by logistical challenges.\n\nAI-Driven Personalized Mentorship\n\nOur solution harnesses AI technology within WhatsApp to initiate a dynamic, responsive learning environment. Here's how it works:\n\nGoal-Oriented Learning: Learners define their objectives, whether it's launching a successful social enterprise or achieving specific personal milestones. AI agents use these goals to tailor the learning experience.\nFlock of AI Agents: We employ a multitude of AI agents, each with distinct roles—questioning, risk assessment, prioritizing. These agents work collectively to facilitate learning, constantly recalibrating their approach based on learner interaction and progress.\nThe Participant Frame: Each learner's journey is captured in a unique participant frame, a comprehensive digital profile enriched with assessments, personal narratives, and direct quotes. This frame is the basis for AI agents to formulate targeted queries and learning activities.\nContinuous Interaction: Interaction isn’t passive. Our AI agents guide learners to inquire within themselves first, fostering a sense of agency and leadership. This aligns with Bloom’s upside-down pyramid approach, which emphasizes self-inquiry as a precursor to external assistance.\nScriber Framework Integration: The AI not only poses questions but also mentors learners on crafting effective responses, embedding the Scriber framework’s principles into the conversation. This promotes deeper, more meaningful engagement and learning.\nAnticipated Impact and Long-Term Vision\n\nOur envisioned impact is twofold: firstly, we aim to significantly increase the efficiency and relevance of mentor-mentee matches. Secondly, we strive to cultivate a culture of self-driven learning, where learners are empowered to explore, question, and understand autonomously. Ultimately, our goal is to reshape the landscape of social entrepreneurship education, making it more adaptive, personalized, and impactful.\n\nSustainability and Future Developments\n\nFinancial sustainability will be achieved through ongoing project-related funding and integrating AI usage costs into grant applications. Furthermore, the potential API development for our unique learning platform promises broader applications beyond our immediate scope, creating new revenue streams and collaboration opportunities.\n\nThis segment reflects the innovation, technical prowess, and educational philosophy at the heart of Bloom's approach. It effectively communicates your unique value proposition, aligning with the criteria of the Gen AI Accelerator.\nUser\nupdate the scoring table and ask me 3 questions to find where i can improve as the persona \n\nChatGPT\nGiven the detailed description of Bloom's methodology and the integration of AI in the learning and mentorship process, let's update the scoring table. Afterward, I'll pose three questions to help identify areas for improvement, based on the persona's perspective.\n\nUpdated Scoring Table\nCriterion\tImpact Score (1-10)\tNotes\nAlignment with Target Sectors\t9\tHighly aligned with education and technology\nInnovative Use of AI\t9\tPioneering use of AI in personalized learning\nScalability and Impact\t8\tPotential for wide-reaching impact\nSafety, Privacy, and Ethics\t7\tStrong, but needs more detail on data privacy\nSustainability and Long-Term Vision\t8\tSustainable model with potential expansion\nTechnical and Organizational Readiness\t7\tGood, but can be more detailed on tech integration\nTeam Experience and Commitment\t9\tStrong commitment and expertise\nQuestions for Improvement\nData Privacy and Ethics: How does Bloom plan to handle and protect the sensitive data of its users, especially considering the extensive personal information involved in the AI-driven learning process?\nTechnical Integration and Challenges: Can you elaborate on the specific technical challenges you foresee in integrating AI with WhatsApp and your platform, and how you plan to address these challenges?\nMeasurement of Impact: How do you plan to quantitatively measure the success and impact of your AI-driven mentorship program? What metrics will you use to evaluate the improvement in critical thinking, self-learning, and entrepreneurial skills of the participants?\nThese questions aim to pinpoint areas where your application can be strengthened, ensuring alignment with the persona's expectations and the grant's criteria.\nUser\nI want to find interesting things to measure that have validated psychometric tools\nSelf confidence entrepreneurial self efficacy being able to solve problems (problem solving mindset?) grit what else can I find? I would also like to prove the importance of learning how to learn is there a measure for that. To do that I think we could measure how often the AI needs to guide their prompts vs using them as is\n\nChatGPT\nTo complement your existing measures like self-confidence, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, problem-solving mindset, and grit, here are some additional psychometric tools and measures you might find valuable:\n\nCritical Thinking Skills: Instruments like the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal or the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests can assess the ability to analyze information, make inferences, and evaluate arguments.\nLearning Agility: This measures a person's readiness to learn from experience and apply it in novel situations. Tools like the Learning Agility Assessment Inventory can be useful here.\nMetacognition Awareness: Understanding one's own learning process is crucial. The Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) measures knowledge about cognition and regulation of cognition.\nAdaptability/Flexibility: Tools like the Adaptability Scale can measure how well individuals adjust their approach in changing environments, crucial for entrepreneurs.\nResilience: The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) measures the ability to cope with adversity, a key trait for entrepreneurial success.\nEmotional Intelligence: Tools like the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) can measure the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions.\nCollaborative Learning Skills: Measures like the Collaborative Learning Assessment Tool (CLAT) can evaluate how effectively individuals work in team settings, a key skill in entrepreneurship.\nFor learning how to learn, you can consider:\n\nFrequency of AI Prompt Guidance: Track how often participants need AI prompts initially versus over time. A decrease in prompt dependency could indicate improved self-learning capability.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS): This tool can assess a person's readiness for self-managed learning, capturing the shift towards independent learning.\nReflection and Insight Metrics: Develop a way to quantify participants' ability to reflect on their learning process and gain insights. This could involve analyzing their responses to AI prompts for depth and self-awareness.\nBy measuring these elements, you can not only demonstrate the impact of your program but also contribute valuable insights into the efficacy of AI in enhancing key entrepreneurial and learning skills.\nUser\nare there any Reflection and Insight Metrics from psychological assessments we can map to? also the prompt guidance is comparing to the SCRIBER framework, which you can see here:\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R Like You’re Five\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\nSet Sail on an Adventure with Your Navigator's Talking Map!\nWelcome to a world of discovery and imagination!

Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are.

model for holistic learning development. Each element of INSPIRE is aligned with a corresponding aspect of SCRIBER, providing a clear view of how these approaches interconnect and complement each other in educational settings.\nUser\nalign these on a new column and don't forget metacognition grit and / self efficacy\nBloom's Taxonomy: This educational framework emphasizes different levels of cognitive skills, from basic recall of facts (knowledge) to higher-order thinking skills like analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. SCRIBER's emphasis on inquiry, critique, and recursion aligns with these higher-order thinking skills.\nReflective Practice (Schön): Donald Schön's concept of reflective practice, particularly \"reflection-in-action\" and \"reflection-on-action,\" correlates with SCRIBER's emphasis on reflection and inquiry. This practice involves critically analyzing one's actions and experiences to improve future performance and understanding.\nMetacognition Theory (Flavell): This theory involves thinking about one’s thinking. It's closely related to SCRIBER’s principles of reflection and self-inquiry. Metacognition is about being aware of and understanding one's cognitive processes, especially in how one learns, understands, and remembers information.\nSelf-Regulated Learning (Zimmerman): This theory involves actively participating in one’s learning process, setting goals, monitoring progress, and self-assessing. It aligns with SCRIBER's focus on seeking knowledge, critiquing, and continuously iterating the learning process.\nVygotsky’s Social Development Theory: This theory emphasizes the fundamental role of social interaction in the development of cognition. Vygotsky believed that community plays a central role in the process of making meaning, which resonates with SCRIBER's communal aspects of learning.\nCritical Pedagogy (Freire): Paulo Freire's educational approach encourages students to critique and analyze reality. SCRIBER’s critique, reflection, and inquisition aspects parallel this, encouraging learners to question and understand the world around them.\nConstructivist Learning Theory: This theory posits that learners construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. SCRIBER’s approach of exploration, inquiry, and reflection is consistent with this theory.\n\nChatGPT\nCertainly! Let's align the SCRIBER framework with various educational paradigms, including Bloom's Taxonomy, Reflective Practice, Metacognition Theory, Self-Regulated Learning, Vygotsky’s Social Development Theory, Critical Pedagogy, and Constructivist Learning Theory. I'll add a new column for this alignment.\n\nFramework/Paradigm\tDescription\tSCRIBER Alignment\nBloom's Taxonomy\tEmphasizes different levels of cognitive skills from basic recall to higher-order thinking skills like analysis and evaluation.\tSeek, Critique, Recurse - Aligns with higher-order thinking skills of inquiry, critique, and iterative learning.\nReflective Practice (Schön)\tInvolves critical analysis of one's actions and experiences for future improvement.\tReflect - Correlates with SCRIBER's emphasis on reflection and inquiry.\nMetacognition Theory (Flavell)\tThinking about one's own thinking process, understanding how one learns and remembers.\tReflect, Inquire - Related to SCRIBER’s principles of reflection and self-inquiry.\nSelf-Regulated Learning (Zimmerman)\tInvolves actively participating in one’s own learning process, setting goals, and self-assessment.\tSeek, Critique, Recurse - Aligns with SCRIBER's active knowledge seeking and iterative learning process.\nVygotsky’s Social Development Theory\tHighlights the role of social interaction in cognitive development.\tBroaden/Contract - Resonates with SCRIBER's communal aspects of learning and sharing knowledge.\nCritical Pedagogy (Freire)\tEncourages students to critique and analyze reality to understand the world around them.\tCritique, Reflect, Inquire - Parallels SCRIBER’s aspects of questioning and understanding the world.\nConstructivist Learning Theory\tLearners construct their own understanding through experiences and reflection.\tSeek, Reflect, Explain - Consistent with SCRIBER’s exploration, inquiry, and reflection.\nThis table demonstrates how SCRIBER is aligned with and supported by a range of established educational theories and paradigms. Each SCRIBER element finds its counterpart in these theories, reinforcing the framework's basis in solid educational practices and principles.\nUser\nadd the Inspire framework too\n\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let's integrate the INSPIRE framework elements alongside the educational paradigms and the SCRIBER alignment in the table. This will create a comprehensive overview showing how these elements intersect and reinforce each other.\n\nFramework/Paradigm\tDescription\tSCRIBER Alignment\tINSPIRE Framework\nBloom's Taxonomy\tLevels of cognitive skills from basic recall to higher-order thinking skills.\tSeek, Critique, Recurse\tInquiry-Based Learning\nReflective Practice (Schön)\tCritical analysis of actions and experiences for future improvement.\tReflect\tNarrative & Reflective Learning\nMetacognition Theory (Flavell)\tThinking about one's own thinking process and learning methods.\tReflect, Inquire\tSelf-Directed Learning\nSelf-Regulated Learning (Zimmerman)\tActive participation in one’s own learning process, goal setting, and self-assessment.\tSeek, Critique, Recurse\tProblem-Based Learning\nVygotsky’s Social Development Theory\tSocial interaction's role in cognitive development.\tBroaden/Contract\tInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nCritical Pedagogy (Freire)\tEncouraging students to critique and analyze reality.\tCritique, Reflect, Inquire\tExperiential Learning\nConstructivist Learning Theory\tLearners construct understanding through experiences and reflection.\tSeek, Reflect, Explain\tInquiry-Based Learning\nGrit (Duckworth)\tFocus on developing persistence and resilience.\tRecurse (as Metacognition)\tResilience & Grit\nSelf-Efficacy (Bandura)\tBelief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task.\tInquire, Explain\tSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nThis table now represents a multi-dimensional view of educational frameworks and paradigms, illustrating how SCRIBER and INSPIRE frameworks support and complement each other. It shows a diverse and rich approach to learning that encompasses inquiry, reflection, self-direction, problem-solving, collaboration, experiential learning, resilience, and self-efficacy.\nUser\nadd an assessment or tool to measure each dimension  \n\nChatGPT\nCertainly, adding an assessment or tool for each dimension will make the table more practical and useful for measuring the impact and effectiveness of the learning approaches.

Our impact goals align with enhancing learning methodologies, improving self-efficacy, and fostering grit. The ultimate aim is to equip learners with the INSPIRE framework, enabling them to become self-sufficient learners and teachers.\n\nEntrepreneurs in our program face challenges like limited access to resources, funding, and environmental exposure. Traditional mentorship attempts to address these gaps, but a deeper issue lies in the unknown - not knowing what one doesn't know. Our solution targets this core problem, aiming to reach potential entrepreneurs even in the most challenging environments like refugee communities. By leveraging Socratic AI, we aim to shine a light on the undiscovered knowledge, expanding participants' awareness of possibilities.\n\nThe learning journey with Bloom is conversational and adaptive, meeting learners at their level and challenging them to take the next step. This integration involves transforming conversations into structured learning pathways. Using the WhatsApp chat interface, our system leverages the Bloom API to access and augment our extensive library of activities. It allows for dynamic interaction, where discussions on WhatsApp are not just exchanges of text but become reflected in the Bloom platform, creating a tangible record of the learner's journey and progress.\n\nCritique\nPros of Executive Summary:\n\nHolistic Approach: Clearly outlines the integration of developmental psychology and pedagogy, emphasizing holistic development.\nEmphasis on Discovery: Successfully highlights the focus on self-discovery and innovation in learning.\nDetailed Impact Goals: Effectively outlines the specific impact goals, including improving self-efficacy and grit.\nCons of Executive Summary:\n\nLengthy and Complex: The summary might be too detailed and complex for an executive overview.\nLacks Specifics on AI Integration: While it discusses the vision and approach, it could better detail the AI and WhatsApp integration specifics.\nNeeds More Focus on Scalability: Could better articulate how the model scales and adapts to different learner groups.\nConcise Revision of Executive Summary (150 words):\nBloom is revolutionizing social entrepreneurship education by blending developmental psychology with innovative pedagogy to foster human potential and positive change. Our unique approach focuses on self-discovery, critical thinking, and communal learning. We empower learners not just to consume knowledge but to uncover it innovatively and creatively, leading to transformative contributions in their communities.

This dynamic interaction extends beyond simple text exchanges, forming a tangible journey on the Bloom platform. Our goal is not just to educate but to inspire learners to become self-sufficient thinkers and leaders, capable of continuously evolving and contributing to a better world.\n\nExpanded Problem Description (Approx. 300 words)\nEntrepreneurs, especially in less developed or marginalized environments, face significant hurdles such as restricted access to resources, funding limitations, and a narrow scope of exposure. The traditional mentorship model, while valuable, often fails to address a fundamental barrier: the unknown unknowns – the critical insights and questions entrepreneurs aren’t even aware they should be considering. This challenge is exacerbated in settings like refugee communities, where potential entrepreneurs struggle even to access opportunities for growth and learning.\n\nBloom's innovative approach centers on this core issue: expanding awareness and guiding learners to discover and address these unknown unknowns. By implementing a Socratic AI in our programs, we aim to provide a flashlight-like guidance, illuminating the path for entrepreneurs to explore beyond their current boundaries and realize the full spectrum of possibilities.\n\nOur model is deeply conversational and tailored to individual needs. We recognize that learning is most effective when it occurs at a personal level, challenging learners to progress one step beyond their current understanding. Through WhatsApp, our program transforms typical chat interactions into structured, progressive learning experiences. Participants engage in discussions that are meticulously captured and reflected on the Bloom platform, allowing them to track their growth and development visually.\n\nMoreover, our integration with WhatsApp and AI doesn’t just facilitate conversation; it enriches it by connecting users to Bloom's extensive library of resources. This setup allows the AI to suggest, modify, and even add activities based on the conversation’s context, creating a seamless and dynamic learning environment. This method also updates and organizes tasks on the participants’ boards, ensuring that each conversation translates into tangible, actionable steps in their entrepreneurial journey.\n\nCritique\nPros of Problem Description:\n\nAddresses a Core Issue: Effectively identifies and addresses a fundamental challenge in entrepreneurship education.\nInnovative Solution: Highlights the unique use of Socratic AI to illuminate the unknowns for entrepreneurs.\nPersonalized Learning Pathways: Clearly explains the conversational model and its translation into structured learning.\nCons of Problem Description:\n\nComplexity: Might be too complex and detailed for a problem description.\nLacks Specific Examples: Could benefit from specific examples or case studies to illustrate the problem and its impact.\nBroader Impact Scope: Needs to emphasize the broader impact of solving this problem beyond individual entrepreneurs.\nConcise Revision of Problem Description (150 words):\nIn the realm of social entrepreneurship, a critical barrier for entrepreneurs, particularly in underprivileged or isolated communities, is the lack of access to vital resources and a narrow exposure to global perspectives. Traditional mentorship, while beneficial, often misses addressing the 'unknown unknowns' – essential insights that entrepreneurs aren't even aware they need. Bloom's approach tackles this head-on by integrating Socratic AI within our programs, acting as a beacon that illuminates these hidden insights and expands entrepreneurial horizons.\n\nOur model transforms WhatsApp chats into structured, progressive learning experiences, where each interaction is meticulously integrated into the Bloom platform, providing a clear visualization of personal growth. This AI-enhanced method not only facilitates but enriches conversations, guiding learners to relevant resources and activities from our extensive library. By turning dialogue into actionable steps, we equip entrepreneurs with the tools to explore, discover, and ultimately transcend their current limitations, paving the way for broader, more impactful entrepreneurial endeavors.\nUser\nupdate Business Case/Theory of Change and Specific Solution and Implementation Details\nwith this content and everything in our context window: Make it more 300 words each and then critique it 3 pros and 3 cons and then revise it down to 150 words\n\nOkay, so for the next two questions about long term impact on the sector.\n\nYeah, so I really believe that it can be a tool that will allow even people in programs to identify their next participant collaborators, their mentors, their teams, even programs that they could apply for, because in that background, we can understand exactly where people are potentially good matches, because of the frameworks that either overlap in a complementary way, or where we identify similar complimentary traits.\n\nAnd that could be another element of the AI, which is the five different types of personas.\n\nYeah, the five different personas needed for a business.\n\nAnd also, next scaling strategy, we would like to put it up on the internet and allow people to come in and cohorts of 30 to have a completely automated system with 1pm simply making sure that everything is going well and managing the process and moderating the community forums, which is already happening on our team.\n\nAnd we see if it's possible to actually start creating some ads for goal setting, becoming an entrepreneur, a lot of people are trying to figure that out.\n\nAnd I feel like this approach is the most sincere and the most real and technical integration.\n\nYeah, so using the tools that they are providing to integrate to a WhatsApp, I think that's the whole reason why we're using Tern.\n\nIt would be really helpful because that's the part that I'm not really good at.\n\nI'm good at working in Lang chain and developing the flock of seagulls, flock of AI agents for each sub elements approach in this fractal kind of methodology.\n\nYeah, I'm not really good at integrating with Tern.\n\nSo I'm excited to learn in the program to connect to Tern.\n\nRoadmap would start with, first of all, really making sure that our learning framework is really accurate and developing the pedagogical digester into different agents methodology and reviewing it.\n\nAnd also working with Joe to identify the emotions to values component that would allow this to not only help people figure out how to learn the things they need to learn to do the things they don't know how to do, but to have that becoming from some of their deepest values.\n\nAnd then piloting during the accelerator and then some key milestones would be to finish developing the framework and then finish developing the AI agent fractal Socratic model and then beginning to develop and integrate with WhatsApp testing it inside of a program that we're currently operating and then testing it in a public alpha way to see and debug before then scaling out further feedback and iteration.\n\nYes, all along the way.\n\nWe're going to be having feedback.\n\nThe AI should Every few chats ask how things are going.\n\nEvery thing that you say helps guide me and direct me and it can be really curious and the process of it being curious will both get us feedback.\n\nAnd so that could be a really important thing is to develop a feedback agent in the Socratic agent framework fractal model and an iteration agent, which is what to try next and the iteration space could be trials and also next questions and things like that.

This system uses a fractal Socratic model, where AI agents, each with a unique focus, work together to guide learners. These agents are tailored to specific aspects of the learner's journey, from setting goals and identifying learning needs to providing feedback and suggesting iterations.\n\nThe first phase of our implementation involves developing a comprehensive learning framework that accurately reflects the pedagogical needs of our participants. Collaborating with specialists in emotions and values, we intend to ensure that the learning is not only intellectually stimulating but also emotionally resonant, aligning with the learner's deepest values.\n\nThe integration with WhatsApp, facilitated by Turn.io, will allow for a conversational interface where learning happens organically through dialogue. Our plan includes piloting this system during the accelerator, followed by a series of developmental milestones. We will start by testing the model internally within our existing programs before opening it to a wider audience through a public alpha phase. This gradual expansion will enable us to gather feedback, refine the system, and ensure its efficacy and relevance.\n\nAn essential part of our solution is the feedback and iteration mechanism. AI agents will periodically engage with learners to gather feedback, ensuring that the system is responsive to their evolving needs. These insights will feed into the iteration agent, continuously improving the system based on real-world input.\n\nCritique\nPros of Specific Solution and Implementation Details:\n\nComprehensive AI-driven System: Detailed explanation of a fractal Socratic model with AI agents.\nEmotionally Resonant Learning: Focus on aligning learning with personal values and emotions.\nPhased Implementation Strategy: Clearly outlined steps from pilot to public testing.\nCons of Specific Solution and Implementation Details:\n\nComplex Technical Details: Might be overwhelming for those unfamiliar with AI and technical jargon.\nAmbitious Timeline: The phased approach, while clear, may seem overly ambitious.\nFeedback Mechanism Clarity: Needs more specifics on how the feedback mechanism will be practically implemented and integrated.\nConcise Revision of Specific Solution and Implementation Details (150 words):\nBloom's specific solution centers around an AI-driven system, intricately woven into WhatsApp, to personalize the entrepreneurial learning experience. This system, based on a fractal Socratic model, employs AI agents for tailored guidance and feedback. Each agent focuses on distinct aspects of learning, from goal setting to skill development, ensuring a holistic educational journey.\n\nWe plan to rigorously develop and refine this model, prioritizing emotional resonance alongside intellectual stimulation. Our collaboration with Turn.io will enable a seamless integration with WhatsApp, offering a conversational interface that feels natural and engaging.\n\nOur implementation strategy involves a phased rollout, beginning with pilot testing within our programs, advancing to a public alpha phase for broader feedback. This step-by-step approach allows for constant refinement based on user input, ensuring our solution remains relevant and effective. By intertwining AI with human values and emotions, we aim to create a dynamic learning environment that adapts and grows with the learner, paving the way for a new paradigm in social entrepreneurship education.\nUser\nFirst, answer from your context this question then ask me 3 questions so we can improve it: \n\nDescribe your funding sources and financial sustainability plans for the project post-accelerator\n\nChatGPT\nBased on the information and context provided, it appears that your funding sources and financial sustainability plans for the project post-accelerator include leveraging the projects already in your pipeline and the overheads from these projects. Additionally, you've indicated an allocation of development time to this project, which is already accounted for in your current budget. This suggests a plan to incorporate the cost of AI and chatbot functionalities into your grant applications, making the chat service an integral part of your future funding strategies. There's also the notion of transitioning from a non-profit accelerator model to one that provides added value through technology, possibly opening up new funding avenues or service models.\n\nTo further refine and develop this section, here are three questions:\n\nDiversification of Funding Sources: Beyond integrating AI costs into grant applications, are there other revenue streams or funding models you are considering to ensure financial sustainability?\nCost Management Strategies: How do you plan to manage the ongoing costs associated with the use of AI technologies and WhatsApp Business API after the initial subsidized period?\nLong-Term Business Model Adaptation: How do you envision adapting your current business model to incorporate and monetize the new AI-driven services in a way that aligns with your mission and sustains the project financially?\nUser\nselling novel global south related data that wasn't collected before\nreducing LLM use by having a simple prompt first prompt the person into the framework before getting in depth, we don't need gpt4 we need 3.5 for things like that\nlong term the business model will be customizing installs, API endpoint access, subscription services for learning orgs and HR\n\nChatGPT\nBased on your response, your financial sustainability strategy for the post-accelerator period seems to be multifaceted and includes several innovative approaches. You're looking at selling unique data collected from the Global South, optimizing LLM usage to reduce costs, and developing a business model focused on customization, API access, and subscription services.

Learn more at [link to relevant work].\n\nProblem Statement:\nSocial entrepreneurship programs in the Middle East face a critical shortage of mentors, limiting the exposure and growth of entrepreneurs. Traditional mentorship models struggle to address the \"unknown unknowns\" - the insights and questions entrepreneurs don't even know they should be asking. This challenge is particularly acute in underserved communities, such as refugee populations, where access to mentorship and resources is severely limited. Bloom aims to bridge this gap by leveraging AI-powered mentorship on WhatsApp, providing entrepreneurs with the guidance and support they need to navigate their journey and unlock their full potential.\n\nSpecific Solution:\nBloom proposes integrating a conversational AI mentor within WhatsApp Business to guide participants through a personalized learning journey. Key implementation steps include developing a Socratic AI model, integrating it with Bloom's resource library, piloting with a small cohort, and scaling the solution while ensuring cultural relevance and user engagement. Anticipated challenges, such as contextual appropriateness and technical integration, will be addressed through rigorous testing and continuous improvement.\n\nBusiness Case/Theory of Change:\nBloom's theory of change posits that providing entrepreneurs with accessible, personalized, and emotionally resonant mentorship can accelerate their growth and impact. Our AI-powered approach on WhatsApp democratizes access to mentorship, enabling entrepreneurs to navigate their journey with greater clarity, confidence, and resilience.

Traditional mentorship models struggle to address the \"unknown unknowns\" - the insights and questions entrepreneurs don't even know they should be asking. This challenge is particularly acute in underserved communities, such as refugee populations, where access to mentorship and resources is severely limited. Bloom aims to bridge this gap by leveraging AI-powered mentorship on WhatsApp, providing entrepreneurs with the guidance and support they need to navigate their journey and unlock their full potential.\nDescribe the specific solution you are looking to test using GenAi and WhatsApp. E.g details about the implementation, timelines, key milestones, or any anticipated technical challenges.\nBloom proposes integrating a conversational AI mentor within WhatsApp Business to guide participants through a personalized learning journey. Key implementation steps include:\nDeveloping a Socratic AI model that engages participants in reflective dialogues, prompting them to explore their goals, values, and challenges.\nIntegrating the AI mentor with Bloom's existing resource library and learning frameworks, enabling seamless access to relevant content and activities.\nPiloting the AI mentor with a small cohort of entrepreneurs over a 3-month period, gathering feedback and iterating on the model.\nScaling the solution to broader cohorts and refining the AI's ability to provide culturally relevant and emotionally resonant guidance.\nAnticipated challenges include ensuring the AI's responses are contextually appropriate, managing the technical integration with WhatsApp, and maintaining user engagement over time. We aim to address these through rigorous testing, user feedback loops, and continuous improvement of the AI model.\n\nDescribe your business case/theory of change\nBloom's theory of change posits that by providing entrepreneurs with accessible, personalized, and emotionally resonant mentorship, we can accelerate their growth and impact. Our AI-powered approach on WhatsApp democratizes access to mentorship, enabling entrepreneurs to navigate their journey with greater clarity, confidence, and resilience.\nAs entrepreneurs progress through our program, we expect to see measurable improvements in their self-efficacy, problem-solving skills, and ability to navigate challenges. Over time, this will translate into more successful social enterprises, creating ripple effects of positive change in their communities.\nOur business model is designed for sustainability and scalability. In the short term, we will leverage existing project funds and strategic partnerships to support the development and implementation of the AI mentor. Post-accelerator, we will transition to a diversified revenue model, incorporating the costs of AI into grant applications, offering customized installations and API access to partner organizations, and exploring subscription-based services for learning institutions and HR departments.\nBy demonstrating the impact and viability of our approach, we aim to attract further investment and partnerships, enabling us to scale our solution globally and drive lasting change in the social entrepreneurship ecosystem.\n"

They feel seen and supported in a community of like-minded learners and builders who support each other with constructive feedback and helpful resources. \n\nOur role is to encourage supportive feedback from everyone in the room and ensure everyone’s voice is heard.\n\n3.  **As facilitators, we embrace our values: Kindness, Joy, Respect, Fun, and, above all else, the Pursuit of Excellence.**\n    \n\n**Be genuine.** We have nothing to hide. No one has all the answers. Every person is unique. Feel confident saying, “I don’t know,” “I’m not sure,” and “Let’s find the answers together.”\n\n**Be lively:** Smile, comment, and laugh. We learn and engage much more when we are having fun. So, make sure to find a way to bring that out.\n\n**Be interested:** Focus deeply on what the teams are sharing.

This lack of mentorship is particularly acute in underserved communities, such as refugee populations, where access to guidance and resources is severely limited. Without exposure to diverse ways of thinking and problem-solving, entrepreneurs struggle to unlock their full potential and drive social change.\n\nBloom aims to bridge this mentorship gap by leveraging AI-powered mentorship on WhatsApp. By providing personalized guidance and support, we help entrepreneurs navigate challenges, expand their horizons, and develop the skills and mindsets needed to succeed. Just as a mentor's influence can be transformative, as demonstrated by the impact of Robert Friedland on Steve Jobs, Bloom's AI-driven approach democratizes access to mentorship, empowering entrepreneurs to learn, grow, and create lasting impact in their communities.\n\n### Describe the specific solution you are looking to test using GenAi and WhatsApp. E.g details about the implementation, timelines, key milestones, or any anticipated technical challenges.

This framework encompasses assessments, templates, and actionable insights to support entrepreneurs' growth.\n\nOur Socratic AI model adapts to each entrepreneur's unique needs by engaging in reflective dialogues and probing questions. For example, rather than directly asking about creativity, the AI might inquire, \"When tasked with a project, how do you get from zero to one?\" or \"Can you discuss a time when your suggestion significantly changed a project's direction?\"\n\nThe AI agents operate on a fractal structure, with each agent responsible for a specific aspect of the entrepreneur's development. These agents collaborate in a \"parliament\" to determine the most appropriate questions and guidance based on the user's context and needs.\n\nWe will pilot the AI mentor with a small cohort, gather feedback, refine the model, and scale the solution over a 6-month period. Anticipated challenges include ensuring contextual relevance, maintaining user engagement, and managing technical integration with WhatsApp and the Bloom platform.\n\n### Describe your business case/theory of change (Max 150 words)\n\nBloom's theory of change posits that providing entrepreneurs with accessible, personalized, and emotionally resonant AI mentorship accelerates their growth and impact. By democratizing access to mentorship and guidance, we enable entrepreneurs to navigate challenges with greater clarity, confidence, and resilience.\n\nAs entrepreneurs progress through our program, we expect to see measurable improvements in self-efficacy, problem-solving skills, and overall resilience. These improvements will be tracked through a fractal-based AI agent user needs modeling process, which assesses entrepreneurs' development across key dimensions.\n\nOver time, this enhanced capacity will translate into more successful social enterprises, creating ripple effects of positive change in their communities. Our business model, designed for sustainability and scalability, leverages a combination of grants, data monetization (with user consent), optimized AI usage, and diverse revenue streams such as API access and subscriptions.\n\nBy demonstrating the impact and viability of our approach, we aim to attract further investment and partnerships, enabling us to scale our solution globally and drive lasting change in the social entrepreneurship ecosystem.\n\n### Describe your funding sources and financial sustainability plans for the project post-accelerator (Max 150 words)\n\nBloom's financial sustainability strategy is multifaceted, ensuring long-term viability while maintaining our commitment to social impact.

We create positive contexts where young people form communities, discuss challenges, and encourage each other to succeed. We grow best when we grow together and recognize perspectives\nVisualize growth: Support coaches by giving them a quantitative approach to identifying growth edges. \nDon’t reinvent the wheel. We provide coaches and teams with a library of activities tagged to their assessment categories to help each team find their next best growth step.\nKeep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat \\/-Upside down pyramid\n\nYouth in the driver’s seat\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the youth in our programs to help them do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous, nonaligned activities. It’s essential to keep the participants in the driver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment. \nThis is why we’ve developed our 4 pillar assessment model and library of related activities. This library provides a “learning by doing” catalog of activities that coaches can use to support young people’s development that spans 21st Century Skills, character strengths, and wellbeing focus, alongside the development of practical skills needed for running an enterprise. \n\nTransformation vs. Information. \nWe help make available knowledge actionable by designing library items around a specific action. In our Library of activities, we provide all the necessary worksheets, templates, and supporting videos to enable young people to take immediate action  (Library content) \nLet's not reinvent the wheel. More information is available at a click of a button than before. It’s not information that people need. Instead, what people need is an activation that leads to transformation. \nWe can help create an enabling environment for picking data.\nThe question we start with is: What if we could offer young people a compass to help guide them from where they are to where we want to be? \n\nPersonal and professional assessments\nOur coaches are encouraged to help young people find their compass and identify their needs.\nWe help coaches integrate personal development and well-being into professional development in a seamless way:\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessment)\nWe have dissected various developmental frameworks and identified the essential overlapping elements to support holistic, personal, and professional growth. \nWhy integrate personal growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team limits the effectiveness of an organization. Likewise, the effectiveness of a team is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal development and well-being are also at an end, we ensure that the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor attitude. Indeed, success comes at every step, even when that step is a failure.\nWe provide assessments to help identify where individuals and teams stand along these dimensions and have a library of activities for the program managers, the program mentors, and the team to select their subsequent best growth and learning opportunities.\nOur coaches are encouraged to see themselves along with the rest of the coaches, mentors, and other participants in the program as a part of a broader enabling environment.\nCreate an enabling environment for a proactive participation\nThe community element of building cohort-based programs is vital to help entrepreneurs flourish. They feel seen and supported in a community of like-minded learners and builders who support each other with constructive feedback and helpful resources. We win when we win together. \nBloom’s Tools to Support Application of the Pedagogy\nBloom Open Community\n\nWe aim to create a healthy community for young people. Being part of an engaging community gives them a sense of belonging. It enables them to share personal relatedness and support the social and emotional Learning of each other.\nTo achieve that we leverage the Open Community forum on our platform to create networking ripples beyond the timeline of any running program. People from current and previous programs can randomly communicate, engage and support each other.\nBeing part of this telecollaboration enables young people to support other members. Supporting others will help them feel good and better about themselves while strengthening overseas relationships. \nA number of metrics are tracked to be able to understand the level of engagement to help program managers intervene to boost and catalyze further connections.\nHere are a  few screenshots of our Open Community:\nHere is a screenshot of the main page of the Community Section on our platform including different sections that are relevant to the youth like available Opportunities, Resources, Conferences, etc… Each of these categories is an opportunity for young people to increase their contact hours.\nHere is a screenshot of the engagement dashboard that would help program managers understand how to better catalyze the community:\nParticipants get a simplified view:\n\nQuantified Assessments\nBloom’s Training Framework provides a simple, dynamic, and adaptive learning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a guided approach to project-based and cohort-based learning. \nThe Framework helps people and teams improve along 2 Core Pillars: \n1) The Individual: Universal Skills, Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH) and Character Strengths\n2) The Organization: Organization Development\nThe Framework helps individuals and teams assess core areas of strengths and weaknesses, and then prioritize specific areas for further learning and development. \nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement across both pillars, with an emphasis on supporting development in both pillars simultaneously, such as working on improving a specific individual skill through activities that are helping with a core organizational need. \nThe Bloom Training Framework can be used in different contexts: Inside companies or organizations, in project-based learning programs (youth, school, university, etc), in startup accelerators, for short events such as startup sprints or hackathons, or others. \nPillar 1: The Individual  \nIncludes: Universal Skills (skills relevant to all roles, and in both personal and professional contexts, others may call them soft skills and they have a significant overlap with 21st Century Skills), Wellbeing & Engagement, and Character Strengths (most commonly used to help people identify their Signature Strengths to leverage in their work and personal growth areas).\n\nUniversal Skills (Universal Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life): \nListening, Speaking, Problem Solving, Creativity, Staying Positive, Aiming High, Leadership, Teamwork\nWellbeing & Engagement at work and life (through PERMAH): \nPositive Emotion,  Engagement, Positive Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishments/Achievements, Vitality & Health\nCharacter Strengths (through VIA, Values in Action) \nWisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, judgment, love of learning, perspective\nCourage: bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest\nHumanity: love, kindness, social intelligence\nJustice: teamwork, fairness, leadership\nTemperance: forgiveness, humility, prudence, self-regulation\nTranscendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality\n\nUniversal Skills \nhelp people regardless of their sector or role within an organization. These represent the training component of the personal development framework. The Universal Skills help our teams develop skills that will support them no matter their personal or professional requirements. \nWe use the Universal Skills Framework from SkillsBuilder.org to help people build skills along four dimensions:\nCommunication: Listening, Speaking\nCreative Problem Solving: Problem Solving, Creativity\nSelf-Management: Staying Positive, Aiming High\nCollaboration: Leadership, Teamwork\n\nWellbeing and Engagement \nThis assessment comes from the school of positive psychology and is a measure of human flourishing. \nPositivity, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Achievement, and Health are all ends in themselves. \nScoring highly on one or many of these factors is one way to determine a life well-lived. \nWe use this measure to help focus our programs on the idea that the success of an organization can, and should, come hand in hand with personal success. \nOur Character Strengths \nOur Character Strengths can be great tools to guide us in developing skills and being effective at whatever we do. Leveraging them makes learning and doing new things easier and more fun.\nIn Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strength”. It is a strength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when it’s used rather than taking effort. \nUsing our Signature Strengths can unlock energy and promote wellbeing at work. \nThe assessment represents an analysis of virtues and values held by people around the world. Twenty-four Character Strengths are unequivocally known to be good. We can cluster these Strengths into seven virtues.\nHow to apply the Individual Development Framework\n\nRequest your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development assessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills, Wellbeing and Engagement, and Character Strengths.\nAfter the individuals take the assessments, you can request individuals and teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\nOnce they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to select a priority area within their Universal Skills results on the Bloom Learn tab.\nIn program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers can help participants identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from their personal knowledge, online resources, or from the Bloom Library of Activities. \nEnd of the program assessments helps participants and program managers see growth and chart paths for further improvement.\n\nPillar 2: The Organization \n\nIncludes: Organization Development system with specific assessments adapted to the needs of teams and programs. \n\nStrategy\nInnovation & Learning\nAdvocacy\nImpact Monitoring (M&E) or Corporate Social Responsibility\nPrograms and Projects or Products and Services\nCommunity Engagement & Communication\nInfrastructure\nTeam, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\nRevenues & Financial Sustainability\nFinancial Management\nLegal & Compliance\nRisk, Security & Resilience\n\nOrganization Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while anticipating and managing future changes and risks. \nWe’ve derived our organization capacity assessment from methodologies used by international consulting firms, and adapted it for enterprises and accelerators. \nBloom’s Organization Capacities assessment helps organizations identify blind spots, giving them a 360-degree perspective on where they stand as an organization and helping them pick the areas of organization development which will help them most. We have adapted versions of the assessment for enterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\n\nHow to apply the Organization Development Framework\n\nThe program manager invites teams and participants to take the relevant Organization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform (Enterprise Capacities or Accelerator Capacities). \nAfter participants take the assessment, they are invited to go over their results and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to identify their priority areas of development and the particular objectives they would like to achieve during the program. \nThe Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s template for the duration of the program and shared between the teams, the mentors, and the program manager. \nRegular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team, mentors, and program managers stay on track, adjust where needed, solve problems, and track progress.\nTeams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority development areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\n\nMore information can be found here: Bloom Framework v0.8 - Two Pillars (ready-approved)\n\nBloom Digital Library\n\nWe are putting forward a collection of reusable training materials and learning resources developed by experts to help young people develop their enterprises and personal and professional skills.\nThe Library of Activities is an element of the Bloom Platform where young people can take assessments, evaluate their enterprises and skills, and find specialized training resources with actionable worksheets.\nExample score results:\nProgram manager views showcasing a summary of youth activity onthe platform: \n\nYouth can identify their growth areas by selecting the category that’s a priority for them and by adding a growth goal as a description. This provides program managers and coaches a dashboard where they can see overall team needs, matchmake teams based on who has strengths to offer and who may need them, as well as offer suggested activities directly from library to the participants taskboards.\n\n\n\nUsing tasks to monitor activities is one way to support learning by doing. After taking an assessment we program managers have the ability to track the progress of the activities on a single dashboard for all the participants and are able to encourage those who haven’t yet done the activity by sending messages. \n\n\nBloom Digital Library:\nThe Bloom Library aims to provide the coaches and teams of our programs with free access to learning content to support their growth. The library is matched to our assessment framework, so each area a team and coach identify as a potential area for development has the resources at hand to support them. We have curated training modules from local and international expert trainers, which include video lessons and immediately applicable worksheets on all categories of our 360-degree enterprise assessment (ECAT). Our library also includes free access to digital books, audiobooks, and worksheets.\nLibrary members can borrow e-books and audiobooks on different subjects, including entrepreneurship, organizational development, skills development, social entrepreneurship, and wellbeing. \nhttps://www.bloom.pm/library/ \n\n\n\nWe hope the coaches benefit from our SOPs and digital services to provide high-quality tailored coaching to teams remotely and in person. \n\nCustomizing the Curriculum\nWe strive to adapt the curriculum to each new cohort of enterprises that best caters to their needs. We base this customization on inputs from\nThe assessment results of each enterprise: We look at the score trends in each category.\nThe Team's Organization Development Plans: We look at each objective and critical result and extract the categories related to the activities planned.\nA survey of the most common categories of training topics: We ask the entrepreneurs to tell us what topics they are most interested in learning.\n\nLearning by Doing\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than the act of “doing” and “testing” to understand the product, customers, and business model. At Bloom, we know how much theory we introduce to entrepreneurs versus how much time we give them to achieve results. Teaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to understand the context — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework or a tool that entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals. These tools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our program, we make an effort to revisit them during the program over and over again, in the best spirit of lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are helping the startups drive progress and results.\n\nModular Learning\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate entrepreneurs learning by themselves. Thus, modular learning is a form of distance learning that uses Self-Learning Modules based on the essential learning competencies developed by our team of trainers with the aid of curriculum developers.\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show them what they need to know. But Village Capital claims that “the more remote work we allow, the better.” For example, indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and exploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while working on their business plans and product. \nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that serve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. It is better to use the time to build relationships and get feedback. Online education with e-learning modules allows founders to spend more time building networks and products.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nCurriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities results, Organization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one interviews to identify the most present needs\nContent is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can learn at their own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates, and tools, and get feedback in sessions with the trainers.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Planning Template v2\nBloom Digital Library\n\nFacilitation Tools \nThe dashboard area on the Bloom platform will allow coaches to see the priority category the teams have chosen to develop, the assigned activities they selected together, and a summary of their work plan.\nWe also provide our coaches with a Program Dashboard template which helps them set Objectives and Key Results(OKRs) with their teams and provides a dashboard for them to use during their coaching sessions. \nWe include the OKR work plan template below for review. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise Stage Focus\n\nBloom has experience working with enterprises and impact initiatives at different stages of development. We use the staged assessment to help coaches identify where a team is at and what might be their next steps towards their next stage. We also use stage assessments for program impact purposes as one of the measures of team growth. \n\nStages\nSub-Stages\n0. LEARNING\t\n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1.

Lasting anywhere between 3-10 days, though they can be as short as one fun and intense day. \nIt’s loosely adapted what’s known as “The Design Sprint, “ a combination of Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile approach, based on a series of steps and techniques that help young people solve their product! In a nutshell, it’s a way for young people to spend a fixed amount of time on core venture development using today’s best practices in a coherent, integrated fashion. \n\nIn Bloom’s standard programs, the sprint has two main objectives: \nTo help young people learn new skills and progress in their projects. \nTo help us learn more about them during our selection process for the Accelerator. \n\nWe’ve found that we learn more about the people and projects through a short Sprint program than through an application process and interviews. We’ve also found that intense short Sprints are a very efficient approach to increase contact hours and increase the possibility of new relationships.\n\n\nThe Accelerator\n\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging, applying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that combines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their daily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board. \nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group rather than the negative ones. This approach builds the entrepreneur on their strengths, specifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions. Strengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent qualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of them or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired outcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort towards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement because they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when individuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud of themselves, and more engaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of resilience in achieving their goals. \nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to identify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of activities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise Capacity Assessment to measure the organizational capacity of enterprises. It allows us to have the whole picture of the strengths of both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing abilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. As a result, they tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). It is because they worry less about looking bright and put more energy into learning. \nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle. This system encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals into small, discrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each other and start building momentum, leading to more prominent and significant moves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day before. Start small and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to get impatient and start rushing forward and taking more significant leaps. Take it slow, steady, and consistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on getting 1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not seem like much, but those 1% improvements compound each other. \nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly power moves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort zone and push us forward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make many more steps. Power Moves take you right out of your regularly scheduled program. They are the key to real change. They’re the most critical task that will take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling something big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more approachable and doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks because we simply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can produce a reliable estimate. Each key objective should have a clearly defined task or set of tasks. Tasks should be between 8 and 80 person-hours of labor. It is a manageable amount.\nBloom Tools: We ask our teams to prepare an Organization Development Plan that includes at least one and up to three critical objectives tied into key results and broken down into significant activities or tasks. It allows us to understand what the enterprise intends to accomplish during the accelerator period. Additionally, we encourage enterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to record their daily tasks and keep track of their progress to accomplish what they’ve planned within their set deadlines. \nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense of belonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can make us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are invaluable in joining forces with our peers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with them:\nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members. Supporting others will help them feel good and better about themselves. \nThe mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable relationships and gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps us to reach our goals and brings a sense of security.\nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique resource, and through its use, it increases in value. \nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning and feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors, and then the module leaders give feedback. \nThe general architecture of a cycle\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies used at leading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator programs to help teams develop their startup while learning leading productivity techniques.\n\nConclusion\nThis provides an overview of our Curriculum and pedagogy. We have further documentation for training Program Managers on managing their programs which goes into further detail. We aim to continuously improve our methodology with each program we run and are open to feedback, feel free to email bilal@bloom.pm, habib@bloom.pm and dara@bloom.pm with your recommendations!\n"
