The root causes of these issues are multifaceted and complex, often intertwining:\n\n1. **Concentration of Wealth and Power:** Wealth and power are often centralized, limiting the diverse solutions spaces and stifling innovation from those who do not hold these resources. There's a need to decolonize these structures to ensure more equitable access to opportunities and resources. \n\n2. **Capitalism Without Critique:** The unchecked globalization of capitalism is leading to social and environmental problems. The current economic system focuses predominantly on shareholder value, neglecting our environment and exacerbating social inequalities. \n\n3. **Lack of Self-Efficacy and Participation:** Many young individuals face a sense of hopelessness and disconnect from their values, stemming from the prevalent neoliberal economic models. This disconnection often results in complacency and a perception that major issues, like social inequality or climate change, are inevitable.\n\n4. **Lack of Meaningful Work:** High unemployment rates coupled with a lack of fulfilling work further contribute to young people's feelings of disenchantment and disconnection.\n\n5. **Insufficient Holistic Methodologies:** There's a lack of comprehensive methodologies that connect both the individual and organizational aspects. Human potential is often utilized to drive the current economic engine, leading to a misalignment between individual values and corporate objectives.\n\nBloom.pm was founded out of a core desire to improve lives and communities, believing in the capacity of individuals to address challenges in their lives, their communities, and the world. We believe in equality of opportunity, not necessarily equality of outcomes. To realize this, we focus on education, training, and support to help young individuals actualize their ambitions.\n\nAt Bloom.pm, we find joy in nurturing someone's dreams and helping them bring it to life, in challenging and changing broken norms, and in the pursuit of creating diverse and beautiful new approaches to solve core human needs. We're driven by the conviction that fostering diverse business leaders and promoting holistic models, especially in developing economies, is the pathway to a better world.",
