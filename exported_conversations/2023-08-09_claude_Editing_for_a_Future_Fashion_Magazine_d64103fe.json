With their AI powered private observation books students are paying themselves by unlocking their innate potential with life long learning companions. Their notebook is connected to a learning platform supporting them in identifying local learning opportunities, second degree network connections to explore their curiosity and can even notice dips in motivation and connect students with learning coaches who can help guide them through those rocky moments.\n\nSchools should prepare us for the future, supporting the creation of productive citizens contributing to society. What the University of Life has discovered is that we can distribute a portion of people’s future compensation for their contributions today. Without any school debt and with early payments to invest in businesses, projects, housing, young people can focus entirely on new discoveries, deep science, passionate self introspection and the learning platform is able to allocate appropriate amounts of potential future earnings and pay part of that today.",

      "content": "Here are some suggestions to make the language more \"magaziney\" for a fashion and design magazine in the future:\n\n- The opening could be punchier. Maybe something like \"The future of education has arrived - and it pays you to learn.\" \n\n- Describe the University of Life in more aspirational, lifestyle-oriented terms rather than purely practical. For example: \"The University of Life ushers in a new era of self-actualization and purpose-driven learning. Students are given the freedom to chart their own educational journey while being financially supported.\"\n\n- Emphasize how this enables creative expression, following passions, personal growth, etc. \n\n- Use vivid descriptors like \"cutting-edge,\" \"visionary,\" \"revolutionary,\" \"empowering,\" \"liberating\"\n\n- Incorporate more conversational tone with contractions, active voice, first-person perspective\n\n- Weave in quotes from students about how transformative the experience is \n\n- Note any aesthetics, designs, architecture that make the learning spaces innovative and inspiring\n\n- Mention celebrity involvement or endorsements if applicable\n\nLet me know if you would like me to revise the paragraph with these suggestions in mind or if you have any other questions!",
