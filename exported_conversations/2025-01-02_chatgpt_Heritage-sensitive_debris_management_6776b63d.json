And I've always been actually working in Iraq during the car bombs was one of those things where I made a sculpture, where it would basically crush a representation of Iraq every time a car bomb happened to sort of create this pressure for people to do something about it and do something wherever they were kind of like a, you know, locally, kindness, I call it the kindness first responders and that was the idea and I've also worked on like an audio file where people would be talking to a microphone, and then the drumbeat behind them the music for this song was basically based on the data of the number of people that died in car bombs in Iraq. And so the idea was, could we basically try to get something that would get people to listen to data and feel it in a new way and really understand the magnitude of the problem without giving them just a bunch of numbers that turn people into objects and like something that's easy to ignore. So I wanted them to feel it so I made this kind of performance piece where people would come up to a microphone and talk, and then as soon as the quote unquote bomb blasted or the bass drum hit, and every day with a hi hat so tat tat tat with the hi hat and the bass drum hit, and then it would be like the person had to stop talking as if they were in the car talking to the parents on the phone, and then when the bomb hit they would just immediately stop I was supposed to give that sudden jarring sensation.",

Can you show how it matches my skills and how it addresses cultural preservation? Yeah, so I didn't really know what to call a crisis or emergency setting, right? So, is working in a refugee camp in Syria a crisis setting? And I had brought storytelling materials, materials for shadow puppets, and worked with young children to tell their stories through drawings and to express their emotions in an active conflict space. I worked in Baghdad during car bombings, creating these alternate spaces where communities of support can form across sectarian divides. I remember going from one place to another and people being really concerned for me, but finding that there's a beautiful way that love can bond people together. I worked in Lebanon during the garbage crisis, and we worked to transform the cardboard in the garbage and the dumpsters into extrudable and moldable art materials to transform a problem into a solution. And yeah, I think these are some ideas. Yeah, so I worked with the UN's ITC. I think I wrote down what I did. It's very short, it's only 200 characters, so I think I have enough there. Skills and competencies. Integrating cultural preservation into technical efforts. Yeah, so we worked in Iraq to create a digital library element that represents Iraqi culture. We can call it digital diplomacy, creating these 3D models of heritage artifacts and uploading them to standard international libraries of 3D drawings that anybody could 3D print and use. In doing so, we created a place where people could see Iraq for its beauty and touch, literally, physically, some of its objects that have a long history of use in baking. Can you reframe practical, professional, with their expectations, and then maybe just answer all the questions about the size that they're looking for? Just, you know, redoing my words and making it slightly cleaner. Be sure to stick with my language and my words.

I also have a proven track record of collaborating with diverse stakeholders, from local communities to international organizations, to develop innovative, context-sensitive solutions for cultural preservation and recovery.  \n\n---\n\n### **Experience with UN and NGOs**  \nI worked with the UN’s International Trade Center in Mosul on post-conflict sustainable reconstruction, focusing on debris management and green approaches. Through Bloom, I have also operated EU- and RDPP-funded programs across Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, and beyond, addressing community resilience and innovation in post-conflict and humanitarian settings.  \n\n---\n\nHow do these drafts feel?

      "content": "All right, here we go. So, impactful projects. Yeah, I think the story about working in Iraq with recoded and developing 3D models of the MADGOOGA utensil that really represents a very traditional Iraqi cookie and uploading it to Thingiverse was an interesting idea. I was a sort of space activator there working to get new creative tech-inspired projects and 3D printing and to set up the lab with a good cultural and grounded in the local fabric and the local community way. And I also was teaching values-based design and character strengths and learning about what makes us who we are so that we have something to share with the world from here in Iraq. Yeah, my personal values. Well, I was raised in a traditional Iraqi household in America with the language and the flavors and the paintings and the food, delicious food, and the idea that we're going to go home someday. And this idea of roots and honoring where we came from and realizing that our decisions have consequences and that we need to answer the question of our birth, we each have to do that to find our why. And so, exploring my why, I've been wondering, why do I love what I do? Why do I love the language of Arabic? Why do I feel this draw to the Middle East? And what am I supposed to do about it? And so, that question of love and how to respond has been a big part of my life. And so, yeah. So, mission alignment. This role allows me to look where the wound is and to attempt to come and provide some support and attention to connect with a place that is undergoing such difficulty and to try to see the beauty through the dust and to work with people to find what's important to preserve and what's important to cherish and how we can bring that forward. Yeah. So, my long-term goals in the field are to work in any context to find the most uplifting way to interact with myself and with others and with the environment to create beauty, no matter what, even if it's terribly sad. So, I've been blessed with a deep and rich culture connecting me to Iraq, where over a million people have died over the course of sanctions and wars in the last years. And the country is working towards getting back on its feet and its people are all over the world. Back on its feet and its people are all over the world with such a sense of longing and loss. And I'm a part of that. And how do I respond? And that's sort of how I feel. It's not that I'm interested in disaster. It's that I was born with a heart that loves places that are undergoing conflict. And that's how I feel about working as well in Gaza and Palestine. And I already have my beautiful memories of working in Bethlehem and Ramallah, R-A-M-A-L-L-A, with the early spaces there and the beautiful people that I know from my communities around the world, the Arab diaspora. So, my technical skills. I have a lot of technical skills from programming to 3D printing to customer relationship management software to cataloging to working on libraries and tags and identifying common features and synonyms and mapping and creating maps using OpenStreetMaps and I think, I don't know if it's a technical skill, but I'm good at interviewing and listening and talking to people to pull important information, 3D scanning. I'm sure there's, basically, I'm just good at stuff. But yeah, so creative problem solving to address a challenge in a post-conflict or crisis setting. So, during the garbage crisis in Beirut, where everybody was running away and closing their doors and shutting their windows, I started asking, what's possible to do and how can we take advantage of this disadvantage? And what we started doing is pulling the cardboard out of the garbage and pulverizing it and creating a pulp and using it to create bowls and using frames to make paper and to create 3D printable, extrudable designs using a syringe. And we did that together in Lebanon. It was a beautiful moment to just look at what's difficult and to say what's possible. Similarly, working in Syria, we looked into the history of the Syrian culture and the position of the tents and the storytelling and the elders, and we thought to ourselves, well, what if we look at the white UNHCR tents rather than just simple places of refuge? What if we saw them as places where we could bring our creativity through shadow puppets? And so we brought some solar panels and some LED lights to the Syrian refugee camps to explore that. Yeah, I've worked with all sorts of diverse stakeholders, from politicians to local communities, international organizations. I worked with the Institut Francais. I've worked with the RDPP, the Danish Development Corporation. They hired Bloom to run some programs. And personally, I've worked with the ITC in Iraq on a sustainable post-conflict reconstruction program to build greenhouses and create a learning educational program. Yeah, I work across many places as a co-founder of Bloom. We've worked with foundations and non-profits and created partnerships with non-profits around the world, and we're a part of a group of accelerator programs creating shared learnings, innovative solutions. I built a first prototype of our learning by doing together cohort-based software that allows people to take assessments and to use those assessments to identify their learning gaps and to give them the subsections of a curriculum rather than requiring them to go through the whole curriculum. And that's the core of the Bloom platform that we have now. And I managed the development team in the past. Data analysis. Yes, I've used data analysis. I can use Jasper and R and Python and other ways to analyze data. And I've done that in my thesis for post-traumatic growth when I studied 21 different social entrepreneurs and what happened to them throughout the position of the Beirut blast in 2020.

As the founder of Bloom.pm, a social entrepreneurship accelerator based in the Middle East, I have dedicated over a decade to fostering resilience and positive change in conflict-affected regions. My work encompasses designing educational programs, conducting audits on post-conflict reconstruction, and integrating cultural preservation into recovery efforts, all of which are directly relevant to the functions of this position.\n\nIn Mosul, Iraq, I collaborated with the United Nations’ International Trade Center to develop reconstruction curricula that support architects and engineers in designing sustainable, heritage-sensitive urban spaces. This involved mapping existing guidelines and identifying gaps in methodologies, which aligns with the role’s requirement for mapping existing guidelines and conducting gap analyses. My efforts in Mosul ensured that cultural heritage was preserved while facilitating the rebuilding of essential infrastructure, directly contributing to the well-being and identity of the community.\n\nAdditionally, I led innovative initiatives such as 3D printing projects in Erbil to preserve and share Iraqi cultural artifacts globally. By creating digital models of heritage items and uploading them to platforms like Thingiverse, I enabled widespread access and physical interaction with these artifacts, fostering a deeper appreciation and understanding of Iraq’s rich cultural history.

These roles required me to engage with diverse stakeholders, navigate cultural sensitivities, and implement creative solutions to immediate challenges, all of which are critical for developing heritage-sensitive debris removal and rubble management guidelines.\n\nFor instance, in Beirut during the garbage crisis, I led a project that transformed waste materials into art supplies, empowering local communities to turn a dire situation into a creative opportunity. Similarly, in Syria, I facilitated storytelling initiatives with refugee children, using shadow puppetry and other creative methods to help them express their experiences and emotions amidst ongoing conflict. These projects highlight my ability to integrate cultural preservation with practical solutions, ensuring that heritage is not only maintained but also revitalized through innovative approaches.\n\nMoreover, my technical skills in programming, 3D printing, data analysis, and digital mapping complement my cultural initiatives, allowing me to create robust, data-driven guidelines that are both effective and culturally respectful. My ability to bridge technical and cultural considerations ensures that the guidelines I develop will be comprehensive and applicable in diverse post-conflict scenarios.\n\nOverall, my combination of technical expertise, cultural sensitivity, and extensive experience in post-conflict reconstruction equips me to meet and exceed the requirements of this consultancy. I am confident that my background and skills will contribute significantly to the development of effective and culturally respectful debris management strategies.\n\n**Word Count:** 3,999 characters\n\n---\n\n### **2.
