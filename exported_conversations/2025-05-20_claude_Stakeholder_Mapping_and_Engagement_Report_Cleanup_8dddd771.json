Formalize the certification pathways\n\nLet me now outline a recommended structure and how to clean up the document to match the deliverable requirements.# BEIT Stakeholder Mapping & Engagement Report - Review and Recommendations\n\nAfter reviewing your BEIT stakeholder mapping and engagement report, I've identified several areas where the document could be streamlined and organized to better fulfill your TOR deliverable requirements. \n\n## Document Organization Issues\n\n1. **Duplicated Content**:\n   - Multiple versions of training structure recommendations appear throughout\n   - Several analyses of the same trainer interviews are repeated\n   - Solar training principles are presented in different formats across the document\n   - Similar day-by-day training plans appear in different sections\n\n2. **Structural Inconsistencies**:\n   - The report begins with a formal outline but transitions to various interview analyses without clear integration\n   - Multiple formats are used for presenting trainer feedback (tables, prose, direct quotes)\n   - Numbering systems restart and differ across sections\n   - Next steps and action items appear in multiple places\n\n## Recommended Document Structure\n\nTo fulfill your TOR deliverable requirements, I recommend reorganizing the document into this structure:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** (1-2 pages)\n   - Project overview and purpose\n   - Key findings from stakeholder engagement\n   - Core recommendations for curriculum and certification\n\n2. **Stakeholder Identification and Mapping** (2-3 pages)\n   - Consolidated table of all local experts interviewed\n   - Stakeholder ecosystem map showing relationships\n   - Clear roles and potential contributions\n\n3. **Engagement Process Documentation** (3-4 pages)\n   - Methodology for stakeholder selection\n   - Interview and focus group formats\n   - Timeline of engagement activities\n   - Participant lists (currently incomplete in some sections)\n\n4. **Consolidated Stakeholder Insights** (4-5 pages)\n   - Thematic analysis of feedback across all interviews\n   - Key quantitative data points from stakeholders\n   - Validated training recommendations from experts\n\n5. **Module Integration Recommendations** (3-4 pages)\n   - Solar training structure based on stakeholder input\n   - Day-by-day curriculum outline\n   - Equipment and resource requirements\n\n6. **Certification & Employment Pathways** (2-3 pages)\n   - Recommended certification approach\n   - Partnership opportunities with employers\n   - Post-training internship framework\n\n7. **Next Steps & Implementation Timeline** (1-2 pages)\n   - Clear action items with owners and deadlines\n   - Communication channels for ongoing engagement\n\n8. **Annexes**\n   - Interview transcripts\n   - Focus group notes\n   - Draft training materials mentioned\n\n## Specific Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Create a single stakeholder matrix**:\n   The document has several partial tables mapping stakeholders. Create one comprehensive table that includes:\n   - Name and organization\n   - Role/expertise\n   - Years of experience\n   - Key contributions\n   - Potential involvement in training\n   - Contact information\n\n2. **Consolidate the qualitative insights**:\n   Section 6 \"Consolidated Qualitative Insights\" contains excellent material but appears multiple times. Merge these into one definitive section that clearly connects insights to curriculum recommendations.\n\n3. **Standardize the training structure recommendation**:\n   Multiple day-by-day structures appear. Create one final recommended structure that incorporates all validated stakeholder inputs.\n\n4. **Develop a clearer certification pathway**:\n   The report mentions certification approaches but lacks a clear, finalized recommendation. Create a specific pathway that includes:\n   - Certification partners (RENAC, local authorities)\n   - Assessment methods\n   - Recognition process\n   - Renewal requirements\n\n5. **Formalize the communication channels**:\n   Section 10 has communication information but needs organization. Create a structured approach to ongoing stakeholder engagement.\n\n## Suggested Content to Remove\n\nTo streamline the document, consider removing:\n\n1. Raw interview notes that are repeated in multiple sections\n2. Draft versions of recommendations that have been superseded\n3. Excessive detail about individual trainers' methodologies that doesn't translate to final recommendations\n4. Repetitive tables showing similar information with slight variations\n\n## Missing Elements to Add\n\nTo fully satisfy your TOR requirements, consider adding:\n\n1. Complete participant lists for all focus group discussions\n2. A clear matrix showing which recommendations were validated by which stakeholders\n3. More detail on potential certification partnerships (particularly with RENAC, mentioned several times)\n4. A formalized process for curriculum adjustment based on ongoing stakeholder feedback\n\nWould you like me to help you develop any specific section of this reorganized structure, or would you prefer guidance on how to consolidate particular elements of the existing document?",

Clear structure that follows logical progression from stakeholder identification to recommendations\n2. Eliminates duplications and redundancies in the current document\n3. Standardizes the presentation format of stakeholder insights\n4. Directly addresses the TOR deliverable requirements (documented engagement, roles, recommendations)\n5. Creates actionable next steps with clear owners and timelines\n\n5 Cons of the Suggested Approach:\n1. May lose some nuanced details from individual interviews in the consolidation process\n2. Could exclude some valuable raw data that provides context or background\n3. Standardizing diverse stakeholder inputs into uniform formats might oversimplify some complex recommendations\n4. Potential for oversimplifying the divergent views of stakeholders when creating \"consensus\" recommendations\n5.

Executive Summary\n\nThe BEIT (Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation) project has conducted extensive stakeholder engagement with over 20 local experts in Mosul's solar, insulation, and architectural sectors. This engagement revealed a fundamental insight: successful technical training requires more than skills transfer—it demands building communities of practice that connect directly to market needs.\n\nOur stakeholder interviews have transformed our approach from a conventional training model to an ecosystem-building strategy that:\n\n1. Frames the unique angle of the short modules as **\"sales engineering\"** capabilities that combine technical knowledge with understanding client needs  \n2. Reframes training as **community formation** rather than content delivery  \n3. **Integrates market actors directly into the classroom** through employer-judged projects  \n4. Creates **tangible pathways to employment** through internships and real-world projects  \n5. Reconnects modern sustainability practices with Iraqi heritage and traditional wisdom\n\nThis report documents our engagement process, synthesizes key insights, and presents a framework for implementing training modules that reflect these principles. By centering local expertise and market realities, we aim to create not just skilled technicians, but empowered problem-solvers who can drive Mosul's sustainable reconstruction.\n\n## 2. Local Experts from Mosul\n\nThe following individuals were recommended as local trainers or subject-matter experts by Mosul-based partners (especially Mosul Space) and outreach from Solar Iraq. Availability and suitability were assessed based on technical knowledge, facilitation skills, and availability.\n\n### 2.1 Key Technical Trainers\n\n| Name | Module | Tech skill | Training skill | Training availability | Interviewed |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Hussam Falih | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Muayad Hasan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Ali Abkan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Mohammed Al-Qatan | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Saud Maan | Solar | ✓ | △ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Mustafa Waleed | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | — | 🟩 |\n| Dr Nasih Hma Salah | Solar | ✓ | ✓ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Ghassan | Insulation | ✓ | △ | — | 🟩 |\n| Muthanna Al-Mashhadani | Insulation | ✓ | △ | — | 🟩 |\n| Omar Laith | Insulation | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Ahmed Al-Obaidy | Architecture | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | 🟩 |\n| Laith Abdulla | Architecture | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Fatima Eyad | Architecture | ✓ | △ | △ | 🟩 |\n| Larsa Emad | Architecture | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n| Yahia Al-Fakhry | Architecture | ✓ | △ | ✓ | 🟩 |\n\n### 2.2 Outreach & Interview Status\n\n| Name | Module | Interview Date | Status |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Hussam Falih | Solar | 14 May 2025 | 🟩 Done |\n| Muayad Hasan | Solar | 14 May 2025 | 🟩 Done |\n| Ali Abkan | Solar | 16 May 2025 | 🟩 Done |\n| Mohammed Al-Qatan | Solar | 18 May 2025 | 🟩 Done |\n| Saud Maan | Solar | 18 May 2025 | 🟩 Done |\n| Mustafa Waleed | Solar | 19 May 2025 | 🟩 Done |\n| Dr Nasih Hma Salah | Solar | 20 May 2025 | 🟩 Done |\n\n## 3. Stakeholder Ecosystem Map\n\nThe following diagram shows all key partners in our BEIT solar training program in Mosul, putting trainees at the center and showing how they connect with everyone who helps them succeed.\n\n| Stakeholder | Role | Contribution to Training |\n|-------------|------|-------------------------|\n| **Trainees** | Central beneficiaries | Learning, peer support, market research |\n| **Master & Assistant Trainers** | Technical instructors | Hands-on skills, quality standards, mentorship |\n| **Solar Installation Firms** | Employers & field partners | Job opportunities, site visits, competition judges |\n| **Equipment Suppliers** | Hardware providers | Demo materials, technical specifications, pricing data |\n| **Government Agencies** | Regulatory framework | Standards certification, financing programs |\n| **International Certifiers** | Quality assurance | RENAC certification, global best practices |\n| **Finance Actors** | Investment catalysts | Micro-financing, business planning, ROI templates |\n| **Community Clients** | End users | Real-world problems, field testing, feedback |\n| **Alumni Network** | Peer supporters | Mentorship, job referrals, ongoing learning |\n| **Heritage Architects** | Cultural integrators | Traditional design principles, sustainable adaptation |\n\nThis approach shows that good training isn't just about teaching facts; it's about building a community that connects skills to real job opportunities.\n\n## 4. Documentation of Interviews\n\n| Session ID | Date (2025) | Participants | Condensed meeting notes – key points raised | Validated recommendations (already fed into Module 1) |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| INT-01 | 14 May | Bilal ↔ Hussam Falih – Enterprise-Development Specialist, OXFAM | Iraqi trainees think in amps, not kWh. DC-cable spec & breaker sizing often ignored → fires. Dust neglect biggest performance killer; needs demo. Up-front cost is the main adoption barrier → link to Ministry-of-Labour loans. Sun-path finder is the best quick shade tool. | Add amp-based load worksheet (Day 1). 45-min DC vs AC wiring safety lab (Day 2). Live \"dirty-vs-clean\" watt demo + panel-cleaning SOP (Day 5). Purchase two sun-path finders; embed exercise (Day 4). Invite a micro-loan officer to Day 6 careers panel. |\n| INT-02 | 14 May | Bilal ↔ Muayad Hasan – RENAC Master-Trainer | Uses PVsyst extensively; advocates simulation before field work. Story-based teaching; ends each day with a trainee review circle & anonymous sticky notes. Dust cleaning must avoid midday wash in summer. Poor mounting structures fail in wind; need structural calcs. | 90-min PVsyst demo + 20 trial licences (Day 3). Daily 15-min review circle + sticky-note feedback. Include dust-clean ROI discussion inside maintenance block (Day 5). Add structural load worksheet & torque-wrench practical (Day 4). |\n| INT-03 | 16 May | Bilal ↔ Ali Abkan – Technical Support Engineer, Chisage ESS | Credibility depends on certificates co-signed by major brands (Gisage, Huawei). Proposes \"tear-down & compare\" cheap vs premium inverters to show quality. Market flooded with fake 10-year warranties. Datasheet literacy and battery–inverter compatibility critical. | Secure brand co-logo for certificates. Add 3-inverter tear-down lab (Day 2–3). Myth-busting slide on fake warranties (Day 2). Datasheet scavenger-hunt worksheet (Day 2). Compatibility tables & firmware-pairing demo (Day 3). |\n| INT-04 | 18 May | Bilal ↔ Saud Maan – Lecturer, College of Electrical Engineering & Engineer, Dijla Office | Learners \"remember by doing\" – keep theory < 20%. Suggests system-assembly competition judged by employers. Idea: host \"Solar Festival\" linking trainees to 10–15 Mosul companies. Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps, inverter programming. | Day 6 installation competition with local firms on the judging panel. Add troubleshooting tasks on SPD, polarity & programming. Plan \"Solar Festival\" showcase two weeks after course. Negotiate 2-month paid internships with installers. |\n| INT-05 | 18 May | Bilal ↔ Mohammed Al-Qatan – Director, Mosul Solar Co. | Wants Day 1 to start hands-on inverter tear-down; theory woven later (70% lab). Emphasises datasheet reading to stop costly mistakes. String-sizing errors burn fuses; needs calculator exercise. Advocates mock job interviews as assessment. | Flip Day 1 agenda: tear-down first then concepts. Insert datasheet reading hunt (Day 1–2). Add string-sizing calculator + fuse-blow demo (Day 3). Schedule mock interviews with three PV firms in afternoon Day 6. |\n| INT-06 | 19 May | Bilal ↔ Mustafa Waleed (Mosul Space / Electrical-office partner) | 4-engineer office supplies PV kits, fire & PLC systems. Main clients: large farm pumps (day-only, no battery) and residential users. Biggest failure he sees: batteries thrown in hot, dusty store-rooms; life drops fast. Needs a cool, clean spot even if cables get longer. Hybrid inverters cost ≈ + US $1,000; commercial pay-back < 2 years; residential 6-8 yrs (dep. on loads). Stresses reading datasheet \"critical rows\" (max PV V, battery V). | Add mini-module on battery placement & ventilation; include cable-sizing for remote packs. Put a quick exercise on finding *Voc, Vmax, Vbat* in an Arabic/English datasheet. Brief comparison case-study: Off-grid vs Hybrid vs On-grid ROI for household vs farm pump. |\n| INT-07 | 20 May | Bilal ↔ Dr Nasih Hma Salah (PhD nanoscience, RENAC Master-Trainer, component supplier) | Uses *Bologna* method – always frame session & learning goals. Since 2019 has run 30-day TOT courses; 100% job-placement claim for 30 alumni. Recommends 2 days of factory / company visits and homework on market-price collection. Suggests limiting scope to small residential PV (≈150 m² homes) for a 6-day course; skip ag/industrial to stay realistic. Proposes subsidised 2-month internships after course (company gains free helper, trainee gains experience). Highlights ethics: quality standards, \"good niyya\", fix building leaks before adding PV. Notes solar-water-heater intro can be taught in 3 days as a lower-barrier track. | Insert half-day market-price scavenger task + template; debrief on Day 5 business block. Keep course strictly on small-residential PV; place \"industrial & ag extensions\" in Annex. Add bullet in Section 7 on internship pipeline (link to Saud's pathway idea). Open every day with a 2-min \"session framing\" slide. |\n\n## 5. Quantitative Data Points\n\n### Study of Solar Training Lengths from Interviewed Participants\n\n#### 1. \"Real-life\" durations the trainers have actually used\n\n*(pulled verbatim from the transcripts – initials in brackets)*\n\n| # | Trainer / Org. | Year mentioned | Typical course pattern they delivered | Hours per contact-day | Total contact-hours | Their slide / delivery preference |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | **Dr Nasih H.** – Nanoscience Lab (Baghdad) | 2019 | **30 calendar days – 2 h every other day** (\"كان أول تدريب… 30 يوم… ساعتين يوم بعد يوم\") | 2 h | ≈ 30 h | Minimum slides; prefers lab work then PDF hand-outs for self-study |\n| 2 | **Dr Nasih H.** – updated idea | 2025 | **7 days straight** (\"إلا خ سبع أيام… نجدد سبعة أيام\") | 5 h | ≈ 35 h | Wants Arabic slides + video snippets; no more than 6 bullets per slide |\n| 3 | **Hussam F.** – Oxfam / RENAC ToT | 2023-24 | **4 days, 09:00-13:00** (\"أربع أيام هو بالعادة يصير تقريباً من التسعة للوحدة\") | 4 h | 16 h | Picture-heavy PPT, < 20 slides total; relies on flip-chart teach-backs |\n| 4 | **Mohammed Q.** – Mosul Solar | 2022-24 | **6 days full-time** (\"ستة أيام… أول شي نبدأ وياهم…\") | 6 h | ≈ 36 h | \"No theory slides before touching hardware\" – uses photos only |\n| 5 | **Muayad H.** – RENAC master-trainer | 2024 | 3-month online + **14-day hands-on in Germany** *(RENAC model)*; Iraqi refreshers are **5-day, 6 h** blocks | 6 h | 30 h | 50:50 split – technical schematics + live PVsyst demo; decks capped at 25 slides |\n| 6 | **Saud M.** – Digital Solar Co. | 2023 | Ad-hoc **5 days, 5 h** (focus on pumps & hybrid) | 5 h | 25 h | Prefers interactive Google-Slide deck w/ live datasheet links |\n| 7 | **Ali A.** – Chisage ESS | 2024 | Usually joins other providers' 4- or 5-day courses as brand specialist (2-h battery block) | — | — | 8-slide tear-down deck + one live inverter |\n\n**Median length across the eight data-points:** **5 days** (range 4 → 30).\n\nWhile the range of days is large, the number of contact hours, 30, is similar to our proposed training.\n\n#### 2. How our proposed Lean 6-day boot-camp lines up\n\n| Cluster & Activity | Our Lean 6-day | Already in Mosul Solar | Already in KESK | \"Voices\" who asked for it |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Load audit in amps + value story** | Day 1 – amps worksheet + café case | ✗ | ✗ | H.F., S.M. |\n| **Hands-on component tear-down** | Day 1 – touch then talk | ✓ | ✓ | M.Q., A.A. |\n| **Datasheet-hunt + fake-vs-real** | Day 2 | ~ (light) | ✓ | A.A., H.F. |\n| **Battery / CC / Inverter sizing in amps** | Day 2-3 | ✓ | ✓ | A.A., M.Q. |\n| **DC vs AC safety lab (burned-wire demo)** | Day 3 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F. |\n| **Full BOS protection & grounding** | Day 3 | ✓ | ✓ | M.Q. |\n| **Shade/path-finder & wind-load calc** | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F., M.H. |\n| **Mount-up & torque-wrench practice** | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | M.Q. |\n| **Cleaning ROI + O&M contract** | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F. |\n| **ROI spreadsheet + sales pitch** | Day 5 | ✗ | ✗ | A.A., S.M., BG |\n| **Market-research street survey (30 interviews)** | Day 5 p.m. | ✗ | ✗ | H.F. |\n| **System assembly competition** | Day 6 a.m. | ✗ | ✓ (partial) | M.Q., H.F. |\n| **Mock interviews & employer panel** | Day 6 p.m. | ✗ | ✗ | M.Q., BG |\n\n##### What overlaps?\n\n* Core sizing maths, component taxonomy, mounting practice – all three programmes share them.\n* Our plan diverges by grafting **finance + customer-empathy + post-sale care** (none of which KESK or Mosul Solar touch).\n\n##### What are we still missing relative to peers?\n\n| Gap vs peers | Source that does cover it | Mitigation inside 6 days? |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Deep PV-physics & advanced cell tech (PERC, bifacial) | KESK | Pre-course 2-h micro-MOOC link |\n| Extended data-logging / SCADA commissioning | KESK | 1-h optional Day 6 add-on or Day 7 mini-module |\n| Formal MCS / IEC standards mapping | KESK slide pack | 20-min standards dash in Day 3 safety block |\n| Simulated design in PVsyst | Muayad RENAC | Light-touch demo Day 5, plus self-study licence list |\n\n#### 3. Is six days still credible after hearing the trainers?\n\n* **Hussam F.** – says 4-day is doable *if* 09-13 only theory + quick labs.\n* **Mohammed Q.** – built his own 6-day full-time course and is comfortable.\n* **Muayad H.** – prefers 5 or 10 full days but agrees you can \"hit the basics\" in 6 *\"if the kit is ready and class is max 4 groups.\"*\n* **Dr Nasih** – longest view (30 d); concedes a 7-day intensive is \"acceptable\" so long as evenings free for homework.\n\n**Consensus reading:** 6 packed days is the *lower edge* of comfort but feasible **if**:\n\n1. Gear is pre-wired & labelled (saves 90 min).\n2. Evening micro-tasks (video or spreadsheet) offload some theory.\n3. Class size ≤ 20, four rigs.\n\n## 6. Consolidated Qualitative Insights\n\nFrom our interviews with trainers and stakeholders, five key thematic clusters emerged that will shape our training approach:\n\n### 6.1 Sales Engineering: A Core Competency\n\nMultiple stakeholders emphasized that technical skill alone doesn't ensure success in Mosul's solar market. We've developed the concept of \"Sales Engineering\" as a distinct competency that combines technical knowledge with customer empathy and financial literacy. This approach:\n\n* Reframes solar technicians as problem-solvers who align solutions with client priorities (Mustafa Waleed highlighted a client whose primary concern was \"making sure his coffee machine works\")  \n* Equips graduates with tools to demonstrate ROI and lifetime value (Ali Abkan: \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper\")  \n* Teaches how to use social proof and local success stories rather than technical specifications to persuade customers (Hussam Falih: \"We always tell them person X installed it... this really encourages them\")  \n* Develops skills to present technical information in accessible terms using local metaphors and examples\n\nThis competency will be integrated throughout the curriculum rather than treated as a separate module, reflecting its foundational importance to success in the Mosul market.\n\n### 6.2. Module Interdependency: The Energy Ecosystem Approach\n\nOur stakeholder engagement revealed that solar, insulation, and architecture should not be taught as isolated domains but as interconnected components of a unified energy ecosystem. This insight transforms our approach to all three modules:\n\n| Module | Focus Area | Interconnection Points |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Solar** | Electrical energy flows, system sizing, power generation | - Solar panels provide roof shading, reducing cooling loads<br>- System sizing requirements decrease with proper insulation<br>- Proper architectural orientation affects panel placement and efficiency |\n| **Insulation** | Thermal envelope, heat transfer, material selection | - Reduces HVAC loads, allowing smaller solar systems<br>- Extends equipment life by reducing operating hours<br>- Creates healthier indoor environments (reduced illness) |\n| **Architecture** | Traditional wisdom, passive cooling, spatial orientation | - Window placement affects natural lighting needs<br>- Courtyard designs create natural ventilation<br>- Mosul heritage designs naturally regulate temperature |\n\nWe're developing cross-module exercises that demonstrate these interconnections quantitatively (e.g., calculating how much smaller a solar system can be when paired with proper insulation).\n\n### 6.3. Dr. Nasih's Solar Water Heater 3-Day Module\n\nDr. Nasih Hma Salah, a RENAC Master Trainer with approximately 14 years of solar experience, proposed an innovative approach to expand market entry points. His recommendation for a condensed 3-day solar water heater training (DN-HV-5, DN-HV-14) offers several strategic advantages:\n\n* **Lower barrier to entry**: Solar water heaters require less technical knowledge than PV systems, making them accessible to a broader range of participants including plumbers and general contractors  \n* **Market gap opportunity**: Dr. Nasih identified this as an underserved market segment in Mosul with significant potential  \n* **Cost efficiency**: Solar thermal systems typically cost less than PV, offering customers an affordable first step into solar energy  \n* **Complementary skills**: Thermal system installation develops transferable skills in solar orientation, mounting, and customer assessment that support later PV training\n\nWe propose developing this as a standalone module that can either serve as an entry point for those without electrical backgrounds or as a specialization for PV graduates looking to expand their service offerings.\n\n### 6.4. Capstone Project: Real-World Design Challenge\n\nStakeholders consistently emphasized the importance of authentic assessment through real-world projects. The capstone project approach combines several key recommendations:\n\n* Mohammed Al-Qatan's suggestion for mock job interviews as final assessment (MQ-HV-6)  \n* Saud Maan's proposal for an installation competition judged by potential employers (SM-HV-7)  \n* Dr. Nasih's emphasis on solving actual client problems (DN-HV-8)  \n* Several trainers' recommendation that each participant design a system for their own home\n\nThe capstone structure includes:\n\n1. Each trainee selects a real site (their home, relative's business, etc.) with ≤150m² roof area (following Dr. Nasih's recommendation to focus on small residential)  \n2. They develop a complete system design including load calculation, component selection, mounting plan, and financial analysis  \n3. On Day 6, they present this design to a panel of local employers in a mock job interview format  \n4. Top performers may be invited to participate in the \"Solar Festival\" showcase event (SM-HV-8)\n\nThis approach creates a direct bridge between training and employment while ensuring skills are applied to authentic local contexts.\n\n### 6.5 Consolidated Solar Training Principles\n\n*(with Trainer Initials for Cited Insights — aligned to Deliverable 1 TOR)*\n\n| # | Principle | What it Means in Practice | Key Evidence |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | **Hands-on First, Theory Second** | ≥ 70% of every module is practical: trainees crimp, torque, mount, commission and troubleshoot before any slide deck. | \"We don't have anything called theory; we are all practical work.\" – **MA-HV-17** |\n| 2 | **Datasheet & Spec-Sheet Literacy** | Every new component is introduced with a bilingual walk-through of its datasheet; quizzes require trainees to match specs across panels, inverters and batteries. | \"The most important thing is the datasheet.\" – **AA-HV-04** |\n| 3 | **DC Safety is Non-Negotiable** | Dedicated 45-minute lab on DC vs AC wiring, breaker and fuse rating, arc-fault risks; only DC-rated parts allowed in demos. | \"DC cable & breaker spec ignored in Iraq, causing fires.\" – **MA-HV-17** |\n| 4 | **Local Context Integration** | All loads expressed in amps, not kWh; price sheets, case-studies and failure photos are Mosul-specific; dust, heat and unstable grid built into loss factors. | **MA-HV-18**, **MA-HV-20**, **MA-HV-21** |\n| 5 | **Measure → Design → Install → Monitor Loop** | Trainees run a full cycle: site audit → PVsyst/HOMER simulation → 4-panel roof-rig installation → live monitoring & tuning. | \"Closed feedback loop: design → install → monitor → redesign.\" – **SM-HV-02** |\n| 6 | **Learning-Through-Mistakes Library** | Daily \"failure photo\" ice-breaker plus a bugged demo-rig so trainees diagnose real wiring & mounting errors. | **MA-HV-05**, **MA-HV-27** |\n| 7 | **Financial Storytelling & ROI** | Each technical task ends with a cash-flow or TCO illustration (generator amps vs solar, cheap vs premium inverter, O&M packages). | \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper.\" – **AA-HV-08** |\n| 8 | **Daily Reflection with Named Sticky Notes** | End-of-day wall where trainees post \"One thing I learnt / found interesting / still unclear\" **with their name** to support M&E photo capture. | Adapted from **MM-HV-15**method; partner feedback requests names on notes |\n| 9 | **4-Station Group Rotation (4–5 pax)** | Parallel stations (mounting, wiring, simulation, battery QA) keep class size 20–24 active; friends separated to avoid dependency. | **MM-HV-12** |\n| 10 | **Peer Teaching & Storytelling** | Micro-presentations: each learner teaches one device or local success story on a flip-chart to reinforce terminology. | **SA-HV-25**, **Qual-12** |\n| 11 | **Visual over Written** | Flip-charts, annotated photos, live demos and Google-Earth walk-throughs replace long text; Arabic/English glossary posters stay on the wall. | Guide pedagogy section + **MA-HV-13** |\n| 12 | **Pre / Post Scenario Assessment** | Scenario cards (technical *and* financial) answered at start and end of each day/module to evidence competence gains. | Guide M&E section |\n| 13 | **Quality-vs-Counterfeit Awareness** | Tear-down of cheap vs Tier-1 inverters, battery authenticity checklist, warranty verification drill. | **AA-HV-10**, **AA-HV-14** |\n| 14 | **Employment & Entrepreneurship Pathway** | Mock interviews with local employers, internship MOUs, \"solar festival\" showcase, and micro-finance/loan briefing embedded in Day 6. | **MA-HV-22**, **SA-HV-30**, Guide employment plan |\n| 15 | **After-Sales & O&M Mind-set** | Module on cleaning schedules, service-contract templates and battery health checks; trainees draft an O&M offer during class. | **MA-HV-20**, **MA-HV-28** |\n| 16 | **Simulation Before Field Work** | PVsyst (or free online) session precedes roof-rig practice; 20 trial licences budgeted. | **SM-HV-01** |\n| 17 | **Accredited, Co-branded Certification** | Course certificate co-signed by RENAC/GISAGE & ITC; final assessment = safe 4-panel install + design & ROI report for trainee's own home. | **AA-HV-06**, certificate insight |\n| 18 | **Inclusive, Mixed-Ability Intake** | Entry screening ensures basic electrical numeracy, but activities pair stronger with emerging learners; bilingual materials support non-native English speakers. | Core principle 1 + **AA-HV-07** |\n\n**Legend (Initials)**\n\n* **MA**: Mohammed Al Qatan  \n* **AA**: Ali Al-Abbasi  \n* **SM**: Saud Maan  \n* **MM**: Muayad Muheisen  \n* **SA**: Saud Al-Hadithi\n\n## 7. Module 1 Integration\n\n### Foundational Pedagogy (with attribution)\n\n| Pedagogic Pillar | Concrete Classroom Practice | Local Source* |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Facilitated, not delivered | Trainer circulates, asks coaching questions; learners do 70% of the talking/doing. | BG (Bilal Ghalib) |\n| Flipped & Chunked | 10-min input → 50-min micro-sprint → 10-min peer debrief; four blocks/day. | BG |\n| Problem-First / Empathy | Every activity starts with a live customer scenario (cousin's roof, café freezer, farm pump). | H.F. & S.M. |\n| Visible Standards | Three color-coded wall checklists: Safety, Datasheet-Match, Quality-Control. | A.A. |\n| Peer Teaching | End of each block, one team \"teach-back\" on a spec, tool or checklist step. | H.F. |\n| Daily Reflection Loop | 15-min sticky-wall (names optional); trainer photos for M&E & next-day tweak. | M.H. |\n| Care & Mind-set | Open each morning with a 3-min \"customer-care story\" linking quality to reputation. | BG |\n\n*H.F. = Hussam Falih, S.M. = Saud Maan, A.A. = Ali Abkan, M.H. = Muayad Hasan, M.W. = Mustafa Waleed, D.N. = Dr. Nasih, BG = Bilal Ghalib\n\n### Daily Structure\n\nBased on feedback from trainers, we've designed the 6-day program using a 4-block daily structure that creates natural rhythm while maximizing engagement:\n\n| Block | Time | Purpose | Expanded Description |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Touch + Think** | Morning<br>(9:30-11:00) | Exploration & Discussion | Trainees physically handle components, observe demonstrations, and discuss what they notice before formal instruction. Mohammed Al-Qatan (MQ-HV-1) emphasized starting with hands-on inverter examination on Day 1 rather than theory. |\n| **Decode + Decide** | Mid-Morning<br>(11:15-12:45) | Technical Analysis | Trainees learn to interpret datasheets, safety guidelines, and design parameters, making evidence-based decisions. Ali Abkan (AA-HV-2) stressed datasheet literacy as critical for preventing costly mistakes. |\n| **Do + Debug** | After Lunch<br>(1:45-3:15) | Applied Practice | Trainees build, wire, configure or troubleshoot real systems, applying morning concepts to practical tasks. Saud Maan (SM) noted that learners \"remember by doing\" with minimal theory. |\n| **Reflect + Connect** | Late Afternoon<br>(3:30-4:00) | Integration & Feedback | Daily reflection using Muayad's sticky-note method (MH-HV-13) where participants anonymously share what they learned, connecting technical skills to market realities. |\n\n### Day-by-Day Curriculum Outline\n\nModule 1 is titled **\"Solar Energy System Design & Installation\"** and is structured as a 6-day applied training. It is organized into progressive daily themes, aligned with Iraq's energy context and job market.\n\n| Day | Topic Focus | Key Activities | Changes Based on Stakeholder Input |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | Fundamentals & Site Walk | Component tear-down, load audit in amps, site assessment | Following Mohammed's approach: hands-on first, then theory. Added Hussam's amp-based load sheet for Iraqi context. |\n| 2 | Component Selection | Datasheet literacy, inverter-battery compatibility, quality assessment | Added Ali's datasheet scavenger hunt, fake vs. real component comparison, and Hussam's DC vs AC wiring safety lab. |\n| 3 | System Design & Safety | String sizing, protection devices, grounding principles | Added Hussam's DC safety lab, Mohammed's string sizing exercise, and fuse-blow demo based on common errors. |\n| 4 | Mounting & Environment | Shade analysis, structural considerations, wind load calculations | Added Hussam's sun-path finder exercise, Muayad's mounting torque test, and structural load worksheet. |\n| 5 | Business & Marketing | ROI calculations, customer needs assessment, field market research | Added Hussam's 30-household survey, Ali's ROI calculator, and O&M contract templates. |\n| 6 | Installation & Employment | System assembly competition, mock interviews, employer panel | Implemented Saud's competition format, Mohammed's mock interviews, and created a formal employer panel. |\n\n## 8. Certification & Pathway Recommendations\n\nBased on our stakeholder engagement, we have developed the following certification and employment pathway strategy:\n\n1. **MOU with RENAC drafted — target sign-off 30 June**  \n   Ali Abkan and Muayad Hasan are coordinating with RENAC to co-brand the certificate and line up an external assessor for the first course.\n\n2. **Subsidised 2-month internships (Saud's proposal)**  \n   Five Mosul installers have agreed in principle to host graduates; the project will cover the first-month stipend, making this the primary employment bridge.\n\n3. **Government recognition**  \n   Submit the syllabus to MoLSA & MoE with a support letter from BREC so graduates gain priority access to energy-loan programmes.\n\n4. **Portfolio evidence requirement**  \n   Each graduate must upload at least one PV-Report and installation photo to LinkedIn; a QR-code linking to the portfolio will be printed on the back of the certificate.\n\n5. **Solar Festival showcase event**  \n   Following Saud Maan's suggestion, we will organize a \"Solar Festival\" approximately 2-4 weeks after training completion, where graduates can showcase their skills to 10-15 local solar companies.\n\n6. **Employment Connection Plan**\n   * Internship MoUs with five firms for hosting graduates\n   * Industry panels with local employers joining Day 6 interviews\n   * Loan program integration to help participants access Ministry of Labour financing\n   * Service business templates including maintenance contracts and marketing materials\n\n## 9. Next Steps & Deadlines\n\n| Task | Owner | Due |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Research equipment purchase orders for training rig & pathfinders | Project Procurement | 25 May |\n| Draft certificate layout (RENAC placeholder?) | مؤيد + Bilal | 1 Jun |\n| Field-survey checklist Arabic/Eng. | حسّام | 5 Jun |\n| Gather failure stories, case studies, and photos from trainers | All Trainers | 10 Jun |\n| Submit syllabus to all trainers MoLSA | Bilal | 10 Jun |\n| Confirm internship MoUs with five solar firms | Saud Maan | 15 Jun |\n| Develop battery-cool-box lab sheet | Bilal + M.W. | 28 May |\n\n## 10. Interview Coordination & Communication Channels\n\nTo show clear visual progress of our outreach efforts, we created a calendar view that tracks interviews with stakeholders. Each person or group we contacted is added to the calendar with a color code showing their current status:\n\n* 🟨 **Yellow**: Interview scheduled  \n* 🟩 **Green**: Interview completed  \n* 🟧 **Orange**: Reschedule required  \n* 🟥 **Red**: Canceled or no-show\n\nWe reached out to stakeholders mainly through WhatsApp and scheduled individual interviews with each. Follow-up and continued engagement will use the same channels for consistency.\n\n### Annexes Available\n\n* Stakeholder Map (Google Sheets)\n* BEIT Facilitator Guide (Draft)\n* Module 1 - Days 4-6.pdf\n* Report and Deliverables folder\n\n---\n\n## SWOT Analysis of This Report\n\n### Strengths\n1.

Executive Summary\n\nThe BEIT (Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation) project has conducted extensive stakeholder engagement with over 20 local experts in Mosul's solar, insulation, and architectural sectors. This engagement revealed a fundamental insight: successful technical training requires more than skills transfer—it demands building communities of practice that connect directly to market needs.\n\nOur stakeholder interviews have transformed our approach from a conventional training model to an ecosystem-building strategy that:\n\n1. Frames the unique angle of the short modules as **\"sales engineering\"** capabilities that combine technical knowledge with understanding client needs  \n2. Reframes training as **community formation** rather than content delivery  \n3. **Integrates market actors directly into the classroom** through employer-judged projects  \n4. Creates **tangible pathways to employment** through internships and real-world projects  \n5.

Documentation of Interviews\n\n| Session ID | Date (2025) | Participants | Condensed meeting notes – key points raised | Validated recommendations (already fed into Module 1) |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| INT-01 | 14 May | Bilal ↔ Hussam Falih – Enterprise-Development Specialist, OXFAM | Iraqi trainees think in amps, not kWh. DC-cable spec & breaker sizing often ignored → fires. Dust neglect biggest performance killer; needs demo. Up-front cost is the main adoption barrier → link to Ministry-of-Labour loans. Sun-path finder is the best quick shade tool. | Add amp-based load worksheet (Day 1). 45-min DC vs AC wiring safety lab (Day 2). Live \"dirty-vs-clean\" watt demo + panel-cleaning SOP (Day 5). Purchase two sun-path finders; embed exercise (Day 4). Invite a micro-loan officer to Day 6 careers panel. |\n| INT-02 | 14 May | Bilal ↔ Muayad Hasan – RENAC Master-Trainer | Uses PVsyst extensively; advocates simulation before field work. Story-based teaching; ends each day with a trainee review circle & anonymous sticky notes. Dust cleaning must avoid midday wash in summer. Poor mounting structures fail in wind; need structural calcs. | 90-min PVsyst demo + 20 trial licences (Day 3). Daily 15-min review circle + sticky-note feedback. Include dust-clean ROI discussion inside maintenance block (Day 5). Add structural load worksheet & torque-wrench practical (Day 4). |\n| INT-03 | 16 May | Bilal ↔ Ali Abkan – Technical Support Engineer, Chisage ESS | Credibility depends on certificates co-signed by major brands (Gisage, Huawei). Proposes \"tear-down & compare\" cheap vs premium inverters to show quality. Market flooded with fake 10-year warranties. Datasheet literacy and battery–inverter compatibility critical. | Secure brand co-logo for certificates. Add 3-inverter tear-down lab (Day 2–3). Myth-busting slide on fake warranties (Day 2). Datasheet scavenger-hunt worksheet (Day 2). Compatibility tables & firmware-pairing demo (Day 3). |\n| INT-04 | 18 May | Bilal ↔ Saud Maan – Lecturer, College of Electrical Engineering & Engineer, Dijla Office | Learners \"remember by doing\" – keep theory < 20%. Suggests system-assembly competition judged by employers. Idea: host \"Solar Festival\" linking trainees to 10–15 Mosul companies. Common errors: SPD wiring, DC-polarity swaps, inverter programming. | Day 6 installation competition with local firms on the judging panel. Add troubleshooting tasks on SPD, polarity & programming. Plan \"Solar Festival\" showcase two weeks after course. Negotiate 2-month paid internships with installers. |\n| INT-05 | 18 May | Bilal ↔ Mohammed Al-Qatan – Director, Mosul Solar Co. | Wants Day 1 to start hands-on inverter tear-down; theory woven later (70% lab). Emphasises datasheet reading to stop costly mistakes. String-sizing errors burn fuses; needs calculator exercise. Advocates mock job interviews as assessment. | Flip Day 1 agenda: tear-down first then concepts. Insert datasheet reading hunt (Day 1–2). Add string-sizing calculator + fuse-blow demo (Day 3). Schedule mock interviews with three PV firms in afternoon Day 6. |\n| INT-06 | 19 May | Bilal ↔ Mustafa Waleed (Mosul Space / Electrical-office partner) | 4-engineer office supplies PV kits, fire & PLC systems. Main clients: large farm pumps (day-only, no battery) and residential users. Biggest failure he sees: batteries thrown in hot, dusty store-rooms; life drops fast. Needs a cool, clean spot even if cables get longer. Hybrid inverters cost ≈ + US $1,000; commercial pay-back < 2 years; residential 6-8 yrs (dep. on loads). Stresses reading datasheet \"critical rows\" (max PV V, battery V). | Add mini-module on battery placement & ventilation; include cable-sizing for remote packs. Put a quick exercise on finding *Voc, Vmax, Vbat* in an Arabic/English datasheet. Brief comparison case-study: Off-grid vs Hybrid vs On-grid ROI for household vs farm pump. |\n| INT-07 | 20 May | Bilal ↔ Dr Nasih Hma Salah (PhD nanoscience, RENAC Master-Trainer, component supplier) | Uses *Bologna* method – always frame session & learning goals. Since 2019 has run 30-day TOT courses; 100% job-placement claim for 30 alumni. Recommends 2 days of factory / company visits and homework on market-price collection. Suggests limiting scope to small residential PV (≈150 m² homes) for a 6-day course; skip ag/industrial to stay realistic. Proposes subsidised 2-month internships after course (company gains free helper, trainee gains experience). Highlights ethics: quality standards, \"good niyya\", fix building leaks before adding PV. Notes solar-water-heater intro can be taught in 3 days as a lower-barrier track. | Insert half-day market-price scavenger task + template; debrief on Day 5 business block. Keep course strictly on small-residential PV; place \"industrial & ag extensions\" in Annex. Add bullet in Section 7 on internship pipeline (link to Saud's pathway idea). Open every day with a 2-min \"session framing\" slide. |\n\n## 5. Quantitative Data Points\n\n### Study of Solar Training Lengths from Interviewed Participants\n\n#### 1. \"Real-life\" durations the trainers have actually used\n\n*(pulled verbatim from the transcripts – initials in brackets)*\n\n| # | Trainer / Org. | Year mentioned | Typical course pattern they delivered | Hours per contact-day | Total contact-hours | Their slide / delivery preference |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | **Dr Nasih H.** – Nanoscience Lab (Baghdad) | 2019 | **30 calendar days – 2 h every other day** (\"كان أول تدريب… 30 يوم… ساعتين يوم بعد يوم\") | 2 h | ≈ 30 h | Minimum slides; prefers lab work then PDF hand-outs for self-study |\n| 2 | **Dr Nasih H.** – updated idea | 2025 | **7 days straight** (\"إلا خ سبع أيام… نجدد سبعة أيام\") | 5 h | ≈ 35 h | Wants Arabic slides + video snippets; no more than 6 bullets per slide |\n| 3 | **Hussam F.** – Oxfam / RENAC ToT | 2023-24 | **4 days, 09:00-13:00** (\"أربع أيام هو بالعادة يصير تقريباً من التسعة للوحدة\") | 4 h | 16 h | Picture-heavy PPT, < 20 slides total; relies on flip-chart teach-backs |\n| 4 | **Mohammed Q.** – Mosul Solar | 2022-24 | **6 days full-time** (\"ستة أيام… أول شي نبدأ وياهم…\") | 6 h | ≈ 36 h | \"No theory slides before touching hardware\" – uses photos only |\n| 5 | **Muayad H.** – RENAC master-trainer | 2024 | 3-month online + **14-day hands-on in Germany** *(RENAC model)*; Iraqi refreshers are **5-day, 6 h** blocks | 6 h | 30 h | 50:50 split – technical schematics + live PVsyst demo; decks capped at 25 slides |\n| 6 | **Saud M.** – Digital Solar Co. | 2023 | Ad-hoc **5 days, 5 h** (focus on pumps & hybrid) | 5 h | 25 h | Prefers interactive Google-Slide deck w/ live datasheet links |\n| 7 | **Ali A.** – Chisage ESS | 2024 | Usually joins other providers' 4- or 5-day courses as brand specialist (2-h battery block) | — | — | 8-slide tear-down deck + one live inverter |\n\n**Median length across the eight data-points:** **5 days** (range 4 → 30).\n\nWhile the range of days is large, the number of contact hours, 30, is similar to our proposed training.\n\n#### 2. How our proposed Lean 6-day boot-camp lines up\n\n| Cluster & Activity | Our Lean 6-day | Already in Mosul Solar | Already in KESK | \"Voices\" who asked for it |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Load audit in amps + value story** | Day 1 – amps worksheet + café case | ✗ | ✗ | H.F., S.M. |\n| **Hands-on component tear-down** | Day 1 – touch then talk | ✓ | ✓ | M.Q., A.A. |\n| **Datasheet-hunt + fake-vs-real** | Day 2 | ~ (light) | ✓ | A.A., H.F. |\n| **Battery / CC / Inverter sizing in amps** | Day 2-3 | ✓ | ✓ | A.A., M.Q. |\n| **DC vs AC safety lab (burned-wire demo)** | Day 3 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F. |\n| **Full BOS protection & grounding** | Day 3 | ✓ | ✓ | M.Q. |\n| **Shade/path-finder & wind-load calc** | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F., M.H. |\n| **Mount-up & torque-wrench practice** | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | M.Q. |\n| **Cleaning ROI + O&M contract** | Day 4 | ✗ | ✓ | H.F. |\n| **ROI spreadsheet + sales pitch** | Day 5 | ✗ | ✗ | A.A., S.M., BG |\n| **Market-research street survey (30 interviews)** | Day 5 p.m. | ✗ | ✗ | H.F. |\n| **System assembly competition** | Day 6 a.m. | ✗ | ✓ (partial) | M.Q., H.F. |\n| **Mock interviews & employer panel** | Day 6 p.m. | ✗ | ✗ | M.Q., BG |\n\n##### What overlaps?\n\n* Core sizing maths, component taxonomy, mounting practice – all three programmes share them.\n* Our plan diverges by grafting **finance + customer-empathy + post-sale care** (none of which KESK or Mosul Solar touch).\n\n##### What are we still missing relative to peers?\n\n| Gap vs peers | Source that does cover it | Mitigation inside 6 days? |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Deep PV-physics & advanced cell tech (PERC, bifacial) | KESK | Pre-course 2-h micro-MOOC link |\n| Extended data-logging / SCADA commissioning | KESK | 1-h optional Day 6 add-on or Day 7 mini-module |\n| Formal MCS / IEC standards mapping | KESK slide pack | 20-min standards dash in Day 3 safety block |\n| Simulated design in PVsyst | Muayad RENAC | Light-touch demo Day 5, plus self-study licence list |\n\n#### 3. Is six days still credible after hearing the trainers?\n\n* **Hussam F.** – says 4-day is doable *if* 09-13 only theory + quick labs.\n* **Mohammed Q.** – built his own 6-day full-time course and is comfortable.\n* **Muayad H.** – prefers 5 or 10 full days but agrees you can \"hit the basics\" in 6 *\"if the kit is ready and class is max 4 groups.\"*\n* **Dr Nasih** – longest view (30 d); concedes a 7-day intensive is \"acceptable\" so long as evenings free for homework.\n\n**Consensus reading:** 6 packed days is the *lower edge* of comfort but feasible **if**:\n\n1. Gear is pre-wired & labelled (saves 90 min).\n2. Evening micro-tasks (video or spreadsheet) offload some theory.\n3. Class size ≤ 20, four rigs.\n\n## 6. Consolidated Qualitative Insights\n\nFrom our interviews with trainers and stakeholders, five key thematic clusters emerged that will shape our training approach:\n\n### 6.1 Sales Engineering: A Core Competency\n\nMultiple stakeholders emphasized that technical skill alone doesn't ensure success in Mosul's solar market. We've developed the concept of \"Sales Engineering\" as a distinct competency that combines technical knowledge with customer empathy and financial literacy. This approach:\n\n* Reframes solar technicians as problem-solvers who align solutions with client priorities (Mustafa Waleed highlighted a client whose primary concern was \"making sure his coffee machine works\")  \n* Equips graduates with tools to demonstrate ROI and lifetime value (Ali Abkan: \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper\")  \n* Teaches how to use social proof and local success stories rather than technical specifications to persuade customers (Hussam Falih: \"We always tell them person X installed it... this really encourages them\")  \n* Develops skills to present technical information in accessible terms using local metaphors and examples\n\nThis competency will be integrated throughout the curriculum rather than treated as a separate module, reflecting its foundational importance to success in the Mosul market.\n\n### 6.2. Module Interdependency: The Energy Ecosystem Approach\n\nOur stakeholder engagement revealed that solar, insulation, and architecture should not be taught as isolated domains but as interconnected components of a unified energy ecosystem. This insight transforms our approach to all three modules:\n\n| Module | Focus Area | Interconnection Points |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Solar** | Electrical energy flows, system sizing, power generation | - Solar panels provide roof shading, reducing cooling loads<br>- System sizing requirements decrease with proper insulation<br>- Proper architectural orientation affects panel placement and efficiency |\n| **Insulation** | Thermal envelope, heat transfer, material selection | - Reduces HVAC loads, allowing smaller solar systems<br>- Extends equipment life by reducing operating hours<br>- Creates healthier indoor environments (reduced illness) |\n| **Architecture** | Traditional wisdom, passive cooling, spatial orientation | - Window placement affects natural lighting needs<br>- Courtyard designs create natural ventilation<br>- Mosul heritage designs naturally regulate temperature |\n\nWe're developing cross-module exercises that demonstrate these interconnections quantitatively (e.g., calculating how much smaller a solar system can be when paired with proper insulation).\n\n### 6.3. Dr. Nasih's Solar Water Heater 3-Day Module\n\nDr. Nasih Hma Salah, a RENAC Master Trainer with approximately 14 years of solar experience, proposed an innovative approach to expand market entry points. His recommendation for a condensed 3-day solar water heater training (DN-HV-5, DN-HV-14) offers several strategic advantages:\n\n* **Lower barrier to entry**: Solar water heaters require less technical knowledge than PV systems, making them accessible to a broader range of participants including plumbers and general contractors  \n* **Market gap opportunity**: Dr. Nasih identified this as an underserved market segment in Mosul with significant potential  \n* **Cost efficiency**: Solar thermal systems typically cost less than PV, offering customers an affordable first step into solar energy  \n* **Complementary skills**: Thermal system installation develops transferable skills in solar orientation, mounting, and customer assessment that support later PV training\n\nWe propose developing this as a standalone module that can either serve as an entry point for those without electrical backgrounds or as a specialization for PV graduates looking to expand their service offerings.\n\n### 6.4. Capstone Project: Real-World Design Challenge\n\nStakeholders consistently emphasized the importance of authentic assessment through real-world projects. The capstone project approach combines several key recommendations:\n\n* Mohammed Al-Qatan's suggestion for mock job interviews as final assessment (MQ-HV-6)  \n* Saud Maan's proposal for an installation competition judged by potential employers (SM-HV-7)  \n* Dr. Nasih's emphasis on solving actual client problems (DN-HV-8)  \n* Several trainers' recommendation that each participant design a system for their own home\n\nThe capstone structure includes:\n\n1. Each trainee selects a real site (their home, relative's business, etc.) with ≤150m² roof area (following Dr. Nasih's recommendation to focus on small residential)  \n2. They develop a complete system design including load calculation, component selection, mounting plan, and financial analysis  \n3. On Day 6, they present this design to a panel of local employers in a mock job interview format  \n4. Top performers may be invited to participate in the \"Solar Festival\" showcase event (SM-HV-8)\n\nThis approach creates a direct bridge between training and employment while ensuring skills are applied to authentic local contexts.\n\n### 6.5 Consolidated Solar Training Principles\n\n*(with Trainer Initials for Cited Insights — aligned to Deliverable 1 TOR)*\n\n| # | Principle | What it Means in Practice | Key Evidence |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | **Hands-on First, Theory Second** | ≥ 70% of every module is practical: trainees crimp, torque, mount, commission and troubleshoot before any slide deck. | \"We don't have anything called theory; we are all practical work.\" – **MA-HV-17** |\n| 2 | **Datasheet & Spec-Sheet Literacy** | Every new component is introduced with a bilingual walk-through of its datasheet; quizzes require trainees to match specs across panels, inverters and batteries. | \"The most important thing is the datasheet.\" – **AA-HV-04** |\n| 3 | **DC Safety is Non-Negotiable** | Dedicated 45-minute lab on DC vs AC wiring, breaker and fuse rating, arc-fault risks; only DC-rated parts allowed in demos. | \"DC cable & breaker spec ignored in Iraq, causing fires.\" – **MA-HV-17** |\n| 4 | **Local Context Integration** | All loads expressed in amps, not kWh; price sheets, case-studies and failure photos are Mosul-specific; dust, heat and unstable grid built into loss factors. | **MA-HV-18**, **MA-HV-20**, **MA-HV-21** |\n| 5 | **Measure → Design → Install → Monitor Loop** | Trainees run a full cycle: site audit → PVsyst/HOMER simulation → 4-panel roof-rig installation → live monitoring & tuning. | \"Closed feedback loop: design → install → monitor → redesign.\" – **SM-HV-02** |\n| 6 | **Learning-Through-Mistakes Library** | Daily \"failure photo\" ice-breaker plus a bugged demo-rig so trainees diagnose real wiring & mounting errors. | **MA-HV-05**, **MA-HV-27** |\n| 7 | **Financial Storytelling & ROI** | Each technical task ends with a cash-flow or TCO illustration (generator amps vs solar, cheap vs premium inverter, O&M packages). | \"Run the numbers so people see why the 'expensive' one is cheaper.\" – **AA-HV-08** |\n| 8 | **Daily Reflection with Named Sticky Notes** | End-of-day wall where trainees post \"One thing I learnt / found interesting / still unclear\" **with their name** to support M&E photo capture. | Adapted from **MM-HV-15**method; partner feedback requests names on notes |\n| 9 | **4-Station Group Rotation (4–5 pax)** | Parallel stations (mounting, wiring, simulation, battery QA) keep class size 20–24 active; friends separated to avoid dependency. | **MM-HV-12** |\n| 10 | **Peer Teaching & Storytelling** | Micro-presentations: each learner teaches one device or local success story on a flip-chart to reinforce terminology. | **SA-HV-25**, **Qual-12** |\n| 11 | **Visual over Written** | Flip-charts, annotated photos, live demos and Google-Earth walk-throughs replace long text; Arabic/English glossary posters stay on the wall. | Guide pedagogy section + **MA-HV-13** |\n| 12 | **Pre / Post Scenario Assessment** | Scenario cards (technical *and* financial) answered at start and end of each day/module to evidence competence gains. | Guide M&E section |\n| 13 | **Quality-vs-Counterfeit Awareness** | Tear-down of cheap vs Tier-1 inverters, battery authenticity checklist, warranty verification drill. | **AA-HV-10**, **AA-HV-14** |\n| 14 | **Employment & Entrepreneurship Pathway** | Mock interviews with local employers, internship MOUs, \"solar festival\" showcase, and micro-finance/loan briefing embedded in Day 6. | **MA-HV-22**, **SA-HV-30**, Guide employment plan |\n| 15 | **After-Sales & O&M Mind-set** | Module on cleaning schedules, service-contract templates and battery health checks; trainees draft an O&M offer during class. | **MA-HV-20**, **MA-HV-28** |\n| 16 | **Simulation Before Field Work** | PVsyst (or free online) session precedes roof-rig practice; 20 trial licences budgeted. | **SM-HV-01** |\n| 17 | **Accredited, Co-branded Certification** | Course certificate co-signed by RENAC/GISAGE & ITC; final assessment = safe 4-panel install + design & ROI report for trainee's own home. | **AA-HV-06**, certificate insight |\n| 18 | **Inclusive, Mixed-Ability Intake** | Entry screening ensures basic electrical numeracy, but activities pair stronger with emerging learners; bilingual materials support non-native English speakers. | Core principle 1 + **AA-HV-07** |\n\n**Legend (Initials)**\n\n* **MA**: Mohammed Al Qatan  \n* **AA**: Ali Al-Abbasi  \n* **SM**: Saud Maan  \n* **MM**: Muayad Muheisen  \n* **SA**: Saud Al-Hadithi\n\n## 7. Module 1 Integration\n\n### Foundational Pedagogy (with attribution)\n\n| Pedagogic Pillar | Concrete Classroom Practice | Local Source* |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Facilitated, not delivered | Trainer circulates, asks coaching questions; learners do 70% of the talking/doing. | BG (Bilal Ghalib) |\n| Flipped & Chunked | 10-min input → 50-min micro-sprint → 10-min peer debrief; four blocks/day. | BG |\n| Problem-First / Empathy | Every activity starts with a live customer scenario (cousin's roof, café freezer, farm pump). | H.F. & S.M. |\n| Visible Standards | Three color-coded wall checklists: Safety, Datasheet-Match, Quality-Control. | A.A. |\n| Peer Teaching | End of each block, one team \"teach-back\" on a spec, tool or checklist step. | H.F. |\n| Daily Reflection Loop | 15-min sticky-wall (names optional); trainer photos for M&E & next-day tweak. | M.H. |\n| Care & Mind-set | Open each morning with a 3-min \"customer-care story\" linking quality to reputation. | BG |\n\n*H.F. = Hussam Falih, S.M. = Saud Maan, A.A. = Ali Abkan, M.H. = Muayad Hasan, M.W. = Mustafa Waleed, D.N. = Dr. Nasih, BG = Bilal Ghalib\n\n### Daily Structure\n\nBased on feedback from trainers, we've designed the 6-day program using a 4-block daily structure that creates natural rhythm while maximizing engagement:\n\n| Block | Time | Purpose | Expanded Description |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| **Touch + Think** | Morning<br>(9:30-11:00) | Exploration & Discussion | Trainees physically handle components, observe demonstrations, and discuss what they notice before formal instruction. Mohammed Al-Qatan (MQ-HV-1) emphasized starting with hands-on inverter examination on Day 1 rather than theory. |\n| **Decode + Decide** | Mid-Morning<br>(11:15-12:45) | Technical Analysis | Trainees learn to interpret datasheets, safety guidelines, and design parameters, making evidence-based decisions. Ali Abkan (AA-HV-2) stressed datasheet literacy as critical for preventing costly mistakes. |\n| **Do + Debug** | After Lunch<br>(1:45-3:15) | Applied Practice | Trainees build, wire, configure or troubleshoot real systems, applying morning concepts to practical tasks. Saud Maan (SM) noted that learners \"remember by doing\" with minimal theory. |\n| **Reflect + Connect** | Late Afternoon<br>(3:30-4:00) | Integration & Feedback | Daily reflection using Muayad's sticky-note method (MH-HV-13) where participants anonymously share what they learned, connecting technical skills to market realities. |\n\n### Day-by-Day Curriculum Outline\n\nModule 1 is titled **\"Solar Energy System Design & Installation\"** and is structured as a 6-day applied training. It is organized into progressive daily themes, aligned with Iraq's energy context and job market.\n\n| Day | Topic Focus | Key Activities | Changes Based on Stakeholder Input |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1 | Fundamentals & Site Walk | Component tear-down, load audit in amps, site assessment | Following Mohammed's approach: hands-on first, then theory. Added Hussam's amp-based load sheet for Iraqi context. |\n| 2 | Component Selection | Datasheet literacy, inverter-battery compatibility, quality assessment | Added Ali's datasheet scavenger hunt, fake vs. real component comparison, and Hussam's DC vs AC wiring safety lab. |\n| 3 | System Design & Safety | String sizing, protection devices, grounding principles | Added Hussam's DC safety lab, Mohammed's string sizing exercise, and fuse-blow demo based on common errors. |\n| 4 | Mounting & Environment | Shade analysis, structural considerations, wind load calculations | Added Hussam's sun-path finder exercise, Muayad's mounting torque test, and structural load worksheet. |\n| 5 | Business & Marketing | ROI calculations, customer needs assessment, field market research | Added Hussam's 30-household survey, Ali's ROI calculator, and O&M contract templates. |\n| 6 | Installation & Employment | System assembly competition, mock interviews, employer panel | Implemented Saud's competition format, Mohammed's mock interviews, and created a formal employer panel. |\n\n## 8. Certification & Pathway Recommendations\n\nBased on our stakeholder engagement, we have developed the following certification and employment pathway strategy:\n\n1. **MOU with RENAC drafted — target sign-off 30 June**  \n   Ali Abkan and Muayad Hasan are coordinating with RENAC to co-brand the certificate and line up an external assessor for the first course.\n\n2. **Subsidised 2-month internships (Saud's proposal)**  \n   Five Mosul installers have agreed in principle to host graduates; the project will cover the first-month stipend, making this the primary employment bridge.\n\n3. **Government recognition**  \n   Submit the syllabus to MoLSA & MoE with a support letter from BREC so graduates gain priority access to energy-loan programmes.\n\n4. **Portfolio evidence requirement**  \n   Each graduate must upload at least one PV-Report and installation photo to LinkedIn; a QR-code linking to the portfolio will be printed on the back of the certificate.\n\n5. **Solar Festival showcase event**  \n   Following Saud Maan's suggestion, we will organize a \"Solar Festival\" approximately 2-4 weeks after training completion, where graduates can showcase their skills to 10-15 local solar companies.\n\n6. **Employment Connection Plan**\n   * Internship MoUs with five firms for hosting graduates\n   * Industry panels with local employers joining Day 6 interviews\n   * Loan program integration to help participants access Ministry of Labour financing\n   * Service business templates including maintenance contracts and marketing materials\n\n## 9.
