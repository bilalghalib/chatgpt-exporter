      "content": "In the **Maliki school of thought**, reciting from a **mushaf (physical copy of the Quran)** while performing **Salah (prayer)** is generally considered **disliked (makruh)**, though the ruling varies based on circumstances. \n\n### **Detailed Ruling:**\n1. **For Obligatory Prayers:**  \n   - It is **disliked (makruh)** to hold and read from the **mushaf** while praying in **obligatory (fard) prayers** because it involves extra movements (turning pages, holding the book) and distracts from khushu' (concentration).\n   - It also contradicts the traditional practice of memorizing and reciting from memory.\n\n2. **For Supererogatory (Nafl) Prayers, Such as Tahajjud:**  \n   - In voluntary prayers, especially **Tahajjud (night prayer)**, some Maliki scholars allow reading from the mushaf **if necessary**, particularly for those who haven't memorized enough Quran.\n   - However, it is still **preferable** to recite from memory.\n\n3. **Following the Imam with a Mushaf:**  \n   - A follower in **congregational prayer** should not hold a mushaf to \"check\" the Imam’s recitation. Instead, they should rely on their memory and listen attentively.\n\n4. **Imam Holding a Mushaf:**  \n   - The **Maliki madhhab** considers it **impermissible** for an **Imam** leading a **congregational** prayer to read from the mushaf because it disrupts the flow of Salah and introduces excessive movement.\n\n### **Summary of the Maliki View:**\n- **Makruh (disliked)** in **obligatory prayers** due to distractions.\n- **Allowed but not preferred** in **voluntary prayers** if needed.\n- **Not permissible** for the **Imam** to lead using a mushaf.\n- **Not permissible** for a **follower** to hold the mushaf in congregation.\n\nWould you like references from Maliki sources on this?",

Even if it does not involve movement, **reading from a text** is seen as a departure from the natural form of prayer.\n   \n2. **Potential Distraction and Reduced Khushu' (Concentration):**  \n   - The Malikis emphasize **khushu' (presence of heart in prayer)**. Even if the mushaf is placed ahead, looking at it **requires eye movement and mental effort** that could affect concentration.\n\n3. **Comparison to Other Acts of Distraction:**  \n   - Some Maliki jurists compare **looking at the mushaf** to **closing one’s eyes in prayer**, which is also discouraged unless necessary, because both actions take away from the natural focus on the place of **sujood (prostration)**.\n\n### **Exceptions & Practicality:**\n- If someone is **new to memorization** or **wants to pray longer (such as in Tahajjud)** and cannot recall the verses, some scholars might **tolerate** this action **in voluntary (nafl) prayers**, but it remains **less ideal**.\n- If you **glance occasionally** without relying on the mushaf for every word, it would reduce the level of dislike.\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Makruh (disliked) but not invalid** if the mushaf is placed ahead and not held.\n- Less disliked in **voluntary prayers** than in **obligatory prayers**.\n- Still preferable to recite from memory for full concentration and adherence to the Sunnah.\n\nWould you like references from Maliki texts on this?",

      "content": "In the **Maliki school**, the ruling for **reading from a mushaf** while performing **makeup (qada) prayers** follows the same principles as obligatory prayers:  \n\n### **Ruling:**\n1. **It is still **makruh (disliked)** to read from the mushaf, even if placed in front of you, because:**  \n   - **Obligatory (fard) prayers**—whether prayed on time or as qada—should follow the standard rulings of Salah, which emphasize **reciting from memory** rather than reading.  \n   - It can distract from **khushu' (concentration)** and introduce an unnatural form of prayer.  \n\n2. **Why Might Some Consider It More Acceptable?**  \n   - If you are **making up many prayers** and have forgotten large portions of Quran, some scholars may consider **looking at the mushaf in front of you** (without holding it) as **a less severe form of makruh**—but it remains disliked.  \n   - Some scholars argue that since **qada prayers must be completed**, if someone forgets much of the Quran and is unable to complete their prayer without reading, **using a mushaf would be preferable to omitting necessary recitation**.  \n\n3. **Best Practice:**  \n   - If possible, recite from memory, even if it means repeating shorter surahs.  \n   - If needed for **longer recitations** (like Fajr or Maghrib), **glancing occasionally without relying fully** would be **less makruh** than reading every word.  \n   - Avoid holding the mushaf, as this involves **extra movement** that is generally discouraged in Maliki fiqh.  \n\n### **Conclusion:**  \n- **Reading from a mushaf in qada prayers is still makruh**, as the ruling for obligatory prayers applies to them.  \n- If absolutely necessary, **placing it in front and glancing occasionally** is **less disliked than holding it**.  \n- If memory is weak, it is **better to repeat shorter surahs** rather than rely on reading.  \n\nWould you like references from **Maliki sources** on this ruling?",
