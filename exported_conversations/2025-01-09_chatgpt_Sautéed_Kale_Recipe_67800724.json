      "content": "Kleicha is indeed a traditional Iraqi cookie, often made for festive occasions like Eid or other celebrations. It’s known for its soft, flaky dough and delicious fillings, typically flavored with dates, nuts, or spices. Here's a classic recipe for **Iraqi Kleicha**:\n\n---\n\n### **Traditional Iraqi Kleicha Recipe**\n\n#### **Ingredients:**\n\n**For the Dough:**\n- 3 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1/2 cup butter, melted\n- 1/2 cup vegetable oil\n- 1/4 cup sugar\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional)\n- 1/2 cup warm milk (adjust as needed for dough consistency)\n- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast (optional, for a slightly fluffier texture)\n\n**For the Filling:**\n- **Date filling:**  \n  - 2 cups pitted dates  \n  - 1 tablespoon butter or ghee  \n  - 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom or cinnamon  \n- **Nut filling (optional):**  \n  - 1 cup finely chopped walnuts  \n  - 2 tablespoons sugar  \n  - 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon  \n- **Optional spice filling:**  \n  - A mix of sugar, cinnamon, and ground cardamom\n\n**For Brushing:**\n- 1 egg yolk mixed with 1 tablespoon milk or water (for a shiny finish)\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Dough:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and cardamom (if using). \n   - Add the melted butter and vegetable oil. Mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n   - If using yeast, dissolve it in the warm milk and let it sit for 5 minutes. Gradually add the milk (with or without yeast) to the flour mixture, kneading until a smooth, pliable dough forms. Adjust with a little more milk if the dough feels too dry.\n   - Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   - For the **date filling**, melt the butter or ghee in a saucepan over low heat, then add the dates and cardamom/cinnamon. Mash with a spoon until a soft paste forms. Let cool.\n   - For the **nut filling**, mix the chopped walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl.\n   - For the **spice filling**, simply combine sugar, cinnamon, and cardamom in a small bowl.\n\n3. **Shape the Cookies:**\n   - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper.\n   - Divide the dough into small portions (about the size of a golf ball). Roll each portion into a thin oval or circle.\n   - Spread the filling of your choice evenly over the dough. Roll it up like a log for a date-filled shape, or fold into a crescent or circle for other styles.\n   - Alternatively, you can use a cookie mold for decorative designs.\n\n4. **Bake:**\n   - Place the shaped cookies on the prepared tray. Brush the tops with the egg yolk mixture.\n   - Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly golden.\n\n5. **Cool and Serve:**\n   - Let the cookies cool slightly on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with tea or coffee.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips:**\n- **Storage:** Store in an airtight container for up to a week, or freeze for longer.\n- **Custom Flavors:** Add a touch of rose water or orange blossom water to the dough for an extra aromatic twist.\n- **Make-Ahead:** You can prepare the dough and filling in advance, storing them separately until ready to bake.\n\nEnjoy this delightful taste of Iraqi heritage!",
