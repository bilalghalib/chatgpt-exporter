      "content": "Your revised statement is quite clear and maintains the essence of the original intent, but there are some subtle differences in meaning and scope:\n\n1. **Scope of Responsibility**: Your revised version suggests that the individual and joint responsibility of both parties is contingent upon following the decision-making process described in the document. This implies that if decisions are not made according to this process, the responsibilities of the parties might be different or unclear.\n\n2. **Liability for Unilateral Decisions**: The original statement explicitly states that decisions made unilaterally, without consulting the other party, result in the individual liability of the party making the decision. This specific scenario is not directly addressed in your revised version, leaving a potential gap in understanding the consequences of unilateral actions.\n\n3. **Clarity on Joint and Individual Responsibilities**: The original statement clearly differentiates between joint decisions (leading to shared responsibility) and individual decisions (leading to individual responsibility). Your version, while clear, doesn't explicitly mention the consequences of individual decisions made outside the agreed-upon process.\n\nIn summary, your revision maintains the overall concept of shared responsibility but might benefit from a clause addressing the responsibility or liability associated with decisions made outside the agreed decision-making process.",
