      "content": "Summarize this, find the clusters of topics first and put them in an obsidian format:\nAlright, so here we go. We're gonna be walking for a bit to get to the day by day where I will hopefully get one of those jars actually because then I could use that nice lid that I have at home and got vinegar yesterday so I don't think I need anything else from there. I need to get a patch from my jacket. I'd also like to just go to a coffee shop and drink a coffee for the course of 15 minutes without talking or thinking or doing something. That's gonna be my practice for the day. I would like to actually get back onto my meditation practice. I think 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes in the evening would be wonderful if I could pull it off. I miss my baby and I'm here so I really would like to find a way to talk to him. Ya Allah Ya Kareem Ya Kareem Ya Kareem Ya Kareem Ya Kareem. Instead of talking to myself, I could be talking to God. Talking to the least one of you. Talking to the better and most gracious version of myself. And I'm in old need, which is beautiful. And I would like to be permeated by the beauty. There is a loss. I felt really happy to see the baby and Josephine. It's really sweet. And I just want to hold the baby. I want to squeeze him and hold him and he's in the evening not having it. He's just kind of squirmy. He's pretty. Slippery. I'm pretty alone here in France. I connect to people from afar on the telephone. Maybe I need to connect people from a close with my body. And I'm going to start using my calendar. My freedom isn't going to be, I'm not going to be dominated by time. But I will be more free by sitting up flexible big blocks of how I like to be just flowing with things. And then I need to put things in there to make sure that I do the things that I need to do. For instance, I want to have a follow up meeting, a two week post family time follow up. I want to make sure to reach out to the person from Kup. And I would also like to reach out to Sylvanna. She had a baby. It's been a month now. I should definitely reach out to her. There's such beautiful sunlight here. It's darkness and the shine of the snow. And inside the city there's very little light. I need to return. Next month I will, I'm going to in short I'll have a salary. And then when I get the salary I will pay for a few things. Probably pay for the air table. Pay for my gym membership and pay for the co-working space. I had an idea to return to my English teaching here to meet people. But also I thought I would put up free small business, actually free business consulting. Why don't you say small? Free business consulting for anybody that wants to take advantage of an English speaking international person who has lots of experience doing lots of different things. And I think I need to look at the phone for a second. I'm sorry guys. I keep thinking I can see. Oh is that it over there? No. Just one more stop. So hardware store. You know I'm going to get another one of those pen loops for my notebook because I gave mine to my dad. And I will, if I lay why not, just enjoy my day. Go to the hardware store, check out for that clip. Go to the flag, get the pen loop. On Amazon get the jacket patch. Do something social, call your sister. Get some snacks. Oh I remember I was going to get the actual jar here. And yeah so I have all of those straws up there. Lion's mane, main petri dish. I think I want to try to just like get a backup. You know like this thing that will keep the elements all backed up. All of the different species because I really don't want to lose any of the species because I have this squishy one which is rare and I have it in a few forms but just got to make sure that I clean up the agar. I can get some of those. What is that? It's like back to agar. They call it antimicrobial agar. Just to be sure that that's like my home agar base. It's clean. It's not going to have any problems. And this is a hobby. This exploration and foraging is a hobby. Beautiful. To go out regularly and to see nature and I think it's really important. And yeah I think what I want to do actually is get into startup mode and get into the early stage boot up phase which is I think where I thrive in many startups. Maybe even investing and joining later. I felt a lot if this project and my dad worked out and had the resources. I kind of like this idea. And it's closed. It's closed. Oh. I think it just opens up again at two thirty which is in fifteen minutes. Okay. Not a problem. They don't have any jars. That's okay. There they are. No jars. Perfect. Perfect. Okay so two thirty I come back here. And for now we will continue walking. And I'll take all of this audio and I'll ask Chad GPT to summarize it and fill out my to do list. And we'll just keep walking and talking to myself. And who cares about me. Who would want to hear me speak. They hear me think. Do I read poetry. No. Why would I read other people's poetry. Why would other people want to read my poetry if I don't read their poetry. It's a. It's unkind. It's not a beautiful way. I think I'm going to go walk through the park into the city and go to Wally's. Get a coffee. And. Oh my dad. I think I really would like to. Get on the call with Doug Song. Those people from back in Michigan you know the people who helped with the previous. Stuff that I was involved in could be really nice to have them in the. No. At the very least. And maybe even to. Yeah. It was called. I know so many people that it would be nice to. Some sort of connection to the past. And absolutely. Once I get this confirmation from my dad I should talk to me. And tell him that I would. Like to really make a push for this. And like I'm going to work with my dad half time and tell that as well. And then personally I think it's time to act. Not a time to empower. Especially these early stage businesses. And just to be sure that we have the confidence in that things that we're sharing are actually things that we can practically do. And yeah so these. These patents are something. The experience of managing a team. And I think. Actually. The. Even now. Sponsoring with the smallest of amounts. Water projects internationally. It will give us the ability to be on the radar. And it will give us the ability to find future volunteers and engineers. And. It would be important I think for. Urban farming projects and all sorts of different projects to have a. Series of different sized interventions. There's a lot of people. Water. It's so important. Water holds the earth together. It's earthquake prevention. Also. The way that we can. Should go meet up with that guy and a man. Or meet up with him or talk to him or send him a message maybe I can talk to her. He's can't. And tell him that. Tending to work on this water thing. I would like to. Get the blessing of my shape. If possible. Also I want to take. The French classes. Learning loops. I feel like. There's like different scales of fractal loop to loop through the loops. Where a learning loop is. The way that we can. Think of society and like that. That's moral. The arc. Of history is long. Bending towards justice and we can think of the loop. Being that. The way that the arc bends. You know like combing your hair back and forth and your arm goes in a circle and slowly slowly your hair gets straighter and straighter. And. You got to enjoy yourself man. Got a. Scoot. I miss my brother. A lot like me. And he is kind of crazy and chaotic and he thinks about many things. And. I have. I wonder if it's possible. I think I wonder if it's beneficial for me. To. Have these diverse interests. Is there a way. To bring in actually. The mycology. And to think about what. Water. Means for. These. Networks. How does the water. Under ground. Relates to the mycological. Networks and my this is beautiful mash up. Let's take a picture. Yeah so I'm wondering how the mycology works. Underground. Preserve the water. And also what am I supposed to do with this idea for the proof of inner work. I think. It would be amazing to potentially share it with the design people at Apple. They're probably staying very far away from currency. But they are like one of the world's biggest banks right through the Apple store. And they're beginning this journal. And I feel like. They could have. An experimental. Journal. That is. Integrated. With either a school. Or a. Fund funding organization. I'm sure I'm sure Apple has its own foundation. And if that they could then identify. Whom. To disperse funds to. But in a giving way rather than you taking your journal. And then. Unlocking funds. You do your journal. And if you do that you unlock the ability to validate. Other people's journals. It's it's got to be a two way street. So the idea is that you do your journal. And then it will. Unlock. Your ability to. Yeah validate somebody else's journal. But only if somebody has first validated that your journal. Gets two thumbs up and so there's kind of this. Moment of. Creating something to do something. Like a recursive loop so we have to break that. And how can we do that. Maybe it's. Maybe we actually use chat GPT. Chat GPT can finally. Help us. And identifying if it's the same person. That is valid that is writing like. How. There's got to be a way to use chat GPT. To identify distinct styles and writing. Tiny little. Ways that people. Pick their phrase the ologies. And. And through and through that then. Being able to. Say that this is the same person and not only is this the same person. They are reflecting on the thing that they said yesterday. And maybe actually. It needs. Everyone needs an agent to. Whoa. Everyone needs an agent that will be able to. Monitor and evaluate progress. I think this is potentially the element that was missing from before. It was. Needing this kind of feedback loop. And. You know I should just make it. No, no, no, no. Should I s- you know, I should write a proof of concept and ask for support and, um, maybe work with Moseh and Mortova to find young people in Iraq who can help with developing this into the future. I think I also want to talk with Joe about this and maybe Ben, and I think one of the other things I really need to figure out is like, I'm scared in this world, like, I don't feel super safe, I don't feel like I'm in a place where I can just talk and do and be without needing to be very careful because of- Like, even my friends, man, even Joe and stuff, I'm feeling nervous to connect with because I don't know where his head's at. And if he just disagrees with me, how will I be able to stand my ground? How will I be able to be completely true to myself and my beliefs in a non-zogmatic but clear and open, uh, to be changed sort of way? And the question is, am I? I'm not sure. I think there's a lot of feeling. That's just- and the thing is, the way that I feel, it's like, is it- What is the word for someone who only cares about xenophobic themselves and people that look like them? Like, do I really not care about the hostages in Israel? I don't think so. I would hate to see anybody- Innocent, injured. Anybody who's- just anybody, maybe not even anybody innocent. I believe in the sanctity of human life and the innocence of everyone until they're proven guilty. You never know. Like, I don't think- I don't think, to be really honest, that I would be as brave as the Jews. That are protesting the army and are, you know, able to- yeah. Are protesting the army and are- I just found a bunch of cool things in the garbage. Crazy. And are, you know, um, how do you say this? Boycoting, like going into service. Like, uh, what is the word? Yeah, it's just boycotting, I guess. This is not bad. These are nice- these are nice glasses. Why do they throw them away? Okay. Now, let's try not to break them. And then let's go. Yeah, so all those people- they're not Jewish. They're Israeli, right? Jewish people are around the world. Israelis that are boycotting the military service. I don't think I'm a spokesperson. I don't think I am a voice of wisdom yet. I am afraid. And I feel this retreat of, you know, a fear of criticism, I guess. Fear of being ostracized, wanting to not hurt people with my words. And actually, this results, I think, from when I was very young. My mother and father had to go into school to be held accountable for my words as a six- seven- five, six-year-old because I had been saying that the American soldiers in Iraq should die. And I know it was true for me then. Oh, cuteies. Okay, it's the future. And, uh, because that was all I knew. I was my entire, you know, world with my dad. And I think I would like to see the average development. I don't think, necessarily, that it is an intelligence thing. People keep saying, \"Oh, Palestinians are taught this.\" And from when they were very young and they're indoctrinated and they're backward and they will never be fair players. And I think maybe even Arabs feel the same way. Palestinians there might feel the same way about the Jewish population and Israeli population saying that they're indoctrinated and is there a place for a real conversation? That's the scary thing. A real conversation is. And I think a real conversation may require mediation, may require time and space and a higher power and a twelve-step program for listening. And maybe these are the things that we need to be teaching in school. I think the idea of dogmatism and this ingrained pinhole view of the world is leading people to very strange places. And it's so tied to truth and to salvation that they stay small when, in fact, I think we need to open up. I think the idea of a boycott is fighting with the tools of power. And I think mapping my models and trying to identify, like, am I still in a tribal identity is going to be something I'll have to sincerely interrogate. Like, I'm here. I have a heart. I have my feelings. And I'm awake and I'm drunk. My coffee. I'm alive. And now I got to figure out who I am, what I believe. And to find the poetry. To find the poetry in a baby that cries and talismanic prayers that don't perform their magic in a coffee that awakens me not. I remember meeting David White and making decisions based on my values, but realizing that I didn't feel like I could live up to them. But that's the real stretch, right? The real stretch is knowing who you want to be, being terrified by that vision, taking that first step. And I shouldn't be alone. We need to be accompanied. We're going far together. We shall law. Is it possible to be more like Patrick Colison and others? For me? Or is that not my lot? Because I am who I am. I am beloved with a crazy brain. Now I got to figure out if I'm going in the right direction. Okay, so I have lots of friends I'm not talking to regularly. But who are my true friends? I think people like Morge. But I need to be a better friend, too. How can I be a better friend? It's a question that I ask myself. I haven't even reflected on last year yet. I'm still just trying to keep marching on. I keep going into the future. But what was last year like? And, uh, wow, genes are totally in. It's like suddenly looking at a thing and all they even thought of was getting genes again. I'm no longer young. And I don't feel so old. I feel like I'm a middle aged. I'm approaching. I'm approaching it. It really depends on if we live forever or not, right? It was funny hearing Benjamin Franklin talking about his life. And, uh, whoops, he's coming up. Especially as an old man. Being like, yeah, no, I'm good. I'm done. I've done enough. And ever since I was really young, actually, I really appreciated Benjamin Franklin. And when I first heard of the leather apron, I don't know who told me. Somebody told me. But it was really inspiring. I thought, how cool. Somebody else sort of thinks he looks like me. I'm not sure what he had. I think this attention to detail, actually, and the writing down and the specification setting. And of course, not everything goes according to plan, but they do one's best to do that. To write down everything. And I wonder what it was like to write in his time, right? Like, would he have time and space and a desk? And, you know, he had children. Although they say he was not the best of parents. He definitely had distractions around. And why can't I write? Have I trained myself to be unable to write? I also have my cameras in France. I mean, in Lebanon. I like to get them back. And yeah, writing. Writing. Writing long hand. I wonder what would happen if I tried to write my story. Oh, there's Wallis. Maybe I should go to Wallis now and then move on. I wonder what would happen if I tried to write long hand that. Let's see if it's open. That story. Oh, and I told them that I attended since I should. And if there's anybody else I promised to connect with, I should probably send a reach out to Fetzer and also to Fetzer and the Wayfair. Very interesting, right? Yeah. Let's sit here. Have a coffee and be quiet for the same day. Where do you get some coffee for home? Bonjour. Is that you? Low coffee shop? Yeah. [ [",

      "content": "### Blog Post: A Day in the Life - Reflections, Errands, and Aspirations\n\nHello there, readers! Today, I'm taking you along on a rather ordinary day, peppered with my thoughts, errands, and a bit of daydreaming. It's going to be a bit of a ramble, but that's just how some days go, right?\n\nSo, I'm starting my day with a plan to head to the day by day store. I've got my eyes on a specific jar because, you know, I have this perfect lid at home just waiting for its other half. Oh, and I picked up vinegar yesterday, so that's ticked off the list. Another thing on my agenda is to find a patch for my jacket. It’s one of those small but important things.\n\nI'm also craving some quiet time, just me and a cup of coffee. I'm thinking of sitting in a café for like 15 minutes, doing absolutely nothing – no talking, no thinking, just being. Speaking of being, I'm yearning to get back to my meditation practice. Twenty minutes in the morning and evening sounds just about right.\n\nFamily thoughts are never far from my mind. I miss my baby dearly. There’s this urge to just hold him, even though he’s been a bit squirmy lately. That's parenthood for you, right? Also, I've been feeling kind of alone here in France. I guess I need more in-person connections, not just phone calls.\n\nNow, about managing my time – I’ve decided to start using my calendar more effectively. My goal is not to be ruled by time but to flow with it, setting up flexible blocks for different activities. Speaking of which, I need to follow up on a family meeting and touch base with a few people, like the person from Kup and Sylvanna, who just had a baby.\n\nThe natural beauty around here is just breathtaking. There's something about the sunlight, the snow, and the scarce city light that's just enchanting. Speaking of commitments, I’m looking forward to getting my salary next month. Got a few things to pay for – the gym, co-working space, and maybe that air table.\n\nOn the professional front, I’ve been toying with the idea of returning to English teaching. It’s a great way to meet people. And why not offer free business consulting? Sounds like a promising venture, doesn’t it?\n\nAmidst these thoughts, I can’t help but get distracted. Oh, the hardware store! I need to get another pen loop for my notebook; gave the last one to my dad. And why not just enjoy the day, right? Maybe do something social, call my sister, grab some snacks.\n\nAh, my mycology hobby! I've been thinking about preserving different species. I need to get some backup, like antimicrobial agar. This hobby, the foraging, it's such an enriching experience.\n\nNow, let’s talk about startup mode. I feel like I thrive in the early stages of startups. And if things work out with my dad, maybe I could invest in something new. Oh, and it’s almost time to return to the store; they should be opening soon. No jars? That's okay, I’ll check back later.\n\nAs I walk and talk to myself, I ponder on various things. Like, should I be reading more poetry? And what about reconnecting with people from my past, like Doug Song back in Michigan? It’s important to maintain these connections.\n\nOn a more reflective note, I’ve been grappling with fears and uncertainties. How do I stay true to myself in a world where opinions can be so polarizing? And then there are these broader societal issues, like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. How do we engage in meaningful conversations there?\n\nAmidst all this, I’ve been thinking about how water is crucial for everything – from preserving the earth to supporting urban farming projects. It’s fascinating how interconnected everything is.\n\nI’m also exploring the idea of using AI, like ChatGPT, for personal development and journaling. It could be a game-changer in how we reflect and grow.\n\nAs for my personal life, I'm wrestling with some deep thoughts about identity, beliefs, and my role in the world. Am I making the right choices? Am I being true to myself?\n\nIn conclusion, it’s been a day full of thoughts, plans, and a bit of existential questioning. But that’s life, isn’t it? A beautiful, chaotic, and ever-evolving journey. Thanks for coming along on this rambly ride with me. Until next time, keep exploring, questioning, and enjoying the little moments. Cheers!",

      "content": "### Blog Post: A Stream of Consciousness - Musings and Meanderings of a Day\n\nHey everyone,\n\nJust walking and talking to myself here, sharing the wanderings of my mind and the errands of my day. It's a bit of a ramble, but hey, that's how my thoughts unspool.\n\nSo, I'm on my way to the day by day store, aiming to snag one of those jars. Got a perfect lid at home just waiting for it. Picked up vinegar yesterday, so that's sorted. My jacket needs a new patch, gotta remember that. And, oh, a coffee shop visit! I want to just sit there for 15 minutes, doing nothing – no talking, no thinking. Just being. That's my practice for the day.\n\nMeditation's on my mind too. I'm thinking 20 minutes in the morning, 20 in the evening. Would be great to get that going again. Missing my baby a lot right now. Need to find a way to connect with him. Ya Allah, Ya Kareem. Maybe I should talk to God more, not just myself. \n\nI'm alone here in France. I connect with people, but it's all over the phone. Need some in-person connections. I'm thinking of using my calendar more, not to be dominated by time, but to manage it better. There are things I need to do, like follow-up meetings and reaching out to some folks.\n\nNature here is something else. The sunlight, the snow, it's beautiful. And soon I'll have a salary, got to budget for the gym, co-working space, and other stuff. English teaching is an idea I'm flirting with. Could be a good way to meet people. Maybe even throw in some free business consulting.\n\nNow, where was I? Ah, the hardware store. Need a pen loop for my notebook, gave mine to Dad. And then there's Amazon for the jacket patch. Got to stay social, maybe call my sister, get some snacks.\n\nMy mycology hobby! Can't forget about that. Need to get antimicrobial agar to keep those species safe. It's a beautiful hobby, really. Being out in nature, exploring, foraging.\n\nThinking about startups, maybe investing. If things go well with Dad, might dive into something new. Oh, and I need to go back to the store, hope they have those jars now. No jars? Okay, no big deal.\n\nAs I keep walking, my mind wanders. Should I read more poetry? What about reconnecting with old friends? And then there's the whole fear and uncertainty thing. Staying true to myself in a world full of differing opinions.\n\nWater. It's been on my mind a lot. It's so essential, for everything from the earth to urban farming. And then there's the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. How do we even begin to have a real conversation there?\n\nBeen thinking about using ChatGPT for something. Maybe personal development? Could be interesting. And then there's the question of identity, beliefs. Am I making the right choices? Staying true to who I am?\n\nSo yeah, that's my day. A bit of everything – thoughts, plans, and a whole lot of pondering. Thanks for joining me on this stream of consciousness. Until next time, keep musing and keep moving.\n\nCatch ya later!",
