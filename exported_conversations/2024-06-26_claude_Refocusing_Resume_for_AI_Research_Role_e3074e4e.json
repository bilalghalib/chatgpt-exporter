We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.\n\nAbout the role:\nAnthropic’s AI technology is amongst the most capable and safe in the world. However, large language models are a new type of intelligence, and the art of instructing and evaluating them in a way that delivers the best results is still in its infancy — it’s a hybrid between research, engineering, and behavioral science. We’re bringing rigor to this new discipline by applying a range of techniques to systematically discover and document prompting best practices, using our models to improve training and evaluation, developing prompt self-improvement techniques to automatically optimize the model’s performance on any given task, , and finding ways of making it easy for our customers to do the same.\n\nGiven that this is a nascent field, we ask that you share with us a specific prompting, model evaluation, synthetic data generation, model finetuning, or application built on LLMs that you're proud of in your application! Ideally this project should show off a complex and clever prompting architecture, or a systematic evaluation of an LLM's behavior in response to different prompts, or an example of using LLMs for a relevant ML task such as careful dataset curation and processing. There is no preferred task; we just want to see how you create and experiment with prompts. You can also include a short description of the process you used or any roadblocks you hit and how to deal with them, but this is not a requirement.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nDevelop automated prompting techniques for our models (eg extensions to the Metaprompter)\nFinetune new capabilities into Claude that maximize Claude’s performance or ease of use given particular prompting innovations\nLead automated evaluation of Claude models and prompts across the training and product lifecycle\nHelp create and optimize data mixes for model training\nDevelop and systematically test new, creative, and original prompting strategies for a wide range of research tasks relevant to our fine-tuning and end product efforts.\nHelp to create and maintain the infrastructure required for efficient prompt iteration and testing.\nDevelop future Anthropic products built on top of Claude.\nStay up-to-date with the latest research in prompting and model orchestration, and share knowledge with the team.\nYou may be a good fit if you:\n\nHave significant ML research or software engineering experience\nHave at least a high level familiarity with the architecture and operation of large language models.\nHave extensive prior experience exploring and testing language model behavior.\nHave spent time prompting and/or building products with language models\nHave good communication skills and an interest in working with other researchers on difficult prompting tasks.\nHave a passion for making powerful technology safe and societally beneficial.\nStay up-to-date and informed by taking an active interest in emerging research and industry trends.\nEnjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)\nStrong candidates may also have:\nAdvanced degree in computer science, mathematics, statistics, physics, or a related technical field, or an advanced degree in a relevant non-technical field alongside evidence of programming experience.\nExperience with large-scale model training and evaluation.\nLanguage modeling with transformers\nReinforcement learning\nLarge-scale ETL\nRepresentative projects:\n\nBuilding the prompting and model orchestration for a production application backed by a language model\nFinetuning Claude to maximize its performance when a particular prompting technique is used.\nBuilding and testing an automatic prompt optimizer or automatic LLM-driven evaluation system for judging a prompt’s performance on a task.\nImplementing a novel retrieval, tool use, sub-agent, or memory architecture for language models.\nBuilding a scaled model evaluation framework driven by model-based evaluation techniques.\nDeadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. \n\nThe expected salary range for this position is:\n\nAnnual Salary:\n$315,000—$510,000 USD\nLogistics\nLocation-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.\n\nUS visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n\nWe encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.\n\nCompensation and Benefits*\n\nAnthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.",

Let's think through the pros and cons of including TextRay on your resume:\n\n<antThinking>We need to consider the relevance of TextRay to the Anthropic position, its current state of development, and how it demonstrates the candidate's skills and initiative. This decision will impact how we present the resume, potentially adding or removing a significant project.</antThinking>\n\nPros of including TextRay:\n\n1. Relevance: It directly demonstrates your hands-on experience with large language models, which is highly relevant to the Anthropic position.\n\n2. Initiative: It shows your proactivity and passion for AI, as you're working on this project independently.\n\n3. Current skills: It reflects your most recent work and skills, particularly in areas like LLMs and web development.\n\n4. Talking point: It could serve as an excellent discussion topic in an interview, allowing you to showcase your thought process and technical skills.\n\n5. Problem-solving: It demonstrates your ability to identify a need and create a solution using AI technologies.\n\nCons of including TextRay:\n\n1. Early stage: As it's newly launched with only a few users, it might be perceived as not fully developed or tested.\n\n2. Side project status: It might be seen as less significant than your full-time professional experiences.\n\n3. Limited space: Including it might take space away from other, potentially more established projects or experiences.\n\nConsidering the nature of the position at Anthropic and the relevance of TextRay to their work, I believe the pros outweigh the cons in this case. Here's why:\n\n1. The Research Engineer, Metaprompting position likely values hands-on experience with LLMs more than the scale or user base of a project.\n\n2. TextRay demonstrates your current skills and interests, which are closely aligned with the job requirements.\n\n3. It shows your initiative and ability to apply AI technologies to solve real-world problems, which is valuable for a research-oriented role.\n\n4. The project's early stage could be framed positively as an ongoing learning experience and a demonstration of your latest skills.\n\nGiven these considerations, I recommend including TextRay on your resume, but presenting it carefully.
