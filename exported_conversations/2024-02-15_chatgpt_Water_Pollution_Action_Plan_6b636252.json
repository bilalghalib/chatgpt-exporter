Abd Al Satar), dawood.sachit@uomustansiriyah.edu.iq (D.E. Sachit)\nReceived 17 January 2021; Accepted 11 May 2021\nabstract\nTigris River is one of the main sources of water in Iraq; therefore, it is important to assess the quality of its water and determine the pollutants that may affect its quality. Several sources of con- tamination that impact the water quality of the Tigris River are located in Baghdad. The hospital of Baghdad Medical City is considered an important source of pollution to the Tigris River. This study examined the change of the heavy metals concentrations of Tigris River water as a result of the discharge of the hospital wastewater of Baghdad Medical City to the river. The water quality index was used to assess and evaluate the type of water quality. The period of the study started in January 2020 and ended in October 2020. In this study, three points to collect the water samples from the river were selected. The first point was 700 m before the Medical City complex. The second one was at the discharge point of the wastewater of the Medical City into the river. The third point was located at 400 m after the discharge point. Water samples were collected from these sites at a depth of approximately 10–30 cm below the water surface. Several variables such as Pb, Cd, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni, Ag were used to determine the quality of the water. Results indicated that the concentration of the selected heavy metals of site 3 was much higher than that of site 1. For exam- ple, the concentration of Pb in January at site 1 was 0.0125 mg/L compared to that of site 2 which was 0.3213 mg/L. In addition, the concentrations of the constituents of site 3 were lower than that of site 2. For instance, the concentration of Pb of site 3 (0.0781 mg/L) was lower than that of site 2 (0.3213 mg/L) but still higher than that of site 1 (0.0125 mg/L). The lower concentration of site 3 indicates the presence of dilution by the river water body; however, it is not a solution since there are multiple sources of pollutants to the river. Moreover, the results showed that the concentration of most of the selected heavy metals of site 1 was either not deducted or very low compared to sites 2 and 3 which indicated the significant amount of pollution discharged to the river by the hospital wastewater. Overall, most of the findings highlighted that the concentration of the heavy metals exceeded the river maintenance system permissible of the Iraqi standard and the World Health Organization (WHO).\nKeywords: Tigris River; Medical City; Wastewater; Heavy metals; Water quality index\n* Corresponding author.\n1944-3994/1944-3986 © 2021 Desalination Publications.

Tigris River within Baghdad city is of particular\nimportance in the study of surface water quality because; industrial and municipal wastes,\nagricultural and runoff from developing areas were mixing with river flow and\nsurrounding water body thereby deteriorating the quality. The aim of the study was to\nassess the WQI on the basis of Weighted Arithmetic Index in order to evaluate the water\nquality of the Tigris River for drinking purposes from three stations within Baghdad city\nduring 2013. The WQI was calculated based on the concentration of eleven parameters\n(pH, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), Total Hardness, Calcium, Magnesium, Chloride,\nTurbidity, Nitrite (NO2), Nitrate (NO3), sulphate (SO4) and Zinc). The calculation of WQI\nshowed that the water quality of Tigris river can be rated as very poor and unsuitable\nconditions at winter and summer, respectively, in the 1st site which is situated at the north\nof the study area while the water quality of the 2nd site can be categories as unsuitable\nconditions at all season of study and for 3rd site can be rated as poor and very poor\nconditions at winter and summer season, respectively. Therefore, there is need a regular\nmonitoring of water quality in order to detect the changes in physio-chemical parameter\nconcentrations.\nKeywords: Weighted Arithmetic Index, WQI, Drinking water, Tigris River, and\nsulphate.\nتأثير تصاريف مذينة الطب ومحطة كهرباء الرشيذ في قيم دليل نىعية مياه نهر دجلة عنذ\nمذينة بغذاد\nالخلاصة\n:\nاُ ذذٕ٘س\nّ٘ػٍح\nاىٍَآ\nفً\nاىٍَآ\nاىسطحٍح\nٕ٘\nّرٍجح ذأشٍش\nالأّشطح\nاىثششٌح\nاىْاذجح ٍِ ػَيٍاخ اىرصٍْغ\nاىسشٌؼح. اُ ّٖشدجيح\nداخو\nٍذٌْح\nتغذاد\nىٔ\nإٍَٔح\nخاصح\nفً\nدساسح\nّ٘ػٍح\nاىٍَآ\nاىسطحٍح\nتسثة\nاىْفاٌاخ\nاىصْاػٍح\nَْضىٍ ٗاى\nح\nٗ\nح ٍ اىضساػ\nٗا\nػادج\nاىرصشٌف\nٍِ\nاىَْاطق\nاىْاٍٍح\nٗاىرً ذخيط\nٍغ\nذذفق\nاىْٖش\nٗذحٍط\nتٔ\nٗتاىراىً\nذذٕ٘س ٌؤدي رىل اىى\nّ٘ػٍ\nح\nاىٍَآ\n. ٗماُ\nاىٖذف\nٍِ\nٕزٓ\nاىذساسح\nٕ٘\nذقٌٍٍ\nWQI\nتأسرخذاً دىٍو\n2nd Conference on Environment and Sustainable Development 28-29-Oct-2015\nEng. &Tech.

It has become an important issue for them as it affects not only human\nuses, but also plant and animal life. Potable safe water is absolutely essential for healthy\nliving. It is a basic need of all human beings to get the sufficient supply of safe and fresh\ndrinking water [2]. Rivers in urban areas play a main role in carrying of industrial and\nmunicipal wastewater, manure discharges and run-off from agricultural fields and streets,\nwhich are responsible for river pollution [3,4]. Nowadays, surface water quality became\na critical issue in many countries; therefore, water quality monitoring is necessary for the\nprotection of freshwater resources [5]. Water quality is usually used to describe the\ncondition of the water, including its chemical, physical and biological characteristics,\nwith respect to its suitability for a particular purpose (i.e., drinking, fishing or irrigation)\n[6,7]. Water quality Index (WQI) is a dimensionless number that combines multiple\nwater-quality factors into a single number and simple terms (e.g., excellent, good, bad,\netc.) for reporting to managers and the public in a consistent manner [8]. Factors to be\nincluded in WQI model could vary depending on the designated water uses and local\npreferences. Water quality indices (WQIs) have been developed to combine water quality\nvariables [9- 11]. There are four stages in the development of WQI: 1st\n-parameter\nselection 2nd\n- the transformation of parameters to the same scale 3rd\n- the development\nof parametric weightings, and 4th\n- the selection of an appropriate aggregation function\n[12,13]. Numerous studies of water quality index for the Tigris River have been\nrecommended by many researchers under different condition [14-17]. However, this\nresearch was conducted to evaluate the water quality of the Tigris River for Iraqi standard\nguideline for drinking water by using the Weighted Arithmetic Index method [9].\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Area\nBaghdad is the capital of Iraq at latitude 33° 18′ 0″ North, longitude 44° 24′ 0″\nEast. Tigris River is the main source of drinking water in Baghdad. It stretches of\nthe Tigris River extends from Al-Tajee in the north of Al-Zafaraniah in the south\nw\nEng. &Tech.

The River divides the city into a right\n(Karkh) and left (Risafa) sections with a flow direction from north to south. The area\nis characterized by arid to semi-arid climate with dry, hot summers and cold winters;\nthe mean annual rainfall is about 151.8 mm [18].\nIn order to determine the water quality index, three sites were chosen for sample\ncollection in the study area along the Tigris River from January to June 2013 (Figure\n1). As it is described in Table (1), the 1st sample station (S1) was located north of\nBaghdad, the 2nd station (S2) at the middle part of the city and the 3rd station (S3)\nwas located at the south part.\nTable (1).

Water Quality Index was calculated based on\nthe concentration of eleven water quality parameters: pH value, Total Dissolved Solid,\nTotal Hardness, Calcium, Magnesium, Chloride, Turbidity, Nitrite, Nitrate, sulphate, and\nZinc\nCalculations Water Quality Index (WQI)\nWater Quality Index (WQI) is a very useful and efficient method, can provide a simple\nindicator of water quality and it’s based on some very important parameters. In this study,\nWater Quality Index (WQI) was calculated by using the Weighted Arithmetic Index\nmethod as described by [9]. In this model, different water quality components are\nmultiplied by a weighting factor and are then aggregated using simple arithmetic mean.\nIn assessing the quality of water in this study, firstly, the quality rating scale (Qi) for\neach parameter was calculated by using the following equation:\n(1)\nWhere,\nQi = Quality rating of ith parameter for a total of n water quality parameters.\nVactual = Actual value of the water quality parameter obtained from laboratory analysis.\nVideal = Ideal value of that water quality parameter can be obtained from the standard\nTables.\nVideal for pH = 7 and for other parameters, it is equal to zero, but for DO Videal = 14.6 mg/l\nVstandard = Recommended Iraqi standard guidelines of the drinking water [20].\nThis equation ensures that Qi = 0 when a pollutant is totally absent in the water sample\nand Qi = 100 when the value of this parameter is just equal to its permissible value. Thus\nthe higher the value of Qi is, the more polluted is the water.\nSecondly, after calculating the quality rating scale (Qi), the Relative (unit) weight (Wi)\nwas calculated by a value inversely proportional to the recommended standard (Si) for\nthe corresponding parameter using the following expression:\n(2)\nWhere,\nWi = Relative (unit) weight for nth parameter.\nK = Proportionality constant, K=1/∑ (1/Si).\nThat means, the Relative (unit) weight (WI) to various water Quality parameters are\ninversely proportional to the recommended standards for the corresponding parameters.\nFinally, the overall WQI was calculated by aggregating the quality rating with the unit\nweight linearly by using the following equation:\nEng. &Tech. Journal, Vol. 34, Part (A), No. 4, 2016 Impact of Medical City and Al-Rasheed Power\nPlant Effluents on the Water Quality Index\nValue of Tigris River at Baghdad City\n719\n(3)\nWhere,\nQi = Quality rating, Wi = Relative weight.\nIn this study, the water quality index was applied and tested for all the sites on the\nTigris River using of Iraqi standard guidelines for drinking water [20]. The standards\n(permissible values of various pollutants) for the drinking water and unit weights are\ngiven in Table 2.\nTable (2). The Iraqi standard guidelines for drinking water [20] and Unit Weights\nResults and Discussion\nIn general, WQI is defined for a specific and intended use of water. In this study the\nWQI was considered for human consumption or uses and the maximum permissible WQI\nfor the drinking water was taken as 100 scores.

Dissolved Solids in natural\nwater are generally consistent from bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sodium\nand sulfate [23]. The TDS in the Tigris river water in this study varies from 6 to 641\nmg/L. However, the results denoted that the mean concentrations of dissolved solid\nwithin permissible levels recommended by Iraqi standard guideline value for drinking\nwater [20].\nTotal Hardness concentration varies from 310 to 950 mg/l, However, the results\nshowed that the mean concentrations of total hardness within permissible levels in all\nstudy area except 1st and 2nd sites at winter season, which exceed the permissible level\n(500 mg/L) recommended by Iraqi standard guideline value for drinking water [20]. The\nobserved mean values of Calcium (Ca2+) concentrations were found well above all the\ntime in all sites, where the values range from (76.15 to 228.45 mg/l). While the observed\nEng. &Tech.

Chloride concentration varies from 24.99 to 274.90 mg/l, and the mean\nconcentrations of Cl- ion was within the recommended values for Iraqi standard\nguidelines all the time.\nTurbidity concentration varies from 6.64 to 37.2 mg/l, and the mean concentrations\nexceeded the recommended values for Iraqi standard guidelines for drinking water (5\nNTU) [20] all the time in all sites.\nNitrite and Nitrate are naturally occurring ions in water system that are part of the\nnitrogen cycle. Nitrate is the stable form of combined nitrogen for oxygenated systems,\nand can be reduced by microbial action. Nitrite ion contains nitrogen in a relatively\nunstable oxidation state; many processes can reduce nitrite to ammonia or oxidize it to\nnitrate [24]. NO2 concentrations vary from 0.0 to 0.487 mg/l and NO3 concentration\nvaries from 0.0 to 21.7 mg/l. The result showed that the mean value of NO2 and NO3\nconcentrations within the recommended values for Iraqi standard guidelines all the time.\nWhile the mean values of Sulfate (SO4) concentrations were found to exceed the\nrecommended values (250 mg/l) for Iraqi standard guidelines all the time, where values\nranged from 142 to 2000 mg/l.\nFor the mean values of Zn concentration was within the permissible level (3 mg/l)\nrecommended by Iraqi standard guidelines for drinking water [20] all the time, where\nvalue ranged between (ND- 0.368 mg/l). The degree of a linear correlation between the\nwater quality parameters, as measured by the correlation coefficient (R), is presented in\nTable 5. pH display positive correlation with Ca (0.738) and total hardness display strong\ncorrelation coefficient with both Ca and Mg (0.962 and 0.953, respectively) which\ndenotes a strong correlation at the 0.01 significance level, indicates that its occurrence in\nthe surface water was mainly due to natural or anthropogenic sources. Calcium and\nChloride are also strongly correlated with Magnesium (0.833) and Sulfate (0.80),\nrespectively. While Nitrite exhibited positive correlations with Zinc (0.755), suggesting it\noriginated from some common sources.\nTable (5).

      "content": "### Local Impact of Medical City's Wastewater Discharge on the Tigris River\n\n#### Key Information\n- **Studies**: Conducted by Al Satar and Sachit, and Al-Obaidy et al.\n- **Focus**: Impact of hospital wastewater discharge from Medical City on the Tigris River.\n- **Sampling**: Three points along the river - upstream, at discharge, downstream.\n- **Findings**: Increased heavy metals concentration downstream; poor Water Quality Index (WQI) ratings.\n- **Risks**: Health risks due to heavy metals, poor water quality affecting local communities and ecosystems.\n\n#### Detailed Overview\nRecent studies have underscored the alarming impact of wastewater discharge from Baghdad's Medical City on the Tigris River, a crucial water source for Iraq. The research by Al Satar and Sachit from Al-Mustansiriyah University specifically investigated the change in heavy metals concentrations in the Tigris River due to this discharge. Sampling water at three strategic points - upstream, at the discharge point, and downstream - they found a marked increase in heavy metal concentrations, including Pb, Cd, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Ag, particularly at the downstream point. This is a clear indication of the pollution load being added to the river by the hospital's wastewater.\n\nAnother study by Al-Obaidy et al. focused on assessing the overall water quality of the Tigris River within Baghdad, taking into account the effluents from both the Medical City and Al-Rasheed Power Plant. The application of the Water Quality Index (WQI) based on various parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), and others, revealed that the water quality ranged from very poor to unsuitable in different seasons. This degradation in water quality not only poses significant health risks to the local population, reliant on the river for various needs, but also threatens the river's aquatic life and ecological balance.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe findings from these studies make it evident that the discharge of untreated wastewater from Medical City is contributing significantly to the pollution of the Tigris River. This situation demands immediate attention and action, not only to protect public health but also to preserve the ecological integrity of this vital waterway. The government's intervention in implementing effective wastewater treatment solutions is imperative to mitigate these risks and ensure the long-term sustainability of the Tigris River as a crucial resource for Iraq.",
