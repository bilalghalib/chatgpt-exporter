I hope you guys got a chance to talk and get to know each other a little bit better.\nNow, for the rest of the day, we are going to go into the first step of Design Thinking, User research.\n\n\nSESSION OBJECTIVES\nLearn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs.\n\nBuild a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology.\n\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nLearn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs:  We will show you why user research is so important and how it is essential for developing any product or service. \n\nBuild a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology: Next, we will talk about building a research plan.

This morning we talked about design thinking and we ran through a design sprint so you can experience the whole process in just about 1 hour! Can someone tell us what we have learned? What is Design thinking? Why is it one of the most important tools for entrepreneurs? What is it used for?\n\nSome possible answers:\nAllows for creative solutions to problems by defining needs as verbs!\nWe get to know our customers (who they are, where they are, how they behave, what they like/dislike, etc…) \nEmpathize with them\nSome people might mention a few (or all) of the steps\nCreate better products by ensuring that it is designed to meet their needs\n\nGo over the design thinking process briefly touching on points the entrepreneurs missed. Remind them that it is a continuous process that needs to be tested and re-evaluated again and again.\n\n\n4\nMINDSETS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nMindsets: Facilitate a discussion on what mindsets we should have going into the program. Write everyone's answer on the board and see where people are at. At the end, put these points up on the boards and say that in design thinking, there are a few additional mindsets that are really important to have. Point out if they have already said any of them. We operate from these mindsets:\nFocus on human values: Design thinking is human centered design. We look to understand the needs and emotions of people in order to design solutions for them. Empathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these\u000busers is fundamental to good design\nShow don’t tell: Wherever you can, show people what you are doing, don’t explain it to them. You learn more from listening and observing real reactions, than having people respond to your talking. This is essential when we get to prototyping. Communicate your vision in an impactful and meaningful way by creating experiences, using illustrative visuals, and telling good stories.\nEmbrace experimentation: Don’t be afraid to try things. It is ok to fail, in fact, it can be good! The more you experiment and allow yourself to consider different options, the more you will learn and you will get better. Prototyping is not simply a way to validate your idea; it is an integral part of your innovation process. We build to think and learn. \nBe mindful of the process: Know where you are in the design process, what methods to use in that stage, and what your goals are. It is a process for a reason, don’t skip a step, but don’t be afraid to go back if you need more research or to reframe the problem to find better solutions!\nBias towards action: Design thinking is very hands on and action oriented. There will not be a lot of time sitting and learning, we want you to experience everything by doing! Design thinking is a misnomer; it is more about doing that thinking. Bias toward doing and making over thinking and meeting.\nRadical collaboration: In order to get a diversity of ideas and solutions, you have to collaborate. In this room there are so many people with different backgrounds and experiences. Use each other to brainstorm and develop your businesses. Later on, you will even collaborate with your customers or anyone else who would interact with your product/service. Bring together innovators with varied backgrounds and viewpoints. Enable breakthrough insights and solutions to emerge from the diversity.\nCraft clarity: Things are going to get messy. That is normal, take care to reframe the problem to make it clear. Produce a coherent vision out of messy problems. Frame it in a way to inspire others and to fuel ideation.\n\n\n\nUSER RESEARCH\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nEmpathizing is the first step we will look at in the Design Thinking process. We will empathize with our users through user research. It is the phase where you learn about your customers behaviors, needs, pains, and gains. \nAsk: Why is the user research phase of Design Thinking so important?\nUser research helps us to understand how people go about performing tasks and achieving goals that are important to them. \nIt gives us context and perspective and puts us in a position to respond with useful, simplified, and productive design solutions. \nUser research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and motivations through methodical, investigative approaches. \nIt helps us identify unarticulated needs and to fill in any gaps in our knowledge about our users, context of use, challenges, and opportunities. \nIt also helps us to align our product and business strategy with the core needs and goals of our users.\nInsights are then used to ensure that all product design decisions do benefit the user. \n\nWHO IS YOUR USER?\nGOALS\nNEEDS\nPAINS\nWANTS\nDESIRES\n20 minutes: Discussion\n\n5- 10 minutes: Guided discussion on user personas. Who is your user?\nI’m sure by now, you guys already have an idea of who your customers are. We are going to spend some time taking a look at who we think are our customers at this point. \nLet’s take an example from the room.  ___(name person in the room)____, can you tell me a little bit about one of your potential customers? Lets look at this as if they were a real person. Tell me the person’s name, where they are from, and what do they love to do.\nGuide the person to fill out all of the components of a user persona (shown on the next slide). Make sure you are writing what they say on the board in a way that will draw out the user persona as depicted in the next slides. \nContent could include:\nGeographic: Location, city, reach, country, international vs local\nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, ethnic background\nBehavioral: Patterns, usage rates, \nPsychographic: Social class, lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes, \nGoals:  What is this person trying to accomplish? \nCustomer pains: What challenges does this person face? What are the big and small problems they have and how does it affect their lives?\nTell this person’s story: Tell a short story about this person trying to accomplish their goal (related to your business). What challenges do they face on their journey? \nIn market segmentation, you can be general. It is a good way to summarize large groups of your customers. However, in this case with personas, we want to make it as real as possible so we will use very specific information.\n*** If you do not feel comfortable facilitating the discussion with a new business idea, learn what is on the example on the hidden slides and create a user persona around that (it is for a tourism business). Still make sure to engage the audience by asking them to talk about a potential customer for the tourism business you are creating.\n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nEveryone should now fill out a user persona for their business. We want you to be really specific. Find an example of a real person who might use your product/service. Describe them like they are real. Your customers will be real people with needs, values, and feelings. \nAsk 1-2 people to share their persona they have created.\nDebrief: You guys all did a great job here. Actually, what you just did was create a “fake” user persona. I think a lot of these points might be accurate; however, we are assuming that these are accurate. This is just based on who we THINK is our user, and it is not really based on much data. Over the next few weeks, we are going to spend some time doing intensive user research and come up with accurate user personas by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data.\n\n\n\n\n\nPICTURE & NAME\n  DEMOGRAPHIC:\nShe is 22 years old, \nSingle, \nStudies international cultures, \nWorks as a waitress. \n  GEOGRAPHIC:\nChristie is living in a small apartment in New York\nHas a strong online presence and spends 3-4 hours on social media every day.\n  BEHAVIORAL:\nShe likes to try new things\nShe eats out at restaurants on a weekly basis\nShe uses her phone to research user reviews to help her decide what to do and buy\nTravels every summer with her family to the mountains\n  PSYCHOGRAPHIC:\nVegan & animal rights activist\nDoesn’t care about her looks, always dresses down  \nLoves adventure\n\nAlternative example (slides 7-8)\n\n5- 10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nGuided discussion on user personas.

She is 22 years old, single, studies international cultures, and works as a waitress. She dreams of a future where she can combine work and travel. She wants to work in work in a company where she can travel and make a difference in the world. She’s not sure about having kids and a husband. At least it’s not on her radar just yet.\n\nTravel internationally in a sustainable way\nSee the world\nHelp others\nSave money\n\n\nTraveling is too expensive\nShe doesn’t know where to look for sustainable tourism options\nIt is really hard for her to keep track of prices, hotel options, and day trips she is reviewing\n\n\n9\nBREAK\n\nYOUR RESEARCH:\nDO\nLOOK\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nYour research plan: Welcome back from your break. I hope you are feeling re-energized! So, as we said before, we all have an idea of who our customers are and what they want, but really, these are just assumptions. We might be right on some things, but we probably don’t have the whole picture. That’s why it is so important to create a research plan. To help us fill these gaps and give us more insights on what our customers need!\n\nHow will we do this? Through three research methodologies: Do, Look, and Listen.\n\nDo is all about experiential learning. Putting yourself in the shoes of your customers.\n\nLook is learning through observation. Trying to see the behaviors of your customers to pinpoint needs and opportunities.\n\nListen is where we talk to our customers through user interviews. Here we hear from them and try to get to the root of their problems and really understand their behaviors and emotions.\n\nDO\nhttps://www.cleancookingalliance.org/binary-data/RESOURCE/file/000/000/407-1.pdf\n20 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nDO is all about experiencing what your customers experience. In order to understand the pains of your customers, you have to go through the process yourself. For the DO, tell the story of one of IDEO's engineers:\nIDEO is one of the leading companies in product development focusing on design thinking methodology. IDEO was working on creating a new design for a stove in a third world country.  They wanted to design a solution for women to make cooking easier for them. So what did they do? They went to the country and used the stove. They experienced how people cooked every day and got to feel how those women felt using that stove. The lesson in this story is that even if you are an expert, you have to go through the same experience of your users to feel their challenges!\n\n15 minutes: Activity - Immerse (DO)\nHave participants partner up\nGive each pair a task: \nGo into the bathroom and wash your hands, \nWalk around the space, get a book, and put it on the table in the kitchen, \nMake a cup of tea\nDo a lap around the space\nGet a piece of paper and write directions to the bathroom\nYou can do anything, be creative!\n\nOne participant will close their eyes and try to complete the task, while their partner guides them and makes sure they don’t run into things or hurt themselves\nThen switch so that both people go through the process\n\nDEBRIEF: How was that experience? What did it make you learn? How do you think it would be to be blind in a space like this? \nNow think, if you were to design a product for someone who was blind, what are some things you would include? Think about what helped you accomplish the task. Was it useful to hold onto things? Were sounds helpful? Did you like it when someone was in front of you? What were things that frustrated you while you were “blind“, how could that be fixed?\nLESSON: It is important to walk in your customers shoes, especially if you are developing a product for them. To see life from their perspective will allow you to truly understand them and their needs\n\n\nWhat are they doing? \nHow are they doing it?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?\nLOOK\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nAnother form of research is observation. You can learn so much by just observing people in their natural routine. While you are watching, take note of a few things:\nWhat are they doing? What are their actual behaviors? List them step by step. Be detail oriented.\nHow are they doing it? Are they doing something a little odd that needs further explanation? Is it easy for them? Difficult?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?  What are they trying to accomplish? What is the end goal? \n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nObserve (LOOK): What is this a picture of? What do you see?\nSpend 5-10 minutes getting thoughts from people. Take the time to build up a story about this person.\nWrite everyone's thoughts on the board\nRemember to touch on the previous slides questions (what, how, why)\nWhat do you see versus what do you think based on what you see?\n\nLESSON: You can learn so much from just looking, taking a step back and trying to figure out what you’re seeing, what you can learn from watching. Keep in mind that you can only learn some things. You can see their actual behaviors. You can observe body language and make assumptions about WHY they are doing it that way. If you can, get some clarification and speak to the person to understand why they did it in that way. \n\nAsk for stories\nTalk about emotions\nAsk why?\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe last research method we are going to cover is the User Interview. In a user interview, you spend 2-30 minutes to speak with customers to hear from them about their experiences. If you take the time to speak to customers, they will tell you everything you would ever need to know about how to make a great product for them. They will tell you what they like and don’t like, the challenges they have with existing solutions and even more! You just have to listen! \n\n\n\n“Tell me about the last time you…”\n“What was the best/ worse...”\n“Why is that?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\nLISTEN\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBe careful how you phrase questions. It is important that you don’t lead your customers into saying what you want to hear. By doing this, your interview data will be useless. To give you some example of bad interview questions:\nDo you like my idea? People tend to be nice, chances are nobody would want you to feel bad and tell you that you have a bad idea. By asking this, you invite people to say “yes, I like your idea” even though it might not be true. \nWould you buy this product? This is another question that is tricky and usually provides you with false information. Again many people would be tempted to say “yes” or “probably” to this question. The best way to test if people are willing to buy a product is to see if they actually take out their wallet and try. \nDo you have trouble with _____? By posing challenges for them, you are putting words in their mouth. Maybe they do have trouble with that, but you want to hear it from them. Maybe they are facing the challenge differently than you are. Allow them to share their thoughts on their own. Don’t tell or suggest to people how they feel or behave. \nCan you tell me how you normally …..  This question is ALMOST good; however, it is too general. You don’t get any real information. If you ask for generalities (‘what is your normal evening like?’) then you’ll get a false picture, it will be their ‘idealized’ evening. You need to ask a question that allows people to give you a specific story that has real emotions.\n\nSo what are good questions to ask? The questions ask for stories, evoke emotions, and go deeper into their actual behaviors. \n“Tell me about the last time you…”  By asking this question, you are able to get very specific information. They will have details about what they liked and didnt like, there might be a timeline, etc... You will get very rich information with this question. \n“What was the best/ worse...” By asking these questions, you are learning more about what the person likes and doesn’t. As you develop your product, it is important to know what your customers care about and what their problems are.\n“Why is that?” and “Can you tell me more?” These questions are great for going deeper. If your interviewee says something surprising or interesting, you should want to know more about it. Don’t assume anything, ask them about their thoughts. \nAsk why 5 times – keep asking why so that you get to the deeper meaning and emotion behind decisions. Humans make decisions based on emotion, it’s important for you to understand why your users/ customers make their decisions\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW\nIntroduce yourself\nIntroduce project\nBuild rapport\nEvoke stories\nExplore emotions\nQuestion statements\nThank you & wrap up\nTime\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + example\n\nExplain all the steps that go into an interview. Here are some tips on what to ask in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of a user interview:\n\nBeginning: In the beginning of the interview, you should ask opening questions to set people at ease and build rapport. You should not ask about sensitive topics. Instead, focus on setting the stage and bringing your interviewees on board so they’re comfortable enough to be, and remain, open with you. What you do at this stage can include the following:\nTelling participants what topics will be covered\nTelling participants how their data will be used\nAsking innocuous questions such as what their role is in their organization\nAsking concrete questions that are easy to answer\n\nMiddle: In the middle of the interview, you’re hitting high gear. Having established a direct channel with your interviewees (the users), you move on and ask the bulk of your questions, but maybe not in the order you had originally planned. Remember to:\nKeep the flow of the conversation as natural as possible, but cover the topics you want to cover.\nPick up on what participants have said earlier and get full replies to questions they have only partially answered.\nSteer participants back on track if they go too far off topic.\nShow that you have been listening.\nGo deeper where necessary\n\nEnd: At the end of the interview, you wrap up in a way that makes participants feel as though they have said what they wanted to say and that their answers are valuable. By this point, you will have managed to tie up any loose ends on matters that had not been clear before, and both you and they should be satisfied that the interview has brought all the issues out into the open. Things you should do include:\nAsking if there is anything participants would like to add.\nTelling your participants what you are going to do with their data and what the value is for them.\nThanking them for taking the time to help with your research. Above all, remember to conduct a pilot study before you start approaching real-life participants and tackling ‘organic’ interview settings. Also, always be sensitive to the fact that people are different and need different things!\n\n5 minutes: Example\nHave 2 trainers go through a User Interview. Show a good user interview and a bad one. \n\n\nEMPATHY MAP\n8 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nSo after your interview, you should reflect on and reorganize your information. We will do this through an empathy map. \nAfter you give the explanation of the empathy map, fill it in for the practice interview you just had in front of the group (with the trainers). Have it be a conversation and write out the answers as a group on the white board. As you discuss together, highlight some information about each quadrant (no need to explain each point in detail!)\n\nThe Says quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or some other usability study. Ideally, it contains verbatim and direct quotes from research.\n“I love Asiacell because I never have a bad experience.”\n“I want something reliable.”\n“I don’t understand what to do from here.”\nThe Thinks quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. Ask yourself (from the qualitative research gathered): what occupies the user’s thoughts? What matters to the user? Pay special attention to what users think, but may not be willing to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure, self-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?\n“This is really annoying.”\n“Am I dumb for not understanding this?”\nThe Does quadrant encloses the actions the user takes. From the research, what does the user physically do? How does the user go about doing it?\nRefreshes page several times.\nShops around to compare prices.\nThe Feels quadrant is the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What does the user get excited about? How does the user feel about the experience?\nImpatient: pages load too slowly\nConfused: too many contradictory prices\nWorried: they are doing something wrong\n\nYou might encounter inconsistencies — for example, seemingly positive actions but negative quotes or emotions coming from the same user.  This is when empathy maps become treasure maps that can uncover nuggets of understanding about our user. It is our job as UX professionals to investigate the cause of the conflict and resolve it.\n\nSome of these quadrants may seem ambiguous or overlapping — for example, it may be difficult to distinguish between Thinks and Feels. Do not focus too much on being precise: if an item may fit into multiple quadrants, just pick one. The 4 quadrants exist only to push our knowledge about users and to ensure we don’t leave out any important dimension. (If you don’t have anything to put into a certain quadrant, it’s a strong signal that you need more user research before proceeding in the design process.)\n\n**This is important to do together because we consistently have trouble with the entrepreneurs not understanding how to use the empathy map. \n\n\n\n\n\nPRACTICE\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nInterview Your Users (LISTEN)\n5 minutes: prepare questions\nCome up with 3-5 questions you want to learn from your customers about their lives/ about your product (5 minutes)\n10 minutes: 2 rounds of interviews (5 minutes each)\nEach person is matched with a partner\n5 minutes: Plot info on an empathy map\nAsk them to plot results on the empathy map right after the interview. This is a great way to re-think the interview and reflect.\n\n\n\n\nEXTREME USER\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users. Who are the people who use this product every day? \nFor example, if you are making a new cleat, you definitely want to talk to people who play sports (kids, parents who buy them, university students, etc…), but you would probably want to talk to people who LIVE in cleats too. Take professional athletes for example, they know every part of their shoes because they wear them for hours every day. They know about what they love and hate about them. \nLet’s take another example. If we were designing a new type of seat in a car, who would the extreme user be? --- allow them to answer. Taxi drivers live in their cars. All day long they are sitting in the seats and probably know really specific details of what makes them comfortable or not. They might even share ideas on how it could be better.\nWhile creating your user research plan, make sure to include extreme users!\nYou will want to include at least 1-2 extreme users into your research plan.\n\n------------------------------------\nNotes about Extreme Users to help facilitate discussion, no need to explain them all:\n\nWhen considering the user's needs in design, it’s very easy for a designer to fall into the trap of designing for the first, average user they can think of. \nOnly by understanding the viewpoints of a full range of people is it possible to avoid the pitfall of designing for yourself. \nThrough speaking to the extreme users and identifying their amplified needs, it can help pull out more meaningful insights and thus gives the potential to push ideas in different directions that you wouldn’t have previously explored. \nThis group of users can help spark creativity by introducing you to hacks and use cases you wouldn’t have imagined. \nIn the hope of trying to please the mainstream, which is still a very diverse group, it’s all too easy to end up designing something generic and easy to replicate.\nAn idea that suits an extreme user is more likely to please the mainstream users too. \nBy focusing on the extremes, you can find the highest priority issues. Most commonly, the high priority issue is what motivates people to buy this thing, and what is keeping them from buying this thing?\nExtreme user's are most in-tune with their needs, emotions and behaviors when using a product or service and can, therefore, articulate needs/challenges better. \n\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user.\nAsking the user to design for you.\nAsking the user to respond to your idea.\nUSER RESEARCH IS NOT:\n3 minutes: Remember!\n\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user. \nRemember you want to make sure they are talking, not you!\nDon’t assume things, allow them to share their own experiences\n\nAsking the user to design for you\nDon’t ask your interviewer what they think the solution is\nDon’t have them list features\nYOU are the designer! You need to gather information from people to create the solution that will best fit their needs. By asking others to design for you, you stunt your creativity and can come up with generic solutions.\n\nAsking the user to respond to your idea\nAvoid asking the user if they like your idea. Any person will just say “yes, I like it” or “yes, I will use/buy this”\nIn general, people are polite, so you shouldn’t trust what they say in that way. Make sure the questions are framed in a way where you are just focusing on the challenges they are facing and learning about how they are currently dealing with them.\nYou should NOT give an explanation of your idea in a user interview.\n\n\n\n\n3 places to immerse\n30 people to interview \n5 extreme users\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nSpend the rest of the session writing your user research questions and practicing with other people in the cohort  (we will also do this tomorrow morning)\nPractice your user research on at least 5 members of the cohort\nGive each other feedback on their interview style.

Introduction\nThis proposal outlines a strategy to integrate climate resilience practices into the existing Five One Labs Incubator Curriculum while maintaining its core entrepreneurial focus. The goal is not to create a \"green business\" program but rather to ensure that businesses emerging from the incubator are resilient, competitive, and prepared for the evolving economic and environmental landscape of Iraq and the Kurdistan Region (KRI), living in the reality of the fact of climate change. \nThis approach aligns with global best practices while remaining locally relevant. It leverages the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a framing tool to embed climate-aware business strategies without disrupting the curriculum’s structure.\n\n2. Approach: Building Climate-Resilient Entrepreneurs\nFraming Climate Resilience as Business Resilience\nInstead of presenting climate adaptation as an environmental initiative, we will position it as a necessary component of modern business strategy.\nThis may require an additional section in the curriculum supporting this realization and opening the connection between climate and successful business strategy. Entrepreneurs will learn to:\nAnticipate shifts in market demand, supply chains, and consumer preferences due to rising energy costs and environmental factors.\nDevelop business models that remain viable in an increasingly resource-constrained world.\nIdentify funding and investment opportunities linked to sustainability, such as impact investing and climate adaptation grants.\nKey Principles of Integration\nEmbedded, Not Added\nClimate resilience is not a standalone topic—it is integrated into market research, financial planning, business model design, and operations.\nReal-World Examples\nCase studies will highlight businesses in Iraq, KRI, and internationally that have successfully adapted to climate challenges.\nFlexibility & Feasibility\nEntrepreneurs will be introduced to staged adaptation strategies, allowing them to implement small, cost-effective changes now, with a roadmap for scaling up over time.\nRisk Management as a Core Business Skill\nBusinesses will learn how to monitor environmental and economic risks and adjust their models accordingly.\n\n3.

Curriculum vs. Green School Quality Standard: Greening Every Learning Environment\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen School Quality Standard Recommendations\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\nDevelop a Green School Action Plan\n(Clear steps, responsibilities, and monitoring for sustainability initiatives)\n- The proposal outlines a structured Implementation Timeline for integrating climate resilience into the incubator curriculum.\n- The Curriculum Integration Strategy identifies specific intervention points in the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal includes structured phases, but it lacks explicit monitoring and evaluation plans to track progress.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce a progress tracking mechanism (e.g., feedback loops, sustainability progress dashboard for businesses).\nMonitor and Evaluate Progress\n(SMART targets, periodic evaluations, and avoiding greenwashing)\n- The proposal includes rubric-based evaluations for assessing resilience in the curriculum.\n- Key Deliverables mention an assessment of 32 curriculum sessions for improvement.\n✅ Alignment with improvement potential – The proposal addresses evaluation, but it doesn’t mention specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or methods for tracking business adaptation over time.\n➡ Recommendation: Develop clear KPIs such as:\n- % of businesses implementing climate resilience strategies\n- Success rates in securing climate-linked investments\n- Reduction in operational costs through energy efficiency\nFoster Community Engagement\n(Sharing sustainability best practices with the broader community)\n- The proposal includes case studies showcasing climate-resilient businesses in Iraq and internationally.\n- Additional services include business resilience coaching and policy & regulatory reports.\n✅ Good Alignment – The proposal focuses on community learning through real-world case studies.\n➡ Recommendation: Encourage peer learning and networking among entrepreneurs through sustainability forums, mentorship programs, or incubator alumni engagement.\nImprove Facilities and Operations\n(Water conservation, waste management, and infrastructure improvements for climate resilience)\n- The proposal focuses on business operations (lean operations, energy efficiency, sustainable supply chains).\n✅ Alignment in a business context – While the proposal integrates climate-conscious business operations, it doesn’t explicitly address waste management or water conservation.\n➡ Recommendation: Include training modules on circular economy principles and green infrastructure for businesses.\nEnhance Teaching and Learning\n(Integrate sustainability across subjects, participatory learning, hands-on projects)\n- Climate resilience is embedded across business modules, not treated as an isolated topic.\n- Uses Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a practical tool for integration.\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum ensures climate resilience is a core business skill.\n➡ Enhancement: Incorporate experiential learning, such as business simulations, hands-on resilience-building exercises, and real-time problem-solving workshops.\nStrengthen Policy and Stakeholder Engagement\n(Stakeholder workshops, engagement with indigenous knowledge, advocacy training)\n- The proposal includes a Policy & Regulatory Landscape Report to guide entrepreneurs on compliance and future climate policies.\n✅ Good Alignment – Addresses policy adaptation but lacks a community advocacy component.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce policy roundtables or stakeholder dialogues for entrepreneurs to actively engage in policy discussions on climate resilience.\nAddress Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness\n(Emergency planning, climate risk reduction strategies)\n- The proposal integrates risk management as a business skill, helping businesses anticipate and mitigate climate risks.\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum tackles climate risks through business continuity planning.\n➡ Enhancement: Add disaster preparedness training (e.g., what to do in case of climate-induced supply chain disruptions or extreme weather events).\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 2:\nClimate Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. GreenComp: The European Sustainability Competence Framework\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenComp Competence Area\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\nEmbodying Sustainability Values (Understanding ecological limits, fairness, and justice in sustainability)\n- Focuses on financial risk, supply chain adaptation, and business continuity.\n- Sustainability is framed as a business strategy, but ethical and social justice aspects are not emphasized.\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal integrates sustainability but does not explicitly address fairness and social justice in business models.\n➡ Recommendation: Expand on ethical decision-making and incorporate regenerative business models that prioritize fair trade, equity, and community impact.\nEmbracing Complexity in Sustainability (Systems thinking and understanding interdependencies)\n- Uses the Business Model Canvas (BMC) to integrate climate risks.\n- Focuses on business resilience but lacks a holistic

      "content": "Here’s how you can subtly embed green/climate resilience content into the **User Research & Design Thinking** session while aligning with your broader strategy:  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Introduce a \"Green Lens\" in User Research**  \n- When discussing **User Personas**, include an **environmentally-conscious consumer segment** (e.g., someone who prioritizes sustainable products, uses minimal waste packaging, or prefers businesses that align with climate-conscious values).  \n- Example: When guiding participants to describe their customer’s **goals, pains, and behaviors**, subtly integrate sustainability-related questions:  \n  - *Does your customer consider environmental factors when making purchasing decisions?*  \n  - *What sustainability-related frustrations do they face in the market (e.g., too much plastic packaging, lack of access to green products, energy costs)?*  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Embed Sustainability in the \"Do, Look, Listen\" Research Framework**  \n- **DO:** When introducing experiential research, include an example where **entrepreneurs experience the environmental impact of their products**. Example:  \n  - If a team is working on a **food-related business**, encourage them to **track the waste their product generates** in a day (packaging, food scraps, delivery emissions).  \n  - If they are working on a **service-based business**, ask them to experience how **energy, water, or material use affects their operations**.  \n- **LOOK:** Encourage participants to **observe environmental inefficiencies** in their customer research. Example:  \n  - While observing customer behavior, note **if they bring reusable bags, avoid excessive plastic, or seek eco-friendly options**.  \n  - If studying a local market, observe if customers **ask about sustainable alternatives** or struggle to find them.  \n- **LISTEN:** Encourage open-ended questions in interviews about climate-conscious habits and constraints. Example questions:  \n  - *How important is sustainability to your purchasing decisions?*  \n  - *What makes it hard for you to buy sustainably?*  \n  - *Do rising energy/water/material costs affect your business or lifestyle?*  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Reframe Extreme Users to Include Green Advocates**  \n- When discussing **Extreme Users**, introduce the idea of an \"eco-conscious extreme user.\"  \n  - Example: If designing a **delivery service**, the extreme user might be someone who **only orders from zero-waste or carbon-neutral companies**.  \n  - If designing **packaging**, an extreme user could be a customer who **avoids single-use plastics entirely and prefers biodegradable options**.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Adjust the Design Thinking Mindsets Section**  \n- **Focus on Human Values:** Add a note that \"human-centered design\" includes **considering environmental impact on communities** (e.g., pollution, waste, resilience).  \n- **Show, Don’t Tell:** Encourage visual storytelling that highlights **waste, inefficiencies, or green innovations**.  \n- **Embrace Experimentation:** Highlight that many **sustainable innovations** come from rapid prototyping (e.g., material testing, alternative packaging).  \n- **Bias Towards Action:** Include a note that **quick experiments with low-impact materials and processes can lead to more sustainable design**.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Empathy Mapping: Add Environmental Impact**  \nWhen filling out **empathy maps**, subtly introduce sustainability-related categories:  \n- **What does the user SAY about sustainability?** (e.g., \"I wish there were more eco-friendly options.\")  \n- **What does the user THINK about sustainability?** (e.g., \"I hate that everything is wrapped in plastic.\")  \n- **What does the user DO to reduce their footprint?** (e.g., Uses reusable containers, bikes to work.)  \n- **What does the user FEEL about environmental issues?** (e.g., Frustrated by waste, worried about climate change.)  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Prototyping & Testing: Add a Sustainability Checkpoint**  \n- When teams **test and iterate their ideas**, introduce a simple \"Green Check\" step:  \n  - *Does this prototype use more materials than necessary?*  \n  - *Are there waste, energy, or transport inefficiencies that can be reduced?*  \n  - *How might this product/service be more climate-resilient?*  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Subtle Framing Throughout**  \n- Instead of making sustainability a **separate** module, **embed it naturally into the existing conversations** about user needs, innovation, and problem-solving.  \n- Position sustainability as a **competitive advantage**—customers increasingly demand green solutions, and resilient businesses **adapt to shifting environmental and economic realities**.  \n- Use **local market case studies** where green solutions have thrived or where environmental constraints shaped business opportunities.  \n\n---\n\nBy weaving these elements throughout the **User Research & Design Thinking** sections, you ensure climate resilience is **embedded** into the entrepreneurial mindset without making it feel like an \"extra\" topic. 🚀",

      "content": "To integrate **green/climate resilience** content into your slides with **minimal modifications**, you can use **subtle but effective tweaks** in key sections without altering the session’s structure. Here's how:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Small Edits to Session Objectives**\n**Current:**  \n- Learn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs.  \n- Build a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology.  \n- Understand how to organize your user research data to find trends.  \n\n**Modified (Minimal Change):**  \n- Learn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs **while considering resource constraints and sustainability.**  \n- Build a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology **with awareness of environmental and cost-saving factors.**  \n- Understand how to organize your user research data to find trends **that may include waste reduction, energy efficiency, and resilience.**  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Tweaks in the \"Who is Your User?\" Section**  \n#### **User Persona Exercise (Small Insertions)**\n- Under **Customer Pains**, add:  \n  - *What challenges does this person face related to cost, energy use, or sustainability?*  \n- Under **Goals**, add:  \n  - *Does this persona prefer sustainable or locally sourced products/services?*  \n- Under **Storytelling Exercise**, when guiding participants to create user personas, add a note:  \n  - *“Think about whether sustainability matters to them. Are they concerned about waste, eco-friendly options, or high energy costs?”*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Subtle Updates to \"Do, Look, Listen\"**\n**DO:**  \n- Add a bullet:  \n  - *What environmental constraints do customers face? (e.g., access to sustainable options, high energy costs, water scarcity?)*  \n\n**LOOK:**  \n- Add:  \n  - *Observe if customers make decisions based on sustainability (e.g., choosing reusable packaging, avoiding waste, preferring local products).*  \n\n**LISTEN:**  \n- Add to sample questions:  \n  - *\"What challenges do you face when trying to be more sustainable?\"*  \n  - *\"Have you noticed any shifts in customer demand for eco-friendly options?\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Add a Quick \"Green Lens\" in Mindsets Slide**\nAt the end of the **Mindsets Discussion**, add **one short line** to the “Bias Towards Action” or “Focus on Human Values” section:  \n- *\"Considering resource constraints and sustainability in early-stage design can lead to cost savings and innovation.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Small Additions in \"Extreme Users\" Slide**  \n- When defining **Extreme Users**, add:  \n  - *\"For example, if designing packaging, an extreme user might be someone who refuses single-use plastics or only buys zero-waste products.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Quick Sustainability Check in Prototyping & Testing**  \n- Add **one bullet** to the Testing slide:  \n  - *\"Before finalizing a prototype, consider: Could this be made with fewer resources, or in a more sustainable way?\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Minimal Edit to Wrap-Up/Next Steps Slide**\n- When discussing next steps, add:  \n  - *\"As you test your business idea, also notice if customers care about sustainability or if you can reduce waste or costs through eco-friendly design.\"*  \n\n---\n\n#### **Final Notes:**  \n✅ These edits **don’t change the structure** of the slides.  \n✅ They **subtly integrate** climate resilience without disrupting the core design-thinking content.  \n✅ They **align with your strategy** while keeping sustainability as a **business advantage, not a separate topic**.  \n\nWould you like me to **apply** these edits to a slide deck if you send over the file? 🚀",

      "content": "### **Does This Relate to the Business Efficiency Workbook?**\n**Yes, there is a clear connection!** The **Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)** is already focused on optimizing **resources, waste reduction, energy use, and business resilience**—which aligns well with **sustainability principles**. The **User Research & Design Thinking** session can easily complement and extend these themes.\n\n### **How Can We Modify the BEW and the Slides for Better Alignment?**\nInstead of **major changes**, we can introduce **small tweaks** that **sync the workbook with the user research phase** while reinforcing **efficiency and sustainability** without making it feel like an extra topic.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Aligning the BEW with User Research (Small Edits)**\n### **✅ Add a \"User Research & Efficiency Insights\" Section to the BEW**\n- Right now, the **BEW focuses on existing operations** but **doesn’t explicitly tie efficiency insights to early-stage user research**.\n- Solution: **Insert a short section in the BEW** on how **user research findings** can identify inefficiencies in customer behavior, supply chains, and product/service use.\n\n📌 **Example Addition to BEW (Efficiency Insights Section):**\n*\"Before improving operations, it is important to understand how customers interact with your business. Through user research, you can identify waste, inefficiencies, and potential cost-saving opportunities in customer behavior. Use the Do, Look, Listen method to track areas of inefficiency.\"*\n\n- **DO:** What inefficiencies do customers face? *(e.g., wasted time, unnecessary materials, high costs)*\n- **LOOK:** What patterns suggest resource overuse? *(e.g., unnecessary packaging, poor logistics, excessive steps)*\n- **LISTEN:** What do customers say about cost, waste, and quality? *(e.g., \"I always throw away extra packaging,\" \"This product uses too much energy\")*\n\n---\n\n## **2. Modifying the Design Thinking Slides (Minimal Tweaks)**\n### **✅ Adjust the User Research Section to Hint at Efficiency**\n📌 **Current Slide: User Research - Do, Look, Listen**  \n- **Minimal Edit:** Add **one line** under each method:  \n  - **DO:** What **inefficiencies, waste, or resource challenges** does your user experience?  \n  - **LOOK:** Are there **patterns in how users manage costs, materials, or energy?**  \n  - **LISTEN:** What do users say about **time, effort, or waste?**  \n\n📌 **Current Slide: User Persona Exercise**  \n- **Small Addition:** Under \"Customer Pains,\" add:  \n  - *Does this user face challenges related to cost, waste, or efficiency?*  \n- Under \"Goals,\" add:  \n  - *Does this user seek more sustainable, affordable, or efficient options?*  \n\n📌 **Current Slide: Extreme Users**  \n- **Modify Example:** Instead of just niche power users, include:  \n  - *\"An extreme user might be someone who only buys cost-effective or resource-efficient products, or someone who actively minimizes waste in their purchasing.\"*  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Aligning BEW and Slides with a Shared Worksheet**\n📌 **Solution:** Modify the existing **Prioritization Matrix in the BEW** to include a **User Research Insights Column**  \n- Currently, the **BEW uses a matrix to prioritize business improvements based on cost, efficiency, and ROI.**  \n- Add **one new column**:  \n  - **User Research Insight:** What customer feedback or behavior data supports this improvement?  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary: Small Changes for Maximum Impact**\n✅ **BEW Change:** Add a **\"User Research & Efficiency Insights\"** section to connect efficiency with early-stage customer research.  \n✅ **Slide Change:** Add **light-touch sustainability hints** into **User Research, Personas, and Extreme Users** without making them feel separate.  \n✅ **Shared Tool:** Modify the **Prioritization Matrix in BEW** to **connect user insights with business efficiency actions.**  \n\nThese **minimal tweaks** ensure the **BEW and User Research session naturally reinforce each other**, making it easier for entrepreneurs to **link sustainability, efficiency, and business resilience**—without extra work or separate lessons. 🚀",

      "content": "You're absolutely right—the **Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)** is about **assessing and improving current operations**, whereas **User Research & Design Thinking** is early-stage and focused on **developing ideas, not optimizing existing businesses**. The timeline mismatch means trying to force efficiency assessments **too early** could be **confusing**.  \n\n### **Revised Approach: Keep Them Separate, But Ensure They Flow Together Later**  \n\nInstead of trying to **modify the BEW now**, a **better solution** is to **bridge the gap** between early user research and later efficiency assessments **without forcing efficiency too soon.** Here’s how:  \n\n---\n\n## **1. Keep User Research Focused on Understanding Problems, Not Optimizing Yet**  \n📌 **Solution:** Keep the **User Research** slides and worksheet focused on **uncovering inefficiencies, pain points, and constraints from a user perspective**—not business operations.  \n\n- **Subtle Addition:** Instead of \"efficiency,\" use **\"constraints\"** (e.g., resource availability, cost concerns, product/service gaps).  \n- **Why?** This lets **business ideas evolve naturally** before jumping into efficiency improvements.  \n\nExample Slide Edit:  \n- Under **DO, LOOK, LISTEN**, instead of saying “efficiency,” say:  \n  - *\"What challenges do users face in cost, time, or access to resources?\"*  \n  - *\"Where do users struggle with inconvenience, delays, or unnecessary complexity?\"*  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Introduce Efficiency as a Later-Stage Reflection, Not an Early Module**  \n📌 **Solution:** Instead of forcing efficiency thinking too early, add a **small “Future Step” note** in the User Research session:  \n\n> *\"Once you start running your business, you can revisit these insights to improve efficiency and reduce costs. A later module will help assess and optimize operations based on real-world data.\"*  \n\n- **This sets the expectation** that efficiency becomes important **after operations exist**, rather than mixing it into user research too early.  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Small Adjustment to BEW: Create a “Tying It Back to Early Insights” Section (Later in the Process)**  \n📌 **Where?** In the BEW, **at the beginning** of the workbook or **before a self-assessment exercise**, add a simple reflection prompt:  \n\n> *\"Think back to your early user research—what pain points or resource constraints did customers mention? Have those changed now that you’re operating?\"*  \n\n- **Why?** This connects **early insights from the User Research module** to the **efficiency work later on**, but **only when it’s relevant** (i.e., once businesses are running).  \n- **No confusion** because the connection is made **after businesses exist**, not while still in idea development.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision: Keep Them Separate but Make a Natural Hand-Off Later**  \n✅ **Keep User Research focused on user challenges, constraints, and unmet needs**—not operations efficiency.  \n✅ **Don’t modify the BEW now**—instead, add a **future reflection section** that links back to user research only when businesses are running.  \n✅ **Subtle slide tweak:** Add a **“Future Step” note** in the User Research module so entrepreneurs **know efficiency work will come later.**  \n\n**This avoids awkwardness and confusion while ensuring insights from early research eventually inform business efficiency—when the timing is right.** 🚀",

Today is all about getting to know each other, understanding the program, and setting the foundations for the next two weeks as you learn more about the market and your customers needs!\n1\n\n\n\nLET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER\u000b\n Name?\n Where you are from?\n Tell us your idea.\n What’s your superpower?\n10 minutes: Share\n\nIntroductions:\nBefore we get started, I would like to introduce myself and get to know all of you a bit better. Let's quickly go around the room and share:\nYour name,\nWhere you are from,\nTell us a little bit about your idea. Have you thought about any challenges related to resources or sustainability in your industry?\nAnd finally, if you had a superpower, what would it be (flying, reading minds, shape shifting, etc…)?\n\nThe trainers should start first. Then, go around the room so each person can introduce themselves.\n2\n\n09:00 am \t\tWelcome + Introductions!\n09:30 am\t\tFive One Labs & Ignite\n10:30 am\t\tDesign Sprint \n12:00 pm\t\tGroup Lunch\n01:30 pm\t\tUser Research \n04:30 pm\t\tWrap up\nAGENDA\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nAgenda: Now that we all know each other a little better, let’s get into the agenda for the day. \nThis morning we will spend some time understanding Five One Labs, the program, and what exactly you will be doing over the two weeks. This will be an opportunity to clarify any questions you still have and give you some insights on what is in store ahead through a design sprint!\nGroup Lunch: At 12:00 we will take a break and get lunch together. \nThis afternoon we will come back and get into user research. This is the first major session we will have. Here we will define our research plan for the next few weeks! Think about how people use and access resources related to your idea. Finally, we will wrap up around 4:30!\n\n3\n\nYES, AND….\n15 minutes: Icebreaker \n\n2 minutes: Explain the activity\nTrainers should conduct the “YES, AND…” Icebreaker\nMake teams of about 3-5\nState a problem or ask the group for a problem \nFor example:\nIt’s an extremely hot day, and I want to get into five one labs without using too much energy on cooling, how can I do that?\nIt is so hot outside, how can I get to and from work without sweating or ever feeling the heat?\n \n5 minutes: “No” technique:\nYou have 2 minutes to generate different crazy ideas to solve that problem. Generate as many as possible. But there is a rule! When one member in the team says an idea another one must say “no!” and come up with a completely different idea. This goes on and on until the 2 minutes are up. You have to do this quickly, let's see how many crazy ideas we will get.\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nUse an umbrella!\nNo! Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”: \nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint! We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources. But first, we will give you a little introduction to the Design curriculum and an overview of the design thinking methodology.\n5\n\n\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      Introduction to Design Thinking\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      User Research\nFeb. 16, 2020:\t      Define the Problem\nFeb. 20, 2020:\t\tCreativity and Ideation\n \n \n\nDESIGN THINKING SCHEDULE\nApril 1\nIntro to design thinking\nApril 1\nApril 7\nApril 8\nUser research\nDefine the problem\nCreativity and ideation\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nQuickly give an overview of the 4 Design sessions they will have over the next two weeks. \nIntroduction to Design Thinking: We will focus on giving you a good understanding of design thinking and the human centered design process today through a design sprint. Starting this afternoon, we will talk about applying the Design Thinking methodology to your business.\nUser Research: We will go into creating a research plan for you to deeply understand your customers and their needs.\nReframe: Define the Problem: We will take all of our research, and clearly define the problem for your different customer types.\nCreativity and Ideation: Finally, we will generate solutions to your customers problems. Some of them might be your current ideas, but we hope to generate a wide variety of ideas that could all be potential solutions. \n6\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is design thinking? Why is it useful?\nPotential answers:\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people \nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential \nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n7\n\nincreased creativity\nstronger solutions\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe trainer should recap points brought up on the previous slide answering “What is design thinking? Why is it useful?”\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people \nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential \nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n8\n\nCC, BY-NC-ND, ⓒ Joe Thorn\nDiscussion: 5 minutes \n\nAsk: Take a look at this photo – who can tell me what this girl needs? (gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\n Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\n Send the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\n How might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life? \n Improve and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each) \nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural? \nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype? \n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?\n\n\n\n]]]",

      "content": "### **Scoring the Updated Design Thinking Section of Ignite Based on the Rubric**\n\nThis version of the **Design Thinking** section integrates **more sustainability-conscious thinking** but still focuses primarily on **human-centered design** rather than **explicit environmental or climate resilience considerations**. Below is the scoring based on the provided rubric.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Product & Service Design for Sustainability**  \n**Score: 3 (Practical Integration)**  \n✅ **Evidence:**\n- The **brainstorming activity** subtly integrates sustainability by introducing constraints like *\"What if it had to be made from recycled materials?\"* and *\"What if it had to be made entirely with local materials?\"*\n- The **prototyping section** encourages the use of **local, recycled, and green materials**.\n  \n🔹 **Improvement Suggestion:**  \n- **Strengthen** the framing of **resource-conscious design** by explicitly mentioning **low-waste, durable, and energy-efficient** solutions as part of the **brainstorming prompt.**  \n- Add a **reflection question**: *“How might your solution minimize waste or environmental impact?”*  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Technology & Innovation for Sustainability**  \n**Score: 2 (Basic Awareness)**  \n✅ **Evidence:**\n- The curriculum **does not explicitly reference sustainable technology**, but the **brainstorming constraints** open the door to discussions about **eco-friendly innovations**.\n  \n🔹 **Improvement Suggestion:**  \n- Encourage **entrepreneurs to think about how technology can enhance sustainability** in their solutions (e.g., **energy-efficient designs, circular economy principles**).\n- Include **one simple example** of a real-world sustainable innovation to **spark inspiration**.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Business Model Resilience**  \n**Score: 1 (Not Addressed)**  \n❌ **Evidence:**\n- There is **no explicit framing of business resilience** in the module.\n- The design sprint does not yet incorporate **climate risks, resource scarcity, or adaptation strategies** for businesses.\n\n🔹 **Improvement Suggestion:**  \n- Add **one discussion point** post-prototyping: *\"If you had to adapt this solution for a world with fewer resources (e.g., water shortages, energy costs, supply chain instability), how would you modify it?\"*\n- Integrate **a small checkpoint** during feedback that asks participants to consider **scalability and resilience**.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Score for the Updated Design Thinking Section**  \n\n| **Category** | **Score (1-5)** | **Evidence** | **Improvement Suggestion** |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|\n| **Product & Service Design for Sustainability** | 3 | Brainstorming includes recycled/local material constraints; prototyping uses sustainable materials | Strengthen framing by adding a **reflection question** on waste reduction |\n| **Technology & Innovation for Sustainability** | 2 | No direct references but allows for sustainable tech exploration in brainstorming | Provide **one example** of a sustainable tech innovation |\n| **Business Model Resilience** | 1 | No explicit link to climate resilience or supply chain risks | Add a **discussion point** on designing for resource constraints |\n\n---\n\n## **Key Takeaways & Next Steps**  \n✔ **A significant improvement** from the previous version, now with some **embedded sustainability elements**.  \n✔ **Small tweaks** (e.g., more explicit framing in brainstorming, a resilience discussion) would elevate the **Product & Service Design** category to a **4**.  \n✔ **Business Model Resilience is still missing**—a **single question or checkpoint** could add this dimension **without disrupting the flow.**  \n\nWould you like me to draft **specific slide edits** or a **worksheet update** to integrate these suggestions? 🚀",
