      "content": "write this following badges system in a 1 pager review note so i can share with my team:\nbefore you write ask me 5 questions to help clarify the task and make the output better:\nOkay, so I want to talk about bloom badges and how they work.\n\nAnd our goals for the bloom badges is to enable people to recognize each other within a program, increasing the amount of connection, community, collaboration, contribution.\n\nAnd this is one of the things that makes our programs really engaging and alive.\n\nAnd also by recognizing each other, we are instilling the framework's scope in the minds of our teams so that they're able to see and understand all of the skills that are within a certain competency framework.\n\nAnd then the next goal that we have with our badges and certificates process is to offer certification that is meaningful, credible, and valuable to the teams and the people that receive them.\n\nIn order to do that, these badges that are going to be offered each have to have some of those variables.\n\nSo the two components that we have are recognition and then badging and certification.\n\nIn recognition, anyone can recognize anybody else at any time for some of the different types of skills for that program's framework.\n\nSo for instance, in the enterprise capacities framework, someone can recognize somebody else for being innovative and creative.\n\nAnd then there are badges.\n\nBeing innovative and creative is something that you can get a badge for.\n\nYou can first get very easy badges, quick badges, by the very first time you onboard into a program, you take an assessment and you identify the entire scope and the different skills within the framework and the competencies within the framework that you could be growing in.\n\nAnd so once you have all of that, what you can then do is go through the course of the program and within a moment with your program manager or mentor, you can update your work plan document to contain a section of which skill are you wanting to develop and to what badge level.\n\nSo let's say that you wanted to get the three star badge for innovation and creativity.\n\nThat means that you're going to be able to teach another person in your organization or outside of your organization this skill and you're going to have to describe what you want to do and how you're going to do it.\n\nSo once you accomplish that, you can then get verified.\n\nIf you're within a program, the verification process happens within these work plan sessions.\n\nIf you're outside of a program, the verification process happens within the Bloom University website where you can propose to be validated for a badge, pay $20 and receive a one-on-one session verifying and validating the badge.\n\nSo the validation process consists of reviewing the evidence, having a standard operating procedure for doing so, and then giving it an approval or a disapproval.\n\nOnce this badge is released, it will be owned by the individual.\n\nThe individual could use these badges then on their social media and at the end of a program or when someone has collected a cluster of badges that they would like to compile into a certificate, which is something that means that the person has a significant amount of knowledge in a framework.\n\nThey can then take all of those badges and then publish them in a certificate.\n\nThe certificate will have all of the badges and if they're in a program, all of the kudos that they have received during the course of that program.\n\nIf they're not in a program, it will have all of the badges who verified the certificate and who is doing the verification and who is receiving the certificate.\n\nAnd so this is the Bloom Badges framework.",

The goal is to foster continuous learning and practical application of skills within the program’s framework.\n\n**Process:**\nParticipants engage in various program activities, projects, and tasks that align with the skills outlined in their work plan. This hands-on approach ensures that learning is practical and applicable. Regular interactions with mentors and peers provide opportunities for feedback and collaboration, further enriching the learning experience. As participants progress, they document their achievements and challenges, which are later reviewed during progress check-ins. This continuous cycle of action and reflection helps solidify learning and prepares participants for the validation phase.\n\n---\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n1. **Overview**\n2. **Initial Assessment**\n   - Objective\n   - Process\n   - Pros\n   - Cons\n3. **Work Plan Document**\n   - Objective\n   - Process\n   - Pros\n   - Cons\n4. **Skill Development**\n   - Objective\n   - Process\n   - Pros\n   - Cons\n5. **Progress Check-Ins**\n   - Objective\n   - Process\n   - Pros\n   - Cons\n6. **Validation and Verification**\n   - Objective\n   - Within a Program\n   - Outside a Program\n   - Approval Process\n   - Pros\n   - Cons\n7. **Badge Award and Ownership**\n   - Objective\n   - Process\n   - Pros\n   - Cons\n8. **Peer Recognition and Kudos**\n   - Objective\n   - Within a Program\n   - Outside a Program\n   - Pros\n   - Cons\n9. **Certificate Compilation**\n   - Objective\n   - Process\n   - Details\n   - Pros\n   - Cons\n10. **Flowchart of Bloom Badges Process**\n11. **Conclusion**\n\n---\n\nNext, we'll move on to the \"Progress Check-Ins\" section.",
