      "content": "I want to write a book on islamic economics - or \"barakanomics\"... it's related to the regenerative and permaculture economics ideas. the appleseed collective's multiple forms of capital ... also, the idea that we need to bring a higher purpose to our economic system because what draws attention is essentially being worshipped and in our lives nothing draws so much attention as money and wealth. society at large is starting to question the model, as it is clear that the majority is not benefitting from the abundance that technological progress has made and we have entered a new moment of technological leveraging. technology, progress, and the idea that the only way to \"go forward\" is to go upward is clear from how we describe our economies - \"stagnant\" - when another word for it could have just as easily been stable. populations around the world are declining - the middle class is shrinking in it's proportion of total wealth ownership and we see an expanding amount of wealth in the 1%. the pressures are due to increase as artificial intelligence is reaching the phase where it will soon make reduandant many of the current jobs, while our global ecosystem is being rocked by wars in ukraine and the middle east, reducing trust in govornment in it's ability to manage innovation, and legislate accordingly. There are many problems and there are some approaches to address them through economic means. Social enterprises, incentivizing green technologies... buying twitter to ensure free speech is preserved - supposedly. and i believe there might be an economic solution, yet it needs to come with an associated shift in technological utilization, and reconception of what it means to be \"homoeconomicus\" - the fundamental beliefs that people have about economics seem to be derived from a flawed understanding of modernity's faith, faith in science, faith in evolution. that survival of the fittest. that (let's forget govornment subsidies for now) in a free market innovation that provides goods and services in a sustainable way to their customers best and at the best price will win business, and business means they can grow/expand/innovate/ and continue the cycle. \nThe problem is that similar to someone living in precarity - how much do you save for tomorrow - the idea of a business being \"too big to fail\" or having enough is not on the radar. Furthermore, beholden to shareholders, a business is incentivized to reduce labor (people) and increase profits - every year, leading to leveraging automation and technology.\nThe questions i have are what sort of businesses were the muslim traders involved in that resulted in so many conversions in asia. what is balance in business? How do we take innovations and use them wisely - and how do we innovate from where we are? Economics is the study of the household. We cannot burn down the ground floor and keep the penthouses up top stable.\nThe ideas which bore the \"invisible hand\" and darwins theory of dog eat dog business where a market will hash everything out is not working. There are long term harms, like climate collapse, which are not priced in - as well as harms to society (suicide rates increasing amoungst teens found to be correlated with social media use) and the loss of meaning in a livelihood. many people do not feel hope for the future, don't have a vision to work towards. so many of mellenials and younger view the \"american dream\" as a rigged game. The idea of home ownership (one of the core tennants of islamic purposes of shari3a is to preserve the family) is a forgone conclusion, college degrees are expensive, productivity has been increasing per person, yet wages have not grown accordingly. The idea that if you work harder you will succeed is a statistically proven lie. And the generations are fed up, many of whom are taking to the streets in protest against climate, against the future they claim their elders have stolen from them. The idea of respecting the shaykh, from whom the younger generation inherit wisdom is gone, and in it's stead is the greedy, lucky, boomer generation who don't understand the economic situation of the majority of the younger generations and instead blame laziness (countered by the evidence of increased productivity) \nThe idea of \"quiet quitting\" - that there are many at work biding their time, looking to \"get away\" with doing the least to then live their lives outside work, and the despair that things will get better is causing younger generations to loose hope. And a hopeless generation is a dead generation. Addicted to phones, with screen time on the rise, anxiety about retirement leading many gen alpha to save early we find the whole idea of vocation and work in an antagonistic perspective. how can i get in, get rich, and get out - save myself seems to be the conclusion we can make from these stats. the challenges are ownership structures, youth can either set out on their own and build businesses or enter a company where the structure is designed to pay the least and extract the most from every component of the value chain without damaging quality. Google's fluffy chairs and delicious lunch bars at work are a form of golden handcuffs - you will give us the best of your youth. \nWhat we don't seem to be asking is if it has to be this way? Sure there are B corps and social enterprises and non profits and activism and many can take the alternative path. Yet, could we have a revolution from the ground up? Could we build the alternative economics which takes care of the entire house, and even restores the garden around it, and rewilds the woods surrounding it? Can the way we make our living be lifegiving for all involved? I believe a true vocation can and should feel like that, to know our skills and qualities which we contribute to neighbords and society whom we care for in a way that is a blessing for the entire valuechain. \nI think of the asian conversions, and the way of working that led to that - I believe there is something we can return to and the billions in capital that we have looking for investment can be redesigned into a vehicle that can launch the blessed versions of the goods and services we have today. Is it optimistic? The fortune 100 changes order and many disspear of the list every decade, I believe that the younger generations are looking for hope and are willing to purchase accordingly. I believe that an alternative economic system can emerge that brings power to people, establishes community cohesion and community wealth - affecting political engagement, buffering from the storms of modernity with new wuquf and other mechanisms - the ideas of humility, effort(jihad), leadership, gratitude, and fundamentally shifting from the never enough because the future is uncertain to the trust and reliance and knowing that god provides and all is written and not a penny less will come to me. the faith that chairty doesn't deplete wealth, and witnessing its impact on society when those marginalized become soon those with the most resources to give, knowing what it's like to be on the recieving end (i have a friend abed who was a refugee in syria, and as soon as he got his first job he was giving to those in need because he said he remembers what it was like) - NEETs are present way more in Turkey than in France by an order of 4 - why? Will it only be a muslim revolution? I believe it can start there, yet when we start to witness the impact of this sort of business dealing, the baraka powered corporations of the future which are the arms which implement technology in society, that pray istikhara and ask for guidance for their implementation. \nIt's said that the steam engine was developed in Istanbul, and instead of building factories and enslaving children (like England) they used it to turn Doner... what is approprirate use of technology? I believe when a business knows why it exists - and has a higher calling than profit, we will see their R&D budgets being spent on what leads to the preservation of life, sanctity of families, and others. Just the like Amish don't reject tehcnology outright, they put it up against their values and have a human early adopter guiny pig the tech for a year and witness it's impact on their lives in contrast to the values they want to be engendering and then accept and reject from that premise. The question is can we not just accept/reject yet also innovate wisely, slowly and carefully. \nI believe that fast is not better. Always, yet when we create for humans we usually ask them what they want, a Muslim will know that they need to ask their spirit, not their soul or nafs, that without purification people might be mistaken between their appropriate needs and their desires. The documentary The Century of the Self describes the calculated way the advertising industry created the idea of the self (Nafs in islamic spiritual psychology) and pandered to it. Could these displacements - shifting to feeding the self, which is the furnace in which we throw resources into the capitalist machine - businesses reinforcing through marketing the idea of the self and then extracting from the world resources to fill it, and expand it ever more, and then speed things up so they can shovel more and more into it. And once we hit attention capacity and films that cut every 2 seconds isn't fast enough, we shorten content. Smaller videos on instagram, easier to scroll from one thing to the next (no dial on the TV) just swipe, infinite scroll, faster burning cigarettes (that's a thing!), fast fashion, faster cars, yet the equipment we have to percieve the world is the same, two eyes, two years, and less and less time with family and friends. and if we do have that time, the quality is degraded by the incapacity of paying attention. The rise of ADHD diagnosis and perscriptions of attention pills, and antidepressants, and sleeping pills. We change our state like we change the notification settings on our phone, we're now in focus time because we need to create value for work to be able to sustain a life. This is how markets are grown, we need to find and exploit consumable things. With Neuralink - perhaps our capacity for experience will be expanded ever further. The wise currently learn about their state and fast from food, so they can live longer, and have focus to produce, there is little attention paid to that which is worth doing, mostly to that which is worth not doing, how can we automate, reduce the time we spend writing reports and emails, doing analysis... why? to have leisure? no to consume other things. Even france is not immune, because the global capitalist system is not geographically bound, in order to compete french companies are becoming more \"entrepreneurial\" and the extended lunch breaks, and focus on food has now become less common with more people eating at work, and... gasp... even eating at their desks. \nThe siesta is in decline in Spain. Ramadan, a month of discipiline and fasting, is becoming a midnight bazar. \nThe question is why? What hole is needing to be filled that clearly cannot be filled with another cronut or trip to bali? Even spirituality is transforming into microdosing mushrooms and midnfulness based stress reduction. The issue is what is Good is HARD because what we seek is to know ourselves and experience self worth and trancendance - we need challenges like a mirror needs an object in order to reflect something. The most technologically and economically forward people I know are libertarians and transhumanists, the idea of the self as God wouldn't really phase them. The hope to transcend limits, cure death, implant data streams with cameras globally, expand our capacity to process with parallel processors hooked up with neura links connected to wolfram alpha - lesswrong like people seeking ultimate clarity on rationalist - explainable, observable, pattern matched reality with no common ground to stand on to describe why we might not want to try to live forever, with no ability to accept that for some people ethical action is more valuable than life, and that there are causes where life is a worthwhile trade, these beliefs don't fit into the worldview. I believe that the lack of understanding about what the self is and a disagreement what life could be about - living forever and becoming Godlike through technology - which one can see espoused on a modern day hero like Elon(self proclaimed on the spectrum of autism, hyper rationalist, first principles oriented person who believes the ultimate purpose is to continue to explore the universe. That human conciousness is not ultimately special, it's only special because it's the only self aware entity we know of in the universe so we must preserve the abstract concept of self awareness - why? Because it's crazy, we can become Godlike with tech, who knows if there are limits, let's push to the ad astera! To the stars? Why the stars? What about within? If he knew there were other entities out there that were concious would he aquiece and allow humanity to potentially die out in an astroid or when our sun explodes? No I don't believe so, I belive that his subjective experience of his conciousness is something that he wants to see ad astera, even if it's in self replicating in his children, something he promotes widely, more babies, especially if you're WEIRD - white smart eurpoean descent, etc - or at least have a degree from MIT or went to ycomb/build something cool. The idea of cool, nerdy stuff could lead someone to smile in amazement, yet because the goal is to experience more and more amazement wonder-full moments and expand to the stars to keep finding that hit - it sounds awesome, and it's not. it's not because the ultimate goal is anathema to common human ethics, I believe if elon had a trolly problem where there was one path which would lead humans to live amoungst the stars (a minority of course, who can get off) and another path where the train would destroy a single life at random from the world - he probably without hesitation would pull the lever and cause it to kill the one random person (even if it is him) I believe he is consumed by this idea and goal, and it's our economic system that empowers people with billions to allow these insane goals dreamt up by someone who self identifies as a person with a social disability (empathy likely works differently) - and our systems put the trolly's lever in people like his's hands. The risk takers who calculate and tabulate and take big bets, debts, and launch the rockets - those who put it all on the line, tearing up relationships and livlihoods for an individuals dream is the failure of our system. Why aren't there billions of millionaires, what is corporate personhood and what's the issue with that? why don't they have councils of those who want to identify the best way to preserve life and precious human consciousness? I'm not sure I can come up with all the solutions, yet I believe that Islam is a complete way of life and that unlike permaculture, there are more than a billion muslims (and because of the six degrees of separation) we have access to the entire market economy to redirect traffic from this, destructive business, to this constructive business. and i want to see muslims take this responsibility seriously by committing to building these businesses and then by committing to shopping them and marketing them to neighbors. I believe that the future isn't a straight line, that technology can be developed and used to further the goals of the shari3a, to increase sa3eed - sa3ada, the truely happy person who is satisfied already with what God decreed for them, and sees everything in economic terms, their life is a debt, a total blessing and a gift, how will we repay this debt by the proper usage of this body through time. feed it good food (what is that? well we MUST figure it out now because of this belief of the Body as a sacred gift that has obligations on us) the family, how to support, trade? what is a good trade? What is money, how to spend profits? what about zakat, what if we took zakat seriously? who will administrate all the wealth? where are the organizations? with money and shifting towards recognizing the abundance that we are currently in - simply by consuming less, inviting the neighbors who are hungry 40 houses to the left and right, and following the path set out for us - we will find the abundance that is simply a misappropriation of resources. we don't need communies, or decentralized technology where we don't trust anyone to create a universal basic income. we basically need to become human, to return to our basic humanity. \nI'd like help identifying the book in the text above, what are the themes, what are the potential topics, who is the potential audience, can we get focused and organize the concepts better? What am I missing?\nHelp me structure, think step by step about how to take this word dump and turn it into a powerful book that grips muslims and creates conversation on an international scale. Come up with a plan to determine the next steps and then identify the prompts we can use to send the text to an LLM alongside this prompt to create the responses needed for a complete book proposal to send to a publisher and questions we still need to answer to improve the book. Remember to think carefully and create deep and insightful prompts, that include elements of asking the user, like ask me 5 questions to help you create xyz from this content, and prompts that derive insights by leveraging world class knowledge and experts like: identify 3 world class experts who would agree and 3 who would disagree with the main premise of this book and have them debate back and forth and then ask the author 3 questions each, etc. ",

Engaging with World-Class Experts**\n\n**Prompt for LLM:**\n\n\"Identify three world-class experts who would agree with the main premise of integrating Islamic ethical principles into modern economics (e.g., Muhammad Yunus, Tariq Ramadan, Karen Armstrong), and three who might disagree (e.g., Richard Dawkins, Milton Friedman, Steven Pinker). Create a dialogue where they debate the feasibility and implications of Barakanomics. After the debate, have each expert pose three questions to the author to challenge and refine the book's arguments.\"\n\n---\n\n### **11. Asking for Your Input**\n\nTo further refine the book, here are some questions:\n\n1. **What personal experiences or observations have most influenced your perspective on Islamic economics?**\n2. **Can you provide specific examples of businesses or communities embodying these principles today?**\n3. **How do you envision technology being used appropriately within Barakanomics?**\n4. **What are your strategies for addressing skepticism or criticism of this economic model?**\n5. **How will you measure the success or impact of the ideas presented in your book?**\n\n---\n\n### **12. Conclusion and Next Steps**\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can transform your initial ideas into a compelling and well-structured book. The next steps involve refining your thesis, expanding on the outlined chapters, and engaging with both experts and potential readers to enrich the content. Remember, the goal is to inspire a meaningful conversation and offer a hopeful alternative to current economic systems.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to provide answers to the questions above or let me know if there's a particular area you'd like to delve into further. Together, we can develop a comprehensive book proposal that resonates with readers and sparks the international dialogue you're aiming for.",
