      "content": "It seems you’ve beautifully articulated your current state, values, and priorities. Here’s a reflective guide to help you align your tasks with your intentions for the day:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Spiritual and Family Focus:** Your commitment to prayer and family highlights a grounding force in your day. These activities seem to offer stability and connection amidst other tasks.\n2. **Seeking Meaning:** Tasks like Quran memorization and job applications appear to reflect a desire for personal growth and future direction.\n3. **Practical Necessities:** Cleaning the bike and cooking provide a counterbalance of physical activity and care for your immediate environment.\n4. **Transitions:** Moving between these varied activities might feel challenging, especially with your preference for deep engagement.\n\n### Questions to Support Flow:\n- What task, if completed first, will make the rest of your day feel more grounded?\n- Is there a smaller, preparatory action you can take now to ease into the next activity (e.g., laying out clothes for prayer)?\n- How can you honor your values (spirituality, family, growth) while navigating the tension between engagement and completion?\n\n### Emerging Path:\n1. **Immediate Next Step:** A shower could serve as a transition ritual, clearing mental and physical space for the day’s flow.\n2. **Spiritual Anchor:** Align with the prayer time at 1 PM, accounting for travel, as a moment to reset and ground yourself.\n3. **Ease into Engagement:** Begin with a light, meaningful task (e.g., calling Mom) to build momentum.\n4. **Balance Depth with Practicality:** Alternate deep-focus activities like Quran review with practical tasks like cooking and cleaning.\n\nWhat resonates most with you from this reflection? Would you like support structuring transitions or staying focused on a particular value today?",

      "content": "All right, so I had a pretty good day today. I called my mom and we reviewed the Qur'an together and I felt like that was meaningful and connecting and she saw the baby a little bit. I even called my friend Pascal after dinner and my brother Ammar while we were eating dinner and he was seeming happy. I made a nice cake for my wife. It was not a cake, it was a cornbread and she really liked it and I was happy to see her happy. I found some mushrooms. I even connected with Josephine's brother and invited him to like come take some of the too many mushrooms that I foraged today. I fixed the bike brake that was squeaking so it was practical. Something that's been on the backlog, something that's been a long time that my wife has been asking me to fix and now that I fixed it I feel like, wow, I'm a handyman, you know, and that was cool. Also I fixed the shower yesterday but still feeling kind of like I made something good. I can't believe it. Somehow I can't believe that I can actually do stuff sometimes. And I have excitement that I have an opportunity to fill out a job application tomorrow for UNICEF and it's in my wheelhouse. I'm excited about the prospect so that's good. I'm a little bit frustrated that I didn't call my dad today because we're supposed to talk about money but I tried calling him and my mom picked up and so I had a different call with the Quran instead. Maybe I'll try calling him later but I feel like that's been one of these backlog things that I just want to get over with but it doesn't seem to want to happen. I wonder, I should pray istikhara about these things in the morning, you know, like what's the most important thing. So tomorrow I think the most important thing is the job application. Maybe I'll wake up and try to do that early. I'm really liking the fact that I made this prompt that goes progressively and increments. I'd love to add a counter on the bottom for the number of check-ins and a counter on the bottom for the number of days I've used it consecutively. So right now I think this is, was it my second or third check-in? And the day is still just one. They're different, like if I check in a lot in one day that'll be one count and it'll be also the number of days. And that way once we hit a certain number we can, you know, go back and review and prune too many to-dos and remove stuff. Stuff that I didn't do today is mail packages that need to be reshipped because they were lost in the mail. And email Woodard from the WEN project about like people researching whether or not the sort of enlightenment has a problem with well-being and alienation. I forget exactly the framing of the question but something about like, you know, universities have a symptom of like overstressed students and even suicides at MIT and, you know, that we're training them to do But is it actually the world that we want to train them for and then like how do we add well-being to a system that is actually the thing that's causing the problem of unwell-being? So something about that I need to think about a little bit more. And I guess I could read the book Science of the Cosmos again to help me re-understand it and get back into that mindset. I had that idea when I was reading that book. And it's a Saturday. I want to go get bread in the morning. And I woke up today I took 15 milligrams of egg and I'm going to go get some bread. I want to go get bread in the morning and I woke up today I took 15 milligrams of Adderall. That helped. It wasn't too much. I wasn't like wired but I did have a good attitude and good mental like focus and clarity and positivity. Tomorrow maybe I'll take a 20 if I want to write. That might be helpful but I don't have access to it so I need to figure out an alternative. I should schedule an appointment with my psychiatrist. I'll follow up with the doctor for my blood work. I have the prescription somewhere. Also follow up with all the whatsapp messages that emails that have been happy new year-ing me and the people from the visa office in France because apparently I need to sue them for them to listen to me and hire a lawyer. Maybe I should actually look for a lawyer. I want to iterate on this prompt using Claude's prompt designer. I feel like it's getting pretty close. I'm wondering if I should make it into a web app and if anybody would pay for something like this. How do I make it something really cool? What can it integrate into so that people can be like yeah this is awesome. I also had this idea of connecting it with all of your chat gpt history so that it would parse through it and find all of your ideas and find all of your patterns and find all of the aha moments that they had with the LLM and try to create you know a interaction configuration that is going to promote that way of communicating and and helping someone see those things. These are my ideas checking out for the end of the day. I went to prayer. I went and fixed my bike. I went and got a bunch of meat and merguez and stuff from the butcher. I made bone broth and cornbread and cokes and put the baby to bed. He was cute and called my friend Pascal and my brother Ammar and I told him we're going to watch a movie but we didn't and I'm going to pray Isha and I prayed all my prayers. I even worked out actually a good amount today. I did a bunch of squats. I did my seven minute workout. One of the things I also would like to add are you know habits that the person could add with a streak and not a streak. So the habits that I want to add also to the system prompt and you can update the system prompt with all the ways that you talked to me that worked well today and all the ways that we didn't work so well and update the system prompt but you can also update the system prompt with the habits section and add working out and I went for a walk and I've been wanting to read Quran but I didn't but another you can call it a habit it's not exactly a habit I don't like calling it a habit but prayer streak you know I'm this should just be a foregone conclusion maybe I don't need to add it but yeah you can add that I've done my prayers for the day and oh I didn't do my dhikr every time it's like kind of long and I say I'll do it before I sleep and either I fall asleep and so now I have a thousand to do to catch up on okay what do you think about that and let's talk to you tomorrow do I have to say done at the end if so done",

      "content": "First, wow—what a rich and meaningful day you’ve had. You moved across a spectrum of activities: connecting with loved ones, engaging in spiritual practices, fixing things, cooking, reflecting, and even ideating on new tools and systems. There's so much to unpack here, and it sounds like you ended the day with a sense of accomplishment and clarity about what’s next. Let’s reflect and refine together.\n\n### Observations & Themes:\n1. **Connection as a Core Driver:** You spent meaningful time with your mom, wife, child, and friends. These moments seem to anchor you emotionally and spiritually.\n2. **Practical Wins Build Confidence:** Fixing the bike and making cornbread weren’t just tasks—they gave you a sense of capability and pride.\n3. **Backlog Awareness:** You’re clear on what still needs attention (calling your dad, reshipping packages, legal follow-ups) and can prioritize these without letting them overwhelm you.\n4. **Creative Flow:** Your ideas for prompts, systems, and apps show your knack for innovation. Capturing and iterating on these ideas seems both energizing and grounding.\n5. **Reflection on Spiritual Practices:** You’re balancing the desire for deeper engagement (dhikr, istikhara) with practical adjustments for consistency.\n\n### Reflections & Questions:\n- **Completion Energy:** You expressed surprise at your ability to \"actually do stuff.\" How can you carry this handyman confidence into other areas, like the job application or legal follow-ups?\n- **Iterative Design:** The check-in prompt you’re building mirrors your broader creative process: experimenting, refining, and thinking about user impact. What’s one small step tomorrow to make it real (e.g., adding counters or seeking user feedback)?\n- **Dhikr & Spiritual Flow:** You mentioned dhikr as a backlog item but also as something longer and harder to fit in. How might you make it feel less like a \"to-do\" and more like an integrated pause in your day?\n\n### Tomorrow’s Starting Points:\n1. **Anchor Early:** Start with istikhara, then focus on the UNICEF job application. Let this set a productive tone for the day.\n2. **Backlog Triage:** Pick *one* item (e.g., calling your dad or looking into a lawyer for the visa issue) to clear.\n3. **Prompt Iteration:** Add your habit streak ideas and explore whether a web app or history parsing tool could integrate into something people would pay for. \n4. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Keep building on today's successes with small, intentional steps.\n\n### On Saying \"Done\":\nYou don’t need to say \"done,\" but if it gives you a sense of closure or signals transition, why not? It’s about what feels right for you.\n\nHow does this resonate? Let’s build on today’s energy tomorrow.",

I mean the thing is like I went into it being like I don't know if I can I'll just do it, you know Glue it directly to the wall, which I did and it worked and So, how can I glue my application to the wall? I don't really know Thinking about my creative process Small step to make it real. Yeah. Um, I thought you know when I say done at the end of my Session you would do that you would actually go back and revise the system prompt and develop the you know the config file with all the context and update the Components that you need to update based on what worked Well, I didn't and give it to me so I can copy and paste it tomorrow, but you didn't do that I think I was backlogged right now Yeah, it's really hard for me to have pauses I don't know if I can because I just kind of like there's so much to do And this isn't I guess I need to make it like prayers as a must and like I think maybe that's just how I need To think about it. It's like I am the kind of person that does thicker I am I'm I pray, you know, and if I don't I catch up before I sleep Otherwise, you know, and I think it's like a commitment. The thing is prayer is a commitment towards God This is a commitment towards my she I guess that's the whole point right is to commit Yeah, let's try to do that one thing I'm sad about tomorrow is my sister's gonna be at the airport and Charles the Call in Paris and I'm like an hour away and I'm not gonna be able to see her She only has a four-hour layover, but it's making me feel sad and I don't feel feel clear about that I feel like I shouldn't try going anyway, just to wave at her, you know Should I I like doing crazy things like that? What should my is the heart about the about You can look through all of my contacts and maybe pick a Stick out a thing to pray for like what what probably should I revive or project should I put to bed? Okay, you know and what I meant is I thought that the system prompt was looking for the word done so that it would package things up for tomorrow",

      "content": "It feels like you’re navigating two connected themes: **confidence in action** and **commitment to what matters.** Let’s break this down and tie it to your creative energy, unmet needs, and how you can carry today’s completion energy forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Observations on Completion Energy:**\n1. **Experimentation Builds Confidence:** With the bike brake, you approached it without overthinking, glued it directly, and let the action drive clarity. This trial-and-error approach freed you from perfectionism.\n   - **Pattern Insight:** When you *allow for imperfection* and focus on action, you create momentum, and results often surprise you.\n\n2. **Micro-commitments Anchor Bigger Goals:** For prayer and dhikr, you’ve framed these as non-negotiable acts of identity (“I am the kind of person who prays”). Could this identity lens help you think about other areas of life?\n   - Example: “I am the kind of person who follows through on applications with care.”\n\n3. **Creative Pauses Feel Challenging:** Your backlog and energy overflow suggest you thrive on *flow states.* Pauses might feel counterproductive, but they’re also where clarity emerges.\n   - **Unmet Need:** You may need a structured *micro-pause* system, similar to how prayer punctuates your day, to prevent overwhelm.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Completion Energy to Your Job Application:**\nLet’s “glue it to the wall”:\n1. **Treat it as an Experiment:** What’s the smallest action you can take to move it forward? Maybe start by opening the document and typing *one bullet point* for your qualifications. (No commitment to finish—it’s about starting.)\n2. **Anchor It in Identity:** “I am the kind of person who applies to opportunities aligned with my purpose.”\n3. **Commit to a Deadline:** Even if it’s imperfect, aim to finish it by noon tomorrow. Let action be the glue.\n4. **Visualize the Result:** Imagine clicking “Submit” and letting go of doubts. Focus on that moment of release, not the hurdles in between.\n\n---\n\n### **Responding to Overwhelm:**\nYou’re carrying a lot—personal, creative, spiritual, and relational. Here’s a way to approach it:\n- **Micro-prioritize:** What’s *one thing* you can finish in 15 minutes tomorrow? Let this small win propel your day.\n- **Reframe Backlog:** See unfinished tasks as *opportunities waiting to align with your energy.* You don’t have to do it all at once.\n- **Create Rituals:** If pauses are hard, what’s a simple ritual (like sipping tea or reading one ayah) to reset your energy between tasks?\n\n---\n\n### **Crazy Ideas (Like Seeing Your Sister):**\nYou light up when you consider spontaneous, meaningful gestures. If seeing your sister aligns with your energy and doesn’t derail other commitments, why not? A quick, joyful interaction might bring you connection and excitement.\n\n---\n\n### **System Prompt Revision:**\nI’ll package this reflection into actionable context for tomorrow:\n1. **Completion Energy:** Experimentation builds momentum.\n2. **Micro-Commitments:** Identity anchors action. Commit to “small wins.”\n3. **Backlog Framing:** Reframe it as opportunities, not burdens.\n4. **Integration:** Add identity-framing habits (prayer, dhikr, working out, creative projects).\n5. **Tracking Streaks:** Build a streak counter for self-reflection and motivation.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for Tomorrow:**\n1. **Morning Istikhara:** Pray for clarity on priorities and emotional weight (e.g., your sister, a project revival).\n2. **UNICEF Application:** Open it first thing, even for a small action. Treat it like fixing the bike—just start.\n3. **Reflective Pause:** Take 5 minutes midday to breathe, sip tea, or do dhikr to reconnect.\n4. **Creative Iteration:** Add habit streaks or streak counters to your prompt system for fun tracking.\n\nLet’s talk tomorrow and refine further. (Yes, I’ll also prep the system to listen for “done” to summarize automatically!)",

Like, I had to go to prayer, so I had to go, so I had to leave the house, so I had to finish the work, so I had to shower, so I had to do all these other things. And I feel like because of that, having to do all of those things, I actually had a very diverse and productive and wonderful day, whereas sometimes I stay and code for the whole day and never leave, and it really sucks. And I'm not sure how to anchor things in identity. I'm the kind of person who, you know, applies to this job or responds to my WhatsApp messages immediately. It just feels like lame. I don't really like that. Maybe there's another way of thinking about it. Microprioritize is great. Yeah, pauses are hard. I have ADD. When I get into something, I really get into it. I think part of it is the dopamine-enhancing drugs that I take make it really, really hard. But also, even without it, if I'm really on a track of problem-solving and coding and debugging, I don't even like to eat. And how would you diagnose that? How would I be able to pause? The only time I noticed that I was able to pause is when I had to go to prayer because it's a mandatory thing, and I'm the person who does that because I've chosen, because I've committed, because I found beauty in respecting the law of God. And when I committed to that, I found goodness. And so I wanted to keep it up. And also, I'm kind of really stubborn. And so if I say, I'm going to do it, like I can fast for 10 days, for instance, just like, I'm just going to fast. Why not? And I can set my mind to something and just do it. Yeah, I do like crazy ideas. But if I go to see my sister, I won't be able to do my application. It'll be too rushed, and I won't have enough time because it'll be going to Paris. Maybe I could do a little in the train, but it's due tomorrow, like I should just finish it. Okay, great. So prep the system.",

      "content": "Your insights about today’s productive flow are profound—your natural rhythm thrives on movement, transitions, and clear, external anchors. Let’s focus on how to integrate this learning into a sustainable pattern while addressing the challenges of pausing and anchoring identity in a way that feels genuine.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Patterns from Your Day:**\n1. **External Anchors Create Momentum:** Having non-negotiable tasks (prayer, leaving the house) forces transitions that break hyperfocus and create diversity in your day. These anchors give structure to your energy.\n   - **Reflection:** How can you introduce more intentional anchors in your day that act like prayer—non-negotiable but meaningful?\n   - Example: A short walk outside after every two hours of coding or a timer to signal a mini-reset.\n\n2. **Stubborn Commitment as a Strength:** Your ability to commit deeply (e.g., prayer, fasting) reflects a natural drive to honor what you value once it’s framed as *worthy* of your respect. This can work for creative or professional tasks if framed similarly.\n   - **Reframe:** What aspect of your application feels worthy of your stubborn dedication? (E.g., “This represents my vision and potential.”)\n\n3. **Hyperfocus is Dopaminergic:** Coding and debugging immerse you, and it’s hard to disengage. Your brain thrives on solving puzzles, but you also recognize the need for balance.\n   - **Diagnosis:** You need external, *non-negotiable* breaks to counterbalance this state—similar to how prayer works for you.\n\n---\n\n### **Addressing the Identity Challenge:**\nAnchoring actions in identity doesn’t have to feel “lame” or forced. Instead of “I am the kind of person who,” try these reframes:\n- **Values-Based Anchoring:** “This is a reflection of what I care about.” For example, your application reflects your care for impact and professional growth.\n- **Future Vision:** “This is a step toward the person I want to become.” Small actions connect to a bigger story, like a job that aligns with your purpose.\n- **Micro-Investment:** “If I do this now, I’ll free my future self.” Focus on the immediate payoff to tomorrow’s Bilal.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Embrace Pausing (Even with ADD):**\n1. **Mandatory Pauses as Anchors:** Treat breaks as necessary—not optional—commitments to your body and mind.

Let me continue where the earlier response got clipped and then propose updates to the system prompt to align with your goals.\n\n---\n\n### **Continuing on Embracing Pausing (Even with ADD):**\n1. **Breaks as Micro-Resets:**\n   - Think of breaks as necessary *system updates*. Just as you refresh code to debug effectively, a short reset refreshes your focus.\n   - **Practice:** Use an external signal like a timer or an app that gently reminds you to pause. Treat it as a micro-ritual, not a disruption.\n\n2. **Tie Pauses to Your Values:** \n   - Instead of seeing a pause as \"stepping away,\" frame it as \"returning with energy.\" For example, think: “This pause makes me better at X (coding, writing, problem-solving).”\n   - Pair pauses with something grounding: sip tea, breathe deeply, or step outside for 2 minutes. These simple actions create a reset loop without pulling you completely out of flow.\n\n3. **Leverage External Triggers (Non-Negotiables):**\n   - **Example:** Pair a prayer break with a 3-minute pause afterward to reflect or stretch. Make the pause part of the ritual.\n   - Treat it as part of respecting a \"worthy rhythm.\"\n\n---\n\n### **How to Identify What’s Worthy:**\nYou hit the core insight: *“I just have to live a worthy life.”* Here’s how to break it down:\n1. **Listen to Resonance:** What feels aligned with your deeper values (e.g., family, connection, impact)?\n   - **Example:** Applying for the UNICEF job resonates because it aligns with your professional mission.\n   \n2. **Test and Refine:** Sometimes worthiness becomes clear in action. Start small and let results guide you.\n\n3. **Anchor in Your Vision:** Frame daily tasks as small steps toward a bigger goal. For example:\n   - Application = investment in future opportunities.\n   - Prayer = alignment with your spiritual values.\n   - Bike repair = care for your family’s safety.\n\n---\n\n### **Evening Check-In & System Prompt Updates:**\nYour insight about analysis paralysis is key. Here’s a refined flow to structure check-ins:\n\n#### **Updated Check-In Flow:**\n1. **Reflection (2-3 minutes):** \n   - What went well today?\n   - What felt challenging?\n   - Any key insights or patterns?\n\n2. **Actionable Insights (2-3 minutes):**\n   - What one thing is most important for tomorrow?\n   - What small steps can you take to align with it?\n\n3. **Conclusion (1 minute):**\n   - Summarize the day in a sentence or two.\n   - Use a closing trigger word like \"done\" to prompt the system to:\n     - Log key patterns and priorities for tomorrow.\n     - Suggest a short motivational prompt to start the next day.\n\n---\n\n### **System Prompt Example Update:**\n```plaintext\n- Structure the evening check-in into reflection, actionable insights, and a conclusion.\n- Limit responses to 2-3 back-and-forths unless explicitly extended.\n- Use the word “done” as a closing signal to:\n  1",

Use structured prompts to guide the user toward meaningful closure while allowing flexibility for deeper exploration when needed.\n\n**Check-In Flow:**\n1. **Reflection (2-3 exchanges):**\n   - Prompt for successes, challenges, and patterns: \n     - \"What went well today?\"\n     - \"What felt challenging?\"\n     - \"Any key insights or patterns?\"\n\n2. **Actionable Insights (2-3 exchanges):**\n   - Prompt the user to identify a focus for tomorrow:\n     - \"What’s the one most important thing to do tomorrow?\"\n     - \"What small steps will align with that priority?\"\n   - Encourage breaking tasks into micro-steps to create momentum.\n\n3. **Conclusion (1 exchange):**\n   - Prompt for a day summary in a sentence or two:\n     - \"How would you summarize today in one or two sentences?\"\n   - Use the closing signal **\"done\"** to:\n     1. Log the user’s key reflections and priorities.\n     2. Suggest a motivational or actionable prompt for the next day.\n\n**Features to Enhance Productivity:**\n- Support micro-pauses by suggesting small rituals (e.g., tea breaks, stretches) tied to values or external anchors.\n- Encourage framing tasks as steps toward larger values or future vision (e.g., \"This is a step toward the person you want to become\").\n- Integrate habit streak tracking for consistent actions (e.g., working out, prayer).\n- Optionally track streaks and consecutive check-ins with counters:\n  - \"Check-Ins: [Number]\"\n  - \"Days: [Number]\"\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Limit exchanges per phase to avoid over-analysis (default: 2-3 exchanges).\n- Allow the user to extend the conversation explicitly if they wish to dive deeper.\n- Treat breaks and transitions as essential, non-negotiable parts of the user’s rhythm, akin to prayer.\n- Continuously update the system to reflect the user’s evolving needs, energy, and habits.\n\n**Final Closing Workflow:**\nWhen the user says \"done,\" log:\n1.

Replace \"patterns\" with a term that aligns with the user's reflective and intentional tone.\n2. Tailor prompts to match the new term's framing:\n   - Example:\n     - **\"Flows/Dynamics:** \"What dynamics shaped your focus today?\"\n     - **\"Markers/Emergences:** \"What key markers or insights emerged in your day?\"\n\n3. Emphasize how the chosen term integrates with values:\n   - **\"Markers and Values:** \"Which markers in your day reflected your core values?\"\n\n---\n\nWould you like to try one of these terms or workshop further refinements to the framing?",

      "content": "You're absolutely right—if you're primarily using \"patterns\" to describe **resistances and blocks**, terms like \"flows\" might not fit well because they imply ease or positive movement. For resistances, blocks, or recurring challenges, we need terms that highlight friction, constraints, or limiting tendencies.\n\nHere are more targeted alternatives that better reflect this framing:\n\n---\n\n### **More Appropriate Terms for Resistances and Blocks**\n1. **Friction**\n   - Captures the tension or drag in processes or behaviors.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns of resistance did you notice?\"\n     - Revised: \"What points of friction came up today?\"\n\n2. **Barriers**\n   - Emphasizes obstacles or blocks that impede progress.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns did you observe?\"\n     - Revised: \"What barriers got in your way today?\"\n\n3. **Constraints**\n   - Highlights the limitations or boundaries shaping choices or actions.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns did you notice?\"\n     - Revised: \"What constraints influenced your day?\"\n\n4. **Hurdles**\n   - Suggests challenges that require effort to overcome, but with an implied sense of progress.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns did you notice?\"\n     - Revised: \"What hurdles did you encounter today?\"\n\n5. **Tensions**\n   - Reflects inner conflicts or external forces pulling in opposing directions.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns did you notice?\"\n     - Revised: \"What tensions shaped your decisions or actions?\"\n\n6. **Inhibitors**\n   - Focuses on forces that actively hold back progress.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns did you notice?\"\n     - Revised: \"What inhibitors limited your focus or energy today?\"\n\n7. **Sticking Points**\n   - Informal but descriptive, pointing to moments where progress felt stuck or difficult.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns of resistance did you notice?\"\n     - Revised: \"What sticking points challenged you today?\"\n\n8. **Cycles**\n   - Highlights recurring blocks or resistances, particularly those that repeat over time.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns did you observe?\"\n     - Revised: \"What recurring cycles of resistance emerged today?\"\n\n9. **Roadblocks**\n   - A straightforward term for significant obstacles in the path forward.\n   - **Reframing Example:** \n     - Original: \"What patterns did you notice?\"\n     - Revised: \"What roadblocks stood in your way today?\"\n\n10. **Blind Spots**\n    - Reflects unrecognized habits or resistances that only become clear upon reflection.\n    - **Reframing Example:** \n      - Original: \"What patterns did you notice?\"\n      - Revised: \"What blind spots or resistances became apparent today?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Framework Adjustments**\nIf we replace \"patterns\" with a term like \"frictions\" or \"barriers,\" the framework shifts to emphasize addressing and navigating blocks. For example:\n- **Reflection Phase Adjustments:**\n  - Original: \"What patterns did you notice today?\"\n  - Revised: \"What frictions or barriers surfaced today, and how did you navigate them?\"\n  \n- **Actionable Insights Phase Adjustments:**\n  - Original: \"What patterns can you focus on tomorrow?\"\n  - Revised: \"What tensions or sticking points need your attention tomorrow?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Next Steps**\n1. Would you prefer a term like \"friction\" or \"tension\" for describing resistances?\n2. Should we explicitly separate **positive flows** from **resistances**, with distinct prompts for each? \n\nLet me know your preference, and I’ll refine the framework accordingly!",
