What’s needed is an\nunderstanding of how LLMs work, particularly the idea of traveling through vector spaces. Once\nyou digest that intuition, you will be able to learn the things you didn’t even know you needed to\nlearn. And then you will be able to do the things you didn’t know you needed to do or how to do\nthem.\nOver hundreds of hours of GPT use since last December, we’ve built this intuition. Now we’re\nsharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while\ndeveloping their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results.\nThis is how you learn prompting.\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire,\nBroaden/contract, Explain, Recurse) and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent\nresults from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions.\nLet’s ease in with a simplified explanation as if you were five years old.\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R Like You’re Five\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\n● \nSet Sail on an Adventure with Your Navigator's Talking Map!\n● \nWelcome to a world of discovery and imagination! On this journey, you're not just wandering; you're an\nintrepid navigator with an extraordinary companion – a talking map. This map is no ordinary paper; it's\nalive with knowledge and adventure!\n● \nYour Interactive Guide: The talking map knows about every nook and cranny of the world. It doesn't just\nshow you places; it talks about them, suggests where to explore, and helps you think of questions about\nunknown corners of the world.\n● \nJourney Across the Map: As you travel with your map, it might say, \"Have you ever wondered what lies\nbeyond that mountain range?\" even when you don’t know there is a mountain range, because it has a\nmaps eye view :D or \"Let's explore what's inside the belly of a fish at the bottom of the ocean!\" It's\nalways ready to take you to new places and open up worlds you have yet to think to discover.\n\n● \nThe Power of Curiosity: Your map's magic lies in its ability to spark your curiosity. Every new place it\npoints out and every question it suggests is like unlocking a hidden treasure of knowledge. It\nencourages you to think, explore, and learn about things far beyond the ordinary.\n● \nNavigating the Unknown: Remember, with your talking map, you're the navigator of your adventure. It's\nthere to guide you, show you hidden paths, and inspire you to ask questions and find answers.\n● \nReady to Discover Hidden Treasures? So, grab your navigator's talking map, and let's embark on a\njourney of discovery and learning. Who knows what wonders we'll uncover together!\nEmbark on an Epic Quest with Your Map of Everything!\nWelcome to a world brimming with endless possibilities! Imagine you're starting a grand\nadventure with two special maps in your hands. The first is your \"map of something\" – it's a map of\nwhat you already know, like your neighborhood, your favorite park, or the subjects you've learned in\nschool. The second is a truly magical map, the \"map of everything,\" and it knows every secret and\nwonder in the world.\nYour Map and the Map of Everything: Your map might show where you live, where your school is,\nor where you've been on vacation. It's familiar and comfortable. But the \"map of everything\" is\ndifferent. It's like a guide that knows all the places you've never seen or even imagined. When you\ntell this map about the places on your personal map, it starts to create paths to new, incredible\ndestinations.\nJourney Beyond the Known: Think of your \"map of everything\" as a magical companion. Once you\nshare with it where you are on your \"map of something,\" it begins to light up paths to extraordinary\nplaces. It could reveal a path from your backyard to a jungle full of talking animals, or from your\nclassroom to a castle in the clouds!\nDiscovering New Worlds Together: Your \"map of everything\" doesn't just take you to new places; it\nalso asks you questions and suggests adventures. It might ask, \"Do you want to see where the\ndinosaurs lived?\" or suggest, \"Let's find out what's at the edge of the universe!\" With every question\nand suggestion, it helps you explore worlds beyond your wildest dreams.\nYour Adventure Awaits: With these two maps, you're not just an explorer – you're a master\nnavigator of knowledge and imagination. The \"map of everything\" guides you to the unknown, to\nhelp you discover and learn about amazing things you've never even thought about.\nAre You Ready to Explore the Unknown? Grab your \"map of something\" and join hands with your\n\"map of everything.\" Let's set off on a journey of endless discovery, where each step takes you to a\nnew world of wonder and excitement!\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and\nsome find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there,\nyet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you\nmove around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you\nthat you “can’t see.”\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you.\nWe developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to\nteach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t\neven know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the\nworld.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\n● \nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\n● \nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\n● \nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\n● \nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\n● \nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\n● \nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\n● \nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\n1. \nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\n2. \nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\n3. \nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can\nemerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on\nthe principles. It is what matters in the end.\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list.\nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a\nmindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought.\n\nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up\nrecipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are.\nIt’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge.\nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n📙\nWay of Being\n❤\nTechnique\n🤲\nPrinciple\n🧠\nSeek \nInquisitive and\nOpen-minded\nAsking questions like:\n“Who would know how to\nanswer this question, what\nis their job?” and\n“What guidelines would\nthey follow?”\n“What would Steve Jobs\nsay in response to this\nquestion?”\n(The more information and\nthe more specific you make\nit, the better.\nExploration:\nGet the AI to show you what\nyou don’t know by giving it as\nmuch as you know and then\nasking what you’re missing.\nUse AI to explore various\n'neighborhoods' of\nknowledge\nCritique \nReceptive to\nFeedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for\ncritiques from a persona\nwho will disagree.\nFor instance, if you’re a\ngrant writer, ask for a review\nfrom a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and\nintegrating feedback to refine\nideas and approaches.\nReflect \nThoughtfully\nCritical\nGenerate “worksheets” to\nfill for yourself.

Once you\npick your template, ask it to\nask you questions to fill in a\ntemplate for your topic.\nTHEN review it and reflect\non it on your own with a\npencil/paper.\nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think\nwith paper. Let the LLM get\nyou close and then walk the\nrest of the way to develop\ncritical thinking and depth in\nunderstanding through\nreflective practices.\nInquire \nCurious and\nrigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its\nreasoning process. Ask it to\nsummarize the critique and\nexplain why the grant\nreviewer thinks that way. To\nAI Transparency:\nAsk the LLM to explain itself\nso YOU can catch the\nmistakes. This is also why\nyou should break down each\n\nmove step by step and keep\nprompts small.\nmajor step into its own\nprompt.\nBroaden /\nContract \nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X\nnumber of diverse and\nnon-overlapping options to\nyour question. Ask it to\ncritique them and ask you\nquestions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand\noptions into the\nneighborhood’s unknown\nspace can help you pick the\nnon-obvious best option.\nExplain \nInquisitive\nChallenger\nAI is the devil's advocate\nand asks probing\nquestions. Another\ntechnique is to ask for a\npanel of diverse experts\nand ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out\nwhere you can be wrong. Ask\nit to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse No self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it…\nSimple example, you’re a\nMcKinsey consultant this is\nour first session, and my\nbusiness is running out of\nrunway and I need help.

Iterate on your questions based on the LLM's responses to dive deeper.\n8. Reflect on the LLM's insights and consider how they apply to your work.\n9. Break down complex topics into smaller, focused prompts for the LLM.\n10. Summarize key takeaways from the LLM's responses to solidify your learning.\n\nLLM Prompt Candies:\n1. Seek: \"Explore this topic from [X] different angles or perspectives.\"\n2. Critique: \"Provide constructive criticism on my ideas, focusing on [X] aspects.\"\n3.

            "text": " Here are 10 clear and practical techniques a human should use when talking to the LLM to implement the SCRIBER framework, along with 10 \"prompt candies\" the LLM should have in its context window:\n\nHuman Techniques:\n1. Ask the LLM to explore different angles and perspectives on the topic.\n2. Request constructive criticism from the LLM on your ideas and assumptions.\n3. Engage in a back-and-forth dialogue with the LLM to refine your understanding.\n4. Prompt the LLM to ask you probing questions about the subject matter.\n5. Encourage the LLM to provide diverse viewpoints and alternative approaches.\n6. Seek clarity on the LLM's reasoning and thought process.\n7. Iterate on your questions based on the LLM's responses to dive deeper.\n8. Reflect on the LLM's insights and consider how they apply to your work.\n9. Break down complex topics into smaller, focused prompts for the LLM.\n10. Summarize key takeaways from the LLM's responses to solidify your learning.\n\nLLM Prompt Candies:\n1. Seek: \"Explore this topic from [X] different angles or perspectives.\"\n2. Critique: \"Provide constructive criticism on my ideas, focusing on [X] aspects.\"\n3. Reflect: \"What are the key takeaways and insights from our discussion so far?\"\n4. Inquire: \"Ask me 3 probing questions to deepen my understanding of [topic].\"\n5. Broaden/Contract: \"Present [X] diverse viewpoints or approaches to this problem.\"\n6. Explain: \"Clarify your reasoning and thought process behind this recommendation.\"\n7. Recurse: \"Based on my response, what additional questions should I consider?\"\n8. Seek + Inquire: \"What are some unexplored areas or questions related to [topic]?\"\n9. Reflect + Critique: \"Reflect on our discussion and provide constructive feedback.\"\n10. Broaden/Contract + Explain: \"Compare these [X] options and explain their pros and cons.\"\n\nBy incorporating these techniques and prompt candies into the human-LLM interaction, both parties can effectively implement the SCRIBER framework to enhance learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving. The human techniques encourage active engagement and reflection, while the LLM prompt candies guide the AI to provide targeted insights and facilitate deeper exploration of the subject matter.",

List 10 of their ideas, critique them, and pick 3 that are meaningful.\" | Encourage learners to step into different personas to expand their thinking and make learning more relatable. | Quality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis. | Difficulty in formulating deep, meaningful questions and relating to unfamiliar personas. | Inquiry Skills Rating Scale |\n| Critique | Problem-Based Learning | Request constructive criticism from the LLM on your ideas and assumptions. | Provide constructive criticism from the perspective of a relevant persona. | \"If Steve Jobs was going to warn me about something given my product development plan, what would he say in a private 1-1 meeting?\" | Use personas to offer constructive feedback and help learners identify potential challenges from different viewpoints. | Processes and critical analysis in problem-solving. | Resistance to feedback and critical analysis, especially from unfamiliar personas. | Problem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nBy differentiating between AI techniques and prompt candies, refining the Seek component, incorporating personas, addressing personal and relational aspects, and adding new elements to the framework, I believe this updated table better captures the essence of transformational learning through the combined SCRIBER and INSPIRE frameworks. The inclusion of personas and relational learning makes the experience more engaging, intuitive, and meaningful for learners.",

For instance if you ask it to help you improve your product it can identify relevant framework and methodologies like a persona map and bug tracker and online tools for product improvements and it can ask have you considered using these techniques. You can ask me about any of them and I'll ask you questions to guide you in filling out the first draft of this template\n\ncorrections for reflect: That will then lead them to the next step, the getting to the boundary edge is with all the tools.
