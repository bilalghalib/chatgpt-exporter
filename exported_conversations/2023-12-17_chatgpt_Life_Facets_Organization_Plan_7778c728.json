I have ADD, I'm a bit of a chaotic person, you can look me up, I'm Bilal Ghalib, B-I-L-A-L G-H-A-L-I-B. You can see I've done a million projects, but I kind of bounce all over the map, and the last few years I've been working mostly on Bloom.pm, a software that lets you run virtual accelerators and running virtual accelerators in the Middle East, and I just took a break to be with my child, and my dad always tells me that, you know, he wishes that he spent more time with us as a kid, but I'm finding that, as when we were kids, but I'm finding that I'm not really able to manage my time well, and I'm here trying to take care of my wife, and I have a two-month-old baby, and life is crazy, and I'm going all back and forth, I'm trying to get Christmas gifts, while trying to find a job, while trying to plan things, and I'm cooking stuff, while I should also be doing stuff in the basement to prepare some Christmas gifts, while all this stuff, so could you help me clarify my mind, and maybe you can tell me what you suggest in terms of, like a professional coach, or something like that, that can help me make some good progress, and feel confident in my life, and get my wife to stop yelling at me about being messy, and so that I could actually bring in two thousand dollars a month into the house, because right now I'm not even making any money at all, and I feel like I'm floundering, I'm splashing, and I'm exhausted, I'm taking my, finally I got a prescription for some psychiatry medications to treat my ADD, but I'm not really sure it's working, I think you can tell from my conversation right now, it's really all over the place, but can you help guide me step by step from this kind of chaotic jumble to something where I have a plan for the day?",

      "content": "Hi Bilal, it sounds like you're juggling a lot right now. With everything from family responsibilities to work and personal health, it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let's try to break this down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, focusing on time management and prioritization could really help. Have you tried any specific methods or tools for organizing your tasks and time? For instance, some people find the Eisenhower Box or the Pomodoro Technique helpful. These can bring structure to your day and make it easier to focus on one thing at a time.\n\nRegarding professional coaching, a life coach or a productivity coach might be beneficial. They can offer personalized advice and strategies based on your unique situation. It's important to find someone who understands the challenges of ADD and can work with you accordingly.\n\nFinancial stability is also key. You mentioned needing to bring in income. Perhaps we can explore some job opportunities or freelance work that aligns with your skills and experiences from your past projects, including your work with Bloom.pm.\n\nLastly, it's great that you're seeking medical advice for ADD. Medications can be hit or miss, and it often takes time to find what works best for you. Have you discussed your concerns about the effectiveness of your current medication with your psychiatrist?\n\nTo start, how about we focus on the most immediate tasks, like planning for Christmas and job searching? We can create a simple plan for today or this week. What are the top three things you need to accomplish?",

      "content": "Okay, thank you. That was not what I was expecting. I was really hoping that you could ask me step by step and walk me through perhaps the to-do list in my mind so I can download it all and get it out of my head, and then maybe ask me questions about the Eisenhower matrix or other sorts of productivity or time management, time planning things. I have a problem where once I start something, I get really engrossed in it and I have a hard time switching tasks, which means that I have a real difficulty doing more than one thing at a time. But life is more than one thing, and also at the same time I need to rest more whenever the baby sleeps, but I can't because I get really sucked into rabbit holes and I don't know how to disconnect. And so I would like some way of really just feeling like I'm on top of things. All the things that I want to do will be done. All my curiosities are not going away. They're all stored somewhere. Maybe you can store some files for me with all of these things designed in like a mind map so that I can look back at it and say, okay, thank God everything is taken care of. It's all organized. I don't have to do it all right now. Someone is helping me see all of this and make sure that it's covered and that today the only thing that I can do and I can get really deeply absorbed in is this, and that's fine. And once I'm done and it's time to sleep, I can put it away because I know that I did the one thing that I need to do today. And if I look at the mind map or if I look at the tool, whatever it is that you suggest with all of this stuff saved in a file that I can download or look on my phone somehow, it would be great to know that it's all taken care of and I'm okay. Maybe you can make a file in Python so that it could be an image that I can screenshot and save on my phone of the mind map or something like that.",

      "content": "Absolutely, Bilal. Let's start by creating a mind map to organize your thoughts and tasks. We'll break it down into categories and prioritize them. You can just tell me everything that's on your mind, and I'll help sort it out. We can categorize them into different areas like family, work, personal projects, health, and so on.\n\nFor each category, you can mention the tasks or thoughts related to it. Once we have everything listed, we can use the Eisenhower Box method to prioritize. This method divides tasks into four categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important. This will help us identify what needs immediate attention, what can be scheduled for later, what can be delegated, and what might be unnecessary.\n\nRegarding your difficulty in switching tasks and getting absorbed in one thing, we can also discuss strategies for that. For example, setting specific time limits for each task might help you transition more easily between them.\n\nSo, let's start with the mind map. What are the main categories we should include? And under each category, what specific tasks or thoughts do you want to list?",

      "content": "Understanding the tax situation, especially when it involves two countries like France and the United States, is crucial for effective financial planning. Let's dive into the key points regarding your tax situation as an expat in France and the requirements for U.S. citizens.\n\n### French Tax System for Expats\n1. **General Tax Returns**: As a resident in France, you're required to file a tax return. If you've filed before, you might receive a pre-filled form to review and amend. Otherwise, you can obtain the form from your local tax office or online. The deadlines for 2023 tax returns are staggered in May and June, depending on various factors【13†source】.\n\n2. **Tax on Different Incomes**: In France, investment income, capital gains from financial investments, real estate, and non-French income are exceptions to the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system【13†source】.\n\n3. **Self-Employed Taxation**: If you're a solo freelancer, you fall under the micro-entrepreneur tax status, simplifying your tax and accounting requirements. However, larger businesses have different tax regimes【13†source】.\n\n4. **Property and Wealth Tax**: France has specific taxes on property and wealth, with different rates and conditions based on your residency status and the value of your assets【13†source】.\n\n### U.S. Tax Requirements\nAs a U.S. citizen or Green Card holder, you're required to file tax returns with the IRS, regardless of where you live. There are various forms and filing requirements, which can be complex, especially when involving foreign income or assets【12†source】.\n\n### Comparing Tax Rates: France vs. U.S.\n- **French Tax Rates**: For salaries, the after-tax amount varies significantly depending on the gross salary. For example, a €28,000 salary results in approximately 31.8% tax rate, while a €113,000 salary faces about a 59.4% rate.\n- **U.S. Tax Rates**: These depend on the state, with New York used as a high-tax example. Here, the tax rates range from 20.3% for lower incomes to 34.2% for higher incomes.\n\nA critical difference between the two countries is how social contributions are handled. In France, social contributions for benefits like healthcare, retirement, and unemployment insurance are included in the tax rates. In contrast, in the U.S., these are often separate expenses【14†source】.\n\n### Next Steps for Tax Planning\n1. **Determine Your Residency Status**: This will affect your tax obligations in both countries.\n2. **Understand Dual Taxation Rules**: There are treaties and credits to prevent dual taxation, but it's essential to know how they apply to your situation.\n3. **Seek Professional Advice**: Given the complexity, especially with your dual residency, consulting with a tax professional experienced in expat taxation might be beneficial. They can help navigate both French and U.S. tax systems and advise on moving money and managing assets in light of tax implications.\n\nBy addressing these tax concerns systematically, you can better plan and manage your finances while complying with the tax requirements of both countries.",

I'm trying to find gifts for her mom, her dad, and her brother, and her and my baby. And I would like to keep it low cost and do it by hand. You can ask me for each individual one. I can tell you right now, actually. So, for Josephine, I wanted to make her a bird feeder that has a camera in it using my iPhone as the computer and Wi-Fi enabled device so that she can see pictures of birds coming to the bird feeder. For her mom, I wanted to do something similar, but with her iPad, to send a picture a day of the new baby that we have over to her house. For the baby, I got him a picture book of the city that we're in, but I don't think that's cute enough or thoughtful enough. I'd like to try something else. For her brother, I was thinking about getting a bunch of vegan gifts. Maybe you can give me some options that I can buy online that we'll ship here to France. Or just like, if there's somebody who's a new vegan, what are some gifts I can give him? For my wife, I was thinking about writing her a song, and maybe you can talk with me later about brainstorming some ideas about something. I feel like that's way sweeter than buying her things, and we can try to kind of deal with some of our marital issues in a sweet and cute way in this song. And that's it for Christmas gifts. Tell me if you have any questions. Otherwise, you can add that to the mind map and organize it however you think is most important. And then review it with me at the end with prioritization, and we can do that later.",

      "content": "Okay, and then the other thing I need to do is my dad is coming in like three days, and my dad wants to talk with me about work, and Josephine, my wife, and I are having difficulties because she wants me to bring in some income to the house, and I need to figure out my next steps for work. After having a baby, I stopped working at bloom.pm and kind of focused entirely on being a household person, cleaning a lot, but Josephine is seeing me do a lot of work in the house, and I think she would prefer that I also bring in some money, and so I have some options. I need to spend some time looking up jobs online. Maybe you can give me some links to jobs for social impact, social innovation, places where people might appreciate my background running bloom.pm, previously Fishworthy and GEMSI, the Global Entrepreneurship and Makerspace Initiative, community building and hackerspaces. You can give me some places to apply, that would be awesome, and you can put that directly into the mind map and the to-do list, also with timelines, because Josephine wants me to make progress on that, and I need to do that soon, probably before my dad comes, so I know what options I have, if I'm going to work with my dad only, or work with my dad, and also work with a consulting gig, or if I'm going to do actually more stuff with the foraging, if I'm going to sell this stuff, does it make any sense, is it a waste of my time, how do I know if this foraging stuff is a waste of my time? I also have a small business called Noor Creative Studios, or Noor Co-op online, that usually sells around a thousand dollars of revenue a month, that I felt like I could take and grow the business, but it also is not a water engineering, change the world, big impact project that has a much higher salary, it's more of a way of doing business in a way that I think is beautiful, and cute, and kind of shows leadership, and it's important to me, but I don't know if I should prioritize this business, or prioritize other businesses, so maybe I need to prioritize getting a business consultant, or coach, who can help me look at all of my options, and make some decisions, and maybe it could be you, you could ask me some questions about these different things, or at least put them on the timeline of things to do over the next few months, so that I can figure it out, or even the next three days, because my dad is coming very soon, and I'm supposed to facilitate the conversation with him about work, and working with him, which I'm really not sure about, so I want to figure out if I can design the time together, find a co-working space that I can rent for a week in Lille, maybe that's something you can help me figure out, Lille, France, L-I-L-L-E-F-R-A-N-T-E, that's where I'm living right now, and I would like to be able to not do this at the house, so that the house is peaceful and calm, and I only want to work 11, 4pm, and my dad is also ADD, and kind of crazy like me, so I need to find a way of chilling out, and making it really nice and slow, so that I can work with him.",

      "content": "Given your background and interests in social impact, social innovation, community building, and hackerspaces, there are several job opportunities in France that could align well with your experience. Here's a summary of what I found:\n\n1. **Impactpool.org** lists various job vacancies in France, including positions within international organizations like UNESCO and OECD. These roles range across different levels, from junior to senior executive, and cover diverse areas such as digital communication, environment policies, and financial affairs. This platform seems to offer a broad spectrum of opportunities that could match your skills and interests in social and environmental impact【24†source】.\n\n2. **Mouvement Impact France on jobs.makesense.org** offers a variety of positions within the realm of social and ecological impact. The roles include options like decarbonization expert, CSR manager, impact measurement manager, and data analysis roles in sustainable development. This site seems particularly relevant for someone with your entrepreneurial background and interest in social and ecological transition, as it focuses on roles within companies and organizations dedicated to making a positive impact【25†source】.\n\nAs for your interest in potentially selling the foraged mushrooms or developing Noor Creative Studios, it's crucial to evaluate the scalability and revenue potential of these ventures. Given the urgency of your need to generate income and the limited time before your dad arrives, focusing on job applications might be a more immediate and reliable route to meeting your financial goals. However, exploring the potential of your foraging hobby or Noor Creative Studios as side projects could also be worthwhile.\n\nConsidering your need to facilitate a productive work environment with your dad and manage your time effectively, finding a co-working space in Lille, France, for a short period might be beneficial. It would provide a dedicated space for focused work sessions, helping manage your ADD tendencies and ensuring a calm environment at home.\n\nRemember, each opportunity should be weighed against your immediate need for income, your long-term career goals, and your personal values and interests. A business consultant or coach could indeed provide valuable insights and help you prioritize these various options.\n\nFor the song for your wife, consider focusing on themes that resonate with your relationship, like shared experiences, love, and commitment, perhaps touching upon how you both navigate challenges together in a lighthearted, loving way. This can be a beautiful, personal gift that speaks to your journey together. \n\nWould you like assistance in finding co-working spaces in Lille or more specific job listings?",

      "content": "Creating a mind map or a calendar in Python using libraries like SciPy is an interesting idea, but it's a bit complex and might not give the most visually appealing results. Libraries like SciPy are more focused on scientific computing and might not be the best tool for creating a detailed, visually engaging mind map.\n\nA more user-friendly option could be using a dedicated mind mapping tool or software. There are several available online, both free and paid, that offer great features for visually organizing tasks, ideas, and schedules. Some popular ones include MindMeister, XMind, and Coggle. These tools are specifically designed for creating mind maps and often include options for adding dates and timelines.\n\nIf you're set on using Python, one possibility is using a library like Matplotlib or Plotly for basic visualization. However, these libraries are generally used for plotting graphs and data, so creating a detailed mind map with dates and specific tasks would require a good amount of custom coding.\n\nFor now, I can summarize and organize the tasks we've discussed into a structured format that you can then transfer to a mind mapping tool or visualize using Python. Here's an outline:\n\n1. **Seek Professional Tax Advice**\n   - Deadline: As soon as possible, before the end of the year\n\n2. **Christmas Gifts Preparation**\n   - Josephine: DIY bird feeder with a camera\n   - Josephine's Mom: iPad setup for baby pictures\n   - Baby: Enhanced picture book or a personal gift\n   - Josephine's Brother: Vegan gifts (online order)\n   - Your Wife: Write a song\n   - Deadline: Before December 25th\n\n3. **Dehydrate Mushrooms**\n   - Deadline: Immediate (to prevent spoiling)\n\n4. **Job Search**\n   - Focus: Social impact, social innovation, community building\n   - Deadline: Before your dad's visit in three days\n\n5. **Review Business Options**\n   - Noor Creative Studios vs. new opportunities\n   - Deadline: Discuss with your dad during his visit\n\n6. **Find Co-Working Space in Lille**\n   - Deadline: Before your dad's visit\n\nWould you like to add anything else to this list? Once finalized, you can transfer this to a mind mapping tool for a clearer visual representation.",

So I want you to be very concise, very clear, very organized, and even add quote-unquote colors so that you can say this is a family thing. It is colored orange. That way I can just take it and color it orange if that makes sense. And I'm going to also continue with a couple of the other tasks that I have to do. I think I told you I need to dehydrate the oyster mushrooms that I found today. I also have a bunch of projects that I want to do. I'm making my own refrigerator or fixing the refrigerator in the basement. I want to ask Josephine for the phone number for the repair people so that they can potentially at least give us an estimate on the fridge repair. Or I want to go into the basement and just spend two hours with him but I don't know when to do that because the baby takes all of my time. I also have some other projects that I'm working on with Maryam Chehbani where I want to make a prayer clock and send it to her. I want to work on this Arduino project where I can color the wall so I can see the prayers. Although these are all kind of just fun projects for me. They're probably lower on the priority list but I don't want to forget about them. I want to make that I do them and I want to make sure I'm making progress on them slowly. Maybe I need to just think about making money so I can hire people to help me make those projects. Also I need to have a vision for my life. Maybe that could be an important thing that you can help me with by the end of the year. You can ask me a bunch of questions or give me questions from now until the end of the year that I can ask and answer for myself that I can then give back to you that you can then help me prioritize and say listen this is not going to help you on your mission. You really are just one human being. You need to put aside the idea of programming an Arduino prayer clock. So that's one thing I would like some help with and you can help me think about that and just you know make a calendar. So that's the other thing. You can give me a set of dates and colors for the activities and colons after it with the activity so it's really easy for me to populate into a calendar. And then also I'd like you to just kind of reflect on what I just said. All the different things that I want to do. I have my helium jars that I want to",
