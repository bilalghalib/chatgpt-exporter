We invite you to join the Thriving Together program, focusing on well-being for impact.\n\nIn this program, we find helpful practices that we can teach entrepreneurs and students. If you want to join, fill out an application form and take a well-being assessment at work.\n\nTo be part of the program, complete the assessment and choose an activity. Some people are already in the program with their chosen activities and areas of well-being.\n\nThe TOT will end with a conference in late September where everyone shares their activities. We hope you'll continue your journey with us by sharing what you learn with others in your organization or programs.\n\nWe're also creating a map of Lebanon's entrepreneurship training ecosystem using survey questions about well-being. If you have ideas for improving these questions, please share them so we can improve our survey together!\n\nThank you!",
