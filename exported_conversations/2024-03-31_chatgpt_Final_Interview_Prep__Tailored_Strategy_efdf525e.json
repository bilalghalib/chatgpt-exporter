      "content": "Hello, my name is Josephine. I'm an illustrator with UI and UX experience, working at OnePoint, a digital transformation agency located in Paris. I have moved to Lille, and I'm in the process of interviewing with a company called Ouimaniti. I have my third interview with the business manager of the company, and I'm wondering what kind of questions he might ask me, or what I should prepare for that interview, since it's the third and final of the hiring process. The first interview was with the HR, and she said that she had a crush on me, and it was a really nice interview about who I am and my experience, and also what I would like as a potential designer, working mostly on UX design and some UI design. I also mentioned the fact that I have experience in illustration and graphic facilitation and coaching, that I did a master's in coaching, and that I'm bilingual in English, which is something that they really are interested in. The second interview was with a UX designer who was senior, and she asked me lots of very specific questions on UX tools and methodologies, which I was mostly unfamiliar with, but still our conversation was in my favor, since she gave her validation for the next interview. Here's the context. The business does digital consulting. We design solutions for customers mostly based in northern France. Some of the biggest clients include Decathlon, ADO Group, which includes Leroy Merlin, and big retail groups in general. I would like you to think about the context that I have given you. Write a short synopsis of where we are, and then think step-by-step about how to prepare for this third and final interview. Ask me three follow-up questions that will help you come up with a good plan for me to prepare for this interview.",

      "content": "Hello Josephine! You're in an exciting phase of your interviewing process at Ouimaniti, a digital consulting firm where you've already made a positive impression in your initial interviews. Your background in UI/UX design, illustration, graphic facilitation, and coaching, coupled with your bilingual skills, align well with the company's focus on designing digital solutions for major clients in northern France. \n\nGiven the context, here are three follow-up questions to help tailor your preparation for the final interview:\n\n1. **Understanding the Role and Expectations**: Can you share more details about the specific responsibilities and projects you expect to handle at Ouimaniti? Knowing this can help tailor your preparation to the role's requirements.\n\n2. **Company Insights**: Have you had the chance to learn about Ouimaniti's company culture, values, or recent projects? Insights into their work approach and achievements could be key discussion points.\n\n3. **Feedback from Previous Interviews**: Did you receive any specific feedback or hints about areas of interest or concern from your previous interviews? This could guide us in focusing on particular skills or experiences to emphasize.\n\nYour answers to these questions will provide a solid foundation for a targeted and effective interview preparation strategy.",

      "content": "Okay, so I will answer the questions, and then when I'm done, summarize my answers, and give me a step-by-step plan to prepare for my final interview with a business manager. Question 1. Understanding the role and expectations. I am expected to provide UX service and UI service to customers and to work in full autonomy and to handle communication and presentation of my process and project to the customers and potentially to also work with their team embedded in their business. Second question. Company insights. Have you had the chance to learn about WeManatee culture, values, or recent projects? What is their work approach? WeManatee has won an award as one of the best places to work. Employees have left reviews saying that it's a really nice place to work at for being seen as an individual. There's a great focus on well-being and on feeling integrated in the company. They have many events to help people share and create bonds together. They also have a program for employees who are in between contracts so that they can volunteer for different causes that are mainly about social and environmental impact. So they value kindness, collaboration, care for the world, and care for people. What about projects that they've done? Was I supposed to push something? No, don't push anything. We're not done. Okay, yeah, keep going. What about a recent project? What? Any recent projects that you know they've done? They work with Decathlon. A recent project that they worked on. I know they work with Decathlon, but I'm not aware of a specific project that they worked on. Okay, feedback from the... So now for question three, feedback from previous interviews. The previous interview I did for a UX position was that I was not familiar enough with UX tools and methodologies. And indeed, during my UX interview with Wimaniti, the UX designer said that I am more of a junior UX designer. What's the position role? There is no position role. I am hired based on my profile. So there's no junior, senior? No, there's no requirements per se, because I'm not applying for a position at one of their clients. I would be hired based on my profile to be part of their pool of designers, and they would eventually find me a contract with one of their clients. The previous interviews were the previous interviews with them. What else did they say? They didn't talk to me about specific contracts with companies. So you only remember the previous interviews, them telling you that you're really good at bilingual, that's great, and that you need to work on your UX skills. Anything else they said? That my UI skills are really impressive and that I would do wonderful in advertisements, potentially. ",

      "content": "Thank you for providing detailed responses, Josephine. Here's a summary of your answers:\n\n1. **Role and Expectations**: You'll be providing both UX and UI services, working autonomously, handling communication and project presentations to clients, and potentially integrating with client teams.\n\n2. **Company Culture at Ouimaniti**: Known for being an excellent place to work with a focus on individual recognition, well-being, integration, social, and environmental responsibility. However, you're not familiar with specific recent projects.\n\n3. **Feedback from Previous Interviews**: You've been identified as having strong UI skills and potential for advertising work, but as more junior in UX with a need to familiarize yourself with UX tools and methodologies.\n\nBased on this, here's a step-by-step plan for preparing for your final interview:\n\n### Step 1: Refine Your Presentation Skills\n- **Practice**: Develop a concise way to present your UI/UX process and past projects. Highlight how you've managed client communication and project presentation.\n- **Autonomy and Integration**: Prepare examples where you worked autonomously and times you integrated well into a team or client's business.\n\n### Step 2: Research and Relate to Company Values\n- **Company Values**: Reflect on your experiences or aspirations that align with Ouimaniti’s values like kindness, collaboration, and environmental care.\n- **Community and Well-being**: Think of instances where you contributed to a positive work culture or team bonding, as this seems important to Ouimaniti.\n\n### Step 3: Address Feedback on Skills\n- **UX Development**: Showcase your willingness to learn and improve in UX. Mention any recent learning or projects where you applied UX principles.\n- **UI Strengths**: Emphasize your UI skills and experiences, particularly in advertising, as they were noted positively.\n\n### Step 4: Anticipate Business-Oriented Questions\n- **Client Communication**: Be ready to discuss how you approach client communication, especially in explaining technical aspects to non-technical stakeholders.\n- **Business Impact**: Prepare to discuss how your design work contributes to business goals, such as improving user experience, driving sales, or enhancing brand identity.\n\n### Step 5: Prepare Questions for Them\n- **Inquire about Projects**: Ask about specific projects they've worked on, especially ones involving Decathlon or other key clients, to show interest and understand potential future work.\n- **Role Clarity**: Seek clarification on the expectations and opportunities for growth given your profile and their identification of your junior level in UX.\n\nThis preparation will help you to present a well-rounded view of your capabilities and potential as a valuable addition to Ouimaniti. Good luck!",
