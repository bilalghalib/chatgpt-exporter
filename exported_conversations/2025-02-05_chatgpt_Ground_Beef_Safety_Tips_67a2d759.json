If it’s been there since Sunday and today is Wednesday, it’s on the edge or potentially past the recommended window.\n\nIf you’re unsure, here are a few tips:\n\n1. **Check the color and smell**: Fresh ground beef is typically red on the outside (with a possible brownish color on the inside). If it has turned grayish-brown all over or developed a sour or off odor, it’s likely spoiled.  \n2. **Check the texture**: If the beef feels sticky, tacky, or slimy, it’s another sign it might have gone bad.  \n3. **When in doubt, throw it out**: Foodborne illness is no fun, so if there’s any question about safety, it’s better to discard it.\n\nNext time, if you’re not going to cook ground beef within a day or two, freezing it right away is usually the safer option.",

Since it’s now Wednesday and you bought it on Sunday, it’s outside the ideal window.\n\nColor alone can be tricky—oxidation can cause the outside to turn darker while the inside stays red. A “musty” smell, even if not strongly sour, can be a warning sign. Ground beef’s texture should be moist but not slimy; a very light slippery feel could be okay, but it’s still on the edge.\n\nIf you’re at all unsure, the safest choice is to throw it out. Cooking doesn’t always eliminate all risks if the beef has truly begun to spoil. In the future, if you can’t cook it within a couple of days, it’s best to freeze the ground beef right away.",

It’s fairly normal for the outside of ground beef to darken when exposed to air, while the inside remains pink. \n\nHere’s what you might look out for:\n1. **Smell**: Even a slight off or musty odor (not necessarily sour) can indicate spoilage.  \n2. **Texture**: A little moisture isn’t unusual, but if it’s noticeably slimy, that’s a red flag.  \n3. **Timing**: If it’s been over two days in your fridge, you’re in a risk zone.\n\nIf you’re at all uncertain or if something feels off, it’s safest to throw it out. Cooking doesn’t always eliminate all risks if the meat has truly begun to spoil. Next time, if you can’t cook ground beef within 1–2 days, consider freezing it to keep it fresh longer.",
