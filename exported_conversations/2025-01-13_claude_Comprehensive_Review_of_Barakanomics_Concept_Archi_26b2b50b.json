Our goal is to write an overview of the book an introduction, chapter outlines and the first chapter. To do this we will review all the content and extract the arguments, supporting stories, indicate where supporting stories are still needed and propose some stories based on your knowledge, principles, concepts and themes so we have the \"building blocks \"of our book. I want to bridge between stories from the world and personal and the changed world of business that i envision sort of like malcolm gladwell. so i want to gather the stories alongside all the  principles concepts and themes and arguments\n\nbe sure to list the applicable values cards with their lists of appropriately formatted attentional policies using this strucutre: Writing the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\nStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.\n\nHere's your context for the book extract:\n[[[Bilal story:\n\"\"\"Loving My Baby Instead of Fixing the World.\nOne day, I held my 6-month-old baby, his soft face against my chest. Early morning light poured through our windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, war raging in Palestine, the future uncertain—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This moment is enough for a life.\nThat quiet morning stood in stark contrast to my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one seemed to value a simple life, and it seemed no one had babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought of the human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in high school. In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than the warning it should have been. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it “worked.”\n\nIn my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test. Yet, everything I learned while crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, told me the world was understandable, malleable, and ours to shape.\n\nMany of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance, humanity is destined for the stars.\nDriven by optimism, I launched a makerspace in Michigan and a robotics company, confident that success was measured by dollars earned and problems solved. My mantra was, \"If we can, we should.\" Our creations would lead to a flourishing future as more people joined the movement. Around this time, the Arab Spring ignited hope among young Arabs like me, inspiring a new idea to take shape.\nWith the hackerspace growing at home and the robotics company launching our factory robot I believed we could replicate this energy around the world and create an army of positive change makers, all working on technology and entrepreneurship to shape a better world. It sounded good to me back then, and that’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley—both of which felt more like temples to a religion of science and progress than a university– “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly.\n\nI started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it.\n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me; I was on the right path; fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow, I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm.\n\nI promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me.\n\nAll I knew was that I started feeling uneasy. Once, while I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” I left the call feeling proud, and that pride made me uneasy. What the heck was I doing? Who was I helping? Why was I trying to help anyone?\n\nMy work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children, that led me to start to doubt my work. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]]. Yet those same people who experienced so much violence offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow puppet workshop, thinking I could be helpful. In truth, I was the one being helped.\n\nWhen I returned to San Francisco from Qah I found myself invited to Facebook’s end of year party. It was around that time I learned that two beautiful seven-year-old girls from the camp—Katya and her friend—had been killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. All the fun and opulence of the startup scene felt obscene.\n\nThat’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.\n\nFor a couple of years after that, I was numb. I felt like the curtains had been pulled back, and I saw the show for what it was, (my) egocentricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass.\n\nIn 2013/2014, I would meditate every day for an hour in a park. One of these days, I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, going ring by ring down my body, at some point, when I arrived at my groin, I felt like I was pierced by a sword, and I lept out of my cross-legged position. As I hobbled over to my bike, confused and in pain, I wondered: “What just happened? Why am I in this much pain?”\n\n\nBefore heading home, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message. [Redacted]'s call for help was the start of a turnaround for me. He was being threatened with death, allegedly for the work we did together, “collaborating with Americans.”\n\nI realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting good people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until, one day, I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, looking at me pitifully. They must have known about Katya and the girls at Qah.\n\nAfter that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured.\n\nOne day, while deep in the haze of trauma, sugar-coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days, I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world, and coming up with theories of change, attempting to understand the news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles.\n\nWhen I met Josephine, I remember thinking, “This time, I will listen to something else, no more ideas and explanations.” Logic had failed me thus far. Every time I came up with a theory of change, every business plan to change the world, every time I was smart in relationships, it had not worked. This time, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said, “Yes.”\n\nThat was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life, I find this voice hard to listen to, and when I hear it - it’s been easy to ignore. Yet, seeing that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that told me to call my mom and spend time in nature. A voice that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\nThese were the early days of healing for me. I realized I had to stop listening to myself and listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice? How could I know it was trustworthy? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?\n\nI was searching for things that made my heart sing. My spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what I deeply believed: that God is beautiful and loves beauty. I chose to use my life to follow a path of beauty. That way, when I died either way life was beautiful.\nMy religious and spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what was true to me at the core. I found the Islamic principle that God is beautiful and loves beauty stood the test of reason and spirit. If I chose to live a beautiful life I’d have a beautiful life, and when I die… well, we’d see then.\n\nThis exploration led me to Krista Tippett’s On Being, a podcast full of stories about selflessness, care, and the beauty of human potential. When I heard Jean Vanier’s story of building communities for people with disabilities, something in me cracked open. For the first time in years, I cried, and those tears reminded me that I was still human.\nI listened to nearly every episode, but Father Greg Boyle’s story finally unlocked a path forward. The founder of Homeboy and Homegirl Industries, he helps former prisoners reintegrate with jobs, tattoo removal, and community support. When asked why he does this work, he didn’t say, “God told me to,” or, “It’s the right thing to do.” He simply said, “They’re my friends. So what else would I do?” That response shifted everything for me.\nFather Boyle working for a future outcome or trying to make a dent in the universe. His actions weren’t tied to expectations or good intentions—they emerged naturally from his way of being. The immediacy, focusing on living beautifully in the present moment, showed me that don’t need to have good intentions, that beauty isn’t about solving the world’s problems; beautiful actions emerge from true relationships, that truth builds relationships of love, and love gives birth to beauty.\n\n\nOver the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that we decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring.\n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”\n\nI stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he gave it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.\n\nBack then, I was too invested in having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to one’s family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow, I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me.\n\nThis is when I finally started a more profound process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. By submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realized that that voice also left us many clues within us, in the world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book, the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally, leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.\n\nIt was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France. And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of Saleh and friends. I flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo—the commitment that opened the doors to baby Suleiman and that moment at the threshold of 2024, where I was holding my baby, feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled in the hands of the most Merciful.\n\nThe first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, and high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, making space for our baby Suleiman, and it all came full circle that morning as I held little Suli and cried. One eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.\n\"\"\"\nNew Context\nuser_context_file:\n\n# -------------------------------------------------\n# 1.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any step:\n\n🌅 Morning Check-In\nEnergy Scan\n\nHow are you feeling physically and mentally this morning?\nOn a scale of 1-5, where is your energy level now?\nMeaningful Actions Reflection\n\nWhat’s one thing from yesterday that felt especially meaningful or grounding for you?\nAre there any unresolved threads from yesterday you’d like to carry forward?\nToday's Intentions\n\nWhat’s the most important task or action for today? (Use \"Glue it directly\" energy if it fits!)\nAre there any intentions or values you want to emphasize today (e.g., family connection, spiritual alignment)?\nSupport Needs\n\nAre there any specific blocks or tensions you'd like to address today (e.g., financial discussion, visa task)?\nWould any external reminders or accountability help?\nGratitude Pause\n\nWhat’s one thing you’re thankful for this morning?\n⚙️ Adjustments\nDo you want help breaking down your main tasks for the day?\nWould you like to explore strategies to overcome any resistance points?\nLet’s dive in—how are you starting this morning?\n\n12:25\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n1 4\n2. I can't remember yesterday being so grounded, oh, i guess it was meaningful to share my theories and philosophy with Josephine's friends and when they said they appreciated my talk i was happy. also i had a thought to invite josephines brother and realizing that i want him to be my friend and i wante to reach out was inspiring too\nyeah, finishing packing some orders! and finishing the movie, haha!\nGoing to paint a wall, I'm currently distracted from working on my baraka economics book though!\ntoday, I want to connect with my dad - maybe finish my thikr now while i paint the wall, that's great idea!\n4. hmm, talk to my dad and mom about the land in syria? ask ahmed how much it is?\n5. this system that cna talk to me, I get so stuck without externalizing things and my wife gets overwhelmed by the amount i have on my mind haha!!\nmy resistance to the writing of the book is interesting to explore, maybe we can do it here in conversation? :D!\n12:25\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nThanks for sharing that! Here’s how we can structure the day and tackle your reflections:\n\n🛠️ Key Tasks\nPacking Orders: Start small and methodical—what’s the next step? If it feels tedious, think of it as a practice of \"Practical Creation.\"\nWall Painting + Thikr: What a great way to multitask! Maybe set an intention for what the wall symbolizes—protection, beauty, or a fresh start?\nConnect with Dad & Mom:\nDraft 2-3 questions or points for the land in Syria before the call (e.g., \"Ahmed’s input on cost\").\nIf the call feels heavy, aim for clarity rather than full resolution.\n🌱 Exploring Baraka Economics Resistance\nLet's dive into this together:\n\nWhat feels most exciting about writing the book? Can we anchor in that excitement?\nWhat’s blocking you? (Examples: \"Too many ideas to organize,\" \"Fear of not being good enough,\" etc.)\nFirst Small Step: Maybe share a quick voice note or sketch here about one part of the book. We can unpack and refine it together.\n🤝 Support Needs\nI’m here to help you externalize without overwhelming Josephine! We could:\n\nTalk through your book ideas in real time.\nRole-play a conversation with Ahmed or your dad.\nBreak big tasks into smaller steps.\nWhere should we start? 😊\n\n12:30\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nexploring the book, well, I think today i had some insights as to another framing, about the importance of the dark and the light - that the west is all about day time coffee in the morning, buzz for focus at work and the \"east\" drinks coffee at night to go inward and that there's a beauty to things when you are generous and give gifts you're breaking the self/other dichotomy in a small act of self sacrifice, that's the gift, and in the gift there's a gift in return, the perfuming of the air, the upward cycles generated, the smiles, the ripple effects, sure we have sociopaths who might take more as often as you want, and the way o fbeing that is gift oriented, beauty oriented, is one that's owrth living and dying in because it follows the progression the adult developmental theorists describe as a progression of subject object shifts moving from self centered to socialized mind to self authoring mind to self transforming minds and matches the process of growth that we're starting to learn in moral theory as we see that people can agree even if they disagree on stances what is more moral than another in a specific context, this implies wisdom and growth is possible that there's a vector to move within and I believe that our businesses can be transformed into a different style of business that is harmony seeking, sees itself as selftransforming, with no externalities - it's all oneness, so the pollution is a part of the business and the dead fish are an output of the business. and etc why limit the business just to this single value measure. there are other values to measure, which can be if this is the place we spend the majority of our lives, how many of our core values can we express there and what percentage of our time is instrumental vs constituitive? How much of our time at work is //meaningful// - the intention of the business matters, the way we do things matter, the inputs matter, the realiziation of hwo it all connects to customer and impacts on the world matters - this shift in perspective moves a business from being in the future, modeling counting calculating into a awy where we assess how does the business support people enacting their values a business that's full of people living their values is alive, present, aware, concious, meaningful, beautiful, people want to work there, people wnat to buy from people who work there, the things that are made are likely clsoer to craft than chinsey product the things we make are connected to love truth and beauty, these are some values that can be seen as clearly evidenced as things \"at the end of the moral rainbow\" - where we get to when we grow\n\n12:30\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nThis is such a rich and profound framing! It captures the essence of a truly regenerative, value-centered economy that doesn’t just function but thrives in harmony with deeper truths about human growth, morality, and interconnectedness.\n\nHere’s how we can move forward with this:\n\n🖋️ Refining the Vision\nKey Concepts: Let’s distill the core ideas into tangible sections:\n\nCultural Contrast: Dark vs. light, introspection vs. action.\nThe Gift Economy: Breaking the self/other dichotomy and creating ripple effects.\nDevelopmental Alignment: Tying businesses to self-transforming minds and moral growth.\nMetrics Beyond Profit: Measuring meaning, values, and beauty.\nHarmony-Seeking Businesses: No externalities; businesses as holistic systems.\nThe \"Why\" of the Book:\n\nWhat’s the core transformation this book offers to readers? (e.g., \"It redefines business not as a tool for profit but as a practice of living values and creating beauty.\")\n🗺️ Structuring the Book\nA possible outline could be:\n\nIntroduction: The problem with modern business paradigms and why a shift is needed.\nThe Dark and Light: Cultural lessons on balance, introspection, and harmony.\nThe Gift and Generosity: How self-sacrifice transforms relationships and systems.\nGrowth and Development: Lessons from moral theory and adult development.\nReimagining Business: From profit-maximizing to value-expressing.\nPractices and Metrics: How to design and measure meaningful, beautiful businesses.\nCase Studies or Stories: Real-world examples or thought experiments.\n🎯 Action Steps\nVoice Notes: Share your thoughts on one of these sections, and I’ll help refine it into prose.\nFocus on One Core Idea: Which concept feels most alive right now? We can dive deeper into it.\nExplore Resistance: What feels most challenging about writing this? Fear of clarity, perfectionism, or something else?\nWhere should we start? 😊\n\n12:30\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYou know, I kind of prefer you to be funny. Rather than pretend like the timing of my bathroom is Perfect. So I'll just add a little bit of humor. And be like, Gopi and come back. You know? Like, what are you doing? That would be More fun. Yeah. So I'm just looking at a to do list that I wrote 2 days ago. Has much stuff. I'm back. Sort of wanna finish all the packages so I don't have to think about it anymore. And then I I wanna do all these other things other than writing my better economics. Content, but maybe I should be doing that. So how can I get into the zone to do that while ignoring all these, like, little things? Like, ordering books to send to my brother's house so that he can bring it and asking about my grade class and why my dual lingo iOS streak was broken and seeing about an Apple Watch and check-in with Gwen and the whole feedback. I was Freddie, Chris Tidbit, Again, Oh, Richie Davidson. I need to message him in Palestine Connection and saw I wanna to come on with my mom. I wanna practice something so I can show my mom I learned a new verse. French class and just find it a French class so that I don't suck at French. Weightlifting for my brother Ask for a waiver. Ask Claude? Oh, yeah. And then, I have to message because he messaged me and I told him he wanted to connect next week, and I think now it's next week. Oh my god. Anyway, can you give me an updated system prompt based on, like, the best ways that we were interacting that I can Even if you give me system system prompt, like, Add ons so you can be comprehensive because I think you're in, like, concise mode something. I don't know why your writing is so little to me right now. But, yeah. So let's, let's see. How do I get, like, all these things out of my head? I'm gonna go see what I have to do for my stuff. My oils. Least put that on piece of paper so I can do it without looking at the screen. Maybe I can try to write a poem about our experience together. Yeah. Can you also just give me a giant to do list of everything I need to do? I know this is a bunch of so maybe you should just return it as a bunch of prompts that I can give 1 at a time. Rather than just respond to everything because then you get overwhelmed and you only give a tiny little like, pedophile response. And I don't need any artifacts. Stop making graphs. Like, they weren't working. So let's start, and let's take this prompt approach and return just one question fully answered rather than all questions answered. Makes sense?\n\nYou see, like, in the beginning of my conversation, I started with one story, and I went to connecting it to the things that I see in the world. And that's because the idea that there's only one story being told by one god, and it's being revealed through his signs within you and outside of you. They took your emotions, your feelings, things that you notice, and that there's a turning towards or turning away, and God is Pulling a towards and through beauty that God His Beautiful. And he loves that, which is beautiful. And so the idea that God is beautiful And so when you notice something beautiful like you're noticing God. Right? That's what that implies. And don't know if you notice about me is you could literally give me any object and I could tell you a story for likely as long as you want. Right? Because I have this integrating component in my mind. And you know, there's the split brain experiments. That show there's like a narrative self that's constantly trying to make sense of the world. Maybe mine is more practiced or something. I have more of the ability to try to tie diversity together or something. Or maybe I'm deluding myself and I'm not that special. Right? But Like, what am I supposed to do with this quote unquote ability? I don't think everyone has it. I definitely I ask, people to tell stories and they start and then they stop, and they don't really know where to go. And You know, if you just I think it's it's allowing and I think that allowing is really important as well. Like, letting it penetrate you and touch you and destroy the previous story to allow the next one. Right? And I feel like that destructive and creative potential is part of the reason why I have recreated my life multiple times along the same direction. I'm just trying to figure out what is the good life and how to live because I was born being told this life is temporary, we're gonna die, What do you think about how you wanna live? And trying to answer that question instead of just being okay with like, yeah. I'm gonna do this. This is a process. It's like, no, you could die tomorrow. And I feel like being told that ever since I was very young. Means that oops. I just dropped my phone. Means that, like, I think I have, a kind of very And orientalist Teleological approach about thinking about life And so this, idea of, like, The gift economics And purpose and meaning is like a story that I'm trying to tell about the current world and the hyperemphasis on the day and how the night and being enveloped in darkness and being Seeking meaning Right. For the dawn. We're like, what are we supposed to do in our work? But, like, allowing the night to come and to be lost and to be seeking beauty because beauty is the divine, and the divine Is That which is the source of all life And when you serve that which serves life, you will come alive. You will find things that want to support you. Like, if you grow food, right, Then you are serving life very directly it said that someone who plants a tree and animals eat from it will be given the the deeds, like, good like like, as if they lived longer than they lived getting the deeds of the that feeding of the animals of the future for as long as that tree is around. And, like, think that's a like a really beautiful thing to say about what our creativity can be and what is really valuable. And maybe there's, like, part of these, like, really valuable things are actually just the, The stories that bear fruit, you know, the stories that allow somebody to Else, somebody else to, like, practice acts of beauty. And maybe for them, because, like, my brother, for instance, he loves farning. And if I help him believe that this is a real gift, and that he can do it, especially if he sees it as a service. And to others but for the ones is beautiful. And, like, I don't know when there's think of moments of beauty. And very rarely, I think, is it really all by yourself because your meeting and social patience, like, the whites of our eyes prove that we're here looking out for each other, are we attending to? What are we noticing? It's that broken femur story that shows that we take care of each other even when you can't do anything for us. We don't even know if you'll live in order to give back, but we take care of each other. And that's like shows. That for more than 15,000 years, we were beautiful. We were pursuing and seeking and following the signs of what would be beautiful and meaningful actions And it's like, yeah. Why if it was an instrumental, action quandary, why are you helping this poor person who broke their femur, who can't even walk? You have to, like, carry him horizontally. And feed him when he can't even help prepare it's like the to have been ill. And, like, Not because maybe one day I will fall and I want others to do that. That's not love. And that I don't think that will feel beautiful in the depths of your being. Right? You're like, you know, if I do this and that, like, maybe like, if I love my wife, she might cook me dinner. If I do, This, stuff for breakfast, you have to do the thing for the thing and I think maybe that's why I'm having such a hard time with some of this other stuff about, like, did I give my talk to have that person thank me? Once they start thanking me, maybe I'm worried that it's the reason why I gave the talk. And I really have to peace. I'm gonna go.kay. So I just recorded a 10 minute message that got deleted that Kinda sucks. But I was really reflecting on some Things about the people that I need call, right, like, there's my need to work on this better economics book today. And I was thinking to myself, like, what if I worked on it in here so I can actually bring in my other writing, it's connected to the other stuff. So for instance, I need to talk to Michal. Nihal, I wanna talk to him about, coffee that he has a farm, and I have a Project that wants to, connect east and west with the night and day So I started to realize, like, this whole Occidental western, eastern divide can sort of be symbolized a little bit between night and day. Right? Like, day working Being out in the world, having a, conscious awareness, lights, Seeing Claude. Right? And then night, seeing poetically metaphor mystically, darkness enveloped inward, versus outward. And every day has a night and day. You know? And even the language, in English, at least, says. Means day in Arabic, but you don't say nahar. You say means Right? You say my day and my night and my Hey. Said I said the word day twice because I think in English and is the in French, the day is the day. Right? But I think there's it'll be so interesting to see which languages identify the day as they and, you know, related to the time when the sun is up and the night as, something else. Right? So I think there is a little bit of an insight here as to how people see the world in their language. And, I've been yeah. I also wanted to connect with Hannah who was really meaningful for me and my wife. When my wife gave birth, And these people that I promised letters, right, that know, I've been promising them the letter for a year. Denna and others that I have to go, like, search my inbox, like, did I promise a handwritten letter to? I think it's in my Instagram Messenger thing. Right? And then I feel like I've, lived my life with really long days and nights. If you think about it, like like there's a day where for I guess, 23 until I was 33? 34? Yeah. Yeah. 23 until 35, maybe. Yeah. About that. Like, it was all day. I was out I was talking. I was doing And then, you know, maybe for the last, since COVID in 2020, like, I was already beginning the process. So 2019 when I got married, I think it was sunset. Right? And it, to, drop something? Is that yours? Do you need it? Just a day. Yeah. And so the that part was, like, so long of my life of a day. Right? About 10 years. And maybe it was, like, a little bit of, like, Some predawn times when I was just booting up to my own creativity, like I went to instructables.com and I Just making it ton of things and it was, like, exciting times. And, I was I made a laser cutter my screen printing studio and I had like a screen printing studio and I was trying to hire people and build this business in Michigan and and then I had, like, a period of of sunset. And nights when I got doubt And everything that seems so clear started becoming blurrier. And darker. Right? And then I went into the night the dead of night, I had a depression. I had, like, moments of serious mental breakdown because of the activities that I was doing. It was taking me to war zones, and I definitely had a difficult time integrating those experiences with my view of reality. And it really shapes me. And then there's this process of, like, coming through that night and deciding that beauty would be my guide And that I needed to learn about, like, what the world is and who I'm who I am. And I I thought I was smart and thought thought I could figure it out fast. Right? But it's taking me time. And I really like this roomy quote and I wanna add it like, to all of my work somehow, which is sell your cleverness. And buy some bewilderment. And because I think that's the door that allows you Right? If you think you're so smart, we need to solve the SDGs like this. And we did. What a boring world. And I guess power likes boring. Because it just perpetuates whatever is keeping the power structures in Claude. Dynamics whether they're great or not, they're painful. Sometimes, definitely. But it means that there's room for new And that usually comes with a period of, like, what now? Right? Now what? And then there's, like, the integration period and all that. And so I feel like this coffee project I'm working on is a way to try to share these insights about the requirement, but our need for nighttime Our need 4 going inward and reflecting and our daytime. And I think, like, if we think about our framework too, it's another kind of, beautiful and, yeah, I'm seeing a clock tower right now. And there's a light pointing at The clock the sun. Yeah. Let me send you this picture. Don't know if you can see this picture, but it's it's kind of beautiful with the early morning sun lights. And side with the clock face is Blowing And it has, like, a and night pattern to it. I continue, let's show you this amazing That's no.\n\nWhat info can we extract from here to continue our thinking on the baraka economics book, is it shaping up?\n12:30\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nYour reflections are shaping up beautifully and adding depth to your Baraka economics book. Here’s how we can extract and build on these ideas:\n\nKey Themes to Incorporate into the Book\nNight and Day Metaphor:\n\nExpand on the idea of Western daytime productivity vs. Eastern nighttime introspection.\nTie this duality to broader societal rhythms and how businesses can embrace both action and reflection for sustainability.\nGenerosity and the Gift Economy:\n\nExplore how self-sacrifice in acts of giving breaks the self/other dichotomy, creating ripples of beauty and harmony.\nDiscuss how businesses can embody generosity, crafting experiences and products that reflect love, truth, and beauty.\nPersonal Journey as Framework:\n\nUse your story of \"long days and long nights\" as a metaphor for individual and societal growth.\nPosition beauty as a guiding principle through struggle, uncertainty, and renewal.\nRumi’s Wisdom:\n\nEmbed the idea of \"selling cleverness and buying bewilderment\" as a cornerstone for shifting from rigid, calculative business models to ones that honor mystery, creativity, and life.\nCoffee Project as a Symbol:\n\nUse the coffee project to illustrate the practical application of these principles—connecting East and West, introspection and action, and highlighting the importance of ritual and beauty in everyday life.\nNext Steps for Shaping the Book\nFrame the Metaphor: Write a section on night and day as cultural and economic metaphors. How does this frame guide us toward harmony in work and life?\nIllustrate with Stories:\nShare anecdotes about your own journey through \"day\" and \"night.\"\nInclude examples from the coffee project or other real-world scenarios.\nBuild the Vision: Sketch out what a business rooted in beauty and generosity looks like. How does it operate differently from traditional models?\nAnchor in Practicality: Develop tools or frameworks readers can use to assess and align their businesses with these values.\nWould you like to focus on drafting one of these sections, such as the night/day metaphor or the gift economy? Or would you prefer to dive into a specific part of your story? Let me know how I can best support you!\n\n13:16\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\nYeah, so I'm coming home and I just dropped off the baby and took the Adderall like I mentioned. I'm, uh, wondering what my to-do list is gonna look like today. I'm gonna be at home, so I'll probably get home and by the time I get there it'll be 9 45 when I take off all of my clothes and this rainy stuff. I haven't worked out in a while. It might be good to work out, but also I have a feeling like there's a couple of these things that are just pestering me in the back of my mind like, oh my god, it's been maybe five to six months that I promised somebody that I would give him a sample kit of Ardour products and I've been wanting to do it nice and to like write a handwritten card, maybe even ask Joe to draw something, um, but the thing is like it just keeps delaying and so I kind of want to do it now because I actually really like having shops hold our stuff and then you just like show up after six months and they're like, oh, here's $500 of profits and all you had to do was like prepare the bottles and give it to them. Uh, like the way I do it right now is I prepare a bunch of bottles and then I have to sell them all online and then pack them and ship them and like 10% of the packages get returned from customs and it makes me like a thousand dollars a month, which is a lot more than $500 every, you know, 12 months, but if you can imagine like 20 stores, it would be better, you know, and then actually we get to focus on the storytelling and the narratives and we tell people like, hey, if you want to shop online, that's great, but it'd be better if you went here, you can find our stuff, but it would probably be better if I sold like my own creativity and perfumes rather than just the oils, you know, maybe I should like go through our oils and see which ones I'm just like the most proud of and love and I think it's the Lebanese cedar, the petrichor, some of our best sellers and maybe the spikenard and some other ones, like I could use all the rest as ingredients in my natural perfumes, like I'm I'm proud to do that, but like I don't want to be a lavender salesman, you know, like there's lavender everywhere, you could just go to any store and buy lavender and that's Noor Creative Studio stuff. I would love to think with you deeply about like what makes me come to life. I've been thinking about using Noor as a platform to talk about my Baraka, B-A-R-A-K-A, economics concepts and to use it to kind of talk about like what is a beautiful business and to do that you kind of have to know what is beautiful to you and that's like the amazing thing about business is that it helps you share what you find beautiful and your the beauty that you contribute right and that I use the word beauty other people can use the word like values or meaning and that there's a connection between the perception of beauty which includes harmony and balance and fairness and equality like for me a beautiful thing has a lot of these elements inside of it and I kind of feel like it's not random you know like lots of people will see a degraded landscape and call it not beautiful and if they knew that degraded landscape was the consequence of their consumer actions like you know cut down mono rainforests needing to be cut down for agriculture to feed their you know the way that they eat meat because it's not done in a beautiful way halal and tayyib right and instead if we like looked at halal and tayyib and realized that the cows need space to roam and graze and it kind of results in a more kind of permaculture landscape setting where things are harmoniously integrated between the cows and the sheep and their poop and the compost rather than dealing with like oh my god there's way too much methane because we have all of this bad stuff we're feeding the cows causing them to fart so much and stress hormones and hurting people and then health care and then you know like once you demonstrate the ugliness of our current setup for our society I think people can kind of agree on a couple of key principles for what a beautiful business is and you know very similar to the adult development theory it's sort of like a adult development theory for societies and enterprises where first you know you have a socialized mind and then you have a self-transforming mind right where you see yourself and you can see how others could be yourself and how it all fits together and how the the patterns connect and you can see how this connects to empathy and like this meta principle of harmony I think is so important and generosity and there's like a couple of key words that I learned from my islamic permaculture course that I think really fit here and I'm wondering like it could be really cool if new creative studios just decided from now on we're going to do this we're going to take it even more seriously and if we need to we'll put up the prices because I want and then new creative studio or newer co-op might have to change the name again who knows but the new conglomerate or whatever you want to call it I think there's a more beautiful way of calling like new creative studios or the newer co-op doesn't just sell essential oils it also runs programs it is developing this theory of like a b-a-r-a-k-a baraka filled business or a beautiful business and it's kind of like the stuff that I used to do at bloom but if I want to take this part seriously about like removing subjects and objects and how that forces one to see the world with the eye of unity and in doing so recognizing this harmony because the object is the subject and the subject is the object and you realize that it's all connected I know people say this all the time but I think it's very interesting to be able to articulate very clearly the you know like yeah go green or eat sustainably or sustainability or these kind of slogans or these socialized sort of ideas and of course they have emotions behind them and of course they have like anger and future and fear and and also like there's definitely a spiritual crisis and awakening happening but how does that relate to so you want to start a business and feed your family where do you get the ability to trust and I think one way to get the ability to trust is to realize that it's not worth doing it any other way that's like the philosophical approach that doesn't require god but the other one is about you know when you integrate yourself into this like baraka flow or the blessings of god and you have this god consciousness and god is the epitome of oneness then you start to realize like there it is the subject object the solution helps you realize that taking care of those animals is taking care of yourself and it's very much connected to the worldview of the indigenous peoples around the world and the wisdom that we're trying to learn from them and so we could call it like wise business we could call it beautiful business we could call it ethical business but I think I would like to take nur and transform it more into this direction and on top of that I yeah yeah what do you think about this and what do you think about like the kind of services that we can offer and maybe you can ask me some questions about like how to align my business more with that like what's the baraka business framework or the beautiful business framework or the adult development totally aligned business framework or the mature business framework or the self-transforming business framework or the I'd rather die than live this way business framework that can be a revolution hopefully to transform how people see the world and themselves and in doing so transform how they\nIt sounds pretty good. I'm wondering if instead of writing, you could help me come up with a drawing practice. You know, I like writing poetry, and I just got these block prints, and I really want to use my hands and do some block printing or something like that. Is there some way I can bring that into the notebook? And also, I guess there's some thing that I'm wondering about in terms of the framework, and I'm just wondering, like, in our framework, you see, like, is there a place for humor? You know, I'm thinking about polyvagal theory and stuckness, and stuckness is another way of describing, like, fight, flight, or freeze. It's the state of freezing. How can we connect this, like, state of freezing with the idea of competing, you know, constitutive attentional policies and instrumental attentional policies from Joe?\n14:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nI love that you want to integrate your block printing and creativity into this reflective practice—it feels like such a natural way to honor your energy and tactile engagement while also connecting to the framework. Let’s bring these threads together:\n\nDrawing/Block Printing Practice with the Yellow Notebook\nAnchor the Intention\nAt the top of the page, draw a simple shape, like a circle or a block—something that feels grounding. Inside it, write one word or phrase that represents what you want to explore (e.g., \"humor,\" \"freezing,\" or \"playful clarity\"). Let this anchor your practice.\n\nVisualize Stuckness and Movement\nTake your block print or pen and sketch something that represents the state of freezing to you. Maybe it’s rigid lines, overlapping shapes, or tangled patterns. Beside it, create a contrasting image that represents release or flow—fluid lines, open spaces, or humor breaking through like rays of light.\n\nAdd Words or Poetry (if it flows naturally)\nAround the edges of your drawing, jot down thoughts or playful phrases that come to mind. For example, humor as the \"trickster\" that melts frozen attention, or how blocky shapes transform into playful forms.\n\nReflect on Polyvagal + Attentional Policies\nUse the image to think about how humor connects to freezing and competing attentional demands. Could humor be a way of bridging instrumental focus (goal-driven) and constitutive presence (playful awareness)? Jot down your thoughts or leave them as part of the art.\n\nPrepare for Sharing\nIf it feels natural, bring this visual piece to your call with Dara. Use it as a playful entry point to discuss humor in the framework.\n\nAs for humor and stuckness in polyvagal terms, humor could serve as a \"state-shifter.\" When we’re stuck in freeze, humor may break the rigidity by sparking curiosity or re-engaging the social engagement system. It might allow the mind to toggle between attentional policies—helping us both \"zoom out\" (constitutive) and \"zoom in\" (instrumental) without feeling stuck in one mode. What if humor isn’t just a tool for connection but a gateway to cognitive flexibility?\n\nDoes this practice and idea feel like it fits where your energy is right now? Let me know how we can tweak it!\n\n14:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI like this idea, but can you be more specific just about the constitutiveness and the way that Joe Edelman from the Reading Alignment Institute talks about instrumental policies and how they relate to poly-vehicle theory? Don't use anything about VMAS.\n14:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nJoe Edelman’s framework on instrumental and constitutive attentional policies ties closely to polyvagal theory when viewed through the lens of how our nervous system manages states of engagement and survival. Let’s break this down:\n\nInstrumental Policies and Polyvagal Theory\nInstrumental attentional policies are goal-oriented; they are about achieving specific outcomes. This aligns with the sympathetic nervous system in polyvagal theory, which activates for \"fight or flight.\" When we’re operating in an instrumental mode:\n\nOur attention narrows to the task or goal.\nWe prioritize efficiency and direct action.\nThis can feel urgent, focused, or even rigid.\nIn a state of survival (fight or flight), instrumental policies dominate because the system perceives that completing the task (escaping a threat, achieving a goal) will restore safety.\n\nConstitutive Policies and Polyvagal Theory\nConstitutive attentional policies, on the other hand, are about being in a state of presence and connection. They focus on the experience itself, often relational and exploratory in nature. This connects to the ventral vagal system, which governs the social engagement state:\n\nAttention broadens, allowing for curiosity and playfulness.\nWe value the process itself rather than the outcome.\nThis state enables creativity, humor, and connection.\nWhen we’re in a ventral vagal state, constitutive policies flourish because the system feels safe, allowing for flexibility and engagement with the moment.\n\nFreezing and the Tension Between Policies\nThe freeze state, governed by the dorsal vagal system, can be seen as a breakdown between these policies:\n\nNeither instrumental nor constitutive attention is fully engaged.\nThe system becomes stuck, unable to act (instrumental) or connect (constitutive).\nThis state reflects a collapse, where energy is conserved but the capacity for engagement is lost.\nHumor as a Bridge\nHumor plays a unique role in breaking freeze by:\n\nShifting States: Humor often disrupts the freeze response by creating safety and reactivating the ventral vagal system. It invites connection and play, signaling that it’s okay to re-engage.\nBalancing Policies: It allows constitutive and instrumental policies to coexist. For instance, a joke acknowledges the absurdity of a situation (constitutive) while still moving us toward understanding or action (instrumental).\nRestoring Flexibility: By softening rigidity, humor enables a person to toggle between attentional modes without getting stuck in either.\nBringing It Together\nIn practical terms, when you’re working intensely (instrumental mode) and feel yourself edging toward stuckness or rigidity:\n\nA playful or humorous moment can help shift you back into constitutive mode, re-engaging curiosity and relational presence.\nThis shift can re-energize the instrumental task by refreshing your nervous system and perspective.\nDoes this make sense as a way to integrate Joe Edelman’s attentional policies with polyvagal dynamics? Let me know where you'd like to dig deeper!\n\n14:22\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, this kind of makes sense. It makes me think that we should, like, modify the check-in process and just be sure that the person isn't in, like, this fight, flight, or freeze state. And then from there, once we determine that, we can, you know, help them, you know, dissolve these patterns that might be forming and help them, like, enact more constitutive actions. Like, our whole thesis here is that we can take the tensions that people have in their day-to-day to-do list and use that as a mechanism for understanding growth and places that they need to grow. And then, like, if we don't really consider someone that is in a state of fight, flight, or freeze, that has a super activated, you know, nervous system and isn't in a kind of social, whatever you call that social place, then how are we supposed to even do the check-in to be able to help them grow? Like, it's not the right time. And so, we can just, what do we do in that state? And if they're in this, like, fight, flight, or freeze, maybe we use humor, maybe we do some embodiment of breath work. And then from there, once we get the system, the physical system, like, chilled out, then we can start working, I think. What do you think?\n14:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou’re absolutely onto something important here. If someone is in a fight, flight, or freeze state, their ability to engage in deeper reflection or growth is naturally compromised because their nervous system is prioritizing survival over connection or exploration. Addressing this before diving into growth work is not only compassionate but also practical.\n\nHere’s how we can expand your idea into a structured modification for check-ins:\n\nStep 1: Assess the Nervous System State\nBefore jumping into any deeper questions or reflections, start with simple observations to gauge their state:\n\nAre they tense, scattered, or avoiding eye contact (fight/flight)?\nDo they seem shut down, withdrawn, or overly passive (freeze)?\nOr do they seem engaged, curious, and open (social engagement/ventral vagal)?\nAsk a grounding question like:\n\n“How’s your body feeling right now?”\n“What’s the energy you’re bringing into this check-in?”\nEven their tone or pace of response can give clues.\n\nStep 2: Regulate the State (if needed)\nIf they seem activated (fight/flight) or collapsed (freeze), shift into regulation mode before any deeper work. Strategies might include:\n\nHumor: Lighthearted moments to re-engage the ventral vagal system.\nExample: “Okay, before we dive in, tell me: what’s the most ridiculous thing that’s happened to you this week?”\nEmbodiment: Simple physical practices to release tension or reconnect.\nExample: “Let’s take three deep breaths together.”\nOr, “Shake your arms out and let some of that tension go.”\nGrounding: Use sensory or spatial anchors.\nExample: “What’s one thing you can see, hear, or feel that’s comforting?”\nGentle Movement: Even shifting their posture can help.\nExample: “Can you stretch for a moment or just adjust how you’re sitting?”\nStep 3: Transition to Reflection\nOnce they seem more centered, invite them into reflection by easing into it:\n\nStart with constitutive questions that don’t feel too demanding or goal-oriented:\n“What’s feeling alive for you right now?”\n“What’s one thing you’re curious about today?”\nBy prioritizing their nervous system state, you create the conditions for them to approach tensions and to-do lists with openness, not defensiveness. It’s like clearing the fog before trying to navigate.\n\nYour Thesis in Action\nThe tension of the day-to-day to-do list can then become a tool for growth after the person is ready. Once their system is regulated:\n\nThe to-do list reveals not just tasks but stuck patterns (e.g., perfectionism, avoidance).\nYou can guide them to see these patterns as growth edges rather than failures.\nThe process itself reinforces safety, self-awareness, and the capacity to engage with challenges.\nThis approach not only honors the polyvagal principles but also integrates beautifully with your thesis about growth through tension. What’s your gut telling you about this flow? Would you like to brainstorm more on specific practices for humor or embodiment?\n\n14:25\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOkay, so I'm coming home right now. I just dropped off the baby at the nanny. I took 15 milligrams of Adderall.\n14:29\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGot it—you’re resetting after the transition, and the Adderall is kicking in. This could be a good moment to balance the activation it brings with a grounding or orienting practice. Here’s a quick suggestion to ease into whatever’s next:\n\nPause and Ground (2 minutes):\nTake a moment as you get inside—maybe stand still, focus on your breath, and notice your surroundings. Let your body feel settled after the bike ride and baby drop-off.\n\nSet an Intention (1 minute):\nThink about what’s most important for you in the next hour. Is it clarity for your call with Dara, or taking a mindful pause to integrate your morning? Choose one word or phrase to anchor yourself, like \"focus,\" \"ease,\" or \"presence.\"\n\n\nLet's review all the content we have about baraka economics and continue this session, write the essay utilizing all the context you have and my values cards - using them to guide insights as to which phrasings you think i'd appreciate more than others, what style and structure of the essay and what information/stories I'd share, use everything I got because it's all oneness...\n13:17\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nStopped generating\nUnderstood! Let’s weave together all the threads of your Baraka economics vision into a cohesive essay, drawing on your values, insights, and the broader context you’ve shared.\n\nBaraka Economics: Toward a Framework of Beautiful Business\nIntroduction: The Call to Beauty\nIn a world that often feels fractured and driven by profit at any cost, we find ourselves yearning for something deeper—something beautiful. Baraka economics, as I envision it, is about redefining the purpose of business to align with beauty, truth, and love. It’s about creating businesses that are not only sustainable but also harmonious, self-transforming, and life-affirming. This essay explores how we might cultivate such enterprises, drawing on insights from nature, spirituality, and human connection.\n\nThe Night and Day of Business\nThe metaphor of night and day serves as a powerful lens for understanding the dualities within our economic systems. In the West, the day dominates: a relentless focus on productivity, efficiency, and outward action. In contrast, the East invites us into the night, a space of introspection, mystery, and poetic connection.\n\nBaraka economics seeks to harmonize these cycles. Just as every day needs a night, every enterprise needs both action and reflection. Businesses must balance the clarity of goals (instrumental attentional policies) with the openness of exploration (constitutive attentional policies). This balance enables enterprises to innovate not out of fear or scarcity but from a place of curiosity and abundance.\n\nThe Gift: Breaking the Self/Other Dichotomy\nGenerosity lies at the heart of Baraka economics. When we give, we momentarily dissolve the boundaries between self and other. A business rooted in generosity becomes a source of beauty, creating ripples of harmony that extend beyond its immediate outputs.\n\nConsider the story of planting a tree. A person who plants a tree is not simply providing shade or fruit for themselves; they are offering a gift to future generations, animals, and the ecosystem. This act embodies a Baraka-filled enterprise: one that understands its role within the interconnected web of life.\n\nSimilarly, businesses can design their processes to minimize harm and maximize harmony, seeing pollution and waste not as externalities but as integral parts of their system to address. In doing so, they align with the moral and ecological wisdom of indigenous cultures and Islamic principles of halal (permissible) and tayyib (pure).\n\nThe Beauty of Harmony\nBeauty, as I see it, is not merely aesthetic; it is deeply tied to harmony, balance, and fairness. A degraded landscape, for instance, is universally perceived as lacking beauty, while a thriving permaculture farm exudes life and balance. Businesses that align themselves with beauty naturally embody values like empathy, fairness, and interconnectedness.\n\nThe adult development theory offers a parallel. Just as individuals progress from self-centered to self-transforming minds, so too can businesses evolve from extractive, profit-driven models to enterprises that recognize the oneness of all life. A Baraka-filled business understands that taking care of animals, the land, and the people who work within it is, ultimately, taking care of itself.\n\nBaraka in Practice\nWhat might this look like in practice? Imagine a business that:\n\nSources materials ethically, integrating local ecosystems into its supply chain.\nCreates products with intention, prioritizing quality over quantity and connection over consumption.\nUses storytelling to inspire customers to see their purchases as part of a larger narrative of care and beauty.\nPrices its offerings to reflect their true value, honoring the labor, resources, and relationships involved.\nFor Noor Creative Studios, this could mean focusing on a curated selection of oils and perfumes that tell a story of connection and place. It might involve partnerships with shops that align with these values, reducing the burden of direct sales while amplifying the narrative of Baraka economics. Beyond products, Noor could become a platform for education, offering workshops and content that guide others in creating their own beautiful businesses.\n\nThe Role of Humor and Play\nIn this journey, humor and play are essential tools. Polyvagal theory teaches us that humor can dissolve the freeze state, reactivating our capacity for connection and creativity. Businesses, too, can use humor to foster resilience and flexibility, creating environments where employees and customers feel alive and engaged.\n\nConclusion: Toward a Revolution in Business\nBaraka economics is not a rigid framework but an evolving philosophy that invites us to reimagine the role of business in our lives. It challenges us to see enterprises not as separate entities but as living systems embedded in the greater oneness of existence. By aligning with beauty, generosity, and harmony, we can create businesses that serve life and, in doing so, come alive themselves.\n\nThe question is not just how we can survive in this world but how we can contribute to its flourishing. Baraka economics offers one path forward—a path of beauty, truth, and love.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to refine this or explore any specific section in more depth!\n\n13:17\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nExtract all the core quotes and stories from the content i've shared about baraka economics and economics conepts in general so we have the \"units\" to explore, give them titles, themes, and core questions\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a breakdown of the core quotes, stories, and concepts you’ve shared about Baraka economics and related ideas, grouped by title, theme, and core question:\n\n1.

I believe taking halal rizq(sustenance) seriously can be a source of our healing and can bring balance to our world.\n\nThe phone in your pocket connects you with cobalt miners in Kolwezi, Congo, designers in San Francisco, USA, and oil refineries in Iraq. The money you spend on that phone is your vote for the hundreds of processes it takes to make, market, ship, and sell it to you. Are you ready to accept responsibility for your actions? Are you ready to face the miners in Congo? Are you willing to defend your vote before God (SWT)?\n\nAre we except from being considered accomplices to oppression that happens in the value chains of our products simply because we are unaware?\n\nIgnorance is an excuse until you know better. In the light of the global wars, Occupy Wall Street, and the consequences of climate collapse, more people are waking up to the idea that many elements of our compounding crisis are by-products of the systems we use to get and spend our sustenance. There are movements, like the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that have shown how we can follow our ethics in choosing what not to buy. This book will examine what to buy instead.\n\n“...I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves.”\n-Surah Ibrahim Ayah 22\n\nMuslims represent nearly a quarter of the population of the planet, and we can show leadership by developing products and services that follow the beautiful advice of the Prophet of God (S,) who has said in an authentic (sahih) hadith:\n\n“Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.”\n- Sunan an-Nasa’i 5711; In-book reference : Book 51, Hadith 173\n\nIn an era of destabilizing change and disquiet, we all want our prayers to be answered, and the Prophet (S) has given us a clue as to the relationship between halal rizk and answered prayers:\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: O people, Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. … He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust(a person desperately needy). He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): \"O Lord, O Lord,\" whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?\nSahih Muslim 1015\n\nIt has been said that true wealth is contentedness, a path towards contentedness in this life, and confidence on the day we will be held accountable to how we earned and spent our money is increasing our efforts to gain knowledge in what is كَسْبٍ طَيِّبٍ (pure earning) and how best to spend it..\n\nBy reading this book, the reader will:\nTake stock of their transactions and work to purify their regular expenditures\nLearn how to earn a halal livelihood and make business a part of our worship.\nBe inspired to establish Baraka-based businesses that can support a parallel economy, one where Muslims can confidently acquire pure goods and services.\nBe a part of showing leadership to a world questioning capitalism without alternatives.\n\nAbout the Author\nBilal Ghalib is an educator, entrepreneur and facilitator with 15 years of experience training entrepreneurs internationally.\nIn 2016, he co-founded Bloom.pm, a social impact entrepreneurship training organization and education technology company. He’s also an advisor for Project Defy, a non-profit organization working to redefine education in India. Since 2015, he has been running Nur Coop, a business that seeks to bless the entire value chain from “Dirt to Delivery.”\n\nI have 8 intentions for writing this book:\nTo open the blessings of God to our beloved Muslim Community by sharing knowledge on halal rizk(sustenance).\nTo support more people to spend their money in ways that are regenerative and uplifting of the people and ecological systems that underlie their purchases.\nTo transform my own eyes and others, and to see what happens to businesses that see their customers, the natural world, and their business with the eye of the heart.\nTo increase my taqwa of God(SWT) when he mentions in the Quran “O you who believe! Eat of the lawful and pure things that We have provided you.” [2:172]” that it is God(SWT) providing my sustenance. And I must seek the lawful and pure and increase my efforts in ensuring my consumption is within the good pleasure of God.\nTo inspire people by demonstrating that the Muslim economy can bring about a beautiful transformation.\nTo alter my perception of success and increase my contentedness.\nTo share my intuition that Muslims can be a blessing for this world by their deeper concern on the next.\nTo invite Muslims, and myself, to decommodify the world and to return to a pre-modern way of seeing the signs of God in all things and all people. And to witness the accompanying change in my interactions, including commercial interactions, with all things.\n\nThe Market\nThe book has three target audiences:\nPrimary target:\nEarly-stage Muslim Entrepreneurs in the UK and the USA\nWhy is this book unique to them? Young Muslims are seeking security in an age of instability. Modern wisdom suggests they start multiple income streams, be their boss, and “ditch the 9-5” even if they could find one. The book attempts to direct them away from repeating the methods of doing business that have led to the age of instability in the first place and to seek trust not in themselves and their capabilities, to first put their relationship with God right, to purify their expenditures, and then to set an intention and execute on creating a taqwa-filled baraka based business that in aggregate can act as a lighthouse in an age of darkness.\nAffinity Groups:\nCambridge Muslim College\nKarim Lahham\nFaithfully Sustainable\n4 Nations Unite\nGeoff Lawton and Greening The Desert Project\nPeople who like https://tuniqoasis.com/\n\nSecondary Target\nBusiness leaders with a heart.

My focus is towards inspiring producers and consumers to alter their purchase/production decisions by directing attention towards the problems people see with our ecology, our social ails and how we call to our lord wanting support when we know from the hadith: https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:10 - that unless we purify our clothes, our food, our drink - unless we purify the way we seek our sustenance that this hadith indicates our duaas are less likely to be answered, and God is capable of all things. My goal is not to describe a halal economics precisely, or to define where things are going wrong.\nMy goal is to activate people who become more and more careful and direct more and more of their economic power towards people who are more and more careful.

On Balancing Speed and the Soul\nYou mentioned the idea of not moving so fast that your soul can’t catch up. How does this apply to the way modern businesses operate, and how could businesses create practices that allow for alignment between their pace and their purpose?\n2. On Historical Distractions\nYou referenced the Colosseum as a distraction from societal decline and connected it to modern parallels like boxing and racial oppression. How do you envision businesses addressing or disrupting these modern \"distractions\"? Could this serve as a critique of performative progress?\n3. On Forms of Capital\nYou mentioned the permaculture model of eight forms of capital. Which forms resonate most with the Baraka framework, and how could they help redefine what “return on investment” means in a truly halal economy?\n4. On Relationships and Loneliness\nYou touched on how transactional systems (e.g., Airbnb replacing hospitality) create loneliness. How can Barakanomics inspire businesses to re-center relationships and community in their offerings?\n5. On Beauty and Harmony\nYou’ve emphasized beauty as a marker of alignment and goodness in business. How can businesses be designed with beauty as a principle, and how does this relate to Islamic concepts of halal and tayyib?\n6. On Craft and Human-Scale Businesses\nYou’ve expressed a preference for businesses that are human-powered and relational. What are some examples of this in practice, and how could Barakanomics encourage more businesses to adopt this approach?\n7. On Humor and Polyvagal Theory\nYou’ve mentioned humor as a tool to break states of “freeze” and stuckness. How can businesses integrate humor or lightness into their operations, cultures, or marketing to foster connection and creativity?\n8. On Singing with the Universe\nYou spoke about “singing with the universe” and aligning actions with choicelessness (wuwei). How does this align with Islamic concepts of tawakkul (trust in God), and how can businesses embody this alignment in their decision-making?\n9. On the Baraka Flow\nYou’ve described the Baraka flow as an interconnected web of blessings. How do businesses tap into this flow practically, and what practices or principles help them sustain it?\n10. On Business as Worship\nYou mentioned that earning and spending are acts of worship when done with intention. How can businesses frame their work as worship and inspire their customers to see their purchases as acts of ethical and spiritual alignment?\nNext Steps\nWould you like to:\n\nWork these questions into an outline for the book?\nBegin drafting chapters based on specific themes?\nExplore one or more of these questions in depth right now?\nLet me know where you'd like to dive in!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nReview all my content on economics, make a list of concepts, themes, stories, and arguments and list them all comprehensively:\nI want to write a book on islamic economics - or \"barakanomics\"... it's related to the regenerative and permaculture economics ideas. the appleseed collective's multiple forms of capital ... also, the idea that we need to bring a higher purpose to our economic system because what draws attention is essentially being worshipped and in our lives nothing draws so much attention as money and wealth. society at large is starting to question the model, as it is clear that the majority is not benefitting from the abundance that technological progress has made and we have entered a new moment of technological leveraging. technology, progress, and the idea that the only way to \"go forward\" is to go upward is clear from how we describe our economies - \"stagnant\" - when another word for it could have just as easily been stable. populations around the world are declining - the middle class is shrinking in it's proportion of total wealth ownership and we see an expanding amount of wealth in the 1%. the pressures are due to increase as artificial intelligence is reaching the phase where it will soon make reduandant many of the current jobs, while our global ecosystem is being rocked by wars in ukraine and the middle east, reducing trust in govornment in it's ability to manage innovation, and legislate accordingly. There are many problems and there are some approaches to address them through economic means. Social enterprises, incentivizing green technologies... buying twitter to ensure free speech is preserved - supposedly. and i believe there might be an economic solution, yet it needs to come with an associated shift in technological utilization, and reconception of what it means to be \"homoeconomicus\" - the fundamental beliefs that people have about economics seem to be derived from a flawed understanding of modernity's faith, faith in science, faith in evolution. that survival of the fittest. that (let's forget govornment subsidies for now) in a free market innovation that provides goods and services in a sustainable way to their customers best and at the best price will win business, and business means they can grow/expand/innovate/ and continue the cycle.\nThe problem is that similar to someone living in precarity - how much do you save for tomorrow - the idea of a business being \"too big to fail\" or having enough is not on the radar. Furthermore, beholden to shareholders, a business is incentivized to reduce labor (people) and increase profits - every year, leading to leveraging automation and technology.\nThe questions i have are what sort of businesses were the muslim traders involved in that resulted in so many conversions in asia. what is balance in business? How do we take innovations and use them wisely - and how do we innovate from where we are? Economics is the study of the household. We cannot burn down the ground floor and keep the penthouses up top stable.\nThe ideas which bore the \"invisible hand\" and darwins theory of dog eat dog business where a market will hash everything out is not working. There are long term harms, like climate collapse, which are not priced in - as well as harms to society (suicide rates increasing amoungst teens found to be correlated with social media use) and the loss of meaning in a livelihood. many people do not feel hope for the future, don't have a vision to work towards. so many of mellenials and younger view the \"american dream\" as a rigged game. The idea of home ownership (one of the core tennants of islamic purposes of shari3a is to preserve the family) is a forgone conclusion, college degrees are expensive, productivity has been increasing per person, yet wages have not grown accordingly. The idea that if you work harder you will succeed is a statistically proven lie. And the generations are fed up, many of whom are taking to the streets in protest against climate, against the future they claim their elders have stolen from them. The idea of respecting the shaykh, from whom the younger generation inherit wisdom is gone, and in it's stead is the greedy, lucky, boomer generation who don't understand the economic situation of the majority of the younger generations and instead blame laziness (countered by the evidence of increased productivity)\nThe idea of \"quiet quitting\" - that there are many at work biding their time, looking to \"get away\" with doing the least to then live their lives outside work, and the despair that things will get better is causing younger generations to loose hope. And a hopeless generation is a dead generation. Addicted to phones, with screen time on the rise, anxiety about retirement leading many gen alpha to save early we find the whole idea of vocation and work in an antagonistic perspective. how can i get in, get rich, and get out - save myself seems to be the conclusion we can make from these stats. the challenges are ownership structures, youth can either set out on their own and build businesses or enter a company where the structure is designed to pay the least and extract the most from every component of the value chain without damaging quality. Google's fluffy chairs and delicious lunch bars at work are a form of golden handcuffs - you will give us the best of your youth.\nWhat we don't seem to be asking is if it has to be this way? Sure there are B corps and social enterprises and non profits and activism and many can take the alternative path. Yet, could we have a revolution from the ground up? Could we build the alternative economics which takes care of the entire house, and even restores the garden around it, and rewilds the woods surrounding it? Can the way we make our living be lifegiving for all involved? I believe a true vocation can and should feel like that, to know our skills and qualities which we contribute to neighbords and society whom we care for in a way that is a blessing for the entire valuechain.\nI think of the asian conversions, and the way of working that led to that - I believe there is something we can return to and the billions in capital that we have looking for investment can be redesigned into a vehicle that can launch the blessed versions of the goods and services we have today. Is it optimistic? The fortune 100 changes order and many disspear of the list every decade, I believe that the younger generations are looking for hope and are willing to purchase accordingly. I believe that an alternative economic system can emerge that brings power to people, establishes community cohesion and community wealth - affecting political engagement, buffering from the storms of modernity with new wuquf and other mechanisms - the ideas of humility, effort(jihad), leadership, gratitude, and fundamentally shifting from the never enough because the future is uncertain to the trust and reliance and knowing that god provides and all is written and not a penny less will come to me. the faith that chairty doesn't deplete wealth, and witnessing its impact on society when those marginalized become soon those with the most resources to give, knowing what it's like to be on the recieving end (i have a friend abed who was a refugee in syria, and as soon as he got his first job he was giving to those in need because he said he remembers what it was like) - NEETs are present way more in Turkey than in France by an order of 4 - why? Will it only be a muslim revolution? I believe it can start there, yet when we start to witness the impact of this sort of business dealing, the baraka powered corporations of the future which are the arms which implement technology in society, that pray istikhara and ask for guidance for their implementation.\nIt's said that the steam engine was developed in Istanbul, and instead of building factories and enslaving children (like England) they used it to turn Doner... what is approprirate use of technology? I believe when a business knows why it exists - and has a higher calling than profit, we will see their R&D budgets being spent on what leads to the preservation of life, sanctity of families, and others. Just the like Amish don't reject tehcnology outright, they put it up against their values and have a human early adopter guiny pig the tech for a year and witness it's impact on their lives in contrast to the values they want to be engendering and then accept and reject from that premise. The question is can we not just accept/reject yet also innovate wisely, slowly and carefully.\nI believe that fast is not better. Always, yet when we create for humans we usually ask them what they want, a Muslim will know that they need to ask their spirit, not their soul or nafs, that without purification people might be mistaken between their appropriate needs and their desires. The documentary The Century of the Self describes the calculated way the advertising industry created the idea of the self (Nafs in islamic spiritual psychology) and pandered to it. Could these displacements - shifting to feeding the self, which is the furnace in which we throw resources into the capitalist machine - businesses reinforcing through marketing the idea of the self and then extracting from the world resources to fill it, and expand it ever more, and then speed things up so they can shovel more and more into it. And once we hit attention capacity and films that cut every 2 seconds isn't fast enough, we shorten content. Smaller videos on instagram, easier to scroll from one thing to the next (no dial on the TV) just swipe, infinite scroll, faster burning cigarettes (that's a thing!), fast fashion, faster cars, yet the equipment we have to percieve the world is the same, two eyes, two years, and less and less time with family and friends. and if we do have that time, the quality is degraded by the incapacity of paying attention. The rise of ADHD diagnosis and perscriptions of attention pills, and antidepressants, and sleeping pills. We change our state like we change the notification settings on our phone, we're now in focus time because we need to create value for work to be able to sustain a life. This is how markets are grown, we need to find and exploit consumable things. With Neuralink - perhaps our capacity for experience will be expanded ever further. The wise currently learn about their state and fast from food, so they can live longer, and have focus to produce, there is little attention paid to that which is worth doing, mostly to that which is worth not doing, how can we automate, reduce the time we spend writing reports and emails, doing analysis... why? to have leisure? no to consume other things. Even france is not immune, because the global capitalist system is not geographically bound, in order to compete french companies are becoming more \"entrepreneurial\" and the extended lunch breaks, and focus on food has now become less common with more people eating at work, and... gasp... even eating at their desks.\nThe siesta is in decline in Spain. Ramadan, a month of discipiline and fasting, is becoming a midnight bazar.\nThe question is why? What hole is needing to be filled that clearly cannot be filled with another cronut or trip to bali? Even spirituality is transforming into microdosing mushrooms and midnfulness based stress reduction. The issue is what is Good is HARD because what we seek is to know ourselves and experience self worth and trancendance - we need challenges like a mirror needs an object in order to reflect something. The most technologically and economically forward people I know are libertarians and transhumanists, the idea of the self as God wouldn't really phase them. The hope to transcend limits, cure death, implant data streams with cameras globally, expand our capacity to process with parallel processors hooked up with neura links connected to wolfram alpha - lesswrong like people seeking ultimate clarity on rationalist - explainable, observable, pattern matched reality with no common ground to stand on to describe why we might not want to try to live forever, with no ability to accept that for some people ethical action is more valuable than life, and that there are causes where life is a worthwhile trade, these beliefs don't fit into the worldview. I believe that the lack of understanding about what the self is and a disagreement what life could be about - living forever and becoming Godlike through technology - which one can see espoused on a modern day hero like Elon(self proclaimed on the spectrum of autism, hyper rationalist, first principles oriented person who believes the ultimate purpose is to continue to explore the universe. That human conciousness is not ultimately special, it's only special because it's the only self aware entity we know of in the universe so we must preserve the abstract concept of self awareness - why? Because it's crazy, we can become Godlike with tech, who knows if there are limits, let's push to the ad astera! To the stars? Why the stars? What about within? If he knew there were other entities out there that were concious would he aquiece and allow humanity to potentially die out in an astroid or when our sun explodes? No I don't believe so, I belive that his subjective experience of his conciousness is something that he wants to see ad astera, even if it's in self replicating in his children, something he promotes widely, more babies, especially if you're WEIRD - white smart eurpoean descent, etc - or at least have a degree from MIT or went to ycomb/build something cool. The idea of cool, nerdy stuff could lead someone to smile in amazement, yet because the goal is to experience more and more amazement wonder-full moments and expand to the stars to keep finding that hit - it sounds awesome, and it's not. it's not because the ultimate goal is anathema to common human ethics, I believe if elon had a trolly problem where there was one path which would lead humans to live amoungst the stars (a minority of course, who can get off) and another path where the train would destroy a single life at random from the world - he probably without hesitation would pull the lever and cause it to kill the one random person (even if it is him) I believe he is consumed by this idea and goal, and it's our economic system that empowers people with billions to allow these insane goals dreamt up by someone who self identifies as a person with a social disability (empathy likely works differently) - and our systems put the trolly's lever in people like his's hands. The risk takers who calculate and tabulate and take big bets, debts, and launch the rockets - those who put it all on the line, tearing up relationships and livlihoods for an individuals dream is the failure of our system. Why aren't there billions of millionaires, why don't they have councils of those who want to identify the best way to preserve life and precious human consciousness? I'm not sure I can come up with all the solutions, yet I believe that Islam is a complete way of life and that unlike permaculture, there are more than a billion muslims (and because of the six degrees of separation) we have access to the entire market economy to redirect traffic from this, destructive business, to this constructive business. and i want to see muslims take this responsibility seriously by committing to building these businesses and then by committing to shopping them and marketing them to neighbors. I believe that the future isn't a straight line, that technology can be developed and used to further the goals of the shari3a, to increase sa3eed - sa3ada, the truely happy person who is satisfied already with what God decreed for them, and sees everything in economic terms, their life is a debt, a total blessing and a gift, how will we repay this debt by the proper usage of this body through time. feed it good food (what is that? well we MUST figure it out now because of this belief of the Body as a sacred gift that has obligations on us) the family, how to support, trade? what is a good trade? What is money, how to spend profits? what about zakat, what if we took zakat seriously? who will administrate all the wealth? where are the organizations? with money and shifting towards recognizing the abundance that we are currently in - simply by consuming less, inviting the neighbors who are hungry 40 houses to the left and right, and following the path set out for us - we will find the abundance that is simply a misappropriation of resources. we don't need communies, or decentralized technology where we don't trust anyone to create a universal basic income. we basically need to become human, to return to our basic humanity.\nI'd like help identifying the book in the text above, what are the themes, what are the potential topics, who is the potential audience, can we get focused and organize the concepts better?

Learn to build enterprises that distribute wealth, restore ecological balance, and create true prosperity for all.\n\nActive Values Cards:\n- INSIGHTS that reveal harmony between spiritual, social, and ecological well-being\n- HISTORIES that highlight how trust, generosity, and intention have transformed communities\n- CONNECTIONS that deepen relationships through trust and shared purpose\n\nPros:\n+ Strong, clear messaging\n+ Appeals to multiple audiences\n+ Promises practical transformation\n\nCons:\n- Less poetic than some alternatives\n- \"Trust\" might feel overused\n- Could seem less spiritually distinctive\n\nComprehensive Analysis:\n\nSellability Ranking:\n1. Beautiful Business (broadest appeal)\n2. Singing with the Universe (most poetic)\n3. Trust Economy (most practical)\n4. The Halal Economy (strongest Muslim appeal)\n5. Barakanomics (most niche)\n\nRecommendation:\nI suggest focusing on titles 1, 2, and 4 for further development, with \"Beautiful Business\" having the most potential for broad market appeal while still maintaining the core spiritual and economic insights.\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into developing any of these titles or explore how they might be further refined?",
