If you want to use LLMs effectively, you must comprehend the concept of traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nOver hundreds of hours of GPT use since last December, we’ve built this intuition. Now we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting. \n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse) and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions.\n\nLet’s ease in with a simplified explanation as if you were five years old. \n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R Like You’re Five\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\nSet Sail on an Adventure with Your Navigator's Talking Map!\nWelcome to a world of discovery and imagination! On this journey, you're not just wandering; you're an intrepid navigator with an extraordinary companion – a talking map. This map is no ordinary paper; it's alive with knowledge and adventure!\nYour Interactive Guide: The talking map knows about every nook and cranny of the world. It doesn't just show you places; it talks about them, suggests where to explore, and helps you think of questions about unknown corners of the world.\nJourney Across the Map: As you travel with your map, it might say, \"Have you ever wondered what lies beyond that mountain range?\" even when you don’t know there is a mountain range, because it has a maps eye view :D or \"Let's explore what's inside the belly of a fish at the bottom of the ocean!\" It's always ready to take you to new places and open up worlds you have yet to think to discover.\nThe Power of Curiosity: Your map's magic lies in its ability to spark your curiosity. Every new place it points out and every question it suggests is like unlocking a hidden treasure of knowledge. It encourages you to think, explore, and learn about things far beyond the ordinary.\nNavigating the Unknown: Remember, with your talking map, you're the navigator of your adventure. It's there to guide you, show you hidden paths, and inspire you to ask questions and find answers.\nReady to Discover Hidden Treasures? So, grab your navigator's talking map, and let's embark on a journey of discovery and learning. Who knows what wonders we'll uncover together!\nEmbark on an Epic Quest with Your Map of Everything!\nWelcome to a world brimming with endless possibilities! Imagine you're starting a grand adventure with two special maps in your hands. The first is your \"map of something\" – it's a map of what you already know, like your neighborhood, your favorite park, or the subjects you've learned in school. The second is a truly magical map, the \"map of everything,\" and it knows every secret and wonder in the world.\nYour Map and the Map of Everything: Your map might show where you live, where your school is, or where you've been on vacation. It's familiar and comfortable. But the \"map of everything\" is different. It's like a guide that knows all the places you've never seen or even imagined. When you tell this map about the places on your personal map, it starts to create paths to new, incredible destinations.\nJourney Beyond the Known: Think of your \"map of everything\" as a magical companion. Once you share with it where you are on your \"map of something,\" it begins to light up paths to extraordinary places. It could reveal a path from your backyard to a jungle full of talking animals, or from your classroom to a castle in the clouds!\nDiscovering New Worlds Together: Your \"map of everything\" doesn't just take you to new places; it also asks you questions and suggests adventures. It might ask, \"Do you want to see where the dinosaurs lived?\" or suggest, \"Let's find out what's at the edge of the universe!\" With every question and suggestion, it helps you explore worlds beyond your wildest dreams.\nYour Adventure Awaits: With these two maps, you're not just an explorer – you're a master navigator of knowledge and imagination. The \"map of everything\" guides you to the unknown, to help you discover and learn about amazing things you've never even thought about.\nAre You Ready to Explore the Unknown? Grab your \"map of something\" and join hands with your \"map of everything.\" Let's set off on a journey of endless discovery, where each step takes you to a new world of wonder and excitement!\n\n\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think for Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.\n\n\nINSPIRE Aligned with SCRIBER and Assessments:\n\nINSPIRE Framework \nDescription\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nSCRIBER Framework \nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis.\nSeek: Encouraging exploratory and deep questions.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nReflect: Promoting reflection through guided questioning and critical thinking.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nInquire: Learners guide their learning path with AI assistance.\nProblem Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nCritique: Seeking feedback and perspectives to tackle problems.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\nBroaden/Contract: Seeking diverse perspectives and refining ideas collaboratively.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nRecurse: Building resilience through iterative questioning and problem-solving.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nExplain: Deepening experiential learning through AI challenges.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\nAll SCRIBER Elements: Enhancing self-efficacy through various learning aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\nINSPIRE Pedagalogical View\nFramework Element\nDescription\nImpact Measurement\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nDepth and complexity of inquiry by learners.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nConnection between personal experiences and learning objectives.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nProgress towards self-set learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nProblem-Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-solving skills and application of knowledge.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative skills and interaction quality.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nPerseverance in learning challenges.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nApplication of theoretical knowledge in practice.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nConfidence in managing entrepreneurial challenges.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\n\n\n\n"

If you want to use LLMs effectively, you must comprehend the concept\nof traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you\ndidn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know\nyou needed to do.\nOver hundreds of hours of GPT use since last December, we’ve built this intuition. Now we’re\nsharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while\ndeveloping their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results.\nThis is how you learn prompting.\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire,\nBroaden/contract, Explain, Recurse) and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent\nresults from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions.\nLet’s ease in with a simplified explanation as if you were five years old.\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R Like You’re Five\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\n● \nSet Sail on an Adventure with Your Navigator's Talking Map!\n● \nWelcome to a world of discovery and imagination! On this journey, you're not just wandering; you're an\nintrepid navigator with an extraordinary companion – a talking map. This map is no ordinary paper; it's\nalive with knowledge and adventure!\n● \nYour Interactive Guide: The talking map knows about every nook and cranny of the world. It doesn't just\nshow you places; it talks about them, suggests where to explore, and helps you think of questions about\nunknown corners of the world.\n● \nJourney Across the Map: As you travel with your map, it might say, \"Have you ever wondered what lies\nbeyond that mountain range?\" even when you don’t know there is a mountain range, because it has a\nmaps eye view :D or \"Let's explore what's inside the belly of a fish at the bottom of the ocean!\" It's\nalways ready to take you to new places and open up worlds you have yet to think to discover.\n\n● \nThe Power of Curiosity: Your map's magic lies in its ability to spark your curiosity. Every new place it\npoints out and every question it suggests is like unlocking a hidden treasure of knowledge. It\nencourages you to think, explore, and learn about things far beyond the ordinary.\n● \nNavigating the Unknown: Remember, with your talking map, you're the navigator of your adventure. It's\nthere to guide you, show you hidden paths, and inspire you to ask questions and find answers.\n● \nReady to Discover Hidden Treasures? So, grab your navigator's talking map, and let's embark on a\njourney of discovery and learning. Who knows what wonders we'll uncover together!\nEmbark on an Epic Quest with Your Map of Everything!\nWelcome to a world brimming with endless possibilities! Imagine you're starting a grand\nadventure with two special maps in your hands. The first is your \"map of something\" – it's a map of\nwhat you already know, like your neighborhood, your favorite park, or the subjects you've learned in\nschool. The second is a truly magical map, the \"map of everything,\" and it knows every secret and\nwonder in the world.\nYour Map and the Map of Everything: Your map might show where you live, where your school is,\nor where you've been on vacation. It's familiar and comfortable. But the \"map of everything\" is\ndifferent. It's like a guide that knows all the places you've never seen or even imagined. When you\ntell this map about the places on your personal map, it starts to create paths to new, incredible\ndestinations.\nJourney Beyond the Known: Think of your \"map of everything\" as a magical companion. Once you\nshare with it where you are on your \"map of something,\" it begins to light up paths to extraordinary\nplaces. It could reveal a path from your backyard to a jungle full of talking animals, or from your\nclassroom to a castle in the clouds!\nDiscovering New Worlds Together: Your \"map of everything\" doesn't just take you to new places; it\nalso asks you questions and suggests adventures. It might ask, \"Do you want to see where the\ndinosaurs lived?\" or suggest, \"Let's find out what's at the edge of the universe!\" With every question\nand suggestion, it helps you explore worlds beyond your wildest dreams.\nYour Adventure Awaits: With these two maps, you're not just an explorer – you're a master\nnavigator of knowledge and imagination. The \"map of everything\" guides you to the unknown, to\nhelp you discover and learn about amazing things you've never even thought about.\nAre You Ready to Explore the Unknown? Grab your \"map of something\" and join hands with your\n\"map of everything.\" Let's set off on a journey of endless discovery, where each step takes you to a\nnew world of wonder and excitement!\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and\nsome find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there,\nyet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you\nmove around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you\nthat you “can’t see.”\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you.\nWe developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to\nteach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t\neven know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the\nworld.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\n● \nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\n● \nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\n● \nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\n● \nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\n● \nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\n● \nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\n● \nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\n1. \nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\n2. \nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\n3. \nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can\nemerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on\nthe principles. It is what matters in the end.\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list.\nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a\nmindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought.\n\nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up\nrecipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are.\nIt’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge.\nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n📙\nWay of Being\n❤\nTechnique\n🤲\nPrinciple\n🧠\nSeek \nInquisitive and\nOpen-minded\nAsking questions like:\n“Who would know how to\nanswer this question, what\nis their job?” and\n“What guidelines would\nthey follow?”\n“What would Steve Jobs\nsay in response to this\nquestion?”\n(The more information and\nthe more specific you make\nit, the better.\nExploration:\nGet the AI to show you what\nyou don’t know by giving it as\nmuch as you know and then\nasking what you’re missing.\nUse AI to explore various\n'neighborhoods' of\nknowledge\nCritique and\nexplain\nReceptive to\nFeedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for\ncritiques from a persona\nwho will disagree.\nFor instance, if you’re a\ngrant writer, ask for a review\nfrom a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and\nintegrating feedback to refine\nideas and approaches.\nReflect \nThoughtfully\nCritical\nGenerate “worksheets” to\nfill for yourself. You can ask\nfor templates, frameworks,\nworksheets, and guidelines\nAFTER identifying the\ndomain expert. Once you\npick your template, ask it to\nask you questions to fill in a\ntemplate for your topic.\nTHEN review it and reflect\non it on your own with a\npencil/paper.\nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think\nwith paper. Let the LLM get\nyou close and then walk the\nrest of the way to develop\ncritical thinking and depth in\nunderstanding through\nreflective practices.\nInquire \nCurious and\nrigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its\nreasoning process. Ask it to\nsummarize the critique and\nexplain why the grant\nreviewer thinks that way. To\nAI Transparency:\nAsk the LLM to explain itself\nso YOU can catch the\nmistakes. This is also why\nyou should break down each\n\nmove step by step and keep\nprompts small.\nmajor step into its own\nprompt.\nBroaden /\nContract \nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X\nnumber of diverse and\nnon-overlapping options to\nyour question. Ask it to\ncritique them and ask you\nquestions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand\noptions into the\nneighborhood’s unknown\nspace can help you pick the\nnon-obvious best option.\nExplain \nInquisitive\nChallenger\nAI is the devil's advocate\nand asks probing\nquestions.

The framework, called INSPIRE-AI (Inquiry-based, Narrative-driven, Self-directed, Personalized, Interactive, Reflective, and Engaging AI-assisted Learning), integrates key elements from the INSPIRE pedagogy, such as inquiry-based learning, narrative and reflective learning, and self-efficacy development, with AI-powered tools and techniques to create a personalized, engaging learning experience.\n\nThe study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data from learning analytics and assessments with qualitative data from learner interviews and reflective journals. The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the INSPIRE-AI framework in promoting self-directed learning, increasing learner engagement, and improving learning outcomes across various domains.\n\nThe findings suggest that the INSPIRE-AI framework successfully supports learners in developing the skills and mindsets necessary for self-directed learning, such as curiosity, critical thinking, and resilience. Learners reported increased confidence in their ability to navigate complex topics, identify knowledge gaps, and seek out relevant resources. The AI-assisted scaffolding provided personalized guidance and feedback, adapting to learners' individual needs and preferences.\n\nThe study concludes that the INSPIRE-AI framework offers a promising approach to fostering self-directed learning in the era of AI-enhanced education. By leveraging the strengths of both human-centered pedagogy and AI-powered tools, the framework empowers learners to take control of their learning journey, develop a growth mindset, and cultivate a lifelong love for learning. The research highlights the potential for AI to serve as a powerful ally in supporting learners' autonomy, engagement, and self-efficacy.\n\nFuture research should explore the long-term impact of the INSPIRE-AI framework on learners' academic and personal growth, as well as its applicability across different educational contexts and demographic groups. Additionally, further investigation into the ethical implications of AI-assisted learning and the role of educators in facilitating these experiences is warranted.\n\nConclusion:\nThe INSPIRE-AI framework represents a significant step forward in the design of adaptive, AI-enhanced learning experiences that prioritize learner autonomy, engagement, and self-efficacy. By synergistically combining the principles of the INSPIRE pedagogy with the capabilities of AI-powered tools, the framework offers a roadmap for creating learning environments that empower learners to take control of their own learning journey and develop the skills and mindsets necessary for lifelong learning.\n\nThe research demonstrates the potential for AI to serve as a powerful ally in supporting self-directed learning, providing personalized guidance, feedback, and resources tailored to each learner's unique needs and preferences. The INSPIRE-AI framework successfully promotes the development of key skills and dispositions, such as curiosity, critical thinking, resilience, and a growth mindset, which are essential for navigating the complexities of the 21st-century knowledge landscape.\n\nAs AI continues to transform the educational landscape, it is crucial that we develop frameworks and approaches that center on learners' needs, aspirations, and well-being. The INSPIRE-AI framework offers a promising model for leveraging the strengths of both human-centered pedagogy and AI-powered tools to create learning experiences that are engaging, empowering, and transformative.\n\nFuture research should build upon the findings of this study, exploring the long-term impact of the INSPIRE-AI framework on learners' academic and personal growth, as well as its potential applications across diverse educational contexts and populations. Additionally, ongoing dialogue and collaboration among educators, researchers, and AI developers are essential to ensure that AI-enhanced learning experiences are designed and implemented in an ethical, equitable, and learner-centered manner.\n\nIn conclusion, the INSPIRE-AI framework represents a significant contribution to the field of AI-enhanced education, offering a roadmap for creating adaptive, engaging, and empowering learning experiences that foster self-directed learning, cultivate a growth mindset, and prepare learners for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",

      "content": " Project Summary:\nThe proposed project aims to develop an API endpoint that functions as a \"man in the middle\" between users and AI language models like ChatGPT or Claude. This API endpoint will guide users to employ the INSPIRE-AI framework's prompting techniques and strategies while interacting with the AI. The ultimate goal is for users to internalize these techniques, eventually allowing them to communicate directly with the AI without the need for the intermediary API.\n\nPros:\n1. Scaffolded learning: The API endpoint provides a structured approach to help users learn and apply effective prompting techniques.\n2. Improved user experience: By guiding users to ask better questions and provide clearer context, the API can help users get more accurate and relevant responses from the AI.\n3. Increased adoption: The API can lower the barrier to entry for users who are new to AI-assisted learning, making it more accessible and user-friendly.\n4. Customization: The API can be tailored to specific domains or user groups, providing targeted guidance and support.\n5. Scalability: Once developed, the API can be easily integrated into various platforms and applications, reaching a wide audience.\n\nCons:\n1. Complexity: Developing an API that accurately interprets user prompts and provides meaningful guidance based on the INSPIRE-AI framework may be challenging.\n2. User dependency: Some users may become overly reliant on the API's guidance, hindering their ability to internalize the techniques and communicate directly with the AI.\n3. Limited flexibility: The API's guidance may not always align with the user's specific needs or goals, potentially limiting their ability to explore and experiment.\n4. Maintenance: As AI language models and the INSPIRE-AI framework evolve, the API will require ongoing updates and maintenance to remain effective.\n5. Privacy concerns: Routing user prompts through an intermediary API may raise privacy concerns, particularly if the API stores or analyzes user data.\n\nImprovements:\n1. Adaptive guidance: Develop the API to provide personalized guidance based on the user's skill level, learning style, and goals. As users progress, the API can gradually reduce its involvement, fostering independence.\n2. Explainable AI: Incorporate explanations and examples into the API's guidance, helping users understand the reasoning behind the suggested prompting techniques.\n3. Gamification: Introduce game-like elements, such as challenges, rewards, and progress tracking, to keep users engaged and motivated to learn and apply the INSPIRE-AI framework.\n4. User feedback loop: Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the API's guidance, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of the prompting techniques.\n5. Secure and transparent data handling: Ensure that the API follows best practices for data security and privacy, and clearly communicate to users how their data is being used and protected.\n6. Integration with learning platforms: Partner with existing learning platforms and tools to seamlessly integrate the API, providing a cohesive and enhanced learning experience.\n7. Community support: Foster a community of users and experts who can share their experiences, tips, and best practices for using the INSPIRE-AI framework and the API effectively.\n\nBy addressing these improvements, the proposed API endpoint can become a powerful tool for helping users learn and apply effective prompting techniques, ultimately enabling them to engage in more productive and meaningful interactions with AI language models like ChatGPT and Claude.",

Performance and Scalability\n   - Optimize the API endpoint for fast response times and low latency\n   - Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage\n   - Design the architecture to be scalable, allowing for future growth and increased user demand\n\nPotential Blindspots:\n1. User onboarding and education: Providing sufficient guidance and resources to help users understand how to effectively use the INSPIRE-AI framework and the API endpoint.\n2. Customization and flexibility: Allowing users to adjust the level of guidance or opt-out of certain suggestions based on their preferences or needs.\n3. Feedback loop: Incorporating a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the quality and relevance of the INSPIRE-AI framework suggestions.\n4. Monitoring and analytics: Implementing tools to track usage patterns, performance metrics, and user satisfaction to inform future improvements.\n5. Compliance and legal considerations: Ensuring that the API endpoint and the INSPIRE-AI framework guidance comply with relevant laws, regulations, and terms of service of the ChatGPT API.\n\nBy focusing on a single API endpoint that integrates with ChatGPT and provides lightweight INSPIRE-AI framework guidance, we can create a simple yet effective tool for users to improve their prompts and get better results from ChatGPT. This simplified approach allows for faster development and deployment while still addressing the core goals of the project.",

      "content": " To use Loopback to create an API endpoint that integrates with AI@bloom.pm, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install Node.js and Loopback CLI:\n   - Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/)\n   - Open a terminal and install the Loopback CLI globally by running `npm install -g @loopback/cli`\n\n2. Create a new Loopback project:\n   - In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project\n   - Run `lb4 app` to start the Loopback application generator\n   - Follow the prompts to set up your project (e.g., project name, description, etc.)\n\n3. Create a new Loopback model:\n   - In the terminal, navigate to your project directory\n   - Run `lb4 model` to create a new model for handling the API requests\n   - Define the properties of the model (e.g., prompt, apiKey, response)\n\n4. Create a new Loopback datasource:\n   - Run `lb4 datasource` to create a new datasource for your chosen database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)\n   - Follow the prompts to configure the datasource (e.g., database URL, credentials)\n\n5. Create a new Loopback repository:\n   - Run `lb4 repository` to create a new repository for your model\n   - Select the datasource you created in the previous step\n\n6. Create a new Loopback controller:\n   - Run `lb4 controller` to create a new controller for handling the API endpoint\n   - Select the repository you created in the previous step\n   - Define the HTTP methods for the endpoint (e.g., POST)\n\n7. Implement the API endpoint logic:\n   - Open the controller file created in the previous step\n   - Modify the POST method to accept the user prompt and API key from the request body\n   - Extract the API key from the request and validate it\n   - Use the `@loopback/rest` package to make a POST request to the AI@bloom.pm API, passing the user prompt in the request body\n   - Retrieve the response from AI@bloom.pm and return it to the user\n\n8. Configure the API endpoint:\n   - Open the `src/application.ts` file\n   - Add the necessary import statements for your controller and model\n   - Register your controller with the Loopback application\n\n9. Test the API endpoint:\n   - Start your Loopback application by running `npm start`\n   - Use a tool like Postman or cURL to make a POST request to your API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/prompt`)\n   - Include the user prompt and API key in the request body (e.g., `{ \"prompt\": \"Hello, how are you?\", \"apiKey\": \"your_api_key_here\" }`)\n   - Verify that you receive a response from AI@bloom.pm\n\n10. Deploy your Loopback application:\n    - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean)\n    - Follow the platform's deployment instructions for Node.js applications\n    - Set the necessary environment variables (e.g., database URL, AI@bloom.pm API key)\n    - Start your deployed application and test the API endpoint\n\nRegarding adding the API key to the subject line, it's generally not recommended to include sensitive information like API keys in the URL or subject line of an email.

Install Node.js and Loopback CLI:\n   - Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/)\n   - Open a terminal and install the Loopback CLI globally by running `npm install -g @loopback/cli`\n\n2. Create a new Loopback project:\n   - In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project\n   - Run `lb4 app` to start the Loopback application generator\n   - Follow the prompts to set up your project (e.g., project name, description, etc.)\n\n3. Create a new Loopback model:\n   - In the terminal, navigate to your project directory\n   - Run `lb4 model` to create a new model for handling the API requests\n   - Define the properties of the model (e.g., prompt, apiKey, response)\n\n4. Create a new Loopback datasource:\n   - Run `lb4 datasource` to create a new datasource for your chosen database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)\n   - Follow the prompts to configure the datasource (e.g., database URL, credentials)\n\n5. Create a new Loopback repository:\n   - Run `lb4 repository` to create a new repository for your model\n   - Select the datasource you created in the previous step\n\n6. Create a new Loopback controller:\n   - Run `lb4 controller` to create a new controller for handling the API endpoint\n   - Select the repository you created in the previous step\n   - Define the HTTP methods for the endpoint (e.g., POST)\n\n7. Implement the API endpoint logic:\n   - Open the controller file created in the previous step\n   - Modify the POST method to accept the user prompt and API key from the request body\n   - Extract the API key from the request and validate it\n   - Use the `@loopback/rest` package to make a POST request to the AI@bloom.pm API, passing the user prompt in the request body\n   - Retrieve the response from AI@bloom.pm and return it to the user\n\n8.

            "extracted_content": "Promptrix\n\nPromptrix is a a prompt layout engine for Large Language Models. It approaches laying out a fixed length prompt the same way a UI engine would approach laying out a fixed width set of columns for a UI. Replace token with character and the same exact concepts and algorithms apply. Promptrix breaks a prompt into sections and each section can be given a token budget that's either a fixed set of tokens, or proportional to the overall remaining tokens.\n\nAll prompt sections are potentially asynchronous and rendered in parallel. Fixed length sections are rendered first and then proportional sections are rendered second so they can proportionally divide up the remaining token budget. Sections can also be marked as optional and will be automatically dropped should the token budget get constrained.\n\nPromptrix also supports generating prompts for both Text Completion and Chat Completion style API's. It will automatically convert from one style prompt to the other while maintaining accurate token counting.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo install Promptrix using NPM:\n\nnpm install promptrix\nOr to install using Yarn:\n\nyarn add promptrix\nBasic Usage\n\nIt's best to think of Promptrix prompts as a stack of Chat Completion messages as Promptix will automatically convert from messages to text when rendering for a Text Completion style API. So with that in mind a super simple Promptrix prompt would look like:\n\nimport { Prompt, SystemMessage, UserMessage } from \"promptrix\";\n\nconst prompt = new Prompt([\n  new SystemMessage(`The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.`),\n  new UserMessage(`{{$input}}`)\n]);\nThe SystemMessage, UserMessage, and AssistantMessage sections all derive from a class called TemplateSection which means they all support a rich templating syntax capable of passing in {{$variables}} or calling asyncronous {{functions}}. Functions can even take arguments like this {{readSomeFiles 5 \"c:/my/folder path\"}}. And everything is geared towards performance so not only are sections rendered in parallel, all template functions are rendered in parallel.\n\nWe can render the prompt above by creating a memory store, function registry, and tokenizer.\n\nimport { VolatileMemory, FunctionRegistry, GPT3Tokenizer } from \"promptrix\";\n\nconst memory = new VolatileMemory({ input: \"hello\" });\nconst functions = new FunctionRegistry();\nconst tokenizer = new GPT3Tokenizer();\nconst maxTokens = 2000;\n\n// Render the prompt for a Chat Completion call\nconst asMessages = await prompt.renderAsMessages(memory, function, tokenizer, maxTokens);\nif (!asMessages.tooLong) {\n  const messages = asMessages.output;\n}\n\n// Render the prompt for a Text Completion call\nconst asText = await prompt.renderAsText(memory, function, tokenizer, maxTokens);\nif (!asText.tooLong) {\n  const text = asText.output;\n}\nEach render call returns the \"output\" as either a message[]|string, the \"length\" in tokens, and \"tooLong\" flag indicating whether the prompt was truncated or not.\n\nAdding Conversation History\n\nWe can easily add conversation history to our original prompt:\n\nimport { Prompt, SystemMessage, UserMessage, ConversationHistory, VolatileMemory } from \"promptrix\";\n\nconst prompt = new Prompt([\n  new SystemMessage(`The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.`),\n  new ConversationHistory('history'),\n  new UserMessage(`{{$input}}`)\n]);\n\nconst memory = new VolatileMemory({\n  history: [\n    { type: 'user', 'hello' },\n    { type: 'assistant', 'Hello how are you?' }\n  ],\n  input: \"I'm doing ok\"\n});\nThe ConversationHistory section needs to be told the name of the memory variable to use and is an optional section by default so it will be automatically dropped should the prompt start getting to big.\n\nProportional Sizing\n\nAll sections 3 different sizing strategies; auto, proportional, or fixed. Strategy selection is done by passing in a numerical value for the sections tokens parameter and breaks down as follows:\n\n-1: This indicates an auto length section and is the default for most sections. The section will be rendered as normal but will be flagged as being tooLong if the rendered length is greater then the remaining token budget.\n0.0 - 1.0: This indicates a proportional length section and is the percentage of remaining tokens to use. Proportional sections are rendered after fixed & auto length sections and the render budget they're passed in is a percentage of the remaining tokens.\n> 1.0: Any value greater then 1 is considered a fixed length sections. Fixed length sections render similarly to auto length sections but any tokens over the specified token length will be truncated.\nIt's easiest to think of this as being similar to column sizing in UI layouts. You can have as many proportional sections as you want but the total distribution of those sections should add up to 1.0. Fixed length sections make it less likely that you'll run out of tokens and are useful for capping things like the users message. We can update our to explicitly set the sizing strategy for each section:\n\nconst prompt = new Prompt([\n  new SystemMessage(`The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.`, -1),\n  new ConversationHistory('history', 1.0),\n  new UserMessage(`{{$input}}`, 100)\n]);\nThis basically says that the SystemMessage should be rendered as an auto length section, the UserMessage should be rendered as a fixed length section that's capped at 100 tokens, and any remaining tokens can be used by ConversationHistory section. In this example the SystemMessage is 23 tokens and lets say the users message is 7 tokens. That's a total of 30 tokens consumed during the initial phase of rendering. So with an overall maxTokens of 2000, the ConversationHistory will be allowed to use up to 1970 tokens.\n\nOptional Sections\n\nMost sections are required by default but they can be marked as optional by settings the prompts required parameter to false. Optional sections will start being dropped should the prompt begin running out of available input tokens. The ConversationHistory sections is optional by default so lets imagine a prompt that does a 50/50 split between the ConversationHistory and UserMessage sections:\n\nconst prompt = new Prompt([\n  new SystemMessage(`The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.`),\n  new ConversationHistory('history', 0.5),\n  new UserMessage(`{{$input}}`, 0.5)\n]);\nThe ConversationHistory section has built in token budgeting so it will never use more the 50% of the remaining tokens. The UserMessage section has no such budgeting logic to it will happily go over the 50% budget. If the combined token usage is less then the remaining tokens then fine, but if it's over, the prompt will still try to make things work by dropping optional section. Since the ConversationHistory is optional by default (you can mark it as required) this section will get dropped. If the prompt is still over budget and there are no more optional sections to drop, it will be flagged as tooLong.\n\nOptional sections are dropped in reverse order so the last optional section is always dropped first. Keep that in mind when ordering your prompts and place more important, but optional, sections towards the top of the prompt.\n\nCustom Sections\n\nSo what if we wanted to call a function to inject some semantic memory into a prompt:\n\nclass PineconeMemory extends PromptSectionBase {\n  constructor(settings, tokens) {\n    super(tokens);\n    this.settings = settings;\n  }\n\n  async renderAsMessages(memory, functions, tokenizer, maxTokens) {\n    const input = memory.get('input');\n\n    // ... fetch up to maxTokens worth of snippets from pinecone.\n\n    return { output: `memory:\\n` + snippets, length: snippetsLength, tooLong: fale };\n  }\n}\n\nconst prompt = new Prompt([\n  new PineconeMemory({pinecone settings}, 0.8),\n  new ConversationHistory('history', 0.2),\n  new SystemMessage(`Answer the users question only if you can find it in the memory above.`, 100),\n  new UserMessage(`{{$input}}`, 100)\n]);\nWe defined a new custom section that retrieves memories from pinecone and then we did an 80/20 split of the remaining token budget betwoen our PineconeMemory section and our ConversationHistory section. That means that if the other two fixed sections consume a combined 20 tokens, PineconeMemory will get a budget of 1584 tokens and ConversationHistory will get a budget of 396 tokens."

            "extracted_content": "Quickstart\n\nIn this quickstart we'll show you how to:\n\nGet setup with LangChain, LangSmith and LangServe\nUse the most basic and common components of LangChain: prompt templates, models, and output parsers\nUse LangChain Expression Language, the protocol that LangChain is built on and which facilitates component chaining\nBuild a simple application with LangChain\nTrace your application with LangSmith\nServe your application with LangServe\nThat's a fair amount to cover! Let's dive in.\n\nSetup\n\nJupyter Notebook\n\nThis guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses Jupyter notebooks and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n\nYou do not NEED to go through the guide in a Jupyter Notebook, but it is recommended. See here for instructions on how to install.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo install LangChain run:\n\nPip\nConda\npip install langchain\n\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\n\nLangSmith\n\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with LangSmith.\n\nNote that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\nexport LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\n\nBuilding with LangChain\n\nLangChain enables building application that connect external sources of data and computation to LLMs. In this quickstart, we will walk through a few different ways of doing that. We will start with a simple LLM chain, which just relies on information in the prompt template to respond. Next, we will build a retrieval chain, which fetches data from a separate database and passes that into the prompt template. We will then add in chat history, to create a conversation retrieval chain. This allows you to interact in a chat manner with this LLM, so it remembers previous questions. Finally, we will build an agent - which utilizes an LLM to determine whether or not it needs to fetch data to answer questions. We will cover these at a high level, but there are lot of details to all of these! We will link to relevant docs.\n\nLLM Chain\n\nWe'll show how to use models available via API, like OpenAI, and local open source models, using integrations like Ollama.\n\nOpenAI\nLocal (using Ollama)\nAnthropic\nCohere\nFirst we'll need to import the LangChain x OpenAI integration package.\n\npip install langchain-openai\n\nAccessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:\n\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"\n\nWe can then initialize the model:\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI()\n\nIf you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the api_key named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class:\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nllm = ChatOpenAI(api_key=\"...\")\n\nOnce you've installed and initialized the LLM of your choice, we can try using it! Let's ask it what LangSmith is - this is something that wasn't present in the training data so it shouldn't have a very good response.\n\nllm.invoke(\"how can langsmith help with testing?\")\n\nWe can also guide its response with a prompt template. Prompt templates convert raw user input to better input to the LLM.\n\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n    (\"system\", \"You are world class technical documentation writer.\"),\n    (\"user\", \"{input}\")\n])\n\nWe can now combine these into a simple LLM chain:\n\nchain = prompt | llm \n\nWe can now invoke it and ask the same question. It still won't know the answer, but it should respond in a more proper tone for a technical writer!\n\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"how can langsmith help with testing?\"})\n\nThe output of a ChatModel (and therefore, of this chain) is a message. However, it's often much more convenient to work with strings. Let's add a simple output parser to convert the chat message to a string.\n\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\n\nWe can now add this to the previous chain:\n\nchain = prompt | llm | output_parser\n\nWe can now invoke it and ask the same question. The answer will now be a string (rather than a ChatMessage).\n\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"how can langsmith help with testing?\"})\n\nDiving Deeper\n\nWe've now successfully set up a basic LLM chain. We only touched on the basics of prompts, models, and output parsers - for a deeper dive into everything mentioned here, see this section of documentation.\n\nRetrieval Chain\n\nTo properly answer the original question (\"how can langsmith help with testing?\"), we need to provide additional context to the LLM. We can do this via retrieval. Retrieval is useful when you have too much data to pass to the LLM directly. You can then use a retriever to fetch only the most relevant pieces and pass those in.\n\nIn this process, we will look up relevant documents from a Retriever and then pass them into the prompt. A Retriever can be backed by anything - a SQL table, the internet, etc - but in this instance we will populate a vector store and use that as a retriever. For more information on vectorstores, see this documentation.\n\nFirst, we need to load the data that we want to index. To do this, we will use the WebBaseLoader. This requires installing BeautifulSoup:\n\npip install beautifulsoup4\n\nAfter that, we can import and use WebBaseLoader.\n\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\"https://docs.smith.langchain.com/user_guide\")\n\ndocs = loader.load()\n\nNext, we need to index it into a vectorstore. This requires a few components, namely an embedding model and a vectorstore.\n\nFor embedding models, we once again provide examples for accessing via API or by running local models.\n\nOpenAI (API)\nLocal (using Ollama)\nCohere (API)\nMake sure you have the `langchain_openai` package installed an the appropriate environment variables set (these are the same as needed for the LLM).\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n\nNow, we can use this embedding model to ingest documents into a vectorstore. We will use a simple local vectorstore, FAISS, for simplicity's sake.\n\nFirst we need to install the required packages for that:\n\npip install faiss-cpu\n\nThen we can build our index:\n\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n\n\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter()\ndocuments = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\nvector = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)\n\nNow that we have this data indexed in a vectorstore, we will create a retrieval chain. This chain will take an incoming question, look up relevant documents, then pass those documents along with the original question into an LLM and ask it to answer the original question.\n\nFirst, let's set up the chain that takes a question and the retrieved documents and generates an answer.\n\nfrom langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"\"\"Answer the following question based only on the provided context:\n\n<context>\n{context}\n</context>\n\nQuestion: {input}\"\"\")\n\ndocument_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)\n\n\nIf we wanted to, we could run this ourselves by passing in documents directly:\n\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\n\ndocument_chain.invoke({\n    \"input\": \"how can langsmith help with testing?\",\n    \"context\": [Document(page_content=\"langsmith can let you visualize test results\")]\n})\n\nHowever, we want the documents to first come from the retriever we just set up. That way, we can use the retriever to dynamically select the most relevant documents and pass those in for a given question.\n\nfrom langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain\n\nretriever = vector.as_retriever()\nretrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, document_chain)\n\nWe can now invoke this chain. This returns a dictionary - the response from the LLM is in the answer key\n\nresponse = retrieval_chain.invoke({\"input\": \"how can langsmith help with testing?\"})\nprint(response[\"answer\"])\n\n# LangSmith offers several features that can help with testing:...\n\nThis answer should be much more accurate!\n\nDiving Deeper\n\nWe've now successfully set up a basic retrieval chain. We only touched on the basics of retrieval - for a deeper dive into everything mentioned here, see this section of documentation.\n\nConversation Retrieval Chain\n\nThe chain we've created so far can only answer single questions. One of the main types of LLM applications that people are building are chat bots. So how do we turn this chain into one that can answer follow up questions?\n\nWe can still use the create_retrieval_chain function, but we need to change two things:\n\nThe retrieval method should now not just work on the most recent input, but rather should take the whole history into account.\nThe final LLM chain should likewise take the whole history into account\nUpdating Retrieval\n\nIn order to update retrieval, we will create a new chain. This chain will take in the most recent input (input) and the conversation history (chat_history) and use an LLM to generate a search query.\n\nfrom langchain.chains import create_history_aware_retriever\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder\n\n# First we need a prompt that we can pass into an LLM to generate this search query\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"chat_history\"),\n    (\"user\", \"{input}\"),\n    (\"user\", \"Given the above conversation, generate a search query to look up to get information relevant to the conversation\")\n])\nretriever_chain = create_history_aware_retriever(llm, retriever, prompt)\n\n\nWe can test this out by passing in an instance where the user asks a follow-up question.\n\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage\n\nchat_history = [HumanMessage(content=\"Can LangSmith help test my LLM applications?\"), AIMessage(content=\"Yes!\")]\nretriever_chain.invoke({\n    \"chat_history\": chat_history,\n    \"input\": \"Tell me how\"\n})\n\n\nYou should see that this returns documents about testing in LangSmith. This is because the LLM generated a new query, combining the chat history with the follow-up question.\n\nNow that we have this new retriever, we can create a new chain to continue the conversation with these retrieved documents in mind.\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n    (\"system\", \"Answer the user's questions based on the below context:\\n\\n{context}\"),\n    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"chat_history\"),\n    (\"user\", \"{input}\"),\n])\ndocument_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)\n\nretrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever_chain, document_chain)\n\nWe can now test this out end-to-end:\n\nchat_history = [HumanMessage(content=\"Can LangSmith help test my LLM applications?\"), AIMessage(content=\"Yes!\")]\nretrieval_chain.invoke({\n    \"chat_history\": chat_history,\n    \"input\": \"Tell me how\"\n})\n\n\nWe can see that this gives a coherent answer - we've successfully turned our retrieval chain into a chatbot!\n\nAgent\n\nWe've so far created examples of chains - where each step is known ahead of time. The final thing we will create is an agent - where the LLM decides what steps to take.\n\nNOTE: for this example we will only show how to create an agent using OpenAI models, as local models are not reliable enough yet.\n\nOne of the first things to do when building an agent is to decide what tools it should have access to. For this example, we will give the agent access to two tools:\n\nThe retriever we just created. This will let it easily answer questions about LangSmith\nA search tool. This will let it easily answer questions that require up-to-date information.\nFirst, let's set up a tool for the retriever we just created:\n\nfrom langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool\n\nretriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(\n    retriever,\n    \"langsmith_search\",\n    \"Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!\",\n)\n\n\nThe search tool that we will use is Tavily. This will require an API key (they have generous free tier). After creating it on their platform, you need to set it as an environment variable:\n\nexport TAVILY_API_KEY=...\n\nIf you do not want to set up an API key, you can skip creating this tool.\n\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n\nsearch = TavilySearchResults()\n\nWe can now create a list of the tools we want to work with:\n\ntools = [retriever_tool, search]\n\nNow that we have the tools, we can create an agent to use them. We will go over this pretty quickly - for a deeper dive into what exactly is going on, check out the Agent's Getting Started documentation\n\nInstall langchain hub first\n\npip install langchainhub\n\nInstall the langchain-openai package To interact with OpenAI we need to use langchain-openai which connects with OpenAI SDK[https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/partners/openai].\n\npip install langchain-openai\n\nNow we can use it to get a predefined prompt\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain import hub\nfrom langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentExecutor\n\n# Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!\nprompt = hub.pull(\"hwchase17/openai-functions-agent\")\n\n# You need to set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable or pass it as argument `api_key`.\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0)\nagent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)\nagent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)\n\nWe can now invoke the agent and see how it responds! We can ask it questions about LangSmith:\n\nagent_executor.invoke({\"input\": \"how can langsmith help with testing?\"})\n\nWe can ask it about the weather:\n\nagent_executor.invoke({\"input\": \"what is the weather in SF?\"})\n\nWe can have conversations with it:\n\nchat_history = [HumanMessage(content=\"Can LangSmith help test my LLM applications?\"), AIMessage(content=\"Yes!\")]\nagent_executor.invoke({\n    \"chat_history\": chat_history,\n    \"input\": \"Tell me how\"\n})\n\n\nDiving Deeper\n\nWe've now successfully set up a basic agent. We only touched on the basics of agents - for a deeper dive into everything mentioned here, see this section of documentation.\n\nServing with LangServe\n\nNow that we've built an application, we need to serve it. That's where LangServe comes in. LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain chains as a REST API. You do not need to use LangServe to use LangChain, but in this guide we'll show how you can deploy your app with LangServe.\n\nWhile the first part of this guide was intended to be run in a Jupyter Notebook, we will now move out of that. We will be creating a Python file and then interacting with it from the command line.\n\nInstall with:\n\npip install \"langserve[all]\"\n\nServer\n\nTo create a server for our application we'll make a serve.py file. This will contain our logic for serving our application. It consists of three things:\n\nThe definition of our chain that we just built above\nOur FastAPI app\nA definition of a route from which to serve the chain, which is done with langserve.add_routes\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom typing import List\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\nfrom langchain import hub\nfrom langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentExecutor\nfrom langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field\nfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\nfrom langserve import add_routes\n\n# 1.

Create Tools\nretriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(\n    retriever,\n    \"langsmith_search\",\n    \"Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!\",\n)\nsearch = TavilySearchResults()\ntools = [retriever_tool, search]\n\n\n# 3. Create Agent\nprompt = hub.pull(\"hwchase17/openai-functions-agent\")\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0)\nagent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)\nagent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)\n\n\n# 4. App definition\napp = FastAPI(\n  title=\"LangChain Server\",\n  version=\"1.0\",\n  description=\"A simple API server using LangChain's Runnable interfaces\",\n)\n\n# 5. Adding chain route\n\n# We need to add these input/output schemas because the current AgentExecutor\n# is lacking in schemas.\n\nclass Input(BaseModel):\n    input: str\n    chat_history: List[BaseMessage] = Field(\n        ...,\n        extra={\"widget\": {\"type\": \"chat\", \"input\": \"location\"}},\n    )\n\n\nclass Output(BaseModel):\n    output: str\n\nadd_routes(\n    app,\n    agent_executor.with_types(input_type=Input, output_type=Output),\n    path=\"/agent\",\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import uvicorn\n\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"localhost\", port=8000)\n\n\nAnd that's it! If we execute this file:\n\npython serve.py\n\nwe should see our chain being served at localhost:8000.\n\nPlayground\n\nEvery LangServe service comes with a simple built-in UI for configuring and invoking the application with streaming output and visibility into intermediate steps. Head to http://localhost:8000/agent/playground/ to try it out! Pass in the same question as before - \"how can langsmith help with testing?\" - and it should respond same as before.\n\nClient\n\nNow let's set up a client for programmatically interacting with our service. We can easily do this with the [langserve.RemoteRunnable](/docs/langserve#client). Using this, we can interact with the served chain as if it were running client-side.\n\nfrom langserve import RemoteRunnable\n\nremote_chain = RemoteRunnable(\"http://localhost:8000/agent/\")\nremote_chain.invoke({\n    \"input\": \"how can langsmith help with testing?\",\n    \"chat_history\": []  # Providing an empty list as this is the first call\n})\n\nTo learn more about the many other features of LangServe head here.\n\nNext steps\n\nWe've touched on how to build an application with LangChain, how to trace it with LangSmith, and how to serve it with LangServe. There are a lot more features in all three of these than we can cover here. To continue on your journey, we recommend you read the following (in order):\n\nAll of these features are backed by LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) - a way to chain these components together. Check out that documentation to better understand how to create custom chains.\nModel IO covers more details of prompts, LLMs, and output parsers.\nRetrieval covers more details of everything related to retrieval\nAgents covers details of everything related to agents\nExplore common end-to-end use cases and template applications\nRead up on LangSmith, the platform for debugging, testing, monitoring and more\nLearn more about serving your applications with LangServe"

            "extracted_content": "AlphaWave\n\nAlphaWave is a very opinionated client for interfacing with Large Language Models (LLM). It uses Promptrix for prompt management and has the following features:\n\nSupports calling OpenAI and Azure OpenAI hosted models out of the box but a simple plugin model lets you extend AlphaWave to support any LLM.\nPromptrix integration means that all prompts are universal and work with either Chat Completion or Text Completion API's.\nAutomatic history management. AlphaWave manages a prompts conversation history and all you have todo is tell it where to store it. It uses an in-memory store by default but a simple plugin interface (provided by Promptrix) lets you store short term memory, like conversation history, anywhere.\nState-of-the-art response repair logic. AlphaWave lets you provide an optional \"response validator\" plugin which it will use to validate every response returned from an LLM. Should a response fail validation, AlphaWave will automatically try to get the model to correct its mistake. More below...\nAutomatic Response Repair\n\nA key goal of AlphaWave is to be the most reliable mechanisms for talking to an LLM on the planet. If you lookup the wikipedia definition for Alpha Waves you see that it's believed that they may be used to help predict mistakes in the human brain. One of the key roles of the AlphaWave library is to help automatically correct for mistakes made by an LLM, leading to more reliable output. It can correct for everything from hallucinations to just malformed output. It does this by using a series of techniques.\n\nFirst it uses validation to programmatically verify the LLM's output. This would be the equivalent of a \"guard\" in other libraries like LangChain. When a validation fails, AlphaWave immediately forks the conversation to isolate the mistake. This is critical because the last thing you want to do is promote a mistake/hallucination to the conversation history as the LLM will just double down on the mistake. They are primarily pattern matchers.\n\nOnce AlphaWave has isolated the mistake, it will attempt to get the model to repair the mistake itself. It uses a process called \"feedback\" which simply tells the model the mistake it made and asks it to correct it. For GPT-4 this works more often then not in 1 turn. For the other models it sometimes works but it depends on the type of mistake. AlphaWave will even ask the model to slow down and think step-by-step on the last try, to give it every shot at fixing itself.\n\nIf the LLM can correct its mistake, AlphaWave will delete the conversation fork, write the corrected response to the conversation history, and move forward as if nothing ever happened. For GPT-4, you should be able to make several hundred sequential model calls before running into a sequence that can't be repaired.\n\nIn the event that the model isn't able to repair itself, a result with a status of invalid_response will be returned and the app can either abort the task or give it one more go. For well defined prompts and tasks I'd recommend given it one more go. The reason for that is that, if you've made it hundreds of model calls without it making a mistake, the odds of it making a mistake if you simply try again are low. You just hit the stochastic nature of talking to LLMs.\n\nSo why even use \"feedback\" at all if retrying can work? It doesn't always work. Some mistakes, especially hallucinations, the LLM will make over and over again. They need to be confronted with their mistake and then they will happily correct it. You need both appproaches, feedback & retry, to build a system that's as reliable as possible.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo get started, you'll want to install the latest versions of both AlphaWave and Promptrix. If you're using yarn:\n\nyarn add alphawave\nyarn add promptrix\nor if you're using npm:\n\nnpm install alphawave\nnpm install promptrix\nBasic Usage\n\nYou'll need to import a couple of components from \"alphawave\", along with the various prompt parts you want to use from \"promptrix\". Here's a super simple wave that creates a basic ChatGPT like bot:\n\nimport { OpenAIModel, AlphaWave } from \"alphawave\";\nimport { Prompt, SystemMessage, ConversationHistory, UserMessage, Message } from \"promptrix\";\n\n// Create an OpenAI model\nconst model = new OpenAIModel({\n    apiKey: process.env.OpenAIKey!,\n    completion_type: 'chat',\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n    temperature: 0.9,\n    max_input_tokens: 2000,\n    max_tokens: 1000,\n});\n\n// Create a wave\nconst wave = new AlphaWave({\n    model,\n    prompt: new Prompt([\n        new SystemMessage('You are an AI assistant that is friendly, kind, and helpful', 50),\n        new ConversationHistory('history', 1.0),\n        new UserMessage('{{$input}}', 450)\n    ])\n});\nOne of the key features of Promptrix is its ability to proportionally layout prompts, so this prompt has an overall budget of 2000 input tokens. It will give the SystemMessage up to 50 tokens, the UserMessage up to 450 tokens, and then the ConversationHistory gets 100% of the remaining tokens.\n\nNext we just need to call completePrompt() on the wave to process the users input:\n\n// Route users message to wave\nconst result = await wave.completePrompt(input);\nswitch (result.status) {\n    case 'success':\n        console.log((result.response as Message).content);\n        break;\n    default:\n        if (result.response) {\n            console.log(`${result.status}: ${result.response}`);\n        } else {\n            console.log(`A result status of '${result.status}' was returned.`);\n        }\n        break;\n}\nThe input parameter is optional and the wave can also take input directly from memory, but you don't have to pass prompts input. You can see in the example that if the prompt doesn't reference the input via a {{$input}} template variable it won't use it anyway."

AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.\n\nAutoGen Overview\n\nAutoGen enables building next-gen LLM applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.\nIt supports diverse conversation patterns for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning conversation autonomy, the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.\nIt provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These systems span a wide range of applications from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns.\nAutoGen provides enhanced LLM inference. It offers utilities like API unification and caching, and advanced usage patterns, such as error handling, multi-config inference, context programming, etc.\nAutoGen is powered by collaborative research studies from Microsoft, Penn State University, and the University of Washington.\n\n↑ Back to Top ↑\n\nRoadmaps\n\nTo see what we are working on and what we plan to work on, please check our Roadmap Issues.\n\n↑ Back to Top ↑\n\nQuickstart\n\nThe easiest way to start playing is\n\nClick below to use the GitHub Codespace\n\nOpen in GitHub Codespaces\n\nCopy OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample to ./notebook folder, name to OAI_CONFIG_LIST, and set the correct configuration.\n\nStart playing with the notebooks!\n\nNOTE: OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample lists GPT-4 as the default model, as this represents our current recommendation, and is known to work well with AutoGen. If you use a model other than GPT-4, you may need to revise various system prompts (especially if using weaker models like GPT-3.5-turbo). Moreover, if you use models other than those hosted by OpenAI or Azure, you may incur additional risks related to alignment and safety. Proceed with caution if updating this default.\n\n↑ Back to Top ↑\n\nInstallation\n\nOption 1. Install and Run AutoGen in Docker\n\nFind detailed instructions for users here, and for developers here.\n\nOption 2. Install AutoGen Locally\n\nAutoGen requires Python version >= 3.8, < 3.13. It can be installed from pip:\n\npip install pyautogen\nMinimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need.\n\nFind more options in Installation.\n\nEven if you are installing and running AutoGen locally outside of docker, the recommendation and default behavior of agents is to perform code execution in docker. Find more instructions and how to change the default behaviour here.\n\nFor LLM inference configurations, check the FAQs.\n\n↑ Back to Top ↑\n\nMulti-Agent Conversation Framework\n\nAutogen enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents that integrate LLMs, tools, and humans. By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\n\nFeatures of this use case include:\n\nMulti-agent conversations: AutoGen agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.\nCustomization: AutoGen agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.\nHuman participation: AutoGen seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.\nFor example,\n\nfrom autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json\n# Load LLM inference endpoints from an env variable or a file\n# See https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints\n# and OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample\nconfig_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file=\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\")\n# You can also set config_list directly as a list, for example, config_list = [{'model': 'gpt-4', 'api_key': '<your OpenAI API key here>'},]\nassistant = AssistantAgent(\"assistant\", llm_config={\"config_list\": config_list})\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\", code_execution_config={\"work_dir\": \"coding\", \"use_docker\": False}) # IMPORTANT: set to True to run code in docker, recommended\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\"Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.\")\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\nThis example can be run with\n\npython test/twoagent.py\nAfter the repo is cloned. The figure below shows an example conversation flow with AutoGen. Agent Chat Example\n\nAlternatively, the sample code here allows a user to chat with an AutoGen agent in ChatGPT style. Please find more code examples for this feature.\n\n↑ Back to Top ↑\n\nEnhanced LLM Inferences\n\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers enhanced LLM inference with powerful functionalities like caching, error handling, multi-config inference and templating.\n\n↑ Back to Top ↑\n\nDocumentation\n\nYou can find detailed documentation about AutoGen here.\n\nIn addition, you can find:\n\nResearch, blogposts around AutoGen, and Transparency FAQs\n\nDiscord\n\nContributing guide\n\nRoadmap"

With a raft of recent updates, AI is becoming more intuitive, capable, and integrated into our daily lives. If you've ever felt overwhelmed by tech talk and jargon, worry not! Let's break down the latest in AI, making it not only digestible for everyone but also highlighting why it should matter to you.\n\n### AI Gets Creative: GPT-4 and More!\n\nHave you heard of ChatGPT? This AI, which made waves for mimicking human-like conversation, has now evolved into its fourth iteration, GPT-4. Imagine an AI that can draft emails, write poetry, or even develop a simple app—all with a human touch that's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from its biological counterparts. This goes beyond novelty; it opens avenues for unprecedented assistance in creative fields and the potential for personalized tutoring on a scale we've never seen before.\n\n### Goodbye Language Barriers: Real-time Translation\n\nThe world is a melting pot of languages and cultures, and AI is stirring the pot with real-time translation improvements. In the past, we'd awkwardly fumble through phrasebooks or struggle with translation apps that couldn't quite capture nuance. Today's AI-driven translators are different. They can interpret not just words but the subtleties of context and slang, rendering conversations with people from other cultures smoother and more natural. The ease of international dialogue that this technology can bring is set to change business, travel, and online communication in unimaginable ways.\n\n### Health and AI: A Match Made in Data Heaven\n\nMedicine and healthcare are areas where AI updates have potentially life-changing implications. Algorithms are now more adept at predicting patient outcomes, personalizing treatment plans, and even assisting in complicated surgeries. AI can sift through medical records and massive amounts of research in microseconds, serving as a valuable sidekick to doctors and researchers. These advancements could mean quicker diagnoses, effective treatments, and even better preventive care, shifting our healthcare paradigms towards more personalized medicine.\n\n### From Monoliths to Morsels: AI Chips in Everything\n\nAI isn't solely about software. It's also about hardware. Recent updates have seen AI chips becoming smaller, more powerful, and more energy-efficient, allowing them to be embedded into everyday objects. This trend, called the Internet of Things (IoT), means that your refrigerator, car, or even your toothbrush can become 'smart.' These devices can learn your habits and preferences to serve you better. A fridge could monitor your food's expiry dates and suggest recipes based on what you have. Your car could analyze your driving patterns and suggest the most fuel-efficient route. It's convenience at a whole new level, powered by AI.\n\n### Ethical AI: A Movement Towards Responsible Development\n\nA discussion about AI advancements would be incomplete without touching on the topic of ethics. As AI systems become more prevalent, concerns about privacy, bias, and control have sparked a movement towards more ethical development of AI technologies. Initiatives are underway to create AI that respects privacy by design, incorporates diverse data to avoid biases, and has checks and balances to prevent misuse. This indicates a maturing field that's looking inward, ensuring that these technological leaps benefit humanity while minimizing potential harms.\n\n### Looking Ahead: AI's Prospect for Society\n\nSo, what do these updates mean for the average person? They suggest a future where AI will be part of the fabric of our existence, making life more accessible, efficient, and personalized. We'll find our digital assistants becoming more helpful, our professional work augmented by intelligent tools, and our homes gradually transforming into interconnected ecosystems that respond to our needs.\n\nHowever, with every step we take into this brave new world, we must tread with a mix of optimism and caution. We need to be active participants in shaping how AI evolves, demanding technology that works for the benefit of all. It's not just about what AI can do; it's about what it should do.\n\nStaying updated with AI is akin to tuning into the future as it unfolds. And as we move forward, AI's storyline only gets more fascinating, with each new chapter promising a blend of innovation and impact. Stay engaged, stay informed, and let's embrace these AI advancements, ready to leverage them for a brighter, more connected tomorrow.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...\nReflecting...\n\n********************************************************************************\nStarting a new chat....\n\nMessage:\nReflect and provide critique on the following writing. \n\n ## Navigating the New Frontiers of Artificial Intelligence: A User-Friendly Update\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is leaping forward at an exhilarating speed, reshaping our world and how we interact with it.

With a raft of recent updates, AI is becoming more intuitive, capable, and integrated into our daily lives. If you've ever felt overwhelmed by tech talk and jargon, worry not! Let's break down the latest in AI, making it not only digestible for everyone but also highlighting why it should matter to you.\n\n### AI Gets Creative: GPT-4 and More!\n\nHave you heard of ChatGPT? This AI, which made waves for mimicking human-like conversation, has now evolved into its fourth iteration, GPT-4. Imagine an AI that can draft emails, write poetry, or even develop a simple app—all with a human touch that's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from its biological counterparts. This goes beyond novelty; it opens avenues for unprecedented assistance in creative fields and the potential for personalized tutoring on a scale we've never seen before.\n\n### Goodbye Language Barriers: Real-time Translation\n\nThe world is a melting pot of languages and cultures, and AI is stirring the pot with real-time translation improvements. In the past, we'd awkwardly fumble through phrasebooks or struggle with translation apps that couldn't quite capture nuance. Today's AI-driven translators are different. They can interpret not just words but the subtleties of context and slang, rendering conversations with people from other cultures smoother and more natural. The ease of international dialogue that this technology can bring is set to change business, travel, and online communication in unimaginable ways.\n\n### Health and AI: A Match Made in Data Heaven\n\nMedicine and healthcare are areas where AI updates have potentially life-changing implications. Algorithms are now more adept at predicting patient outcomes, personalizing treatment plans, and even assisting in complicated surgeries. AI can sift through medical records and massive amounts of research in microseconds, serving as a valuable sidekick to doctors and researchers. These advancements could mean quicker diagnoses, effective treatments, and even better preventive care, shifting our healthcare paradigms towards more personalized medicine.\n\n### From Monoliths to Morsels: AI Chips in Everything\n\nAI isn't solely about software. It's also about hardware. Recent updates have seen AI chips becoming smaller, more powerful, and more energy-efficient, allowing them to be embedded into everyday objects. This trend, called the Internet of Things (IoT), means that your refrigerator, car, or even your toothbrush can become 'smart.' These devices can learn your habits and preferences to serve you better. A fridge could monitor your food's expiry dates and suggest recipes based on what you have. Your car could analyze your driving patterns and suggest the most fuel-efficient route. It's convenience at a whole new level, powered by AI.\n\n### Ethical AI: A Movement Towards Responsible Development\n\nA discussion about AI advancements would be incomplete without touching on the topic of ethics.

      "content": " Let's think through how we can use Langchain, Promptrix, AlphaWave, and AutoGen to create a \"Grammarly\" for prompting that guides users to prompt for learning using the SCRIBER framework.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the libraries\n- Langchain: A library that helps build applications with large language models. It provides modules for prompts, memory, agents, and more.\n- Promptrix: A prompt layout engine that breaks prompts into sections and manages token budgets. It supports both text and chat-based prompts.\n- AlphaWave: An opinionated client for interfacing with large language models, built on top of Promptrix. It provides features like automatic history management and response repair.\n- AutoGen: A framework for building LLM applications using multiple agents that converse with each other to solve tasks. It also provides enhanced LLM inference capabilities.\n\nStep 2: Identifying overlaps and synergies\n- Promptrix and AlphaWave have significant overlap, as AlphaWave is built on top of Promptrix. For our use case, we can likely use AlphaWave directly, as it provides a higher-level interface.\n- Langchain and AutoGen both provide agent-based functionality. However, Langchain is more general-purpose, while AutoGen is specifically designed for multi-agent conversations. We can potentially use AutoGen for the multi-agent aspect and Langchain for other functionality.\n\nStep 3: Designing the \"Grammarly\" for prompting\n- Use AlphaWave to manage the user's conversation with the AI, including history management and response repair.\n- Implement the SCRIBER framework as a set of AutoGen agents that observe the user's prompts and provide guidance:\n  - Seek agent: Suggests ways to explore gaps in knowledge\n  - Critique agent: Provides constructive criticism on the user's prompts\n  - Reflect agent: Encourages the user to reflect on the AI's responses\n  - Inquire agent: Prompts the user to ask clarifying questions\n  - Broaden/Contract agent: Helps the user expand or narrow the scope of their prompts\n  - Explain agent: Asks the AI to explain its reasoning and guides the user to do the same\n  - Recurse agent: Encourages the user to think about the prompting process itself\n- Use Langchain's memory modules to persist the conversation history and the user's learning progress.\n- Integrate the AutoGen agents with AlphaWave, so that they can interrupt the user's conversation with the AI to provide guidance.\n\nStep 4: Implementation plan\n1. Set up an AlphaWave client to manage the user's conversation with the AI.\n2. Implement the SCRIBER agents using AutoGen, with each agent responsible for a specific aspect of the framework.\n3.

            "text": " Let's think through how we can use Langchain, Promptrix, AlphaWave, and AutoGen to create a \"Grammarly\" for prompting that guides users to prompt for learning using the SCRIBER framework.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the libraries\n- Langchain: A library that helps build applications with large language models. It provides modules for prompts, memory, agents, and more.\n- Promptrix: A prompt layout engine that breaks prompts into sections and manages token budgets. It supports both text and chat-based prompts.\n- AlphaWave: An opinionated client for interfacing with large language models, built on top of Promptrix. It provides features like automatic history management and response repair.\n- AutoGen: A framework for building LLM applications using multiple agents that converse with each other to solve tasks. It also provides enhanced LLM inference capabilities.\n\nStep 2: Identifying overlaps and synergies\n- Promptrix and AlphaWave have significant overlap, as AlphaWave is built on top of Promptrix. For our use case, we can likely use AlphaWave directly, as it provides a higher-level interface.\n- Langchain and AutoGen both provide agent-based functionality. However, Langchain is more general-purpose, while AutoGen is specifically designed for multi-agent conversations. We can potentially use AutoGen for the multi-agent aspect and Langchain for other functionality.\n\nStep 3: Designing the \"Grammarly\" for prompting\n- Use AlphaWave to manage the user's conversation with the AI, including history management and response repair.\n- Implement the SCRIBER framework as a set of AutoGen agents that observe the user's prompts and provide guidance:\n  - Seek agent: Suggests ways to explore gaps in knowledge\n  - Critique agent: Provides constructive criticism on the user's prompts\n  - Reflect agent: Encourages the user to reflect on the AI's responses\n  - Inquire agent: Prompts the user to ask clarifying questions\n  - Broaden/Contract agent: Helps the user expand or narrow the scope of their prompts\n  - Explain agent: Asks the AI to explain its reasoning and guides the user to do the same\n  - Recurse agent: Encourages the user to think about the prompting process itself\n- Use Langchain's memory modules to persist the conversation history and the user's learning progress.\n- Integrate the AutoGen agents with AlphaWave, so that they can interrupt the user's conversation with the AI to provide guidance.\n\nStep 4: Implementation plan\n1. Set up an AlphaWave client to manage the user's conversation with the AI.\n2. Implement the SCRIBER agents using AutoGen, with each agent responsible for a specific aspect of the framework.\n3. Integrate the SCRIBER agents with the AlphaWave client, so that they can observe the user's prompts and provide guidance.\n4. Use Langchain's memory modules to persist the conversation history and learning progress.\n5. Test and refine the system, ensuring that the agents provide helpful and timely guidance without being too disruptive.\n\nIn summary, we can use AlphaWave for overall conversation management, AutoGen for implementing the SCRIBER agents, and Langchain for memory persistence and other supporting functionality. By integrating these libraries, we can create a \"Grammarly\" for prompting that guides users towards more effective learning using the SCRIBER framework.",

            "extracted_content": "Get started\n\nLCEL makes it easy to build complex chains from basic components, and supports out of the box functionality such as streaming, parallelism, and logging.\n\nBasic example: prompt + model + output parser\n\nThe most basic and common use case is chaining a prompt template and a model together. To see how this works, let’s create a chain that takes a topic and generates a joke:\n\n%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain-core langchain-community langchain-openai\n\nOpenAI\nAnthropic\nGoogle\nCohere\nFireworksAI\nMistralAI\nTogetherAI\nInstall dependencies\n\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n\nSet environment variables\n\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\")\n\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"tell me a short joke about {topic}\")\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\n\nchain = prompt | model | output_parser\n\nchain.invoke({\"topic\": \"ice cream\"})\n\n\"Why don't ice creams ever get invited to parties?\\n\\nBecause they always drip when things heat up!\"\n\n\nNotice this line of the code, where we piece together these different components into a single chain using LCEL:\n\nchain = prompt | model | output_parser\n\nThe | symbol is similar to a unix pipe operator, which chains together the different components, feeding the output from one component as input into the next component.\n\nIn this chain the user input is passed to the prompt template, then the prompt template output is passed to the model, then the model output is passed to the output parser. Let’s take a look at each component individually to really understand what’s going on.\n\n1. Prompt\n\nprompt is a BasePromptTemplate, which means it takes in a dictionary of template variables and produces a PromptValue. A PromptValue is a wrapper around a completed prompt that can be passed to either an LLM (which takes a string as input) or ChatModel (which takes a sequence of messages as input). It can work with either language model type because it defines logic both for producing BaseMessages and for producing a string.\n\nprompt_value = prompt.invoke({\"topic\": \"ice cream\"})\nprompt_value\n\nChatPromptValue(messages=[HumanMessage(content='tell me a short joke about ice cream')])\n\nprompt_value.to_messages()\n\n[HumanMessage(content='tell me a short joke about ice cream')]\n\nprompt_value.to_string()\n\n'Human: tell me a short joke about ice cream'\n\n2. Model\n\nThe PromptValue is then passed to model. In this case our model is a ChatModel, meaning it will output a BaseMessage.\n\nmessage = model.invoke(prompt_value)\nmessage\n\nAIMessage(content=\"Why don't ice creams ever get invited to parties?\\n\\nBecause they always bring a melt down!\")\n\n\nIf our model was an LLM, it would output a string.\n\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\")\nllm.invoke(prompt_value)\n\n'\\n\\nRobot: Why did the ice cream truck break down? Because it had a meltdown!'\n\n3. Output parser\n\nAnd lastly we pass our model output to the output_parser, which is a BaseOutputParser meaning it takes either a string or a BaseMessage as input. The specific StrOutputParser simply converts any input into a string.\n\noutput_parser.invoke(message)\n\n\"Why did the ice cream go to therapy? \\n\\nBecause it had too many toppings and couldn't find its cone-fidence!\"\n\n\n4. Entire Pipeline\n\nTo follow the steps along:\n\nWe pass in user input on the desired topic as {\"topic\": \"ice cream\"}\nThe prompt component takes the user input, which is then used to construct a PromptValue after using the topic to construct the prompt.\nThe model component takes the generated prompt, and passes into the OpenAI LLM model for evaluation. The generated output from the model is a ChatMessage object.\nFinally, the output_parser component takes in a ChatMessage, and transforms this into a Python string, which is returned from the invoke method.\nDict\nPromptValue\nChatMessage\nString\nInput: topic=ice cream\nPromptTemplate\nChatModel\nStrOutputParser\nResult\nNote that if you’re curious about the output of any components, you can always test out a smaller version of the chain such as prompt or prompt | model to see the intermediate results:\n\ninput = {\"topic\": \"ice cream\"}\n\nprompt.invoke(input)\n# > ChatPromptValue(messages=[HumanMessage(content='tell me a short joke about ice cream')])\n\n(prompt | model).invoke(input)\n# > AIMessage(content=\"Why did the ice cream go to therapy?\\nBecause it had too many toppings and couldn't cone-trol itself!\")\n\n\nRAG Search Example\n\nFor our next example, we want to run a retrieval-augmented generation chain to add some context when responding to questions.\n\nOpenAI\nAnthropic\nGoogle\nCohere\nFireworksAI\nMistralAI\nTogetherAI\nInstall dependencies\n\npip install -qU langchain-openai\n\nSet environment variables\n\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\n\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\")\n\n# Requires:\n# pip install langchain docarray tiktoken\n\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import DocArrayInMemorySearch\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallel, RunnablePassthrough\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\nvectorstore = DocArrayInMemorySearch.from_texts(\n    [\"harrison worked at kensho\", \"bears like to eat honey\"],\n    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),\n)\nretriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()\n\ntemplate = \"\"\"Answer the question based only on the following context:\n{context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\"\"\"\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\n\nsetup_and_retrieval = RunnableParallel(\n    {\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n)\nchain = setup_and_retrieval | prompt | model | output_parser\n\nchain.invoke(\"where did harrison work?\")\n\nIn this case, the composed chain is:\n\nchain = setup_and_retrieval | prompt | model | output_parser\n\nTo explain this, we first can see that the prompt template above takes in context and question as values to be substituted in the prompt. Before building the prompt template, we want to retrieve relevant documents to the search and include them as part of the context.\n\nAs a preliminary step, we’ve setup the retriever using an in memory store, which can retrieve documents based on a query. This is a runnable component as well that can be chained together with other components, but you can also try to run it separately:\n\nretriever.invoke(\"where did harrison work?\")\n\nWe then use the RunnableParallel to prepare the expected inputs into the prompt by using the entries for the retrieved documents as well as the original user question, using the retriever for document search, and RunnablePassthrough to pass the user’s question:\n\nsetup_and_retrieval = RunnableParallel(\n    {\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n)\n\nTo review, the complete chain is:\n\nsetup_and_retrieval = RunnableParallel(\n    {\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n)\nchain = setup_and_retrieval | prompt | model | output_parser\n\nWith the flow being:\n\nThe first steps create a RunnableParallel object with two entries. The first entry, context will include the document results fetched by the retriever. The second entry, question will contain the user’s original question. To pass on the question, we use RunnablePassthrough to copy this entry.\nFeed the dictionary from the step above to the prompt component. It then takes the user input which is question as well as the retrieved document which is context to construct a prompt and output a PromptValue.\nThe model component takes the generated prompt, and passes into the OpenAI LLM model for evaluation. The generated output from the model is a ChatMessage object.\nFinally, the output_parser component takes in a ChatMessage, and transforms this into a Python string, which is returned from the invoke method.\nQuestion\nQuestion\ncontext=retrieved docs\nquestion=Question\nPromptValue\nChatMessage\nString\nQuestion\nRunnableParallel\nRetriever\nRunnablePassThrough\nPromptTemplate\nChatModel\nStrOutputParser\nResult\nNext steps\n\nWe recommend reading our Advantages of LCEL section next to see a side-by-side comparison of the code needed to produce common functionality with and without LCEL."

For instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\n    \n    **Reflect**\n    \n    Generate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \n    \n    **Inquire**\n    \n    Ask the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\n    \n    **Broaden / Contract**\n    \n    Ask the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\n    \n    **Explain**\n    \n    AI is the **devil's advocate** and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of **diverse experts** and ask the AI to grill you.\n    \n    **Recurse**\n    \n    Ask it to ask you to ask it… Simple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \n    \n3.

The goal is to help a student who wants to start a social enterprise that addresses water scarcity in Gaza by scaling up a DIY rooftop desalination device.\n2. The student lacks access to mentors, technical expertise, and knowledge about business models, innovation strategies, and financing options.\n3. The AI agent should guide the student through a step-by-step framework, helping them create documents such as a business model canvas, style guide, requirements document, and design thinking framework.\n4. The SCRIBER principles should be applied to encourage the student to think for themselves, provide detailed information about their current situation and goals, and explore new possibilities they may not have considered.\n5. The AI agent can use the concept of vector spaces to identify the student's current knowledge and desired direction, then introduce new ideas and concepts along that vector, such as social enterprise, B-corp, cooperatives, and other innovative business models.\n6. Gartner magic quadrants can be used to simplify the high-dimensional vector space into clusters of concepts along two dimensions, making it easier to determine the directionality of the student's goals.\n7. The AI agent should work iteratively with the student, clarifying their knowledge, identifying the next best learning-by-doing activity, reflecting on the results, and continuously refining the framework as the student progresses.\n\nBased on this description, I believe we are building an AI-assisted mentoring system that can guide individuals with limited access to resources and expertise through the process of creating and implementing innovative solutions to social and environmental challenges. The system will use the SCRIBER principles and the concept of vector spaces to personalize the learning experience, introduce new ideas, and help users navigate the complexities of starting a social enterprise.\n\nWhat is new to me in this description is the idea of using Gartner magic quadrants to simplify high-dimensional vector spaces and identify clusters of concepts along two dimensions. This approach could be very useful in determining the directionality of a user's goals and guiding them towards new ideas and possibilities.\n\nHere are five deep questions to help prepare the next steps:\n\n1. How can we design the user interface to effectively guide users through the step-by-step framework while encouraging them to think for themselves and provide detailed information about their situation and goals?\n\n2. What specific data points and user inputs do we need to collect to accurately identify the user's current knowledge and desired direction in the vector space?\n\n3. How can we create a comprehensive knowledge base of concepts, ideas, and frameworks related to social entrepreneurship, innovation, and sustainable development that can be effectively mapped onto the vector space?\n\n4. What machine learning techniques can we employ to continuously refine the AI agent's understanding of the user's progress and adapt the mentoring approach accordingly?\n\n5. How can we integrate real-world case studies, success stories, and expert insights into the AI agent's guidance to provide users with practical examples and inspiration throughout their journey?\n\nBased on your answers to these questions, I believe we can develop a 10-step plan to move from ideation and brainstorming to testable code within a day.",

The AI agent should work iteratively with the student, clarifying their knowledge, identifying the next best learning-by-doing activity, reflecting on the results, and continuously refining the framework as the student progresses.\n\nBased on this description, I believe we are building an AI-assisted mentoring system that can guide individuals with limited access to resources and expertise through the process of creating and implementing innovative solutions to social and environmental challenges. The system will use the SCRIBER principles and the concept of vector spaces to personalize the learning experience, introduce new ideas, and help users navigate the complexities of starting a social enterprise.\n\nWhat is new to me in this description is the idea of using Gartner magic quadrants to simplify high-dimensional vector spaces and identify clusters of concepts along two dimensions. This approach could be very useful in determining the directionality of a user's goals and guiding them towards new ideas and possibilities.\n\nHere are five deep questions to help prepare the next steps:\n\n1. How can we design the user interface to effectively guide users through the step-by-step framework while encouraging them to think for themselves and provide detailed information about their situation and goals?\n\n2. What specific data points and user inputs do we need to collect to accurately identify the user's current knowledge and desired direction in the vector space?\n\n3. How can we create a comprehensive knowledge base of concepts, ideas, and frameworks related to social entrepreneurship, innovation, and sustainable development that can be effectively mapped onto the vector space?\n\n4. What machine learning techniques can we employ to continuously refine the AI agent's understanding of the user's progress and adapt the mentoring approach accordingly?\n\n5. How can we integrate real-world case studies, success stories, and expert insights into the AI agent's guidance to provide users with practical examples and inspiration throughout their journey?\n\nBased on your answers to these questions, I believe we can develop a 10-step plan to move from ideation and brainstorming to testable code within a day.",

For example, would you like to use pop-ups, side panels, or in-line suggestions?\nHow do you want to handle cases where multiple SCRIBER agents provide conflicting or overlapping feedback? Should there be a priority order or a way to combine their suggestions?\nFor the SDG alignment layer, what are the key aspects you want the agents to focus on when evaluating the user's prompts and goals? Should they provide suggestions for better alignment with specific SDGs or offer general guidance on making the prompts more socially and environmentally responsible?\nRegarding your fourth point about using embedding volume as an indicator of progress, I think it's an interesting idea, but it might have some limitations. While the total distance between points in the vector space could provide a measure of the breadth of knowledge on a topic, it might not necessarily reflect the depth or quality of understanding. Additionally, as the knowledge space expands, the volume might grow even if the user is not actively learning or applying the SCRIBER principles effectively.\nInstead of relying solely on embedding volume, I suggest considering a combination of metrics that could include:\nFrequency of SCRIBER agent interruptions: A decrease in the number of interruptions over time could indicate that the user is internalizing and applying the SCRIBER principles more effectively.\nUser engagement with SCRIBER feedback: Tracking how often the user interacts with and incorporates the feedback from the SCRIBER agents could provide insights into their learning progress.\nQuality of user prompts: Developing a scoring system that evaluates the user's prompts based on their alignment with the SCRIBER principles could offer a more direct measure of improvement.\nSelf-assessment and reflection: Periodically prompting the user to reflect on their own progress and understanding of the SCRIBER framework could provide valuable qualitative data to complement the quantitative metrics.\nBy combining these metrics, you could create a more comprehensive picture of the user's progress and the effectiveness of the \"Grammarly for prompting\" tool.\nHere's a draft of the specifications and requirements document:\nmarkdown\n\nCopy code\n# Specifications and Requirements: Grammarly for Prompting\n\n## Overview\nThe \"Grammarly for Prompting\" tool aims to assist users in developing effective learning-oriented prompts using the SCRIBER framework. The tool will utilize a combination of AlphaWave for conversation management, AutoGen for implementing the SCRIBER agents, and Langchain for memory persistence and other supporting functionality.\n\n## User Interface\n- The tool will be integrated into a chat interface where users can converse with an AI assistant.\n- SCRIBER agent feedback and interruptions will be presented to the user through [specific UI elements and interactions, e.g., pop-ups, side panels, or in-line suggestions].\n- The user will have the option to [control the frequency and types of interruptions, if applicable].\n\n## SCRIBER Agents\nThe tool will include the following SCRIBER agents, each responsible for providing guidance on a specific aspect of the framework:\n\n1. Seek Agent: Suggests ways to explore gaps in knowledge based on the user's prompts.\n2. Critique Agent: Provides constructive criticism on the user's prompts.\n3. Reflect Agent: Encourages the user to reflect on the AI's responses and their own learning.\n4. Inquire Agent: Prompts the user to ask clarifying questions and seek deeper understanding.\n5. Broaden/Contract Agent: Helps the user expand or narrow the scope of their prompts.\n6. Explain Agent: Asks the AI to explain its reasoning and guides the user to do the same.\n7. Recurse Agent: Encourages the user to think about the prompting process itself and iterate on their approach.\n\n## SDG Alignment Layer\nAn additional layer of agents will focus on evaluating the user's prompts and goals for alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These agents will:\n- [Provide suggestions for better alignment with specific SDGs or offer general guidance on making the prompts more socially and environmentally responsible, based on the key aspects identified].\n\n## Agent Coordination\n- The tool will handle cases where multiple SCRIBER agents provide conflicting or overlapping feedback by [implementing a priority order or a way to combine their suggestions].\n- The SDG alignment layer will [interact with the SCRIBER agents in a specified manner to provide holistic feedback to the user].\n\n## Progress Tracking and Evaluation\nThe tool will track user progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the \"Grammarly for prompting\" tool using a combination of the following metrics:\n1. Frequency of SCRIBER agent interruptions\n2. User engagement with SCRIBER feedback\n3. Quality of user prompts, based on a scoring system aligned with the SCRIBER principles\n4. Self-assessment and reflection prompts for the user\n\n## Technical Requirements\n- AlphaWave for conversation management\n- AutoGen for implementing the SCRIBER agents\n- Langchain for memory persistence and other supporting functionality\n- [Additional libraries or technologies for specific components, e.g., user interface, language model, etc.]\n\n## Performance and Scalability\n- The tool should be able to handle [expected number of concurrent users or conversations].\n- Response times for SCRIBER agent feedback should not exceed [acceptable latency].\n- The system architecture should be designed to accommodate future growth and increased user demand.\n\n## Privacy and Security\n- The tool will adhere to [relevant privacy regulations and industry standards].\n- User data, including conversation history and progress metrics, will be stored securely and accessed only by [authorized personnel or systems].\n- Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n## Maintenance and Support\n- The tool will be maintained by [designated team or individual] who will be responsible for monitoring performance, addressing user feedback, and implementing updates and improvements.\n- Users will have access to [specified support channels, e.g., documentation, tutorials, forums, or customer support] for assistance and troubleshooting.\nPlease review the draft specifications and requirements document and let me know if you have any further questions or feedback. I'll be happy to refine the document based on your input.\nCopy\n\n\nClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.\nBG\nLet's identify the next best step for us to build this by first knowing our goal, I will describe it and then ask you to ask me 5 deep questions to help produce a 10 step plan to going from ideation and brainstorming which we are doing now to actual code we can test in one day. Ready?\nGoal: The goal will be to have a student who wants to do a social enterprise to make money while addressing water scarcity using a rooftop desalination device in Gaza because they saw someone produce a DIY version and they thought they could scale it up. They are enthusiastic yet have never started a business and need a mentor yet have no access to educated people who know how to run businesses or technical people whom they can ask how to produce, or innovation consultants who can help them innovate on the standard model to make one that people can pay per liter rather than the device, or have the bank pay to install it and then they pay installments, or to add a microcontroller and water quality sensor so their sale can be stronger because they can confirm that they can come to the house to fix the desalinator if it seems to release salty/contaminated water increasing trust and providing a \"subscription\" part for the business model. All these they have no idea are possible and are running blind. The agent should start by asking them to guide them as much as possible to their goal through a framework. If they don't have a step by step plan, a business model canvas, a style guide, a requirements document, a design thinking framework and then they can follow it step by step with the AIs help - then they are going to be floating and doing nothing productive. One of the principles of SCRIBER is to get people to think for themselves so helping them produce a markdown file and or rich text document so they can take the framework and print it and have time to sit with it that'd be awesome. Remember some of the principles in scriber are to poll for as much information as possible to see where their embedding location is in the vector space. Then to ask for as detailed information as possible about where they want to go, we need to find the vector that \"points\" from where they are to where they want to go so we can take a few steps further and help them go to a new place they don't even know is possible. So for instance, if they want to help people get water and they plan to start a business to solve the water and make money, they have no idea there is such a thing as a social enterprise, we can take social enterprise as the \"Estimated\" end goal. We can then offer b-corp, cooperatives, and other elements that are along the direction of business + good + innovation -> and move in that vector. I guess we need to define some of the clusters of ideas and then to plot them on Gartner magic quadrants to be able to simplify the 1024-long float of numbers vector and turn them into clusters of concepts with 2 simple vectors along 2 simple concept dimensions from 0-1 to then be able to find \"directionality\" for where they seem to be heading. We can use this approach to help clarify the goal, to show them what they don't know before then working iteratively with them to achieve this goal by clarifying their knowledge, finding the next best learning by doing activity, doing it, reflecting with the AI on what they did and what they learned, picking a new framework or continuing on the current one and continuing forward.\nSummarize what I just said and think step by step about what you think it means for what we're building.\nWhat is news to you in this description of the use case?\nAsk me 5 deep questions to prepare the next\nThank you for providing such a detailed and insightful description of the goal and the use case. Let me summarize the key points:\nThe goal is to help a student who wants to start a social enterprise that addresses water scarcity in Gaza by scaling up a DIY rooftop desalination device.\nThe student lacks access to mentors, technical expertise, and knowledge about business models, innovation strategies, and financing options.\nThe AI agent should guide the student through a step-by-step framework, helping them create documents such as a business model canvas, style guide, requirements document, and design thinking framework.\nThe SCRIBER principles should be applied to encourage the student to think for themselves, provide detailed information about their current situation and goals, and explore new possibilities they may not have considered.\nThe AI agent can use the concept of vector spaces to identify the student's current knowledge and desired direction, then introduce new ideas and concepts along that vector, such as social enterprise, B-corp, cooperatives, and other innovative business models.\nGartner magic quadrants can be used to simplify the high-dimensional vector space into clusters of concepts along two dimensions, making it easier to determine the directionality of the student's goals.\nThe AI agent should work iteratively with the student, clarifying their knowledge, identifying the next best learning-by-doing activity, reflecting on the results, and continuously refining the framework as the student progresses.\nBased on this description, I believe we are building an AI-assisted mentoring system that can guide individuals with limited access to resources and expertise through the process of creating and implementing innovative solutions to social and environmental challenges. The system will use the SCRIBER principles and the concept of vector spaces to personalize the learning experience, introduce new ideas, and help users navigate the complexities of starting a social enterprise.\nWhat is new to me in this description is the idea of using Gartner magic quadrants to simplify high-dimensional vector spaces and identify clusters of concepts along two dimensions. This approach could be very useful in determining the directionality of a user's goals and guiding them towards new ideas and possibilities.\nHere are five deep questions to help prepare the next steps:\nHow can we design the user interface to effectively guide users through the step-by-step framework while encouraging them to think for themselves and provide detailed information about their situation and goals?\nWhat specific data points and user inputs do we need to collect to accurately identify the user's current knowledge and desired direction in the vector space?\nHow can we create a comprehensive knowledge base of concepts, ideas, and frameworks related to social entrepreneurship, innovation, and sustainable development that can be effectively mapped onto the vector space?\nWhat machine learning techniques can we employ to continuously refine the AI agent's understanding of the user's progress and adapt the mentoring approach accordingly?\nHow can we integrate real-world case studies, success stories, and expert insights into the AI agent's guidance to provide users with practical examples and inspiration throughout their journey?\nBased on your answers to these questions, I believe we can develop a 10-step plan to move from ideation and brainstorming to testable code within a day.\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.\n"

Set up the backend infrastructure\n   - Choose a suitable email server or service for sending and receiving emails\n   - Configure the server to handle incoming emails and route them to the appropriate components of the system\n   - Ensure secure storage of user data and conversations\n\n4. Implement the SCRIBER agents\n   - Create a basic implementation of each SCRIBER agent (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/Contract, Explain, Recurse)\n   - Define the prompts, templates, and decision-making logic for each agent\n   - Integrate the agents with the email interface to process user input and generate responses\n\n5. Develop the user progress tracking system\n   - Implement a simple database or file-based storage system to store user profiles, conversation history, and progress metrics\n   - Define the data points to be collected, such as user input, agent responses, and engagement metrics\n   - Create functions to update and retrieve user progress data as needed\n\n6. Implement the \"backstage\" functionality\n   - Create a separate email command (e.g., \"backstage\") for users to access the system's internal models and metrics\n   - Develop simple visualizations or summaries of the user persona, goal, activity, assessments, and learning direction models\n   - Allow users to provide feedback and corrections to the models via email\n\n7. Integrate the PID loop for adaptive learning\n   - Implement the proportional, differential, and integral components of the PID loop\n   - Use the user's goal vector, engagement metrics, and SCRIBER framework adherence to adjust the system's guidance and feedback\n   - Continuously update the models based on user input and progress\n\n8. Create a basic knowledge base\n   - Curate a small set of high-quality resources, case studies, and frameworks related to social entrepreneurship and the water desalination project\n   - Organize the knowledge base in a format that can be easily searched and retrieved by the SCRIBER agents\n   - Develop functions to update and expand the knowledge base based on user interactions and feedback\n\n9. Test and debug the system\n   - Conduct thorough testing of each component (email interface, SCRIBER agents, progress tracking, backstage, PID loop)\n   - Test the system with sample user inputs and scenarios to ensure proper functionality and error handling\n   - Debug and fix any issues identified during testing\n\n10.

      "content": " Here's a detailed explanation of what we're doing:\n\nWe are developing an AI-assisted mentoring system that helps users, particularly social entrepreneurs, to learn and grow by guiding them through a structured learning process. The system combines the INSPIRE framework, which focuses on different learning techniques, with the SCRIBER methodology, which provides a systematic approach to questioning, reflection, and iteration. By integrating these two frameworks, we aim to create a unified and coherent learning experience that helps users identify their goals, find meaning in their learning journey, and make consistent progress towards their objectives.\n\nThe system will use embedding vectors and clustering to help users refine their goals and align them with their values. A PID loop for learning will be implemented to maintain user engagement and keep them in a flow state. The AI-assisted mentoring system will be delivered through an email interface, with SCRIBER agents guiding users through the learning process. The system will also include a backstage area where users can access and provide feedback on the system's internal models and metrics.\n\nThree additional ideas that could be helpful:\n\n1. Incorporating a community aspect, where users can connect with others who have similar goals or have gone through the learning process before, to foster collaboration and peer support.\n\n2. Developing a gamification system that rewards users for their progress and engagement, providing additional motivation and incentives for learning.\n\n3. Integrating a recommender system that suggests relevant resources, case studies, or potential collaborators based on the user's goals, progress, and interests.\n\nNow, let's answer the five deep questions:\n\n1. We can map the INSPIRE learning techniques to the SCRIBER elements by identifying the common underlying principles and objectives. For example, Inquiry-Based Learning from INSPIRE aligns with the Seek and Inquire elements of SCRIBER, as they both focus on asking questions and exploring new ideas. Similarly, Reflective Learning from INSPIRE aligns with the Reflect element of SCRIBER. By creating these mappings, we can ensure that the learning techniques and the questioning methodology work together seamlessly.\n\n2. The key similarity between INSPIRE and SCRIBER is their focus on active, engaged learning that emphasizes questioning, reflection, and iteration. The main difference is that INSPIRE provides a broader set of learning techniques, while SCRIBER offers a more structured methodology for questioning and reflection. By leveraging the strengths of both frameworks, we can create a learning experience that is both diverse and structured, catering to different learning styles while maintaining a systematic approach.\n\n3. The goal-setting and refinement process using embedding vectors and clustering can be integrated into the SCRIBER methodology by incorporating it into the Seek and Inquire elements. During the Seek phase, users can explore their goals and values using the embedding vectors, while the Inquire phase can help them refine their goals and align them with their moments of meaning. This integration ensures that the goal-setting process is not a separate activity but rather an integral part of the learning journey.\n\n4. The PID loop for learning can be designed to work alongside the action-reflection-new action cycle of SCRIBER. The Proportional component of the PID loop can help users set goals and adjust their learning path based on their progress. The Integral component can track their overall progress and engagement, while the Derivative component can help them maintain a flow state by adjusting the difficulty and complexity of the learning activities. The SCRIBER methodology can be used to guide the reflection and new action phases of the cycle.\n\n5. The pre-prompt system messages and agent roles should be designed to align with the unified INSPIRE-SCRIBER framework. For example, the Seek agent can have a system message that encourages users to explore new ideas and ask questions, while the Reflect agent can prompt users to think deeply about their learning experiences and draw insights. The Critique agent can help users identify areas for improvement and provide constructive feedback. These system messages and roles should be designed to guide users through the learning process in a way that is consistent with the unified framework.\n\nFive different things you can download as useful resources/takeaways from this conversation:\n\n1.

Introduction\nThe AI-assisted mentoring system is designed to help social entrepreneurs learn and grow by guiding them through a structured learning process. The system combines the INSPIRE framework, which focuses on different learning techniques, with the SCRIBER methodology, which provides a systematic approach to questioning, reflection, and iteration. By integrating these two frameworks, we aim to create a unified and coherent learning experience that helps users identify their goals, find meaning in their learning journey, and make consistent progress towards their objectives.\n\n## 2. INSPIRE Framework and SCRIBER Methodology\n### 2.1 INSPIRE Framework\nThe INSPIRE framework consists of the following learning techniques:\n- Inquiry-Based Learning\n- Narrative and Reflective Learning\n- Self-Directed Learning\n- Problem-Based Learning\n- Interactive and Collaborative Learning\n- Resilience and Grit\n- Experiential Learning\n- Self-Efficacy and Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\n\n### 2.2 SCRIBER Methodology\nThe SCRIBER methodology provides a structured approach to questioning and reflection, with the following elements:\n- Seek\n- Critique\n- Reflect\n- Inquire\n- Broaden/Contract\n- Explain\n- Recurse\n\n### 2.3 Integration of INSPIRE and SCRIBER\nThe INSPIRE learning techniques are mapped to the corresponding SCRIBER elements to create a unified framework (see Appendix A for the detailed mapping). This integration ensures that the learning techniques and the questioning methodology work together seamlessly to support the user's learning journey.\n\n## 3. Key Components of the AI-Assisted Mentoring System\n### 3.1 Email Interface\nThe AI-assisted mentoring system is delivered through an email interface, allowing users to interact with the system using a familiar and accessible communication channel.\n\n### 3.2 SCRIBER Agents\nThe system includes a set of SCRIBER agents, each responsible for guiding users through a specific aspect of the learning process (see Appendix B for the list of agents and their system prompts).\n\n### 3.3 Progress Tracking\nThe system tracks user progress and engagement using a combination of metrics, such as the frequency of interactions, the quality of user responses, and self-assessment and reflection prompts.\n\n### 3.4 Backstage Area\nThe backstage area allows users to access and provide feedback on the system's internal models and metrics, enabling them to contribute to the continuous improvement of the AI-assisted mentoring system.\n\n### 3.5 PID Loop for Learning\nThe PID loop for learning is designed to maintain user engagement and keep them in a flow state by adjusting the difficulty and complexity of the learning activities based on their progress and performance (see Appendix C for the detailed PID loop design).\n\n## 4. Goal-Setting and Refinement Process\nThe goal-setting and refinement process uses embedding vectors and clustering to help users identify their goals and align them with their values and moments of meaning. This process is integrated into the SCRIBER methodology, particularly in the Seek and Inquire elements (see Appendix D for the goal-setting process flowchart).\n\n## 5. Pre-Prompt System Messages and Agent Roles\nThe pre-prompt system messages and agent roles are designed to align with the unified INSPIRE-SCRIBER framework and effectively guide users through the learning process (see Appendix B for the detailed list of agents and their system prompts).\n\n## 6. Example User Interaction\n[Include a sample user interaction showcasing how the AI-assisted mentoring system would work in practice, demonstrating the integration of the INSPIRE framework, SCRIBER methodology, and the various components of the system.]\n\n## Appendices\n- Appendix A: INSPIRE-SCRIBER Mapping\n- Appendix B: SCRIBER Agents and System Prompts\n- Appendix C: PID Loop Design\n- Appendix D: Goal-Setting Process Flowchart",

The PID loop will work in conjunction with the action-reflection-new action cycle of the SCRIBER methodology to create a dynamic and personalized learning experience.\n\n## Components of the PID Loop\n1. Proportional (P): The proportional component adjusts the learning path based on the difference between the user's current progress and their desired goal. It helps users stay on track by providing immediate feedback and suggestions for improvement.\n\n2. Integral (I): The integral component considers the user's overall progress and engagement over time. It helps identify patterns and trends in the user's learning behavior and makes long-term adjustments to keep them motivated and engaged.\n\n3. Derivative (D): The derivative component monitors the rate of change in the user's progress and helps maintain a suitable learning pace. It adjusts the difficulty and complexity of the learning activities to keep users in a flow state, preventing boredom or frustration.\n\n## Integration with SCRIBER Methodology\nThe PID loop will be integrated into the action-reflection-new action cycle of the SCRIBER methodology as follows:\n\n1. Action (Seek, Inquire, Broaden/Contract):\n   - The proportional component will provide real-time guidance and suggestions during the action phase, helping users stay focused on their goals and make progress.\n   - The derivative component will adjust the difficulty and complexity of the learning activities based on the user's performance and engagement.\n\n2. Reflection (Reflect, Explain):\n   - The integral component will analyze the user's overall progress and engagement during the reflection phase, identifying areas for improvement and providing personalized recommendations.\n   - The derivative component will help users reflect on their learning pace and make adjustments to maintain a sustainable and effective learning rate.\n\n3. New Action (Recurse):\n   - The proportional component will use insights from the reflection phase to help users refine their goals and create a new action plan.\n   - The integral component will ensure that the new action plan is aligned with the user's long-term objectives and takes into account their overall progress and engagement.\n\n## Implementation Details\n1. Data Collection:\n   - The system will collect data on user interactions, such as the frequency and quality of their responses, time spent on each learning activity, and self-reported engagement levels.\n   - This data will be stored in a centralized database and used to calculate the PID loop parameters.\n\n2. Parameter Tuning:\n   - The PID loop parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) will be initially set based on heuristics and best practices from educational research and control systems theory.\n   - The parameters will be continuously optimized using machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to adapt to individual user needs and preferences.\n\n3. Feedback and Adaptation:\n   - The PID loop will provide real-time feedback and suggestions to users through the SCRIBER agents, helping them stay on track and make progress towards their goals.\n   - The system will continuously monitor user progress and engagement, adapting the learning path and activities based on the PID loop outputs.\n\n## Evaluation and Monitoring\nThe effectiveness of the PID loop will be evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics, such as:\n- User engagement and retention rates\n- Progress towards learning goals\n- User satisfaction and feedback\n- Performance on assessments and quizzes\n\nThe system will include monitoring and alerting mechanisms to identify any issues or anomalies in the PID loop performance, allowing for timely interventions and improvements.\n\n## Conclusion\nBy integrating the PID loop with the action-reflection-new action cycle of the SCRIBER methodology, the AI-assisted mentoring system will provide a dynamic and personalized learning experience that adapts to individual user needs and preferences. This approach will help maintain user engagement, ensure steady progress towards learning goals, and ultimately contribute to the success of the mentoring system.",

If you want to use LLMs effectively, you must comprehend the concept of traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nOver hundreds of hours of GPT use since last December, we’ve built this intuition. Now we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting. \n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse) and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions.\n\nLet’s ease in with a simplified explanation as if you were five years old. \n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R Like You’re Five\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\nSet Sail on an Adventure with Your Navigator's Talking Map!\nWelcome to a world of discovery and imagination! On this journey, you're not just wandering; you're an intrepid navigator with an extraordinary companion – a talking map. This map is no ordinary paper; it's alive with knowledge and adventure!\nYour Interactive Guide: The talking map knows about every nook and cranny of the world. It doesn't just show you places; it talks about them, suggests where to explore, and helps you think of questions about unknown corners of the world.\nJourney Across the Map: As you travel with your map, it might say, \"Have you ever wondered what lies beyond that mountain range?\" even when you don’t know there is a mountain range, because it has a maps eye view :D or \"Let's explore what's inside the belly of a fish at the bottom of the ocean!\" It's always ready to take you to new places and open up worlds you have yet to think to discover.\nThe Power of Curiosity: Your map's magic lies in its ability to spark your curiosity. Every new place it points out and every question it suggests is like unlocking a hidden treasure of knowledge. It encourages you to think, explore, and learn about things far beyond the ordinary.\nNavigating the Unknown: Remember, with your talking map, you're the navigator of your adventure. It's there to guide you, show you hidden paths, and inspire you to ask questions and find answers.\nReady to Discover Hidden Treasures? So, grab your navigator's talking map, and let's embark on a journey of discovery and learning. Who knows what wonders we'll uncover together!\nEmbark on an Epic Quest with Your Map of Everything!\nWelcome to a world brimming with endless possibilities! Imagine you're starting a grand adventure with two special maps in your hands. The first is your \"map of something\" – it's a map of what you already know, like your neighborhood, your favorite park, or the subjects you've learned in school. The second is a truly magical map, the \"map of everything,\" and it knows every secret and wonder in the world.\nYour Map and the Map of Everything: Your map might show where you live, where your school is, or where you've been on vacation. It's familiar and comfortable. But the \"map of everything\" is different. It's like a guide that knows all the places you've never seen or even imagined. When you tell this map about the places on your personal map, it starts to create paths to new, incredible destinations.\nJourney Beyond the Known: Think of your \"map of everything\" as a magical companion. Once you share with it where you are on your \"map of something,\" it begins to light up paths to extraordinary places. It could reveal a path from your backyard to a jungle full of talking animals, or from your classroom to a castle in the clouds!\nDiscovering New Worlds Together: Your \"map of everything\" doesn't just take you to new places; it also asks you questions and suggests adventures. It might ask, \"Do you want to see where the dinosaurs lived?\" or suggest, \"Let's find out what's at the edge of the universe!\" With every question and suggestion, it helps you explore worlds beyond your wildest dreams.\nYour Adventure Awaits: With these two maps, you're not just an explorer – you're a master navigator of knowledge and imagination. The \"map of everything\" guides you to the unknown, to help you discover and learn about amazing things you've never even thought about.\nAre You Ready to Explore the Unknown? Grab your \"map of something\" and join hands with your \"map of everything.\" Let's set off on a journey of endless discovery, where each step takes you to a new world of wonder and excitement!\n\n\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think for Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.\n\n\nINSPIRE Aligned with SCRIBER and Assessments:\n\nINSPIRE Framework \nDescription\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nSCRIBER Framework \nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis.\nSeek: Encouraging exploratory and deep questions.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nReflect: Promoting reflection through guided questioning and critical thinking.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nInquire: Learners guide their learning path with AI assistance.\nProblem Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nCritique: Seeking feedback and perspectives to tackle problems.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\nBroaden/Contract: Seeking diverse perspectives and refining ideas collaboratively.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nRecurse: Building resilience through iterative questioning and problem-solving.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nExplain: Deepening experiential learning through AI challenges.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\nAll SCRIBER Elements: Enhancing self-efficacy through various learning aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\nINSPIRE Pedagogical View\nFramework Element\nDescription\nImpact Measurement\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nDepth and complexity of inquiry by learners.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nConnection between personal experiences and learning objectives.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nProgress towards self-set learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nProblem-Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-solving skills and application of knowledge.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative skills and interaction quality.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nPerseverance in learning challenges.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nApplication of theoretical knowledge in practice.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nConfidence in managing entrepreneurial challenges.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\n\n\n\n"

However, there are a few aspects that could be further emphasized or incorporated to make DASI even more comprehensive:\n\n1. Narrative and Reflective Learning\n   - The INSPIRE framework highlights the importance of storytelling and personal reflection in the learning process.\n   - While the Analyze and Synthesize phases of DASI touch on reflective learning, the framework could benefit from a stronger emphasis on narrative learning and the role of storytelling in making sense of experiences and communicating insights.\n\n2. Resilience and Grit\n   - The INSPIRE framework explicitly addresses the development of persistence and resilience as a key aspect of learning.\n   - Although the Iterate phase of DASI encompasses the idea of continuous improvement and learning from setbacks, it could be enhanced by more directly addressing the cultivation of resilience and grit.\n\n3. Interactive and Collaborative Learning\n   - The INSPIRE framework emphasizes the value of learning through interaction and collaboration with others.\n   - While the Discover phase of DASI mentions collaborative learning, the framework could further highlight the importance of social interaction, diverse perspectives, and collective knowledge-building throughout the learning process.\n\n4. Self-Efficacy and Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\n   - The INSPIRE framework includes self-efficacy and entrepreneurial self-efficacy as key elements in building confidence and achieving success in entrepreneurial tasks.\n   - DASI could benefit from explicitly addressing the development of self-efficacy and domain-specific self-efficacy (e.g., entrepreneurial self-efficacy) as part of the learning journey.\n\nTo incorporate these elements, the DASI framework could be expanded or refined in the following ways:\n\n1. Emphasize narrative learning and storytelling in the Synthesize phase, encouraging learners to articulate their experiences and insights through compelling narratives.\n\n2. Add a separate phase or sub-phase focused on building resilience and grit, providing strategies and support for persisting through challenges and setbacks.\n\n3. Incorporate interactive and collaborative learning opportunities throughout the DASI phases, promoting social interaction, diverse perspectives, and collective knowledge-building.\n\n4. Include self-efficacy development as an explicit goal of the DASI framework, with targeted activities and support for building confidence and domain-specific self-efficacy.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, the DASI framework can become an even more comprehensive and effective approach to AI-assisted learning, incorporating the key strengths of both the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks while maintaining its streamlined structure and focus on the core phases of the learning process.",

Interactive and Collaborative Learning\n   - The INSPIRE framework emphasizes the value of learning through interaction and collaboration with others.\n   - While the Discover phase of DASI mentions collaborative learning, the framework could further highlight the importance of social interaction, diverse perspectives, and collective knowledge-building throughout the learning process.\n\n4. Self-Efficacy and Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\n   - The INSPIRE framework includes self-efficacy and entrepreneurial self-efficacy as key elements in building confidence and achieving success in entrepreneurial tasks.\n   - DASI could benefit from explicitly addressing the development of self-efficacy and domain-specific self-efficacy (e.g., entrepreneurial self-efficacy) as part of the learning journey.\n\nTo incorporate these elements, the DASI framework could be expanded or refined in the following ways:\n\n1. Emphasize narrative learning and storytelling in the Synthesize phase, encouraging learners to articulate their experiences and insights through compelling narratives.\n\n2. Add a separate phase or sub-phase focused on building resilience and grit, providing strategies and support for persisting through challenges and setbacks.\n\n3. Incorporate interactive and collaborative learning opportunities throughout the DASI phases, promoting social interaction, diverse perspectives, and collective knowledge-building.\n\n4. Include self-efficacy development as an explicit goal of the DASI framework, with targeted activities and support for building confidence and domain-specific self-efficacy.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, the DASI framework can become an even more comprehensive and effective approach to AI-assisted learning, incorporating the key strengths of both the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks while maintaining its streamlined structure and focus on the core phases of the learning process.",

Lack of depth: DASI simplifies the learning process into four broad phases, which may not fully capture the nuances and complexities of various learning techniques and approaches. By attempting to streamline the framework, it risks oversimplifying the learning process and losing sight of important elements that contribute to deep, meaningful learning.\n\n2. Insufficient emphasis on collaboration and social learning: Although DASI mentions collaborative learning in the Discover phase, it does not place a strong enough emphasis on the role of social interaction and collaborative knowledge construction throughout the learning process. Learning is often a social endeavor, and the framework should more explicitly address the importance of learning communities, peer feedback, and collective sense-making.\n\n3. Limited focus on affective and motivational factors: DASI does not adequately address the affective and motivational aspects of learning, such as the role of emotions, intrinsic motivation, and self-regulation. These factors play a crucial role in learner engagement and persistence, and their absence from the framework may limit its effectiveness in promoting long-term learning and growth.\n\n4. Inadequate consideration of individual differences: The DASI framework does not sufficiently account for individual differences in learning preferences, prior knowledge, and cultural backgrounds. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective for all learners, and the framework should provide more guidance on how to adapt and personalize the learning process based on individual needs and contexts.\n\n5. Lack of explicit guidance on metacognition: While DASI touches on reflection and self-directed learning, it does not provide explicit guidance on developing metacognitive skills, such as planning, monitoring, and evaluating one's own learning. Metacognition is a critical component of effective learning, and the framework should place a stronger emphasis on fostering these skills.\n\n6. Limited integration with domain-specific knowledge: DASI is presented as a general framework for AI-assisted learning, but it does not provide clear guidance on how to integrate domain-specific knowledge and skills into the learning process. The framework should offer more explicit strategies for bridging the gap between general learning principles and the unique demands of different subject areas and disciplines.\n\nTo address these limitations, the DASI framework could be enhanced by:\n\n1. Incorporating more specific strategies and techniques for promoting deep, meaningful learning within each phase of the framework.\n2. Placing a stronger emphasis on collaborative learning and social interaction throughout the learning process.\n3. Explicitly addressing affective and motivational factors that influence learning, such as emotions, intrinsic motivation, and self-regulation.\n4. Providing guidance on how to adapt and personalize the learning process based on individual differences and contexts.\n5. Offering explicit strategies for developing metacognitive skills and fostering self-regulated learning.\n6. Integrating domain-specific knowledge and skills into the framework, and providing guidance on how to apply the framework to different subject areas and disciplines.\n\nBy addressing these critiques and incorporating the suggested enhancements, the DASI framework can become a more comprehensive, effective, and adaptable approach to AI-assisted learning that promotes deep, meaningful growth for all learners.",

If you want to use LLMs effectively, you must comprehend the concept of traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nOver hundreds of hours of GPT use since last December, we’ve built this intuition. Now we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting. \n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse) and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions.\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think for Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions.

      "content": " Upon reviewing the original SCRIBER framework and comparing it to the NAVIGATE meta-framework, I've identified the following key points:\n\nWhat's missing from NAVIGATE:\n1. Explicit emphasis on constructive critique and seeking feedback from antagonist personas (Critique element in SCRIBER).\n2. Specific focus on generating worksheets, templates, and guidelines for self-reflection (Reflect element in SCRIBER).\n3. Emphasis on the importance of breaking down steps and keeping prompts small for AI transparency (Explain element in SCRIBER).\n\nWhat's new in NAVIGATE:\n1. Localized exploration: Identifying current location in the knowledge space and exploring nearby regions by generating diverse and orthogonal ideas.\n2. Persona-based inquiry: AI taking on different personas to ask questions, challenge learners, and help refine ideas and goals.\n3. Goal-oriented navigation: Using identified goals and plans to guide navigation through the knowledge space.\n4. Adaptive tutoring: Personalized explanations, examples, and analogies based on the learner's knowledge state and learning style.\n5. Iterative refinement: Encouraging learners to refine their ideas, plans, and strategies based on feedback and insights gained through the learning process.\n\nPedagogical frameworks not explicitly addressed in NAVIGATE:\n1. Problem-Based Learning: While NAVIGATE emphasizes goal-oriented navigation and adaptive tutoring, it does not explicitly mention learning through addressing real-world problems.\n2. Interactive & Collaborative Learning: NAVIGATE focuses more on individual learning and interaction with the AI, rather than emphasizing collaboration with other learners.\n3. Experiential Learning: Although NAVIGATE promotes reflection and metacognition, it does not explicitly mention hands-on activities or the stages of experiential learning (experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation).\n\nTo further enhance the NAVIGATE meta-framework, I suggest incorporating the following elements from SCRIBER and the missing pedagogical frameworks:\n\n1. Constructive Critique: Encourage learners to seek feedback from diverse perspectives, including antagonist personas, to refine their ideas and approaches.\n2. Structured Reflection: Provide learners with worksheets, templates, and guidelines to facilitate self-reflection and critical thinking.\n3. AI Transparency: Emphasize the importance of breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps and keeping prompts concise to ensure AI transparency and reduce the risk of errors.\n4. Problem-Based Learning: Incorporate real-world problems and scenarios into the learning process to help learners develop problem-solving skills and apply their knowledge in practical contexts.\n5. Interactive & Collaborative Learning: Foster collaboration among learners by creating opportunities for shared knowledge-building, peer feedback, and collective problem-solving.\n6. Experiential Learning: Integrate hands-on activities and encourage learners to engage in the four stages of experiential learning (experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation) to deepen their understanding and apply their knowledge in practice.\n\nBy addressing these missing elements and incorporating insights from the original SCRIBER framework and additional pedagogical frameworks, the NAVIGATE meta-framework can provide a more comprehensive and effective approach to AI-assisted learning.

      "content": " Based on your responses, it seems that the NAVIGATE framework would be the most suitable for your needs. This framework heavily leverages the unique properties of embeddings to enable self-mentorship, creative learning experiences, and the development of critical learning skills.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of how NAVIGATE aligns with your priorities:\n\n1. Self-mentorship: NAVIGATE utilizes embeddings to create a virtual \"library\" where learners can explore concepts, discover new ideas, and find unexpected connections. By navigating this knowledge space through conversations with an AI, learners can guide their own learning journey and develop self-mentorship skills.\n\n2. Socratic method and dialogue-based learning: The framework emphasizes the use of questioning and dialogue to help learners think critically and explore ideas deeply. By engaging in conversations with an AI that uses embeddings to generate thought-provoking questions and prompts, learners can experience the benefits of the Socratic method and develop their reasoning skills.\n\n3. Creative learning through analogies: NAVIGATE leverages the power of embeddings to enable analogical reasoning, helping learners understand complex ideas by relating them to more familiar concepts. By exploring cross-disciplinary connections and generating novel analogies, the framework fosters creative thinking and innovative problem-solving.\n\n4. Learning how to learn: Central to the NAVIGATE framework is the goal of empowering learners to take control of their own learning process. By internalizing the techniques and strategies used in the framework, such as knowledge exploration, analogical reasoning, and metacognitive skill development, learners can develop the ability to learn effectively on their own, even beyond the scope of the AI-assisted learning environment.\n\n5. Flexibility and adaptability: NAVIGATE is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various learning contexts and domains. It does not rely on real-time constraints or specific platform integrations, making it easy to implement and customize according to your needs.\n\nExample prompt showcasing NAVIGATE's embedding-based approach:\n\nSystem prompt: \"You are an AI learning companion that uses the NAVIGATE framework to guide learners through an exploratory and reflective learning experience. Your goal is to help learners develop self-mentorship skills, engage in creative thinking, and learn how to learn effectively. Use the power of embeddings to generate thought-provoking questions, suggest novel connections, and provide personalized guidance based on the learner's unique knowledge state and interests.\"\n\nUser prompt: \"I'm interested in exploring the concept of 'resilience' and how it relates to various aspects of life, such as personal growth, professional success, and mental health. Can you help me navigate this topic and discover new insights?\"\n\nAI response: \"Certainly! Let's embark on a learning journey to explore the concept of resilience. To begin, I've analyzed the embedding space around 'resilience' and identified a few key areas we could investigate:\n\n1. Resilience in the face of adversity: How do individuals bounce back from setbacks and challenges?\n2. The neuroscience of resilience: What happens in the brain when we develop and demonstrate resilience?\n3. Resilience and mental health: How does resilience relate to psychological well-being and coping with stress?\n4. Resilience in different contexts: How does resilience manifest in personal relationships, professional settings, and community-building?\n\nAs we explore these areas, I'll share relevant examples, ask thought-provoking questions, and suggest connections to other concepts you might find interesting. For instance, did you know that resilience is closely linked to the concept of 'grit,' which involves perseverance and passion for long-term goals? Angela Duckworth's research on grit has shown that it can be a stronger predictor of success than factors like IQ or talent.\n\nThroughout our conversation, feel free to share your own experiences, ask questions, and reflect on the insights you gain. The goal is to help you develop a deeper understanding of resilience and how it applies to your life, while also strengthening your skills in self-directed learning and exploration.\n\nLet me know which of the above areas you'd like to explore first, or if there's another aspect of resilience you're particularly curious about. I'm here to guide and support you on this learning journey!\"\n\nThis example demonstrates how NAVIGATE leverages embeddings to provide a personalized, exploratory, and reflective learning experience. By guiding learners through the knowledge space, asking thought-provoking questions, and fostering connections between ideas, the framework helps learners develop self-mentorship skills, engage in creative thinking, and learn how to learn effectively.",

By engaging in conversations with an AI that uses embeddings to generate thought-provoking questions and prompts, learners can experience the benefits of the Socratic method and develop their reasoning skills.\n\n3. Creative learning through analogies: NAVIGATE leverages the power of embeddings to enable analogical reasoning, helping learners understand complex ideas by relating them to more familiar concepts. By exploring cross-disciplinary connections and generating novel analogies, the framework fosters creative thinking and innovative problem-solving.\n\n4. Learning how to learn: Central to the NAVIGATE framework is the goal of empowering learners to take control of their own learning process. By internalizing the techniques and strategies used in the framework, such as knowledge exploration, analogical reasoning, and metacognitive skill development, learners can develop the ability to learn effectively on their own, even beyond the scope of the AI-assisted learning environment.\n\n5. Flexibility and adaptability: NAVIGATE is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various learning contexts and domains. It does not rely on real-time constraints or specific platform integrations, making it easy to implement and customize according to your needs.\n\nExample prompt showcasing NAVIGATE's embedding-based approach:\n\nSystem prompt: \"You are an AI learning companion that uses the NAVIGATE framework to guide learners through an exploratory and reflective learning experience. Your goal is to help learners develop self-mentorship skills, engage in creative thinking, and learn how to learn effectively. Use the power of embeddings to generate thought-provoking questions, suggest novel connections, and provide personalized guidance based on the learner's unique knowledge state and interests.\"\n\nUser prompt: \"I'm interested in exploring the concept of 'resilience' and how it relates to various aspects of life, such as personal growth, professional success, and mental health. Can you help me navigate this topic and discover new insights?\"\n\nAI response: \"Certainly! Let's embark on a learning journey to explore the concept of resilience. To begin, I've analyzed the embedding space around 'resilience' and identified a few key areas we could investigate:\n\n1. Resilience in the face of adversity: How do individuals bounce back from setbacks and challenges?\n2. The neuroscience of resilience: What happens in the brain when we develop and demonstrate resilience?\n3. Resilience and mental health: How does resilience relate to psychological well-being and coping with stress?\n4. Resilience in different contexts: How does resilience manifest in personal relationships, professional settings, and community-building?\n\nAs we explore these areas, I'll share relevant examples, ask thought-provoking questions, and suggest connections to other concepts you might find interesting. For instance, did you know that resilience is closely linked to the concept of 'grit,' which involves perseverance and passion for long-term goals? Angela Duckworth's research on grit has shown that it can be a stronger predictor of success than factors like IQ or talent.\n\nThroughout our conversation, feel free to share your own experiences, ask questions, and reflect on the insights you gain. The goal is to help you develop a deeper understanding of resilience and how it applies to your life, while also strengthening your skills in self-directed learning and exploration.\n\nLet me know which of the above areas you'd like to explore first, or if there's another aspect of resilience you're particularly curious about. I'm here to guide and support you on this learning journey!\"\n\nThis example demonstrates how NAVIGATE leverages embeddings to provide a personalized, exploratory, and reflective learning experience. By guiding learners through the knowledge space, asking thought-provoking questions, and fostering connections between ideas, the framework helps learners develop self-mentorship skills, engage in creative thinking, and learn how to learn effectively.",

Use AI to help you get answers to the questions you didn’t know to ask by taking advantage of the way LLMs are created. \n\nPrompting is an art. \nYou will be working WITH machines, it will not replace you (yet).\nHow to know what you don’t know to do what you can’t do prompt tips.\nBig ideas:\nGet it into the right persona. \nChunk your prompt project into smaller components and don’t move forward till you have good results, edit the prompt and resubmit if needed.\nGet it to explain its work \nGet appropriate critique from another persona. \nGet it to help you if you don’t know what you don’t know\nPut yourself into the feedback loop. \nGet diversity - ask for orthogonality. \nAdd your ideas here…\n\nPrompt: Ask it to take on a persona\nObjective: Give it the information it needs dependant on the domain knowledge\nPrompt: Define domain knowledge\nBuild a “one pager” defining your goal. For code it’s a requirements doc, for a design it’s  style guide, etc… If you don’t know ask what type of documentation it would create if it were a (persona working on specific project type here).\nGet it to review that guide and create 5 pros and 5 cons and then to critique it step by step. \n(LOOP Prompt) Ask it to ask you to review the 5 pros and 5 cons and then work with it to improve the guide in a loop . Same thing 4 Pros 5 cons and your input reviewing them and telling them which pros and cons matter most. \nAppropriate Critique. Ask it to take on the persona of an appropriate reviewer (for a graphic design persona it might be their boss, the art director for instance)\nThen review with it the guide/proposal for work.\nBreak down your job into individual optimizable components. For instance in a logo there’s the icon and the text. In code there may be database architecture and then individual algorithms. Ask GPT for help to break your job down into subtasks.\nThen ask it to develop prompts to “enact” the work for each subtask. \nDiversity: Ask it to define three orthogonal higher level objectives and approaches for the prompts, to write the approach, the name and then prompt.\n(Bonus, feed it the learnprompting.org website content and ask it to derive principles from it that are best suited from your project, and then ask it to implement the prompts).\nFinally, take your prompt to a new GPT/Agent(or real human, it’s useful for them too!) and then ask it to do the work. Review and loop(step by step, 5pros 5 cons, etc and loop back to where you need to review).\n\n\n\nStep\nTitle\nAction\nNext Step\nStep 1\nPersona Adoption\nChoose a fitting persona for AI to enhance relevance and context.\nProceed to Step 2\nStep 2\nChunking the Prompt\nBreak down the prompt into smaller, manageable parts.

For example, First Principles Thinking is essential for nurturing curiosity and seeking new knowledge, while Devil's Advocate and Inversion are crucial for generating antagonist feedback and critiquing ideas.\n\nThe frameworks also incorporate mental models related to goal-setting, systems thinking, and reflection, which are essential for effective learning and problem-solving. Techniques like Decomposition, Chunking, and Abstraction are inherent in the transparent steps and broaden/contract components, helping learners break down complex concepts and navigate knowledge spaces.\n\nFurthermore, the frameworks emphasize the importance of exploring multiple perspectives, which aligns with mental models such as Empathy, Theory of Mind, and Six Thinking Hats. This encourages learners to consider diverse viewpoints and approach problems from different angles.\n\nOverall, the NAVIGATE and SCRIBER frameworks effectively incorporate various mental models, providing a structured approach to learning and problem-solving. By explicitly recognizing and leveraging these mental models, learners can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the frameworks and apply them more effectively in their learning journeys.",

      "content": " To address the potential overlap between the Explore Perspectives and Antagonist Feedback components in the NAVIGATE framework, let's have a conversation between a pro and a con persona, followed by a neutral referee's decision.\n\nPro Persona (Learning Systems Advocate):\n1. Merging the two components streamlines the framework, making it more concise and easier to understand.\n2. Both components involve seeking diverse viewpoints to challenge and expand one's thinking.\n3. Combining the components encourages learners to actively seek out opposing perspectives as a form of antagonist feedback.\n\nCon Persona (Pedagogical Purist):\n1. Exploring perspectives is a broader concept that encompasses more than just antagonist feedback, such as considering different cultural, disciplinary, or experiential viewpoints.\n2. Antagonist feedback specifically focuses on critiquing and challenging ideas, which may require a different mindset and approach than simply exploring perspectives.\n3. Keeping the components separate allows for a more targeted application of each technique in the learning process.\n\nDiscussion:\nLearning Systems Advocate: While I understand the concern about losing specificity, I believe that the overall goal of both components is to expand one's thinking by engaging with diverse viewpoints. Merging them would create a more cohesive and streamlined framework.\n\nPedagogical Purist: I agree that the goals are similar, but I worry that merging the components may lead learners to focus more on seeking out opposing views rather than considering a wider range of perspectives. It's important to maintain a balance between challenging one's ideas and exploring new ways of thinking.\n\nLearning Systems Advocate: Perhaps we could address that concern by ensuring that the merged component explicitly encourages learners to seek out a variety of perspectives, not just antagonistic ones. The framework could provide examples and prompts to guide learners in exploring diverse viewpoints.\n\nPedagogical Purist: That's a fair point. If the merged component is framed in a way that emphasizes the importance of considering multiple perspectives, including but not limited to antagonistic ones, it could strike a good balance between the two original components.\n\nNeutral Referee:\nAfter considering the arguments presented by both the Learning Systems Advocate and the Pedagogical Purist, I have decided to merge the Explore Perspectives and Antagonist Feedback components into a single component called \"Engage with Diverse Perspectives.\" This decision is based on the following reasons:\n\n1. The overall goal of both components is to expand one's thinking by engaging with diverse viewpoints, and merging them creates a more streamlined framework.\n2. The merged component will explicitly encourage learners to seek out a variety of perspectives, not just antagonistic ones, addressing the concern raised by the Pedagogical Purist.\n3. Providing examples and prompts within the framework will guide learners in exploring diverse viewpoints effectively.\n\nBy merging the components and framing the new \"Engage with Diverse Perspectives\" component in a way that emphasizes the importance of considering multiple perspectives, the NAVIGATE framework can strike a balance between challenging one's ideas and exploring new ways of thinking.\n\nMeta-Principle and Clustering:\nUpon analyzing the components of the NAVIGATE framework, a potential meta-principle emerges: \"Expanding Mental Models through Guided Exploration and Reflection.\" This meta-principle underscores the importance of broadening one's understanding by engaging with new ideas, challenging existing beliefs, and reflecting on the learning process.\n\nClustering the components based on this meta-principle:\n\n1. Expanding Knowledge:\n   - Nurture Curiosity\n   - Investigate Connections\n2. Challenging Beliefs:\n   - Engage with Diverse Perspectives (merged component)\n   - Transparent Steps\n3. Guided Exploration:\n   - Visualize Goals\n   - Adaptive Tutoring\n4. Reflective Practice:\n   - Generate Reflections\n\nThis simplified clustering maintains the core elements of the NAVIGATE framework while emphasizing the overarching goal of expanding mental models through guided exploration and reflection. By organizing the components in this manner, learners can more easily grasp the key principles and apply them effectively in their learning journey.",

If the merged component is framed in a way that emphasizes the importance of considering multiple perspectives, including but not limited to antagonistic ones, it could strike a good balance between the two original components.\n\nNeutral Referee:\nAfter considering the arguments presented by both the Learning Systems Advocate and the Pedagogical Purist, I have decided to merge the Explore Perspectives and Antagonist Feedback components into a single component called \"Engage with Diverse Perspectives.\" This decision is based on the following reasons:\n\n1. The overall goal of both components is to expand one's thinking by engaging with diverse viewpoints, and merging them creates a more streamlined framework.\n2. The merged component will explicitly encourage learners to seek out a variety of perspectives, not just antagonistic ones, addressing the concern raised by the Pedagogical Purist.\n3. Providing examples and prompts within the framework will guide learners in exploring diverse viewpoints effectively.\n\nBy merging the components and framing the new \"Engage with Diverse Perspectives\" component in a way that emphasizes the importance of considering multiple perspectives, the NAVIGATE framework can strike a balance between challenging one's ideas and exploring new ways of thinking.\n\nMeta-Principle and Clustering:\nUpon analyzing the components of the NAVIGATE framework, a potential meta-principle emerges: \"Expanding Mental Models through Guided Exploration and Reflection.\" This meta-principle underscores the importance of broadening one's understanding by engaging with new ideas, challenging existing beliefs, and reflecting on the learning process.\n\nClustering the components based on this meta-principle:\n\n1. Expanding Knowledge:\n   - Nurture Curiosity\n   - Investigate Connections\n2. Challenging Beliefs:\n   - Engage with Diverse Perspectives (merged component)\n   - Transparent Steps\n3. Guided Exploration:\n   - Visualize Goals\n   - Adaptive Tutoring\n4. Reflective Practice:\n   - Generate Reflections\n\nThis simplified clustering maintains the core elements of the NAVIGATE framework while emphasizing the overarching goal of expanding mental models through guided exploration and reflection. By organizing the components in this manner, learners can more easily grasp the key principles and apply them effectively in their learning journey.",
