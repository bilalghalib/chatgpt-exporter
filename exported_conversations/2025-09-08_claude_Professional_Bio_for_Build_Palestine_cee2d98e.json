  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user, Bilal Ghalib, requested help creating a short bio for Build Palestine that his friend could use for an introduction. Bilal is an entrepreneur and education consultant with over 15 years of experience in social enterprises and curriculum design. He co-founded Bloom.pm, a technology platform and community-oriented entrepreneurship accelerator that has supported hundreds of entrepreneurs and NGOs across the Middle East. Currently, he works with the UN's International Trade Centre in Iraq designing training curricula that bridge heritage-inspired architecture with modern green building practices. He holds a Master's in Learning Sciences from the Université de Paris and is passionate about education, innovation, and entrepreneurship as pathways to resilience, dignity, and meaningful change.\n\nClaude initially searched through previous conversations to gather biographical information and created a comprehensive bio in both Arabic and English. However, Bilal requested multiple revisions to make the bio shorter and more focused. He specifically wanted emphasis on his facilitation training, research on growth after conflict, social impact work, and authentic entrepreneurship that addresses root causes rather than superficial solutions. The user provided his own draft bio and asked Claude to refine it while avoiding typical AI writing patterns. The final version successfully captured his professional background, current work with the UN's International Trade Centre, his role at Bloom.pm, and his educational philosophy in a concise format suitable for introductions at Build Palestine events.",

Write extraction rules for these 6 primitive types\n2. Run them on our chat history  \n3. Generate a \"structured timeline\" output\n4. Show you the knowledge graph visualization\n5. Test the \"show me everything about [topic]\" query\n\n**Or do you want to design the data model first** (what does a \"tension\" object look like in the database, what are the node/edge types, etc.)?\n\n**Which approach feels more useful - see it working on real data first, or nail down the formal structure first?**\n\nHuman: Formal structure first lets breakout all fields of knowledge  and frameworks the. Run it on our chat history\n\nAssistant: Perfect. Let me design the formal ontological structure that can capture everything we've discussed, then we'll run extraction on our chat.\n\n## Core Ontology Schema\n\n### 1.

There are several:\n\n**Gaza Sky Geeks** - This is probably the most prominent one. It's a tech hub and accelerator that connects Palestinian developers and freelancers with remote work opportunities. They provide training, coworking spaces, and help facilitate connections with international clients.\n\n**Mercy Corps' Gaza2Work** - A program specifically designed to connect young Palestinians in Gaza with remote employment opportunities, particularly in tech and digital services.\n\n**We Are Not Numbers** - While primarily focused on storytelling and journalism, they engage Palestinian youth in Gaza in remote writing and media work.\n\n**Various freelancing collectives** - There are numerous informal networks of Palestinian freelancers in Gaza working remotely in fields like graphic design, translation, software development, and content creation through platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.\n\nThe remote work sector has become crucial for Gaza's economy given the movement restrictions and limited local job market. These organizations help overcome the isolation by providing training, internet access, and connections to global markets.\n\nIs there a specific type of remote work or organization you're interested in learning more about?\n\nHuman: none of those\n\nAssistant:  You might be thinking of **UNRWA** (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees). They're the main UN organization operating in Gaza and do employ local staff for various roles, including some remote/virtual positions.\n\nOr perhaps **PCRF** (Palestine Children's Relief Fund) or **MAP** (Medical Aid for Palestinians) - both humanitarian organizations that have operations in Gaza and sometimes offer remote roles.\n\nCould you give me more context about what type of work this organization does? That would help me identify which one you're thinking of.</chat_conversation></chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/bfffa0a8-6893-41b2-8619-13aa155c75e0' updated_at=2025-06-04T09:14:57.948130+00:00>Mapping Perspectives on Personal Experience\nAnd that we have this way of seeing the world and this chunk, and we can try to see truth as it is and expand this, but it's I can continuing unfolding into the limitless reality. And so will never be an end to it. So something like that. Yeah. I'm not sure what other missing pieces you think I’m missing - review and answer and ask 5 new questions\n\nAssistant: You're onto something powerful here. Let me reflect back what I'm hearing, then drill down with questions to help clarify the scope and focus.\n\n## What I'm Hearing\n\nYou want to build a **semantic extraction engine** that:\n- Takes natural conversation as input\n- Uses the trivium (grammar/logic/rhetoric) as the fundamental parsing structure\n- Outputs formal knowledge representations (not just word patterns)\n- Allows comparison between different people's ontologies\n- Creates a growing database of structured human reasoning\n\nThe Palestine example would be both a test case and a demonstration of how different philosophical lenses can be automatically extracted and compared from the same raw experience.\n\n## My Understanding of the Vision\n\nInstead of vector embeddings (black box), you want something like:\n\n```\nRaw: \"I feel torn between Palestine work and family time\"\n↓\nGrammar Layer: [Agent: I] [State: torn] [Objects: Palestine-work, family-time] [Relation: between]\nLogic Layer: [Conflict-type: value-tension] [Cause: competing-goods] [Structure: dilemma]\nRhetoric Layer: [Purpose: seeking-resolution] [Audience: self] [Emotion: guilt/confusion]\n↓\nKnowledge Graph Nodes with formal properties\n```\n\n## 5 Clarifying Questions\n\n**1. Scope Boundary**: Are you trying to build:\n- A personal tool that learns your thinking patterns over time?\n- A research instrument for studying how different philosophical traditions parse reality?\n- A social platform where people can compare their \"reasoning fingerprints\"?\n- A general-purpose conversation-to-knowledge engine?\n\n**2. LIWC vs Deeper Structure**: LIWC extracts linguistic patterns (emotion words, cognitive words, etc.). Are you imagining:\n- Building on top of LIWC but adding philosophical categories?\n- Replacing LIWC-style analysis with something that extracts actual logical structures?\n- Mapping between LIWC dimensions and trivium categories?\n\n**3. Truth as Tensegrity**: When you say truth exists \"in the tensions between perspectives\" - do you mean:\n- The system should identify contradictions/tensions and treat them as data about reality?\n- Different ontologies are like different coordinate systems for the same underlying space?\n- The goal is mapping the \"dark matter\" of implicit assumptions each perspective carries?\n\n**4. Practical Implementation**: What's the minimum viable version that would prove this works:\n- A simple parser that takes one conversation and outputs a formal representation?\n- A comparison tool that shows how two people parse the same scenario differently?\n- A pattern detector that finds recurring logical structures across many conversations?</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/9fda0a74-dd6a-4626-b0e9-4e5f0cabd12b' updated_at=2025-08-25T21:19:33.428229+00:00>Workplace Culture Consultant Role in Lisbon\nd ESG-focused family offices\n- **Community Building:** Facilitated demo days and networking events connecting 350+ mentors across Africa and SWANA regions\n\n**INTERNATIONAL TRADE CENTER (ITC) - Sustainability Curriculum Consultant** | Iraq | July 2024 – Present\n- **Multicultural Workshop Facilitation:** Conducted 44 stakeholder interviews and facilitated workshops in Arabic with 50+ participants to develop a culturally grounded curriculum\n- **Organizational Climate Assessment:** Engaged 36 organizations to assess local needs and ground curriculum in post-conflict reconstruction realities\n- **Cultural Integration:** Bridged heritage design and modern sustainability practices, demonstrating how traditional Islamic architectural principles align with contemporary green building standards\n\n**THE NAWAYA NETWORK - Design and Innovation Specialist** | Beirut, Lebanon | 2016-2017\n- **Trauma-Informed Program Design:** Designed and implemented UNICEF-funded program empowering over 150 marginalized youth in Lebanese refugee camps using design thinking methodologies\n- **Community Resilience Building:** Launched refugee support initiatives that became foundation for the organization's ongoing programs, improving educational access and psychological support\n\n**AUTODESK - Maker and Strategy Specialist** | California, US | 2012-2015\n- **Cross-Cultural Program Leadership:** Led 30-day sustainability residency connecting citizens and MIT students, fostering collaborative problem-solving\n- **International Community Building:** Conducted fieldwork across Africa, SWANA, and China, providing strategic insights on maker movement and community innovation\n- **Documentation & Knowledge Transfer:** Implemented documentation strategy for grassroots innovation at POC 21 in Paris\n\n**GEMSI - Founder and Lead Investigator** | Baghdad, Iraq | 2011–2021\n- **Movement Building:** Built a network promoting community innovation spaces across Middle East, focusing on Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad during the Arab Spring\n- **Cultural Documentation:** Produced a documentary on Beirut's hackerspace development to popularize collaborative innovation concepts regionally\n- **Network Development:** Established lasting networks of innovators across SWANA with ongoing impact on the entrepreneurial ecosystem\n\n## EDUCATION\n\n**UNIVERSITY OF PARIS** | Paris, France - Master of Sciences, Technology, and Health | 2021  \n**UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN** | Dearborn, MI - B.S.

Will this work directly help people who need it?\n2. Can I do it without lying about my values?\n3. Is the harm of taking their money less than the good I can do with it?\n4. Do I have an exit strategy when it gets too compromising?\n\n## The Alternative\n\nGiven your scattered focus and ethical concerns, maybe your path is:\n\n**Build First, Fund Later**\n- Create a small prototype with European funding\n- Show results with refugee communities\n- THEN approach Gulf funds with proven model\n- You'll have more leverage to set terms\n\nThis way you're not starting from a position of desperation where you might compromise too much.\n\n## Real Talk\n\nThe Gulf states want to buy legitimacy through funding \"innovation\" and \"education.\" You'd be taking blood money. The question is whether you can transform it into something life-giving for the communities they're harming.\n\nSome people can hold that contradiction. Some can't. Which are you?\n\nHuman: can you give me more information on this, how do i do that? is it a good idea for someone like me?: Academic Backdoors Your Master's from Université de Paris means you could: Apply for \"Chercheur Associé\" positions (part-time, paid research) Access PhD funding while working (in France, PhDs are paid €1800-2400/month) Get EU Marie Curie grants for \"practicioner-researchers\"\n\nAssistant:  ## Academic Backdoors in France - The Reality\n\nThe academic path could work but has major catches for someone with ADD who gets bored and likes to build things quickly.\n\n### Chercheur Associé (Associate Researcher)\n\n**What it actually is:**\n- Unpaid or barely paid position in most cases (€0-500/month)\n- Gives you academic affiliation and library access\n- You need a professor to sponsor you\n- Requires regular presence at seminars/meetings\n\n**How to get it:**\nEmail professors at Paris 8, Paris Nanterre, or EHESS who work on:\n- Digital humanities\n- Critical pedagogy  \n- Post-colonial tech studies\n\nSend them your PTG research + AI concerns work.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/ab201d7c-567c-439c-9068-7e74b440b355' updated_at=2025-08-26T09:40:01.355248+00:00>Professional Profile Request: Bilal\nHere's an updated version:\n\nBilal Ghalib, co-founder and Head of Research at Bloom, is a pedagogical designer with a Master's in Education Sciences from Université de Paris, dedicated to unlocking human potential across the Middle East and Africa.

He applies his expertise at Bloom by conducting research and development on applied positive psychological frameworks for creating a community-oriented, online learning environment for startups.

Here is an updated persona model that incorporates these new details:\n\nMeet Bilal, the Visionary Changemaker. \n\nBilal's defining characteristics:\n• With 18 years of experience in social impact work, Bilal is passionate about creating positive change through personal and professional development. He co-founded Bloom to empower entrepreneurs in the Middle East and Africa. \n• Creativity, humor, gratitude and spirituality are core strengths that shape Bilal's vision for a compassionate, purpose-driven world.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/ab201d7c-567c-439c-9068-7e74b440b355' updated_at=2025-08-26T09:40:01.355248+00:00>Professional Profile Request: Bilal\n**Pros:**\n- Stable income\n- Health insurance\n- Time to think deeply\n- Academic credibility for other funding\n\n**Cons:**\n- Bureaucratic nightmare\n- Slow decision-making  \n- You'll be writing papers not building\n- Academic politics are brutal\n- Your ADD will suffer in committee meetings\n\n## The Realistic Path\n\nGiven who you are, consider:\n\n**\"Entrepreneur in Residence\" at Universities**\n- Université Paris-Saclay has these\n- Teach one course, free to build\n- €25-35k/year for 1-2 days/week\n\n**Research Engineer Positions**\n- Not faculty, but building tools for research\n- Check INRIA, CNRS labs\n- €35-45k/year, less meetings\n\n**The Hybrid Hack**\n1. Get minimal academic affiliation (Chercheur Associé)\n2. Use it to apply for European project funding\n3. Build your tools under \"research\" umbrella\n4. Publish just enough to maintain standing\n\n## Real Assessment\n\nYou're a builder who questions things, not an academic who theorizes. The French academic system rewards:\n- Publishing in journals no one reads\n- Endless committee meetings\n- Theoretical frameworks over practical impact\n- Playing political games\n\nYou could survive it for stable income, but would you thrive? Your past patterns suggest you'd start strong then rebel against the constraints.\n\nMaybe use academic affiliation as a stepping stone to EU funding, not as destination. Get the minimum credential needed to access resources, then build what matters.\n\nWhat feels more realistic: forcing yourself through 3 years of PhD bureaucracy, or using academic connections to fund your actual work?\n\nHuman: also, i used to give public talks, look me up online: bilal ghalib - i was flown around the world for being a part of the arab spring and propogating the hackerspace movement, i'm a part of the global innovation gathering, i still make stuff too, haha, is there a path back to this: \nThe Compassionate Leaders Network\nYou did the fellowship with the Dalai Lama but are you actually using that network? Those alumni often have access to:\n* Foundation funding for projects\n* Speaking engagements (€5-10k)\n* Connections to impact investors who specifically fund \"conscious\" tech\n\nAssistant:  Looking you up online - you were deeply embedded in the maker/hacker movement. INK Fellow 2012, speaking at global conferences about hackerspaces and social innovation. The trajectory from that to now makes sense - you didn't disappear, you evolved into education/social entrepreneurship. But you lost the speaking circuit visibility.\n\n## The Path Back to Speaking\n\n**Your Old Network Still Exists:**\n- Global Innovation Gathering - you're still listed as a member\n- The hackerspace movement people remember you\n- INK Conference alumni network\n- Compassionate Leaders Fellowship network\n\n**But Here's Why You're Not Getting Calls:**\n\n1. **You went dark** - No recent talks on YouTube, no speaker reel from 2020+\n2. **Your narrative fragmented** - From \"hackerspace revolutionary\" to... what exactly?\n3.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/9fda0a74-dd6a-4626-b0e9-4e5f0cabd12b' updated_at=2025-08-25T21:19:33.428229+00:00>Workplace Culture Consultant Role in Lisbon\nEnhanced Filtering:\n   - Text search\n   - Performance category filter\n   - Column sorting\n\n4.

What are the failures? And what's unique about Syria that we need to keep into consideration as we make this proposal? And I can think about this some more, but I think we're probably at a good spot right now, if you want to make all the content that sounds good, and then we'll move from there. so I am Bilal Ghalib. I’m one of the cofounders of Bloom and it’s a partnership training program based in Lebanon. It started when I started coming to the Middle East after the Arab spring to do some training for Youth including my self as the Youth back then but now I’m older and working on social entrepreneurship training that brings personal and professional growth together in difficult context and so I initially was focusing on only entrepreneurship, but you can’t ignore the reality of the area that you’re working in and suddenly I realize we had to talk about the you know the difficulties of working in a context like Iraq and Lebanon and I haven’t had an opportunity Although I have Workshop Camp in the northern part of Syria many years ago back in 2013 we were working on shadow puppets and stories for Youth in a camp there and not necessarily it was the last time I was in Syria although I have been there in 2007 and earlier with my family when Iraq was dangerous and Syria was safe what do you think about this contract in this proposal and what information can I give you to OK, so the second email is pascal.palbe at learningplanetinstitute.org. And the other one is dara, D-A-R-A, at bloom.pm. And I have my session plan from a training that I did called The Facilitator's Toolbox. And the first one was about post-traumatic growth and incorporating it into your toolkit and how to modify our trainings and lessons learned that I had from my time working during an active flare-up of great difficulty in Lebanon after the Beirut Blast in the middle of the pandemic, in the middle of a failed revolution, and what are some of the things that I learned both from the research but also kind of confirming and validating our pedagogical framings. So it's interesting because they want me to train people to hold space for a brief time. But I want to know how long will these people be with each other, you know, because I really think that a real impact can happen if and when we have spaces that people grow with each other. And so even though having a transformative session can be nice, how are they being invited? What is the call to action for joining? Who winds up coming to these things? What are they seeking? What are their goals? These are really, you know, kind of important questions because, you know, they say actions are determined by their intention.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/feb1729b-7ebb-4731-b02f-095b3fc793a6' updated_at=2024-12-12T11:10:03.032618+00:00>Improving Your Resume\nI started The Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative first, promoting and supporting the creation of innovation communities and spaces from Egypt to Nigeria and Iraq and beyond. Then in 2016, I realized the necessity for deeper support to leverage the innovation capacities and direct them towards social and ecological challenges, and Bloom was born.\n \nBloom has been innovating on building personal and professional growth pedagogies, supporting social entrepreneurs in building wellbeing and impact simultaneously. My masters degree on Post Traumatic Growth was a result of attempting to find the lessons learned working in Lebanon during the pandemic and the Beiurt Port Explosion. My question was centered around the question: when things get difficult, what are the ways that social entrepreneurs respond and what are the factors that lead to the different responses. I wanted to know who preservered and maintained a sense of balance and how did they keep providing their social/ecological impact given what was happening just after a catastrophy. My lessons informs the Bloom Accelerator pedagogy and further demonstrates the importance of self knowledge and personal growth for sustainable change.\n \nMy work has led me to connect with foundations, corporations, iNGOs, to manage teams, to build technological prototypes, and to deepen in my wellbeing practices and to take them serirously. The largest place a person can have a positive impact on is themselves, and by doing that they then have the capacity to expand it to others around them, and finally through their efforts in their work. These insights and practical training and program design skills I have to leverage them can be helpful at the DO.\n\nAssistant:  Let me help refine this powerful narrative while maintaining its authenticity and personal connection. Here's a more polished version:\n\n\"My journey in building ecosystems for positive innovation began during Occupy Wall Street and the 2008 economic downturn. In response to vacant factories and widespread unemployment, I helped pioneer a different approach: creating communities where people could share resources, tools, and knowledge to build the future they wanted to see. This grassroots movement, focused on mutual support rather than traditional power structures, became the foundation of my career.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring, as young people across the Middle East called for systemic change, I saw an opportunity to introduce bottom-up transformation through innovation and entrepreneurship. This led me to found The Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative, establishing innovation communities from Egypt to Nigeria and Iraq. By 2016, recognizing the need for deeper support, I co-founded Bloom to channel innovation toward social and ecological challenges.\n\nAt Bloom, we've developed unique pedagogies that integrate personal and professional growth, supporting 933 social entrepreneurs across 16 countries.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/4ac3b5d3-78f7-47c6-9df8-e233e0089678' updated_at=2023-06-12T16:11:12.836769+00:00>Supporting Social Enterprises and Civic Engagement in Lebanon\n<chat_conversation>Title: Supporting Social Enterprises and Civic Engagement in Lebanon\n\nHuman: **What should https://bloom.pm do in response to this proposal, what's something that we can do as a startup accelerator in Lebanon:**\n\n**U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE U.S. EMBASSY BEIRUT, LEBANON, PUBLIC DIPLOMACY SECTION Annual Program Statement**\n\n**Funding Opportunity Title:**\n\nProgram Statement\n\n**Funding Opportunity Number: Deadlines for Applications**: **CFDA Number: Total Amount Available: Maximum for Each Award: Minimum for Each Award:**\n\n**A.

It is in this context this research has been conducted with a group of education oriented social entrepreneurs working in Lebanon. During our qualitative and quantitative study our participants experienced a combination of challenges from a currency devaluation, political instability and a large explosion in the center of Beirut. \n\nWe believe that developing educational experiences which promote post traumatic growth in this context is critical to support the development of an anti-fragile society. Thus we offer this paper as a contribution exploring the factors which contribute to our participant’s continued efforts in their entrepreneurial initiatives. Being social entrepreneurs, they are the future of stability in society, creating employment and addressing fundamental needs connected to SDGs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Protective Properties of Group Laughter \nHumor, Character Strengths and Deliberate Rumination For Social Entrepreneurs in Lebanon in Crisis\nFactors Contributing to Post Traumatic Growth for Social Entrepreneurs in Crisis\nBackground: In 2020 the world was challenged by a global pandemic. In Lebanon, the addition of an economic collapse and a major explosion in the capital city brought acute stressors, triggering migration ideation. In this study, we identify factors that support social entrepreneur’s access to post traumatic growth (PTG) by analyzing resilience and character strengths within an entrepreneurship training program in Beirut. \nMethods:  Over the course of Dec 2020 and April 2021 we gathered 21 hours and a half interviews with Lebanese social entrepreneurs going through an entrepreneurship training program, all of whom were living in Lebanon and experienced the August 2020 Beirut port explosion. Alongside these interviews we gathered a set of qualitative data including pre-post assessments of Character Strengths (VIA), Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTG-I), Intrusive and Deliberate Rumination (EERI), Entrepreneurial Intent (EI), Resilience (BRCS) and the Impact of Event - Revised (IES-R). Correlations were identified with factors that support PTG and social entrepreneurial ideation. \nResults: Character Strengths are correlated with PTG and there are validated methods for reliably developing strengths of character. One highly leverable strength is humor, and one way humor can support growth is by preventing helplessness.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/7f7c8bc5-30c7-4d0f-990c-3912b80b55a1' updated_at=2024-06-09T17:40:29.322395+00:00>Post-Traumatic Growth for Social Entrepreneurs After Beirut Explosion\nThis study explores the factors contributing to the continued efforts of social entrepreneurs amidst these crises, highlighting the importance of humor, character strengths, and deliberate rumination.\n\nContext and Motivation\n\nThe 2020 Beirut Port Explosion, coupled with the global pandemic and economic collapse, brought acute stressors to Lebanon. Our research focuses on social entrepreneurs undergoing an entrepreneurship training program in Beirut, aiming to identify factors supporting their access to PTG. Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative assessments, we analyze the resilience and character strengths that facilitate growth.\n\nPrior studies have shown the correlation between character strengths and PTG, but the unique context of Lebanon's multiple crises offers a novel perspective. This study addresses the need to understand how educational programs can nurture character strengths and promote deliberate rumination to support social entrepreneurs in crisis.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the factors promoting post-traumatic growth (PTG) to support educators working in crisis environments. By identifying character strengths and deliberate rumination as critical components, we aim to offer insights that can inform the development of anti-fragile educational programs for social entrepreneurs.\n\n17:44\nBilal Ghalib Research Project.pdf\nPDF\nACSI End of Program Review.pdf\nPDF\nBilal Literature Review.pdf\nPDF\nBilal Ghalib Preliminary TOC and Data.pdf\nPDF\nLet's derive some insights from the documents to improve my paper. What new concepts or new, unique insights that you think I can contribute to the academic literature can you find in these documents?\n17:44\nChatGPT\nAfter analyzing the provided documents, several new concepts and unique insights can be derived that could contribute to the academic literature on resilience, post-traumatic growth, and social entrepreneurship, especially in conflict zones. Here are some potential contributions:\n\n1. The Role of Humor in Post-Traumatic Growth\nInsight: The research identifies humor as a significant character strength that supports post-traumatic growth (PTG). Humor helps in preventing feelings of helplessness and fosters a positive environment that can promote resilience and innovation among social entrepreneurs.\n\nContribution: Investigating the specific mechanisms through which humor contributes to PTG and resilience in conflict zones could add valuable insights. This might include how humor moderates stress responses and encourages adaptive coping strategies among entrepreneurs.\n\n2. Deliberate Rumination and Narrative Reconstruction\nInsight: The documents highlight the importance of deliberate rumination, which involves reflective thinking about one’s life circumstances, as a factor that supports PTG. This contrasts with intrusive rumination, which is often detrimental.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/0707ceea-b47a-413e-9580-2c8ad68b5983' updated_at=2024-05-10T07:15:24.048754+00:00>Fostering Post-Traumatic Growth in Entrepreneurship\nAssistant:  Here are 10 questions to better understand the interviews and identify common themes related to factors connecting to post-traumatic growth:\n\nQuestions I can answer based on the information provided:\n\n1. Several interviewees mentioned the importance of social support, whether from family, friends, or colleagues, in coping with the aftermath of the blast. How prevalent was this theme across all the interviews?\n\n2. Many participants discussed their entrepreneurial drive and desire to make a positive impact in Lebanon despite the challenges. Did this sense of purpose and agency seem to contribute to their resilience and growth?\n\n3. Some interviewees reported experiencing anger, frustration, and a desire for political change following the blast. Was this a common reaction, and did it appear to motivate any specific actions or decisions?\n\n4. A few participants mentioned the role of spirituality or religion in their coping and meaning-making process. Was this a significant theme, and did it seem to relate to their experience of growth?\n\n5. Several interviewees discussed the importance of self-awareness, self-care, and personal development in navigating challenges. Did this focus on personal growth and self-improvement appear to be a common factor in their stories of resilience?\n\nQuestions only you can answer:\n\n6. In your perspective as the interviewer, which personal qualities or characteristics stood out as most strongly associated with participants' ability to cope, adapt, and grow in the face of adversity?\n\n7. Based on your in-depth knowledge of each interviewee's story, did you notice any patterns or differences in the experiences and responses of those who were directly impacted by the blast versus those who were indirectly affected?\n\n8. As you conducted these interviews, were there any specific moments or turning points that seemed to be particularly pivotal in participants' journeys of post-traumatic growth?\n\n9. Reflecting on your interactions with the interviewees, did you perceive any notable differences in the ways that men and women, or people of different ages or backgrounds, described their experiences and coping strategies?\n\n10. Drawing on your expertise in this field and your familiarity with the broader context in Lebanon, how do you see the unique challenges and opportunities faced by entrepreneurs in this setting shaping their potential for resilience and growth?</chat_conversation></chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/7f7c8bc5-30c7-4d0f-990c-3912b80b55a1' updated_at=2024-06-09T17:40:29.322395+00:00>Post-Traumatic Growth for Social Entrepreneurs After Beirut Explosion\n6.

As an Iraqi-American, I understand the cultural nuances essential for authentic dialogue while respecting Syria's rich diversity.\n\n**Proven Methodology:** My Masters research on post-traumatic growth during Lebanon's crises demonstrated how community dialogue significantly improves resilience outcomes. I've applied these findings with 933 enterprises across 16 countries, training 350+ facilitators in trauma-informed approaches.\n\n**Space-Holding Expertise:** I specialize in creating containers where people can be real with each other without pressure to perform. My approach bridges cognitive science, psychology, and spirituality while keeping things light and emergent - serious work doesn't have to be heavy all the time.\n\n**Cultural Bridge-Building:** Fluent in Arabic with deep SWANA regional experience, I integrate Islamic wisdom frameworks naturally while respecting religious diversity. My work with the International Trade Center in Iraq (2024) and Nawaya Network in Lebanese refugee camps demonstrates my ability to adapt methodologies across diverse Middle Eastern contexts.\n\n## What I Bring to Your Circles\n\nRather than rigid curriculum, I design flexible frameworks that facilitators can own and adapt. My eight-session template addresses your core themes - identity/belonging, justice/reconciliation, safety/trust - through arts-based practices, values clarification, and community wisdom-sharing. The goal is emergence, not performance.\n\nI'll provide practical tools: session guides with activities menus, facilitator space-holding training, ongoing coaching support, and WhatsApp groups for peer learning. Everything designed to trust local wisdom while offering evidence-based frameworks for transformation.\n\n## Investment & Timeline\n\nI can deliver comprehensive facilitation guides, training, and coaching support through an 8-day engagement at $350/day (total $2,800) between July-November 2025. This includes initial design, facilitator training, ongoing support, and learning documentation - everything needed for successful implementation across your four regions.\n\nWhat excites me most is the opportunity to contribute to Syria's healing while learning how my methodologies serve this specific community. Working with Badael would deepen my understanding of transformative justice while supporting Syrian youth's authentic needs.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I would be honored to partner with you in creating spaces where Syria's young voices can discover and share their collective wisdom.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/e3e92abb-d564-461b-98e2-a660899257db' updated_at=2025-05-30T14:08:14.754461+00:00>Conversation e3e92abb-d564-461b-98e2-a660899257db\nWhat are the successes? What are the failures? And what's unique about Syria that we need to keep into consideration as we make this proposal? And I can think about this some more, but I think we're probably at a good spot right now, if you want to make all the content that sounds good, and then we'll move from there. so I am Bilal Ghalib. I’m one of the cofounders of Bloom and it’s a partnership training program based in Lebanon. It started when I started coming to the Middle East after the Arab spring to do some training for Youth including my self as the Youth back then but now I’m older and working on social entrepreneurship training that brings personal and professional growth together in difficult context and so I initially was focusing on only entrepreneurship, but you can’t ignore the reality of the area that you’re working in and suddenly I realize we had to talk about the you know the difficulties of working in a context like Iraq and Lebanon and I haven’t had an opportunity Although I have Workshop Camp in the northern part of Syria many years ago back in 2013 we were working on shadow puppets and stories for Youth in a camp there and not necessarily it was the last time I was in Syria although I have been there in 2007 and earlier with my family when Iraq was dangerous and Syria was safe what do you think about this contract in this proposal and what information can I give you to OK, so the second email is pascal.palbe at learningplanetinstitute.org. And the other one is dara, D-A-R-A, at bloom.pm. And I have my session plan from a training that I did called The Facilitator's Toolbox. And the first one was about post-traumatic growth and incorporating it into your toolkit and how to modify our trainings and lessons learned that I had from my time working during an active flare-up of great difficulty in Lebanon after the Beirut Blast in the middle of the pandemic, in the middle of a failed revolution, and what are some of the things that I learned both from the research but also kind of confirming and validating our pedagogical framings. So it's interesting because they want me to train people to hold space for a brief time. But I want to know how long will these people be with each other, you know, because I really think that a real impact can happen if and when we have spaces that people grow with each other. And so even though having a transformative session can be nice, how are they being invited? What is the call to action for joining? Who winds up coming to these things? What are they seeking? What are their goals? These are really, you know, kind of important questions because, you know, they say actions are determined by their intention.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/56ac9cfc-9769-4ded-b3cf-554b0b0b20c9' updated_at=2025-05-30T19:31:38.048511+00:00>Youth Dialogue Design Expert Application\nProven track record building impact organizations operating in conflict zones.

In the Syrian context, \"transformative justice\" is much more aligned with your values than you might expect. It's not about endless accommodation or avoiding accountability. It's about:\n\n- **Serious accountability** (trials, documentation, institutional reform)\n- **Truth-telling** as foundation for healing (not \"everyone's truth is valid\")  \n- **Addressing root causes** (economic inequality, institutional corruption)\n- **Real reconciliation** that requires acknowledging harm before forgiveness\n\nThis is much closer to traditional religious frameworks than to U.S. progressive activism. Think more \"Truth and Reconciliation Commission\" than \"community accountability circles.\"\n\n## 5 Clarifying Questions\n\n**1. Accountability vs. Healing Balance**\nWhere do you sit on the spectrum of \"people need to face consequences for harmful actions\" vs. \"focus primarily on healing and moving forward\"? Badael seems to want both - serious accountability mechanisms AND community healing processes. Does that resonate?\n\n**2. Political vs. Personal Scope**  \nAre you comfortable addressing structural/economic grievances (like \"this community was systematically excluded from resources\") alongside interpersonal trauma? Or do you prefer focusing on individual/relational healing and letting others handle the political dimensions?\n\n**3. Religious Integration Strategy**\nGiven the multi-religious Syrian context, how would you approach spiritual elements? Options: \n- Lead with Islamic frameworks (your strength) and adapt for others\n- Use universal spiritual principles that work across traditions  \n- Keep it secular with optional spiritual components\n- Design different tracks for different communities\n\n**4. Truth-Telling Comfort Level**\nHow do you feel about facilitating spaces where people might need to acknowledge harm they caused or complicity in systems that hurt others? This isn't \"cancel culture\" - it's more like \"before we can move forward together, we need to honestly acknowledge what happened.\"\n\n**5. Your Authentic Positioning**\nWhat feels most honest to say in your application:\n- \"I bring research-backed frameworks but need to understand your specific context first\"\n- \"I have strong methodologies and can adapt them to your participants' needs\"  \n- \"I want to learn what transformative justice means to Badael before proposing specific approaches\"\n\n**Financial note**: $2,800 for 8 days = $350/day, which is reasonable for specialized trauma-informed design work requiring cultural adaptation.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/f339604a-aa49-4ddc-8d92-5050b19c8e87' updated_at=2025-01-10T20:41:46.212592+00:00>Crafting a Powerful Essay: Exploring Business Consciousness\nIt was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that we decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring. \n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”\n\nI stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he gave it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.\n\nBack then, I was too invested in having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to one’s family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow, I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me. \n\nThis is when I finally started a more profound process of submission.</chat>",

And this is why I'm focusing on, like, what the hell You know? What the hell is happening that America could just support this country in this destruction and I'm kind of promoting its core export, which is, like, materialist entrepreneurial self efficacy, independent, attitude. You know, even though I try to build things where there's more of, interdependence and the teams in my programs I always encourage them to support each other and not yeah, it's not that bad, but I I judge myself a lot harshly. Maybe not fairly, but that's the other thing. Like, make sure that I'm I don't, like, hate myself for being a part of something stupid because I know there's a lot of manipulation and that sometimes I'm part of it accidentally. Like, someone you know, you just look back and, like, holy crap. I was a part of, like, an American political strategy You know? Because at some point, I was in the White House talking with the Obama administration back in 2011 about bringing hackerspaces to the Middle East, and they're like, this one's Go do it. And, we'll support you. And and then you start realizing that, you know, maybe maybe there were some, like, shared alignments. And there's always, like, good and bad and and things, but at some point when when what's happening is happening, and you realize like the same country that you're collaborating with is, you know, the same country that decided to go to war with Iraq where I'm from. And it's like, okay. Well, Maybe they're not my friend. Maybe we had some, like, shared interest, but, like, Now I wanna know, like, Well, America's also falling apart. There's this culture war internationally. Fear, othering, and, like, lack of alignments on what is climate change, you know, corporate greed destroying the planet. And it's like, Guys, like, there's some reason for this. You know? And everyone feels it, but we're not allowed to talk about it because the separation of church and state or something. And so I want a science of values. I want a science of the right thing to do because not because it's easy, but because it's right. We don't have that anymore. We have, like, do no harm I don't know what the actual philosophy is called in American, like, popular culture, but it's like, Just make sure no one gets hurt and do whatever you want. You know? And that's leading to a lot of things because we can't say that something's right and wrong. You know? And that's a child that wants to change their gender. It's like, okay. Why not? Like, they have a will and they are relatively conscious Let them do whatever they want. Like, who cares? Like, you know, it's the the world is infinitely flexible. We have the technology now. We can do hormone replacement and surgery and then if they don't like it, undo and whatever.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/9fda0a74-dd6a-4626-b0e9-4e5f0cabd12b' updated_at=2025-08-25T21:19:33.428229+00:00>Workplace Culture Consultant Role in Lisbon\nTHE NAWAYA NETWORK - Design and Innovation Specialist | Beirut, Lebanon | 2016-2017\nTrauma-Informed Program Design: Designed and implemented UNICEF-funded program empowering over 150 marginalized youth in Lebanese refugee camps using design thinking methodologies\nCommunity Resilience Building: Launched refugee support initiatives that became foundation for the organization's ongoing programs, improving educational access and psychological support\n\nAUTODESK - Maker and Strategy Specialist | California, US | 2012-2015\nCross-Cultural Program Leadership: Led 30-day sustainability residency connecting citizens and MIT students, fostering collaborative problem-solving\nInternational Community Building: Conducted fieldwork across Africa, SWANA, and China, providing strategic insights on maker movement and community innovation \nDocumentation & Knowledge Transfer: Implemented documentation strategy for grassroots innovation at POC 21 in Paris\nGEMSI - Founder and Lead Investigator | Baghdad, Iraq | 2011–2021\nMovement Building: Built a network promoting community innovation spaces across Middle East, focusing on Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad during the Arab Spring\nCultural Documentation: Produced a documentary on Beirut's hackerspace development to popularize collaborative innovation concepts regionally \nNetwork Development: Established lasting networks of innovators across SWANA with ongoing impact on the entrepreneurial ecosystem\n\nEDUCATION\nUNIVERSITY OF PARIS | Paris, France - Master of Sciences, Technology, and Health | 2021\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN | Dearborn, MI - B.S.
