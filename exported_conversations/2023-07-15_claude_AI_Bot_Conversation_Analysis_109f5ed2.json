We believe digital literacy is, too. Thaki empowers refugee and vulnerable children to learn and thrive through self-paced, motivational electronic educational tools. These tools are their key to accessing 21st century skills. Thaki, pronounced “the key,” means “smart” in Arabic. Thaki. Unlock their potential! Join us in reaching more deserving children. Support our campaign TAKE ACTION Our Vision Our vision is to eliminate inequity brought about by poverty, war and disasters and to foster a world in which we sustainably share our resources and help one another with compassion and benevolence. Our Mission Our mission is to empower refugee and vulnerable children to learn and thrive through self-paced, motivational electronic tools. Our Beliefs We believe that every child deserves an education. We believe that learning can be fun and engaging. We believe in applying technology to advance our learning. We believe that every child is entitled to a happy, safe childhood. We believe in sharing our resources. We believe in eliminating waste. We believe in helping one another to live peacefully and to be and achieve our best. How Thaki Works 1. We collect Organizations can donate their gently used electronics to us. We collect them and give them new life. 2. We load We’ve developed a platform that integrates a variety of informative, interactive, and educational content. 3. We distribute We then distribute the devices to education centers that work with refugee and vulnerable children. 4. We support We provide resources and tools to support teachers and children in e-learning and digital literacy. Thaki is a social impact non-profit, non-sectarian, non-political association founded in 2015. We operate on a donation model for second-hand devices (mostly laptops but tablets and projectors as well), with the requirement that these devices must have their chargers, be fully functional, young and robust enough to have at least a three-year remaining life span. We target corporate and institutional donors who typically have a two or three-year retirement policy on their laptops. Due to internet connectivity issues in many places where our recipient partners are located, we put both open-source and proprietary e-learning educational content on these laptops, a collection which is getting richer over time as additional content partnerships are forged. Our recipient education partners are in great need of laptops to further their work. They operate under severe resource constraints in difficult circumstances and value the contribution of Thaki’s e-learning material to their mission. Thaki Nederland is registered as a foundation in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce: #65713834, RSIN # 8562 29 490, with ANBI status. Thaki is also a registered NGO in Lebanon. Financial administration operates out of Thaki Netherlands. “The only thing you can take with you is your education.” HEAR OUR STORY We operate a carbon neutral organization. In 2020, Thaki started tracking carbon emissions arising from core operational activities: work-from-home, business travel and logistics. We then offset our footprint by purchasing verifiable carbon credits. SUPPORTING THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Thaki has joined the cause to ensure we meet part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, a set of global priorities to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

Thaki tackles essential learning gaps for refugee and vulnerable learners whose education has been compromised, through a unique technology-based model. For schools: Thaki creates computer labs equipped with gently used laptops preloaded with around $4,000 of donated education software. The software is available offline, through a bespoke content app in Arabic and English. For teachers: Building the digital competence and skills of inadequately trained educators aimed at equipping students for a rapidly changing world. Thaki offers a Teacher Digital Toolkit, with 80+ training courses, videos and lesson plans, to build teachers’ digital literacy and enable them to use laptops and international learning content confidently and effectively in lessons. This toolkit is focused on teaching about the UN SDGs, digital literacy, STEM, life-skills, values, coding, language, and many other competencies. For learners: Thaki unlocks imagination and creativity, by providing some of the world’s best proprietary e-learning platforms for free. Students can explore National Geographic, Animated value-focused videos with Big Bad Boo, learn coding with Scratch, and so much more. For communities: Thaki is piloting an end-to-end solar installation solution for schools to generate all the clean electricity they need, including ways to offer device charging to the community. Children and families will never need to interrupt their learning because of the electricity being down. For peace and stability: Thaki is developing a digital learning program to help children, teachers and caregivers handle trauma and build a healthier world.\" What problem or challenge is the nominee working to address? \"There are 5.5 million refugees and over 7.2 million internally displaced children, in the Middle East and North Africa region (UNICEF, 2022).

It means the learner is equipped with the tools that increase confidence to pursue dreams. It means the learner has the opportunity to become a digital native; one accustomed to navigating the digital environments that permeate higher education, employment, and daily life settings. It means the learner has skills and knowledge they can pass on to their siblings, parents, neighbors and friends. It means the learner can have a more personalized learning experience in what may otherwise be an overcrowded classroom with little time for 1 on 1 attention. It means the learner can learn in the language they speak at home and see educational characters who look and sound like them. It means the learner gains ownership in their own developmental journey through a large choice of self-paced responsive content. It means the learner is exposed to other cultures’ lifestyles, languages, and values.

What Thaki does - in brief Thaki fills an essential learning gap for those with limited or no access to education. It is an educational bridge between the latest in ed-tech solutions and vulnerable communities enabling children and teachers to interact with the virtual world that would otherwise not be available to them. What Thaki does - detail \"Thaki connects the unconnected. It was born out of a need to respond to the refugee crisis in the Middle East where Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees per capita. Thaki is an educational bridge between ed-tech solutions and vulnerable communities, enabling children and teachers to interact with the virtual world that would otherwise not be available to them. Its circular economy model is based on collaboration and low-effort contributions from the private sector, leading to huge social impact. Thaki’s educational features include a bilingual, content-rich app that enables offline learning and a Digital Toolkit for teachers – a bilingual platform with a variety of resources and learning modules that support teachers more confidently and effectively teach with digital tools and Thaki’s educational content. We collect gently used electronic devices and load them with a bespoke software platform that integrates a variety of highly informative and interactive educational content. Our content is curated and contextualized to address holistic topics including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, digital literacy and other future focused skills that is lacking in the educational offerings to the marginalized children whom we serve. We then distribute the devices to education centers that work with refugee and vulnerable children in Lebanon and Jordan and provide tools and resources to support teachers and learners with their learning journeys to gain digital literacy. \" Train Teachers through the Teacher Digital Toolkit (TDT). Thanks to a grant by the Catalyst Foundation for Universal Education we produced a robust bilingual (Arabic-English) platform of training materials and resources to guide teachers on digital skills and pedagogy. The TDT grew out of a need to support teachers with easy-to-use, self-guided learning tools through courses, lesson plans, and teaching tips to help them gain skills and experience in digital teaching methods while accessing the wealth of learning resources that are preloaded on Thaki computers. This training content includes 42 Courses, 67 instructional videos, 28 Lesson Plans, and 22 teaching resources. The training material is focused on digital classroom basics, coding, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and more. \"What evidence have you gathered to demonstrate that this solution is needed? Please provide a brief summary \" \"We track and iterate our findings following a user-centered approach collecting data directly from the teachers, students and partner organizations using feedback surveys, field observations and interviews. Our surveys are administered through the impact assessment platform, Whyise. Furthermore, we conducted an external evaluation of the impact of Thaki on children and their teachers from 6 learning centers of extremely vulnerable populations in Jordan (5 centers) and the UAE (1 center), conducted by the Centre for Lebanese Studies (CLS). CLS designed the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEAL) system, tracking the progress of the program as a whole against the outcomes and objectives, and answered the overall question of the program: What effect does the proposed project have on students’ and teachers’ quality of learning and teaching respectively. The results showed very positive impacts of Thaki’s intervention on both children and teachers (full study available). For this project, we will monitor and evaluate project impact through the Whyise tools to which we subscribe, including pre and post-test surveys and field observations. \" Key Operational risks \"We currently have 3 main operational risks: 1- Acquisition of hardware: Donated laptops are not always readily available in the numbers we need. To mitigate that, we purchase refurbished laptops through trusted and mission-aligned providers with whom we have negotiated special rates. 2- Cost of services: Given the financial crisis in Lebanon, some recipient partners struggle to pay for the cost of our services (recently adjusted to be more aligned with our actual costs). We conducted market research on the price of refurbished laptops in Lebanon available commercially and devised a pricing structure that is very competitive, with the added benefit of providing Thaki’s services of the wealth of preloaded offline content, client onboarding and our Teacher Digital Toolkit – all for a fraction of what recipients would pay for commercially available used laptops. We shared this new pricing strategy with our partners and most have embraced it and continue requesting laptops from us. That said, we still seek funding and joint partnerships in order to subsidize our costs for greater affordability to our recipients. 3- Electricity: Digital literacy requires power to run the laptops. The power situation in Lebanon has become extreme with little to no power supply coming from the grid, and strain on – as well as lack of affordability – to operate the prevalent (and polluting) generators. We successfully leveraged funding and partners to power one of our large partner schools with solar energy (impacting 1,100 children) and have funding partners secured for other school solar implementations. We are deepening dialogue with local and international partners to brainstorm collaborative solutions for this country-wide issue. In parallel, we are making plans to expand our services in other countries, with a current focus on Jordan (deepening our presence there), Palestine and Morocco which will further diversify our market. \" What are your main sources of funding? Thaki App of offline content: \"As noted during our call, we are happy to give you remote access to a Thaki laptop so that you can navigate the platform yourself. This table lists the content that is preloaded on the laptops, with a video tour of the interface (please note that both need to be updated since we have recently made changes, but they give you a general idea). In addition to the educational content, we also preload the laptops with a wealth of open source software programs, including word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, graphic and coding programs because we believe learning these skills is a very important part of digital literacy. If you have digital content that you would like to see added or removed from the app we can discuss customizing and adapting it. \" Who does Thaki seek to help? \"Thaki, in partnership with TNO, is developing a science based, digital, self-guided package for young children, their teachers and parents in Lebanon and other MENA countries that aims to decrease the impact of trauma and increase resilience in children through strategies on how to deal with overwhelming emotions. This project is funded by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency/RVO as a Small Business Innovation Research Programme (SBIR) assignment from the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Nour, a child resiliency program Thaki, in partnership with the Dutch research organization TNO, is developing a science based, digital, self-guided package, Nour, for young children, their teachers and parents that aims to decrease the impact of trauma in children through strategies on how to deal with overwhelming emotions. Nour is a child resiliency program that will be implemented in Lebanon and MENA, incorporating an innovative approach to social emotional learning with practical, digital delivery mechanisms and positive outcomes across the community. With this program young children (targeted at 5 to 8 years) learn how to recognize and communicate their feelings and use strategies to self-regulate their emotions and learn to deal with stress. Teachers, parents, and caregivers learn how to guide the children’s experience as well as enhance their own self-awareness and wellbeing.

The content you've provided appears to be a list of questions or prompts from a form or application, likely related to the EQUALS in Tech Awards, a prestigious international award acknowledging innovative initiatives and projects that promote gender equality in the tech sector.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences, individual initiatives, or projects to fill in these fields, because I don't have a personal identity or a personal narrative.\n\nNonetheless, I can help you understand how each question could be adapted to specifically address EQUALS Global Partnership's interests:\n\n*   Questions 1-4: These questions pertain to the applicant's personal details and should be answered accurately. EQUALS Global Partnership would be interested in these details to understand who is behind the initiative and their professional background.\n    \n*   Question 5: Here, the focus should be on providing the address details of where the organization/project is primarily based. This is of interest to EQUALS as it helps understand the geographical context and potential reach of the project.\n    \n*   Question 6-8: These are specifics about the project/initiative, which are crucial for EQUALS to understand what the project is about, when it was established, and where it operates.\n    \n*   Question 9: Providing representative information helps EQUALS identify who they can directly communicate with regarding the initiative.\n    \n*   Question 10: The applicant should provide relevant online presence details. EQUALS is interested in these as they provide more information about the project and its reach.\n    \n*   Questions 11-12: By identifying the type of stakeholder and the category of nomination, EQUALS can understand the context of the initiative and how it aligns with their mission.\n    \n*   Question 13: Knowing if the project was previously nominated helps EQUALS track repeat applicants and the progression of initiatives over time.\n    \n*   Questions 14-17: These are the key questions where the applicant should focus on how their work aligns with the mission of EQUALS. The applicant should detail how their initiative promotes gender equality in the tech sector, the impacts it has had, how it's been scaled, and its innovative aspects.\n    \n*   Questions 18-19: By providing information on partners and relevant links, EQUALS can assess the initiative's collaboration with other entities and\n    \n\nhere's context about equals: Skip to Main Content ABOUT PARTNERS PROJECTS AWARDS LEARN BLOG PAST WINNERS FAQ SOCIAL MEDIA PACK EQUALS in Tech Awards ​ The nominations for the EQUALS in Tech Awards 2023 are now open. ​ The Director of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT), Dr Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, opens the nominations for the EQUALS in Tech Awards 2023. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ The EQUALS Global Partnership is now seeking nominations for the 2023 EQUALS in Tech Awards.

We believe digital literacy is, too. Thaki empowers refugee and vulnerable children to learn and thrive through self-paced, motivational electronic educational tools. These tools are their key to accessing 21st century skills. Thaki, pronounced “the key,” means “smart” in Arabic. Thaki. Unlock their potential! Join us in reaching more deserving children. Support our campaign TAKE ACTION Our Vision Our vision is to eliminate inequity brought about by poverty, war and disasters and to foster a world in which we sustainably share our resources and help one another with compassion and benevolence. Our Mission Our mission is to empower refugee and vulnerable children to learn and thrive through self-paced, motivational electronic tools. Our Beliefs We believe that every child deserves an education. We believe that learning can be fun and engaging. We believe in applying technology to advance our learning. We believe that every child is entitled to a happy, safe childhood. We believe in sharing our resources. We believe in eliminating waste. We believe in helping one another to live peacefully and to be and achieve our best. How Thaki Works 1. We collect Organizations can donate their gently used electronics to us. We collect them and give them new life. 2. We load We’ve developed a platform that integrates a variety of informative, interactive, and educational content. 3. We distribute We then distribute the devices to education centers that work with refugee and vulnerable children. 4. We support We provide resources and tools to support teachers and children in e-learning and digital literacy. Thaki is a social impact non-profit, non-sectarian, non-political association founded in 2015. We operate on a donation model for second-hand devices (mostly laptops but tablets and projectors as well), with the requirement that these devices must have their chargers, be fully functional, young and robust enough to have at least a three-year remaining life span. We target corporate and institutional donors who typically have a two or three-year retirement policy on their laptops. Due to internet connectivity issues in many places where our recipient partners are located, we put both open-source and proprietary e-learning educational content on these laptops, a collection which is getting richer over time as additional content partnerships are forged. Our recipient education partners are in great need of laptops to further their work. They operate under severe resource constraints in difficult circumstances and value the contribution of Thaki’s e-learning material to their mission. Thaki Nederland is registered as a foundation in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce: #65713834, RSIN # 8562 29 490, with ANBI status. Thaki is also a registered NGO in Lebanon. Financial administration operates out of Thaki Netherlands. “The only thing you can take with you is your education.” HEAR OUR STORY We operate a carbon neutral organization. In 2020, Thaki started tracking carbon emissions arising from core operational activities: work-from-home, business travel and logistics. We then offset our footprint by purchasing verifiable carbon credits. SUPPORTING THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Thaki has joined the cause to ensure we meet part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, a set of global priorities to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

It means the learner is equipped with the tools that increase confidence to pursue dreams. It means the learner has the opportunity to become a digital native; one accustomed to navigating the digital environments that permeate higher education, employment, and daily life settings. It means the learner has skills and knowledge they can pass on to their siblings, parents, neighbors and friends. It means the learner can have a more personalized learning experience in what may otherwise be an overcrowded classroom with little time for 1 on 1 attention. It means the learner can learn in the language they speak at home and see educational characters who look and sound like them. It means the learner gains ownership in their own developmental journey through a large choice of self-paced responsive content. It means the learner is exposed to other cultures’ lifestyles, languages, and values. It means the learner is exposed to non-academic content on topics such as gender, well-being and mindfulness, diversity and inclusion, the Sustainable Development Goals, etc. It means the learner experiences the kindness of a stranger; someone they’ll never know gifted something of value to them. It means the learner has a chance to feel the responsibility and duty of care that comes with lookinglook after something of value. It means the learner witnesses a real life example of circularity and conscious consumption in a region grappling with engaging best practices aroundwith sustainability and e-waste. \" Link to a pitch video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq7btaiVC9s Link to a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnlGKfaGNsU Focus of your company Education Technology for refugee and vulnerable communities in the Middle East Link to a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igdvAAZyGoM Link to a video https://youtu.be/5pGWV4KBDUs Product demo https://youtu.be/tPTPpjOWhsw What recent achievements? / Timeline? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JApiJ2ueFy3Gtw9ZMnUNt2qJEuxhNLcPq3\\_s\\_S\\_J\\_Ag/edit?pli=1# What evidence do you have that your solution works/of your impact? What Thaki does - in brief Thaki fills an essential learning gap for those with limited or no access to education. It is an educational bridge between the latest in ed-tech solutions and vulnerable communities enabling children and teachers to interact with the virtual world that would otherwise not be available to them. What Thaki does - detail \"Thaki connects the unconnected. It was born out of a need to respond to the refugee crisis in the Middle East where Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees per capita. Thaki is an educational bridge between ed-tech solutions and vulnerable communities, enabling children and teachers to interact with the virtual world that would otherwise not be available to them. Its circular economy model is based on collaboration and low-effort contributions from the private sector, leading to huge social impact. Thaki’s educational features include a bilingual, content-rich app that enables offline learning and a Digital Toolkit for teachers – a bilingual platform with a variety of resources and learning modules that support teachers more confidently and effectively teach with digital tools and Thaki’s educational content. We collect gently used electronic devices and load them with a bespoke software platform that integrates a variety of highly informative and interactive educational content. Our content is curated and contextualized to address holistic topics including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, digital literacy and other future focused skills that is lacking in the educational offerings to the marginalized children whom we serve. We then distribute the devices to education centers that work with refugee and vulnerable children in Lebanon and Jordan and provide tools and resources to support teachers and learners with their learning journeys to gain digital literacy. \" Train Teachers through the Teacher Digital Toolkit (TDT). Thanks to a grant by the Catalyst Foundation for Universal Education we produced a robust bilingual (Arabic-English) platform of training materials and resources to guide teachers on digital skills and pedagogy. The TDT grew out of a need to support teachers with easy-to-use, self-guided learning tools through courses, lesson plans, and teaching tips to help them gain skills and experience in digital teaching methods while accessing the wealth of learning resources that are preloaded on Thaki computers. This training content includes 42 Courses, 67 instructional videos, 28 Lesson Plans, and 22 teaching resources. The training material is focused on digital classroom basics, coding, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and more. \"What evidence have you gathered to demonstrate that this solution is needed? Please provide a brief summary \" \"We track and iterate our findings following a user-centered approach collecting data directly from the teachers, students and partner organizations using feedback surveys, field observations and interviews. Our surveys are administered through the impact assessment platform, Whyise. Furthermore, we conducted an external evaluation of the impact of Thaki on children and their teachers from 6 learning centers of extremely vulnerable populations in Jordan (5 centers) and the UAE (1 center), conducted by the Centre for Lebanese Studies (CLS). CLS designed the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEAL) system, tracking the progress of the program as a whole against the outcomes and objectives, and answered the overall question of the program: What effect does the proposed project have on students’ and teachers’ quality of learning and teaching respectively. The results showed very positive impacts of Thaki’s intervention on both children and teachers (full study available). For this project, we will monitor and evaluate project impact through the Whyise tools to which we subscribe, including pre and post-test surveys and field observations. \" Key Operational risks \"We currently have 3 main operational risks: 1- Acquisition of hardware: Donated laptops are not always readily available in the numbers we need. To mitigate that, we purchase refurbished laptops through trusted and mission-aligned providers with whom we have negotiated special rates. 2- Cost of services: Given the financial crisis in Lebanon, some recipient partners struggle to pay for the cost of our services (recently adjusted to be more aligned with our actual costs). We conducted market research on the price of refurbished laptops in Lebanon available commercially and devised a pricing structure that is very competitive, with the added benefit of providing Thaki’s services of the wealth of preloaded offline content, client onboarding and our Teacher Digital Toolkit – all for a fraction of what recipients would pay for commercially available used laptops. We shared this new pricing strategy with our partners and most have embraced it and continue requesting laptops from us. That said, we still seek funding and joint partnerships in order to subsidize our costs for greater affordability to our recipients. 3- Electricity: Digital literacy requires power to run the laptops. The power situation in Lebanon has become extreme with little to no power supply coming from the grid, and strain on – as well as lack of affordability – to operate the prevalent (and polluting) generators. We successfully leveraged funding and partners to power one of our large partner schools with solar energy (impacting 1,100 children) and have funding partners secured for other school solar implementations. We are deepening dialogue with local and international partners to brainstorm collaborative solutions for this country-wide issue. In parallel, we are making plans to expand our services in other countries, with a current focus on Jordan (deepening our presence there), Palestine and Morocco which will further diversify our market. \" What are your main sources of funding? Thaki App of offline content: \"As noted during our call, we are happy to give you remote access to a Thaki laptop so that you can navigate the platform yourself. This table lists the content that is preloaded on the laptops, with a video tour of the interface (please note that both need to be updated since we have recently made changes, but they give you a general idea). In addition to the educational content, we also preload the laptops with a wealth of open source software programs, including word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, graphic and coding programs because we believe learning these skills is a very important part of digital literacy. If you have digital content that you would like to see added or removed from the app we can discuss customizing and adapting it. \" Who does Thaki seek to help? \"Thaki, in partnership with TNO, is developing a science based, digital, self-guided package for young children, their teachers and parents in Lebanon and other MENA countries that aims to decrease the impact of trauma and increase resilience in children through strategies on how to deal with overwhelming emotions. This project is funded by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency/RVO as a Small Business Innovation Research Programme (SBIR) assignment from the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Nour, a child resiliency program Thaki, in partnership with the Dutch research organization TNO, is developing a science based, digital, self-guided package, Nour, for young children, their teachers and parents that aims to decrease the impact of trauma in children through strategies on how to deal with overwhelming emotions. Nour is a child resiliency program that will be implemented in Lebanon and MENA, incorporating an innovative approach to social emotional learning with practical, digital delivery mechanisms and positive outcomes across the community. With this program young children (targeted at 5 to 8 years) learn how to recognize and communicate their feelings and use strategies to self-regulate their emotions and learn to deal with stress. Teachers, parents, and caregivers learn how to guide the children’s experience as well as enhance their own self-awareness and wellbeing.

Many of these children are missing out on a quality education, meaning that their potential is at risk of being wasted. Thaki bridges the gap between the latest ed-tech solutions, and vulnerable communities by addressing an essential learning gap for those with limited or no access to education. Our vision is that all children should have the opportunity to explore and reach their full potential, no matter their life circumstances. The key to this is access to digital literacy education. \" How is Thaki making a positive impact towards the problem or challenge they are attempting to address? \"Thaki has reached over 22,500 children to date, and seeks to reach an additional 105,000 learners by 2025.

It means the learner is equipped with the tools that increase confidence to pursue dreams. It means the learner has the opportunity to become a digital native; one accustomed to navigating the digital environments that permeate higher education, employment, and daily life settings. It means the learner has skills and knowledge they can pass on to their siblings, parents, neighbors and friends. It means the learner can have a more personalized learning experience in what may otherwise be an overcrowded classroom with little time for 1 on 1 attention. It means the learner can learn in the language they speak at home and see educational characters who look and sound like them. It means the learner gains ownership in their own developmental journey through a large choice of self-paced responsive content. It means the learner is exposed to other cultures’ lifestyles, languages, and values. It means the learner is exposed to non-academic content on topics such as gender, well-being and mindfulness, diversity and inclusion, the Sustainable Development Goals, etc. It means the learner experiences the kindness of a stranger; someone they’ll never know gifted something of value to them. It means the learner has a chance to feel the responsibility and duty of care that comes with lookinglook after something of value. It means the learner witnesses a real life example of circularity and conscious consumption in a region grappling with engaging best practices aroundwith sustainability and e-waste. \" Link to a pitch video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq7btaiVC9s Link to a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnlGKfaGNsU Focus of your company Education Technology for refugee and vulnerable communities in the Middle East Link to a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igdvAAZyGoM Link to a video https://youtu.be/5pGWV4KBDUs Product demo https://youtu.be/tPTPpjOWhsw What recent achievements? / Timeline? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JApiJ2ueFy3Gtw9ZMnUNt2qJEuxhNLcPq3\\_s\\_S\\_J\\_Ag/edit?pli=1# What evidence do you have that your solution works/of your impact? What Thaki does - in brief Thaki fills an essential learning gap for those with limited or no access to education. It is an educational bridge between the latest in ed-tech solutions and vulnerable communities enabling children and teachers to interact with the virtual world that would otherwise not be available to them. What Thaki does - detail \"Thaki connects the unconnected. It was born out of a need to respond to the refugee crisis in the Middle East where Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees per capita. Thaki is an educational bridge between ed-tech solutions and vulnerable communities, enabling children and teachers to interact with the virtual world that would otherwise not be available to them. Its circular economy model is based on collaboration and low-effort contributions from the private sector, leading to huge social impact. Thaki’s educational features include a bilingual, content-rich app that enables offline learning and a Digital Toolkit for teachers – a bilingual platform with a variety of resources and learning modules that support teachers more confidently and effectively teach with digital tools and Thaki’s educational content. We collect gently used electronic devices and load them with a bespoke software platform that integrates a variety of highly informative and interactive educational content. Our content is curated and contextualized to address holistic topics including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, digital literacy and other future focused skills that is lacking in the educational offerings to the marginalized children whom we serve. We then distribute the devices to education centers that work with refugee and vulnerable children in Lebanon and Jordan and provide tools and resources to support teachers and learners with their learning journeys to gain digital literacy. \" Train Teachers through the Teacher Digital Toolkit (TDT). Thanks to a grant by the Catalyst Foundation for Universal Education we produced a robust bilingual (Arabic-English) platform of training materials and resources to guide teachers on digital skills and pedagogy. The TDT grew out of a need to support teachers with easy-to-use, self-guided learning tools through courses, lesson plans, and teaching tips to help them gain skills and experience in digital teaching methods while accessing the wealth of learning resources that are preloaded on Thaki computers. This training content includes 42 Courses, 67 instructional videos, 28 Lesson Plans, and 22 teaching resources. The training material is focused on digital classroom basics, coding, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and more. \"What evidence have you gathered to demonstrate that this solution is needed? Please provide a brief summary \" \"We track and iterate our findings following a user-centered approach collecting data directly from the teachers, students and partner organizations using feedback surveys, field observations and interviews. Our surveys are administered through the impact assessment platform, Whyise. Furthermore, we conducted an external evaluation of the impact of Thaki on children and their teachers from 6 learning centers of extremely vulnerable populations in Jordan (5 centers) and the UAE (1 center), conducted by the Centre for Lebanese Studies (CLS). CLS designed the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEAL) system, tracking the progress of the program as a whole against the outcomes and objectives, and answered the overall question of the program: What effect does the proposed project have on students’ and teachers’ quality of learning and teaching respectively. The results showed very positive impacts of Thaki’s intervention on both children and teachers (full study available). For this project, we will monitor and evaluate project impact through the Whyise tools to which we subscribe, including pre and post-test surveys and field observations. \" Key Operational risks \"We currently have 3 main operational risks: 1- Acquisition of hardware: Donated laptops are not always readily available in the numbers we need. To mitigate that, we purchase refurbished laptops through trusted and mission-aligned providers with whom we have negotiated special rates. 2- Cost of services: Given the financial crisis in Lebanon, some recipient partners struggle to pay for the cost of our services (recently adjusted to be more aligned with our actual costs). We conducted market research on the price of refurbished laptops in Lebanon available commercially and devised a pricing structure that is very competitive, with the added benefit of providing Thaki’s services of the wealth of preloaded offline content, client onboarding and our Teacher Digital Toolkit – all for a fraction of what recipients would pay for commercially available used laptops. We shared this new pricing strategy with our partners and most have embraced it and continue requesting laptops from us. That said, we still seek funding and joint partnerships in order to subsidize our costs for greater affordability to our recipients. 3- Electricity: Digital literacy requires power to run the laptops. The power situation in Lebanon has become extreme with little to no power supply coming from the grid, and strain on – as well as lack of affordability – to operate the prevalent (and polluting) generators. We successfully leveraged funding and partners to power one of our large partner schools with solar energy (impacting 1,100 children) and have funding partners secured for other school solar implementations. We are deepening dialogue with local and international partners to brainstorm collaborative solutions for this country-wide issue. In parallel, we are making plans to expand our services in other countries, with a current focus on Jordan (deepening our presence there), Palestine and Morocco which will further diversify our market. \" What are your main sources of funding? Thaki App of offline content: \"As noted during our call, we are happy to give you remote access to a Thaki laptop so that you can navigate the platform yourself. This table lists the content that is preloaded on the laptops, with a video tour of the interface (please note that both need to be updated since we have recently made changes, but they give you a general idea). In addition to the educational content, we also preload the laptops with a wealth of open source software programs, including word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, graphic and coding programs because we believe learning these skills is a very important part of digital literacy. If you have digital content that you would like to see added or removed from the app we can discuss customizing and adapting it. \" Who does Thaki seek to help? \"Thaki, in partnership with TNO, is developing a science based, digital, self-guided package for young children, their teachers and parents in Lebanon and other MENA countries that aims to decrease the impact of trauma and increase resilience in children through strategies on how to deal with overwhelming emotions. This project is funded by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency/RVO as a Small Business Innovation Research Programme (SBIR) assignment from the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Nour, a child resiliency program Thaki, in partnership with the Dutch research organization TNO, is developing a science based, digital, self-guided package, Nour, for young children, their teachers and parents that aims to decrease the impact of trauma in children through strategies on how to deal with overwhelming emotions. Nour is a child resiliency program that will be implemented in Lebanon and MENA, incorporating an innovative approach to social emotional learning with practical, digital delivery mechanisms and positive outcomes across the community. With this program young children (targeted at 5 to 8 years) learn how to recognize and communicate their feelings and use strategies to self-regulate their emotions and learn to deal with stress. Teachers, parents, and caregivers learn how to guide the children’s experience as well as enhance their own self-awareness and wellbeing.

She is working to address an essential learning gap for those with limited or no access to education. Rudayna’s vision is that all children should have the opportunity to explore and reach their full potential, no matter their life circumstances. The key to this is access to digital literacy education. How is the nominee making a positive impact towards the problem or challenge they are attempting to address?Rudayna’s work through Thaki has reached over 22,500 children to date, and seeks to reach an additional 105,000 learners by 2025. Thaki tackles essential learning gaps for refugee and vulnerable learners whose education has been compromised, through a unique technology-based model. For schools: Thaki creates computer labs equipped with donated laptops from corporates, loaded with around $4,000 of donated education software. The software is available offline, through a bespoke content app in Arabic and English. For teachers: Building the digital competence and skills of poorly trained educators aimed at equipping students for a rapidly changing world. Thaki offers a Teacher Digital Toolkit, with 40+ training courses, videos and lesson plans, to build teachers’ digital literacy and enable them to use laptops and international learning content confidently and effectively in lessons. This toolkit is focused on teaching about the UN SDGs, digital literacy, STEM, life-skills, values, coding, language, and many other competencies. For learners: Thaki unlocks imagination and creativity, by providing some of the world’s best proprietary e-learning platforms for free. Students can explore National Geographic, Animated value-focused videos with Big Bad Boo, learn coding with Scratch, and so much more. For communities: Thaki is piloting an end-to-end solar installation solution for schools to generate all the clean electricity they need, including ways to offer device charging to the community. Children and families will never need to interrupt their learning because of the electricity being down. For peace and stability: Thaki is developing a digital learning programme to help children, teachers and caregivers handle trauma and build a healthier world.What Thaki doesSo what does a Thaki laptop mean to the learners who use it?It means the learner has a virtual window into the world outside their immediate environment and can discover information and goals that otherwise may not seem attainable. It means the learner is equipped with the tools that increase confidence to pursue dreams. It means the learner has the opportunity to become a digital native; one accustomed to navigating the digital environments that permeate higher education, employment, and daily life settings. It means the learner has skills and knowledge they can pass on to their siblings, parents, neighbors and friends. It means the learner can have a more personalized learning experience in what may otherwise be an overcrowded classroom with little time for 1 on 1 attention. It means the learner can learn in the language they speak at home and see educational characters who look and sound like them. It means the learner gains ownership in their own developmental journey through a large choice of self-paced responsive content. It means the learner is exposed to other cultures’ lifestyles, languages, and values. It means the learner is exposed to non-academic content on topics such as gender, well-being and mindfulness, diversity and inclusion, the Sustainable Development Goals, etc. It means the learner experiences the kindness of a stranger; someone they’ll never know gifted something of value to them. It means the learner has a chance to feel the responsibility and duty of care that comes with lookinglook after something of value. It means the learner witnesses a real life example of circularity and conscious consumption in a region grappling with engaging best practices aroundwith sustainability and e-waste.Link to a pitch videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq7btaiVC9sLink to a videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnlGKfaGNsUFocus of your companyEducation Technology for refugee and vulnerable communities in the Middle EastLink to a videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igdvAAZyGoMLink to a videohttps://youtu.be/5pGWV4KBDUsProduct demohttps://youtu.be/tPTPpjOWhswWhat recent achievements? / Timeline?https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JApiJ2ueFy3Gtw9ZMnUNt2qJEuxhNLcPq3\\_s\\_S\\_J\\_Ag/edit?pli=1#What evidence do you have that your solution works/of your impact?What Thaki does - in briefThaki fills an essential learning gap for those with limited or no access to education. It is an educational bridge between the latest in ed-tech solutions and vulnerable communities enabling children and teachers to interact with the virtual world that would otherwise not be available to them.What Thaki does - detailThaki connects the unconnected. It was born out of a need to respond to the refugee crisis in the Middle East where Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees per capita. Thaki is an educational bridge between ed-tech solutions and vulnerable communities, enabling children and teachers to interact with the virtual world that would otherwise not be available to them. Its circular economy model is based on collaboration and low-effort contributions from the private sector, leading to huge social impact. Thaki’s educational features include a bilingual, content-rich app that enables offline learning and a Digital Toolkit for teachers – a bilingual platform with a variety of resources and learning modules that support teachers more confidently and effectively teach with digital tools and Thaki’s educational content. We collect gently used electronic devices and load them with a bespoke software platform that integrates a variety of highly informative and interactive educational content. Our content is curated and contextualized to address holistic topics including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, digital literacy and other future focused skills that is lacking in the educational offerings to the marginalized children whom we serve. We then distribute the devices to education centers that work with refugee and vulnerable children in Lebanon and Jordan and provide tools and resources to support teachers and learners with their learning journeys to gain digital literacy.Train Teachers through the Teacher Digital Toolkit (TDT). Thanks to a grant by the Catalyst Foundation for Universal Education we produced a robust bilingual (Arabic-English) platform of training materials and resources to guide teachers on digital skills and pedagogy. The TDT grew out of a need to support teachers with easy-to-use, self-guided learning tools through courses, lesson plans, and teaching tips to help them gain skills and experience in digital teaching methods while accessing the wealth of learning resources that are preloaded on Thaki computers. This training content includes 42 Courses, 67 instructional videos, 28 Lesson Plans, and 22 teaching resources. The training material is focused on digital classroom basics, coding, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and more. What evidence have you gathered to demonstrate that this solution is needed? Please provide a brief summaryWe track and iterate our findings following a user-centered approach collecting data directly from the teachers, students and partner organizations using feedback surveys, field observations and interviews. Our surveys are administered through the impact assessment platform, Whyise. Furthermore, we conducted an external evaluation of the impact of Thaki on children and their teachers from 6 learning centers of extremely vulnerable populations in Jordan (5 centers) and the UAE (1 center), conducted by the Centre for Lebanese Studies (CLS). CLS designed the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEAL) system, tracking the progress of the program as a whole against the outcomes and objectives, and answered the overall question of the program: What effect does the proposed project have on students’ and teachers’ quality of learning and teaching respectively. The results showed very positive impacts of Thaki’s intervention on both children and teachers (full study available). For this project, we will monitor and evaluate project impact through the Whyise tools to which we subscribe, including pre and post-test surveys and field observations. Key Operational risksWe currently have 3 main operational risks: 1- Acquisition of hardware: Donated laptops are not always readily available in the numbers we need. To mitigate that, we purchase refurbished laptops through trusted and mission-aligned providers with whom we have negotiated special rates. 2- Cost of services: Given the financial crisis in Lebanon, some recipient partners struggle to pay for the cost of our services (recently adjusted to be more aligned with our actual costs). We conducted market research on the price of refurbished laptops in Lebanon available commercially and devised a pricing structure that is very competitive, with the added benefit of providing Thaki’s services of the wealth of preloaded offline content, client onboarding and our Teacher Digital Toolkit – all for a fraction of what recipients would pay for commercially available used laptops. We shared this new pricing strategy with our partners and most have embraced it and continue requesting laptops from us. That said, we still seek funding and joint partnerships in order to subsidize our costs for greater affordability to our recipients. 3- Electricity: Digital literacy requires power to run the laptops. The power situation in Lebanon has become extreme with little to no power supply coming from the grid, and strain on – as well as lack of affordability – to operate the prevalent (and polluting) generators. We successfully leveraged funding and partners to power one of our large partner schools with solar energy (impacting 1,100 children) and have funding partners secured for other school solar implementations. We are deepening dialogue with local and international partners to brainstorm collaborative solutions for this country-wide issue. In parallel, we are making plans to expand our services in other countries, with a current focus on Jordan (deepening our presence there), Palestine and Morocco which will further diversify our market. What are your main sources of funding?Thaki App of offline content:As noted during our call, we are happy to give you remote access to a Thaki laptop so that you can navigate the platform yourself. This table lists the content that is preloaded on the laptops, with a video tour of the interface (please note that both need to be updated since we have recently made changes, but they give you a general idea). In addition to the educational content, we also preload the laptops with a wealth of open source software programs, including word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, graphic and coding programs because we believe learning these skills is a very important part of digital literacy. If you have digital content that you would like to see added or removed from the app we can discuss customizing and adapting it. Who does Thaki seek to help?Thaki, in partnership with TNO, is developing a science based, digital, self-guided package for young children, their teachers and parents in Lebanon and other MENA countries that aims to decrease the impact of trauma and increase resilience in children through strategies on how to deal with overwhelming emotions. This project is funded by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency/RVO as a Small Business Innovation Research Programme (SBIR) assignment from the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Nour, a child resiliency program Thaki, in partnership with the Dutch research organization TNO, is developing a science based, digital, self-guided package, Nour, for young children, their teachers and parents that aims to decrease the impact of trauma in children through strategies on how to deal with overwhelming emotions. Nour is a child resiliency program that will be implemented in Lebanon and MENA, incorporating an innovative approach to social emotional learning with practical, digital delivery mechanisms and positive outcomes across the community. With this program young children (targeted at 5 to 8 years) learn how to recognize and communicate their feelings and use strategies to self-regulate their emotions and learn to deal with stress. Teachers, parents, and caregivers learn how to guide the children’s experience as well as enhance their own self-awareness and wellbeing.
