      "content": "Let's turn this proposal into a generic proposal, strip out any information about Wise systems from this project proposal and give me 3 improvement critiques from the generic version:\n\nProposal for Bloom Pilot Program Partnership with Wise Systems\nMay 2023\nIntroduction\nAt Bloom PM, we understand the importance of a healthy hybrid work culture. We are excited to present a pilot program to support and improve your employees' personal and professional growth, leveraging our extensive experience as a social enterprise accelerator.\nSince 2015 we have been developing our values-based personal and professional growth methodology for entrepreneurship education, fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. Through our programs, we've impacted thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, many of which have launched, grown, and mobilized millions in funding.\nGallup's validated Q12 engagement survey indicates that only 20% of the world's workers are engaged and since the pandemic in 2020 it has been on the decline resulting in lower performance. We believe in the power of remote/hybrid organizations and that it’s possible to take advantage of going remote/hybrid.\nRemote work, when leveraged correctly, allows companies to save money, boost employee productivity, and improve retention. Using our tried and tested models and concepts in The Bloom Method, we help individuals and organizations outline a working model for productivity and engagement. We identify and implement coaching solutions to propel learning, organizational effectiveness, and personal and professional development.\nWhat We Can Do For Wise Systems\nIn 2023, offices worldwide struggle to balance rising employee demand for more remote flexibility, less meeting time, and work-life balance with a need to keep employees engaged, productive, and motivated. \nAt Bloom, we transitioned in 2018 to operating our organization and delivering customer services in fully remote or hybrid environments. Using cutting-edge tools, positive reinforcement strategies, and strengths-based development, we have grown our company to 4 continents and 12 hours of time difference while remaining on the leading edge of business acceleration programs in the MENA region. \nWith this program, you can expect the following:\nIncreased Employee Engagement: The tailored activities and personalized growth plans will help ignite each employee's passion and motivation to contribute meaningfully to the organization.\nHealthier Remote Work Culture: Our program focuses on creating a supportive remote work environment, addressing remote employees' challenges, and promoting a sense of belonging and connectedness with the team.\nEnhanced Organizational Performance: With improved engagement levels, your employees will be better equipped to collaborate, innovate, and drive growth, leading to positive impacts on Wise Systems' performance.\nAssessing Impact \nTo evaluate the impact of our pilot program on remote work engagement and effectiveness, we propose working with Wise Systems to assess the following KPIs to monitor progress and ensure our solution aligns with your organization's goals:\nRemote work capacity: Assessed across the organization.\nEmployee engagement: Assessed by team members\nProductivity: Assessed during the program we will monitor/report team member accomplishments, streaks, and post-program monitoring of selected KPIs.\n“Disengaged employees cost the world $7.8 trillion a year in lost productivity.”\n-State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report \nProgram Overview\nBloom PM's pilot program aims to catalyze positive change in your remote work culture and improve overall team health, productivity, and performance. Our program will be tailored to suit the unique needs of Wise Systems, and we have a few options for engaging with our training ranging from light touch to training one of your team members - such as an HR representative or team lead - on our methodology so that it may become a repeatable process ingrained in your organizational culture. In addition, they will receive weekly coaching to successfully implement our combined personal and professional growth method within your organization.\nThe Bloom Method\nOur methodology  helps people and teams identify their shared purpose and build towards enhanced shared success. We use reflective practices, personal and professional development assessments, and a library of activities designed to help your employees thrive at work holistically. \nWe focus on fostering self-awareness and identification of purpose at work, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid word environments. These tools, including recent integrations with AI,  will allow your trained team member to facilitate and support your employees' ongoing growth and development.\nThree key principles of a successful Bloom program are:\nOur values and strengths power our performance: We help participants identify their sources of meaning at work that unlocks energy and capacity for committed learning and development in their “missions.”\nAction-based learning loops: Participants are guided to design a “mission” every two weeks. A mission is a performance objective they want to achieve each cycle, including reflecting on past learnings and planning next best steps.\nLearning by doing together: Promote collaboration and mutual support, especially online, since usually two heads are better than one.\n“[Taking the assessments] did open up my eyes to a lot of things. For example, although I knew I had these problems when I wrote them down and shared them with the team and heard their feedback, I completely understood that those are things I should be taking seriously and solving ASAP.”\t\n- Le Joyau d’Olive (Accelerator Participant 2021)\nSuggested Approaches \nTier 1, The Basics\nEngagement: 3 weeks\nTier 2, The Standard\nEngagement: 5 weeks\nTier 3, Deep Learning\nEngagement: 10 weeks\n• Intro info by email \n\n• Pre-workshop assessments \n\n• 2 hour participatory online workshop reviewing challenges, priorities, goals, and setting action plans … and direct focused adaptive learning during the workshop  \n\n• Two weeks of self-guided implementation \n\n• Follow-on 2 hour participatory online workshop, reviewing progress, and setting next-stage action plans   \nBasics program, plus: \n\n1 additional group session 2 weeks later\n\n~~ plus ~~\n\nA 40-minute 1-on-1 coaching session for up to 5 people on your team. \n\nor\n\nA 2-hour intro train-the-trainer workshop to improve facilitation/online facilitation skills on your team plus help people from your team continue supporting your team using Bloom’s assessments and library.\nPlus observe TOT trainees deliver a workshop or session, and provide them with written feedback post-session.  \n\n\n\nStandard program, plus: \n\n3 month program, 6 group sessions total \n\n~~ plus ~~\n\n2 x 40-minute 1-on-1 coaching sessions for up to 5 people on your team. \n\nor\n\n2 x 2-hour train-the-trainer workshops to improve facilitation/online facilitation skills on your team plus help people from your team continue supporting your team using Bloom’s assessments and library.\nIncludes 2 TOT facilitation observation sessions, facilitator certificates, and guidance in follow-on program design. (Additional support for implementation is optional.)  \n$5800\n$12,500\n$24,000\n\nWe will send a  more detailed timeline and details for the specified program approach. \nNext Steps\nTo efficiently implement the Bloom PM pilot program for Wise Systems, we propose the following essential steps and deadlines:\nInitial Consultation and Customization (by May 12, 2023): Schedule a 30-minute call with Bilal Ghalib to discuss Wise Systems' needs and goals. Based on the consultation, Bloom PM will tailor the program and provide a draft with a timeline and activities. You can email at bilal@bloom.pm, or  WhatsApp/Signal: +14782272253, or schedule a call directly on my calendly to arrange an initial consultation. \nApproval and Implementation (aiming for Mid June): Review and approve the customized program. Collaborate with Bloom PM to develop and execute an implementation plan, including the assignment of responsibilities, communication channels, and milestones.\nProgram Kickoff (July 2023): Launch the pilot program with an introductory session for the selected team members.\n\nWe are keen to explore this opportunity together and look forward to playing an integral role in Wise Systems' ongoing success.\n\n\nThank you 🌻\n",

This helps to set the tone and provide context to the reader.\n\n2. **More Specific KPIs:** Your assessment of impact should include more specific KPIs. While the ones you've listed are certainly important, providing more detailed and industry-specific metrics could make your proposal more compelling. For instance, you could include metrics like employee turnover rate, absenteeism, or even industry-specific productivity measures.\n\n3. **Case Studies:** Incorporate case studies of previous engagements where your programs have made a difference.

We aim to help youth identify the gaps they need to address in order to thrive, and then support them in addressing those gaps. We do this through social entrepreneurship programs, skills development, and other impact-driven initiatives.\nOur Track Record\nBloom and our affiliated initiatives (through AltCity Impact) have been running skills development, entrepreneurship education, and organizational development programs in Lebanon and the EuroMENA region for over 14 years. We are now running startup and \"accelerate the accelerators\" programs in 9 MENA countries, plus an impact accelerator focused on women-led social enterprises in MENA and Africa. \nAbout 5 years ago we shifted to online, hybrid online+offline, and data-driven programs, which enabled us to reach a much larger population while running more personalized and impactful programs. We have been building those methods and tools into the Bloom platform which we use to help us leverage our assessments, our methods, Library of Activities, and data monitoring dashboards to run more impactful programs. \nWe have worked with a wide variety of partners including banks, governments, universities, telcos, the UN, World Bank, international investors, and more. A small sample of our current and former partners is included here: \n\n\nWe have run more than 50 sprints & accelerator cycles in the last 8 years, collaborated with partners to run 27 more, and worked with teams & training partners across 10 countries. We love running online & hybrid entrepreneurship & skills development programs that inspire and energize, and we continue to innovate in our programs, tools and approaches to improve impact and build a stronger community of collaborators and participants. \nWe have worked with over 850 teams over the last 8 years in 10 MENA and African countries, with a focus on social enterprises and early-stage startups, through online and offline programs. \nOur teams have mobilized millions in next-stage funding, won prizes (national, regional, and global), and gained acceptance in top accelerators in MENA and worldwide. \nWe have collaborated with leading local, regional and international partners in the tech, accelerator, corporate, government, INGO, and university sectors. \nKey impact highlights from a recent impact assessment include the following user-reported metrics:\n80% of teams say they grew personally during their time with Bloom\n79% of teams say they grew professionally during their time with Bloom\n87% of teams recommend Bloom programs to fellow entrepreneurs\n96% of our teams were able to maintain (despite economic decline) or increase in size 3 months after joining our program\nTestamonials:\n1\t“Every time I mentor someone I learn. Every step is an addition to our knowledge and experience.”\tAJ (Board Meeting)\n2\t“It is incredible how we can generate hundreds of solutions in just a little time; we need this community in our daily life.”\tMortben\n3\t“The mindset of sharing: giving and receiving is a striking feature. The culture of we grow together is what I am taking.”\tOgechi\n4\t“The energy and engagement of the other teams to support were incredible; I will surely be missing all this interaction once the sprint is over!”\tWonderhub\n5\t“Entrepreneurship is not just about money, it’s about fulfillment.”\tLatifa Naziha\n6\t“Such a great and amazing Bloom Team and Program! Being part of the 2 weeks sprint was a great opportunity for us to learn, share and brainstorm ideas with a great community with bright ideas, which proves once again that we, Lebanese people, will always strive and shine despite all circumstances.”\tHadiyati\n7\t“The ECAT did open up my eyes to a lot of things. For example, although I knew I had these problems when I wrote them down and shared them with the team and heard their feedback, I completely understood that those are things I should be taking seriously and solving ASAP.”\tLe Joyau d’Olive\n8\t“To be honest, the diagnostic sessions helped us rearrange our thoughts on developing our organization’s policies and structure.

Here's the improved version:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAt Bloom, we champion the value of a robust, hybrid work culture. Our proposed pilot program, backed by our extensive experience as a social enterprise accelerator since 2015, aims to support and enhance your employees' personal and professional growth. Our unique, value-based growth methodology has been instrumental in fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. To date, we have influenced thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, with many launching, growing, and mobilizing millions in funding. \n\nOur method is underpinned by Gallup's Q12 engagement survey data, which reveals a worrying decline in global workforce engagement since the pandemic. However, we are confident in our approach. We see remote and hybrid work as an opportunity, not a challenge.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: The proposal is clearly structured and easy to follow. It starts with an introduction to the company and its services, then moves on to the specifics of the program and how it will be implemented, and concludes with a summary and a call to action.\n\n2. **Detailed Explanation of Services**: The proposal does a good job of explaining what Bloom does and the methodologies it uses. It goes into detail about how Bloom's methods will be beneficial to the company it is pitching to.\n\n3. **Use of Data**: The proposal makes use of data to back up its claims, which lends credibility to the argument.\n\n4. **Testimonials**: Including testimonials from previous clients is a great way to demonstrate the success of Bloom's program and services.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Target Audience**: While the proposal mentions customization based on assessment feedback, it does not clearly specify how the program will be tailored to the specific needs of the target audience. It could be more effective to include a section detailing how Bloom's program will address the unique challenges and requirements of the company it is pitching to.\n\n2. **Value Proposition**: The proposal could benefit from a more concise, compelling value proposition statement at the beginning, summarizing why the company should choose Bloom's program over other alternatives.\n\n3. **Cost and Timeframe**: The proposal lacks information about the cost of the program and the timeframe for its implementation. These are crucial details that potential clients will likely want to know upfront.\n\n4. **Visual Aids**: The proposal is quite text-heavy. Incorporating some visual aids, such as charts or infographics, could make the proposal more engaging and easier to digest.\n\n5. **Call to Action**: The conclusion could be strengthened by a more explicit call to action, directing the reader on what the next steps should be if they're interested in Bloom's services.\n   \nOverall, the proposal is quite robust and compelling, but addressing these areas of improvement could make it even more effective.",

      "content": "The landing page you've provided is comprehensive and provides clear, detailed information about Bloom's services, value proposition, and the benefits that organizations can expect to receive. However, there are a few areas where the landing page could be improved to better align with best practices for landing page design and conversion optimization. Here are my critiques:\n\n1. **Lengthy Text**: While the provided text is rich in information, it might be overwhelming for visitors who are just getting introduced to Bloom. Modern web users often prefer short, concise, and engaging copy that communicates the main points quickly.\n\n2. **Lack of Visuals**: The proposed landing page layout does not include visuals or infographics, which could make the page more engaging and easier to understand. Images, icons, or infographics can help break up the text, making it easier to digest.\n\n3. **Absence of Social Proof**: Adding testimonials or case studies can build trust with potential customers. While you mention the track record, direct quotes from satisfied clients or success stories can be more convincing.\n\n4. **Missing Call-to-Action (CTA)**: A clear CTA is missing. While the text is informative, it doesn't guide the visitor towards a specific action, like contacting Bloom, signing up for a demo, or learning more about the offerings.\n\n5. **Lack of Personalization**: The language could be more directly addressed to the visitor. Using words like \"you\" and \"your team\" can make the content feel more personalized and engaging.\n\nTaking into account these critiques, here's a revised landing page layout and content:\n\n**Landing Page Content**\n\n**Header:**\n\n\"Bloom: Unleashing Your Team's Potential in the Hybrid Work Era\"\n\n**[Hero Image - Picture showing a diverse, happy remote team]**\n\n**Subheader:**\n\n\"Maximize productivity.
