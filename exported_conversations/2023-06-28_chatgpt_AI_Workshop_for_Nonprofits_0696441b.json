      "content": "Given the mission of TEDx, Changemakers Exchange, and other social enterprises around the world, they often focus on innovative, impactful ideas and transformative change. As such, workshop names that highlight the potential for significant societal transformation using AI, and those that hint at the shared language of impact, change, and progress would likely be more appealing. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **AI Empowerment for Nonprofits (AIEN):** This name suggests that the workshop will empower nonprofits with the knowledge and skills they need to leverage AI, which is a message likely to resonate with these groups.\n\n2. **Tech-for-Good AI Workshop (TGA):** This name directly ties the workshop to the 'tech for good' movement, which is all about using technology to drive positive social impact. This would be appealing to changemakers and social enterprises.\n\n3. **AI for Positive Change (APC):** This name suggests that the workshop is all about harnessing AI to drive positive change – a message directly in line with the goals of TEDx and social enterprises.\n\n4. **ChangeMakers' AI Workshop (CMAIW):** By directly referencing 'changemakers' in the name, this option would likely be compelling for individuals involved in Changemakers Exchange and similar initiatives.\n\n5. **Nonprofit Tech Innovators: AI Workshop (NTI-AIW):** This name positions attendees as innovators, which could be appealing to the forward-thinking audiences of TEDx and social enterprises.\n\nRemember, the name of the workshop is just the first step. To attract these groups, you'll also want to ensure that your workshop content aligns with their interests, needs, and goals.",
