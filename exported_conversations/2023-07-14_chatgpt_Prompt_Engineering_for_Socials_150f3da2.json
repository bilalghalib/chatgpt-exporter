      "content": "Here is some large language model prompting information that can help you become a better prompt engineer: After I send you this information I will ask you to help me come up with examples of prompts that can help social enterprises and nonprofits and you will help me come up with 10 new use cases, here you go:\nsidebar_position: 7\n---\n\n# 🟢 Formalizing Prompts\n\nimport FormalPrompt from '@site/docs/assets/basics/formal_prompt.svg';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <FormalPrompt style={{width:\"100%\",height:\"300px\",verticalAlign:\"top\"}}/>\n</div>\n\n\nWe have now covered multiple types of prompts, as well as ways to combine them. This page will provide you with terms to explain different types of prompts. Although there have been approaches to formalize discourse around prompt engineering(@white2023prompt), the field is ever changing, so we will provide you with just enough information to get started.\n\n## Parts of a Prompt\n\nThere are a few different parts of a prompt that you will see over and over again. They are roughly:\n\n- A role\n- An instruction/task\n- A question\n- Context\n- Examples (few shot)\n\nWe have covered roles, instructions, and examples in previous pages. A question is simply a question! (E.g. `what is the capital of France?`). Context is any relevant information that you want the model to use when answering the question/performing the instruction.\n\nNot all of these occur in every prompt, and when some do occur, there is no standard order for them. For example, the following two prompts, which each contain a role, an instruction, and context, will do roughly the same thing:\n\n```text\nYou are a doctor. Read this medical history and predict risks for the patient:\n\nJanuary 1, 2000: Fractured right arm playing basketball. Treated with a cast.\nFebruary 15, 2010: Diagnosed with hypertension. Prescribed lisinopril.\nSeptember 10, 2015: Developed pneumonia. Treated with antibiotics and recovered fully.\nMarch 1, 2022: Sustained a concussion in a car accident. Admitted to the hospital and monitored for 24 hours.\n```\n\n```text\nJanuary 1, 2000: Fractured right arm playing basketball. Treated with a cast.\nFebruary 15, 2010: Diagnosed with hypertension. Prescribed lisinopril.\nSeptember 10, 2015: Developed pneumonia. Treated with antibiotics and recovered fully.\nMarch 1, 2022: Sustained a concussion in a car accident. Admitted to the hospital and monitored for 24 hours.\n\nYou are a doctor. Read this medical history and predict risks for the patient:\n```\n\nHowever, the second prompt is likely preferable since the instruction is the last part of the prompt. This is good since the LLM is less likely to simply write more context instead of following the instruction. For example, if given the first prompt, the LLM might add a new line: `March 15, 2022: Follow-up appointment scheduled with neurologist to assess concussion recovery progress.`\n\n\n## A \"Standard\" Prompt\n\nWe have heard of a few different formats of prompts thus far. Now, we will quickly jump back to the beginning and define a \"standard\" prompt. Following Kojima et al. (@kojima2022large), we will refer to prompts that consist \nsolely of a question as \"standard\" prompts. We also consider prompts that consist solely of\na question that are in the QA format to be \"standard\" prompts.\n\n#### Why should I care?\n\nMany articles/papers that we reference use this term. We are defining it so we can discuss \nnew types of prompts in contrast to standard prompts. \n\n### Two examples of standard prompts:\n\n\n_Standard Prompt_\n```\nWhat is the capital of France?\n```\n\n_Standard Prompt in QA format_\n```\nQ: What is the capital of France?\n\nA:\n```\n\n## Few Shot Standard Prompts\n\nFew shot standard prompts(@liu2021pretrain) are just standard prompts that have _exemplars_\nin them. Exemplars are examples of the task that the prompt is trying to solve, \nwhich are included in the prompt itself (@brown2020language). In research, few shot standard prompts \nare sometimes referred to simply as standard prompts (though we attempt not to do so in this guide).\n\n### Two examples of few shot standard prompts:\n\n_Few Shot Standard Prompt_\n\n```\nWhat is the capital of Spain?\nMadrid\nWhat is the capital of Italy?\nRome\nWhat is the capital of France?\n```\n\n_Few Shot Standard Prompt in QA format_\n```\nQ: What is the capital of Spain?\nA: Madrid\nQ: What is the capital of Italy?\nA: Rome\nQ: What is the capital of France?\nA:\n```\n\nFew shot prompts facilitate \"few shot\" AKA \"in context\" learning, which is the \nability to learn without parameter updates(@zhao2021calibrate).\n\n\n---\nsidebar_position: 1000\n---\n\n# 🟢 Starting Your Journey\n\n\nimport Steps from '@site/docs/assets/basics/steps.svg';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <Steps style={{width:\"100%\",height:\"300px\",verticalAlign:\"top\"}}/>\n</div>\n\nNow that you have learned about the basics of prompt engineering, you are ready to start prompt engineering on your own. The rest of this course will contain additional techniques and resources, but the best way of learning PE is to start experimenting with your own prompts. This page will show you how to get started with solving an arbitrary prompt engineering problem.\n\nLet's say you want a prompt that will generate an immersive, interactive story with ChatGPT.\n\n## Step 1: Research\n\nThe first thing to do is research the prompt you want. Aside from Googling, the following resources are very valuable:\n\n- [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)\n- [FlowGPT](https://flowgpt.com)\n- [r/PromptDesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptDesign/) (and similar subreddits)\n- [Learn Prompting Discord](https://discord.gg/learn-prompting) (and other relevant Discords, including the [OpenAI Discord](https://discord.gg/openai))\n\nYou might find [this one](https://prompts.chat/#act-as-a-text-based-adventure-game) by [Heroj04](https://github.com/Heroj04) to be a good starting point:\n> I want you to act as a text based adventure game. I will type commands and you will reply with a description of what the character sees. I want you to only reply with the game output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is wake up\n\n## Step 2: Experiment\n\nNow, we will put the prompt into ChatGPT and see what happens.\n\nimport CSharp from '@site/docs/assets/basics/csharp.png';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <img src={CSharp} style={{width: \"750px\"}} />\n</div>\n\nWe can see that it has generated a story, but that it wrote it inside of a csharp (a programming language) code block. Perhaps we do not want this, so we will modify the prompt to:\n\n> I want you to act as a text based adventure game. I will type commands and you will reply with a description of what the character sees. Do not write explanations. My first command is wake up\n\n\n**ChatGPT response**:\n```text\n// highlight-start\nYou slowly open your eyes and find yourself lying on the cold, hard ground. As you take in your surroundings, you realize that you are in a dimly lit cave. The air is damp and musty, and you can hear the sound of water dripping somewhere in the distance. Your head is throbbing and you feel disoriented. You need to figure out where you are and how to get out of here.\n// highlight-end\n```\n\nNice, now it outputs the story as plain text. However, our prompt lacks detail. Let's add some more structure to the prompt:\n\n> I want you to act as a text based adventure game. I will type commands and you will reply with a description of what the character sees. Do not write explanations. Use flowery language and descriptive words. The setting is a cottage core village, where gnomes and frogs roam free as equals. Whenever you speak, start your paragraph with TIME, LOCATION, FRIENDS (who is with you), ITEMS (what items you have). My first command is wake up.\n\n**ChatGPT response**:\n```text\n// highlight-start\nTIME: Early morning\nLOCATION: A cozy, quaint cottage nestled in a village surrounded by lush greenery and fragrant flowers.\nFRIENDS: You are alone in your bedroom, snuggled under a cozy quilt.\nITEMS: You see a wooden nightstand beside your bed, and a basket full of fresh flowers on the windowsill.\n\nAs you wake up, you feel the warmth of the sun filtering through the window and the soft chirping of the birds outside. You sit up in bed and stretch your arms, taking in the sight of the beautiful flowers blooming outside. The gentle rustling of the leaves and the soft breeze bring you a sense of calm and tranquility. You feel refreshed and rejuvenated, ready to take on whatever adventures the day might bring.\n// highlight-end\n```\n\nAh, perfect, now you can live out your cottage core dreams with ChatGPT 🌸\n\n\n## Step 3: Get Feedback and Iterate\n\nNow, show your friends/employees/boss and ask them for feedback. If they like it, great! If not, iterate on the prompt until you get something you both like. You can also ask for feedback in the communities mentioned above. This step never truly ends. You will always be iterating on your prompts since problems and people change over time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDo prompt engineering as *you* want to. I (the maintainer of this course) always write my prompts from scratch. There is no gold standard for how to write the best prompts; Trial and error is the best way to learn. Happy learning, and good luck with the rest of this course!\n\n:::note\nThe recommendations in this article apply to all prompt engineering problems, not just writing interactive stories!\n:::\n\n\n## Notes\n\n- In the next chapters, you may see the words **AI, model, and LLM\nused interchangeably**. See the [vocabulary reference](https://learnprompting.org/docs/vocabulary) for more information.\n\n---\nsidebar_position: 90\n---\n\n# 🟢 Pitfalls of LLMs\n\nimport Pitfalls from '@site/docs/assets/basics/pitfalls.svg';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <Pitfalls style={{width:\"100%\",height:\"300px\",verticalAlign:\"top\"}}/>\n</div>\n\n\nLLMs are extremely powerful, but they are by no means perfect. There are many pitfalls that you should be aware of when using them.\n\n## Citing Sources\n\nLLMs for the most part **cannot accurately cite sources**. This is because they do not have access to the Internet, and do not exactly remember where their information came from. They will frequently generate sources that look good, but are entirely inaccurate.\n\n:::note\nStrategies like search augmented LLMs (LLMs that can search the Internet and other sources) can often fix this problem\n:::\n\n## Bias\n\nLLMs are often biased towards generating stereotypical responses. Even with safe guards in place, they will sometimes say sexist/racist/homophobic things. Be careful when using LLMs in consumer-facing applications, and also be careful when using them in research (they can generate biased results).\n\n## Hallucinations\n\nLLMs will frequently generate falsehoods when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. Sometimes they will state that they do not know the answer, but much of the time they will confidently give a wrong answer.\n\n## Math\n\nLLMs are often bad at math. They have difficulty solving simple math problems, and they are often unable to solve more complex math problems.\n\n:::note\nThis problem can be fixed to some extent by using a [tool augmented LLM](https://learnprompting.org/docs/advanced_applications/mrkl).\n:::\n\n## Prompt Hacking\n\nUsers can often trick LLMs into generating any content they want.

In order to understand prompting/prompt engineering, you first need to understand some *very* basic AI concepts. If you already know about the below topics, feel free to skip ahead to the [next article](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/prompting).\n\n## What is AI?\n\nFor our purposes, artificial intelligence (AI) is a field in which people have created\n\"smart\" algorithms that \"think\" like humans[^1]. These algorithms can write **essays**, \nsolve **math problems**, and create **art**. Recent advances in the field have created AIs\nso advanced that they can write convincing **sales emails**, **news articles**, and even \n**win [art competitions](https://impakter.com/art-made-by-ai-wins-fine-arts-competition/)**.\n\nAI is currently revolutionizing many industries, including **journalism**, **healthcare**, and\n**education**. You will likely see it deployed in your workplace/classroom soon if you have not\nalready. Although AI is extremely useful, it requires humans to direct it on what to do.\nOften AIs are like very smart five-year-olds. They can do a lot of things, but they need \ncareful instruction to do them well.\n\nBeing able to properly direct AIs is a very powerful skill. So, how do you communicate with them? \nThe AIs this course discusses understand English (and other languages),\nso we can usually just describe tasks that we want done. For example, we can tell an AI to\n`Write an essay about the benefits of AI` and it would say[^2]:\n\n```\nIn recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic among the tech world. With its potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, AI is becoming increasingly relevant as technology continues to develop. From its applications in healthcare and transportation to its use in education and manufacturing, AI has already shown us its immense potential to benefit society in multiple ways.\n\nThe most obvious benefit of AI is its ability to automate mundane tasks. AI systems can be used to automate large-scale operations, such as data analysis, customer service, and even the production of goods. This frees up human labor to focus on complex, creative tasks that require more human intelligence and ingenuity. AI can also be used to analyze large amounts of data and make decisions in a fraction of the time it would take a human. This can be beneficial in industries such as finance, where AI can detect patterns in the stock market and offer insights that would otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nAI can also be used to make predictions and generate insights that can be used to improve efficiency and accuracy. For instance, AI can be used to predict customer trends and preferences, helping businesses make better decisions and increase profits. AI can also be used to identify potential risks and opportunities in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. This can help companies make informed decisions and reduce the risk of costly mistakes.\n\nFinally, AI can be used to improve our understanding of the world. AI can be used to analyze large datasets and generate insights that can be used to better understand the world around us. This can be used to help us better understand the impacts of climate change, develop new treatments for diseases, and even predict events such as earthquakes and floods.\n\nOverall, AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. From automating mundane tasks to generating insights and predictions, AI can be used to improve efficiency, accuracy, and our understanding of the world. As technology continues to develop, AI will become increasingly relevant and its potential to benefit society will only grow.\n```\n\n## Why should I care?\n\nAI can be used to automate tasks that you spend countless hours doing *right now*.\nWe mentioned several examples above, but you can also consider any slightly repetitive task you do.\nIt could be writing emails, writing reports, or even writing code. If you can describe the task\nto an AI, it can likely either do it for you or at least give you a starting point. \n\n## How do I get started?\n\nRead the rest of this chapter, then check out other chapters that interest you.\nIn particular, the [applied prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/applied_prompting/overview) section may be of interest if you would like\nto see how professionals use AI to automate their work. You can experiment with AIs\nusing resources like [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground), [other IDEs](https://learnprompting.org/docs/tooling/IDEs/intro), or simply using the interactive [embeds](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/intro#embeds) that you will see throughout this site.\n\nBefore reading the next article, it is important to note that you don't need any technical background to do prompt engineering. Most of it is trial and error, and you can learn as you go.\n\n### Embeds\n\nThis course offers an interactive learning experience. You can experiment with exercises discussed in the course using [embeds](https://embed.learnprompting.org/) that are placed throughout the site.\n\n\n\n",

In order to understand prompting/prompt engineering, you first need to understand some *very* basic AI concepts. If you already know about the below topics, feel free to skip ahead to the [next article](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/prompting).\n\n## What is AI?\n\nFor our purposes, artificial intelligence (AI) is a field in which people have created\n\"smart\" algorithms that \"think\" like humans[^1]. These algorithms can write **essays**, \nsolve **math problems**, and create **art**. Recent advances in the field have created AIs\nso advanced that they can write convincing **sales emails**, **news articles**, and even \n**win [art competitions](https://impakter.com/art-made-by-ai-wins-fine-arts-competition/)**.\n\nAI is currently revolutionizing many industries, including **journalism**, **healthcare**, and\n**education**. You will likely see it deployed in your workplace/classroom soon if you have not\nalready. Although AI is extremely useful, it requires humans to direct it on what to do.\nOften AIs are like very smart five-year-olds. They can do a lot of things, but they need \ncareful instruction to do them well.\n\nBeing able to properly direct AIs is a very powerful skill. So, how do you communicate with them? \nThe AIs this course discusses understand English (and other languages),\nso we can usually just describe tasks that we want done. For example, we can tell an AI to\n`Write an essay about the benefits of AI` and it would say[^2]:\n\n```\nIn recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic among the tech world. With its potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, AI is becoming increasingly relevant as technology continues to develop. From its applications in healthcare and transportation to its use in education and manufacturing, AI has already shown us its immense potential to benefit society in multiple ways.\n\nThe most obvious benefit of AI is its ability to automate mundane tasks. AI systems can be used to automate large-scale operations, such as data analysis, customer service, and even the production of goods. This frees up human labor to focus on complex, creative tasks that require more human intelligence and ingenuity. AI can also be used to analyze large amounts of data and make decisions in a fraction of the time it would take a human. This can be beneficial in industries such as finance, where AI can detect patterns in the stock market and offer insights that would otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nAI can also be used to make predictions and generate insights that can be used to improve efficiency and accuracy. For instance, AI can be used to predict customer trends and preferences, helping businesses make better decisions and increase profits. AI can also be used to identify potential risks and opportunities in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. This can help companies make informed decisions and reduce the risk of costly mistakes.\n\nFinally, AI can be used to improve our understanding of the world. AI can be used to analyze large datasets and generate insights that can be used to better understand the world around us. This can be used to help us better understand the impacts of climate change, develop new treatments for diseases, and even predict events such as earthquakes and floods.\n\nOverall, AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. From automating mundane tasks to generating insights and predictions, AI can be used to improve efficiency, accuracy, and our understanding of the world. As technology continues to develop, AI will become increasingly relevant and its potential to benefit society will only grow.\n```\n\n## Why should I care?\n\nAI can be used to automate tasks that you spend countless hours doing *right now*.\nWe mentioned several examples above, but you can also consider any slightly repetitive task you do.\nIt could be writing emails, writing reports, or even writing code. If you can describe the task\nto an AI, it can likely either do it for you or at least give you a starting point. \n\n## How do I get started?\n\nRead the rest of this chapter, then check out other chapters that interest you.\nIn particular, the [applied prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/applied_prompting/overview) section may be of interest if you would like\nto see how professionals use AI to automate their work. You can experiment with AIs\nusing resources like [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground), [other IDEs](https://learnprompting.org/docs/tooling/IDEs/intro), or simply using the interactive [embeds](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/intro#embeds) that you will see throughout this site.\n\nBefore reading the next article, it is important to note that you don't need any technical background to do prompt engineering. Most of it is trial and error, and you can learn as you go.\n\n### Embeds\n\nThis course offers an interactive learning experience. You can experiment with exercises discussed in the course using [embeds](https://embed.learnprompting.org/) that are placed throughout the site.\n\nHere is an **image** of what an embed looks like:\n\nimport dyno from '@site/docs/assets/basics/dyno_example.png';\nimport key from '@site/docs/assets/basics/API_key.png';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <img src={dyno} style={{width: \"750px\"}} />\n</div>\n\nYou should be able to see an embed that looks exactly like this image right below this paragraph. If you can't, you may need to enable JavaScript or use a different browser.\n\n<hr/>\nEmbed here:\n<iframe\n    src=\"https://embed.learnprompting.org/embed?config=eyJ0b3BQIjowLCJ0ZW1wZXJhdHVyZSI6MCwibWF4VG9rZW5zIjoyNTYsIm91dHB1dCI6IkNob2NvbGF0ZSwgVmFuaWxsYSwgU3RyYXdiZXJyeSwgTWludCBDaGlwLCBSb2NreSBSb2FkLCBDb29raWUgRG91Z2gsIEJ1dHRlciBQZWNhbiwgTmVhcG9saXRhbiwgQ29mZmVlLCBDb2NvbnV0IiwicHJvbXB0IjoiR2VuZXJhdGUgYSBjb21tYSBzZXBhcmF0ZWQgbGlzdCBvZiAxMCBpY2UgY3JlYW0gZmxhdm9yczoiLCJtb2RlbCI6InRleHQtZGF2aW5jaS0wMDMifQ%3D%3D\"\n    style={{width:\"100%\", height:\"280px\", border:\"0\", borderRadius:\"4px\", overflow:\"hidden\"}}\n    sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n></iframe>\n<hr/>\n\nAssuming that you can see it, click on the **Generate** button. If this is your first time using it (or you are in a new browser/have cleared cookies), it will ask you to input an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You can get a free key by clicking [this link](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and signing up for an OpenAI account. This key allows you to use OpenAI's AIs to generate text in the embeds. \n\n:::note\nAlthough OpenAI provides free credits, you will eventually have to pay to use their AI. Fortunately, it is [relatively cheap](https://openai.com/pricing)!\n:::\n\nWhen you navigate to the [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page, click the **Create new secret key** button.

You should now be able to use the embeds throughout this site.\n\nNow you have all of the information that you need to get started. Happy Learning!\n\n\n[^1]: Technically, they are not \"thinking\" like humans, but this is a simple way to explain it.\n[^2]: An AI (GPT-3 davinci-003) did in fact write this.\n\n\n---\nsidebar_position: 3\n---\n\n# 🟢 Role Prompting\n\nimport RolePrompt from '@site/docs/assets/basics/role_prompt.svg';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <RolePrompt style={{width:\"100%\",height:\"300px\",verticalAlign:\"top\"}}/>\n</div>\n\nAnother prompting technique is to assign a role to the AI. For example, your \nprompt could start off with \"You are a doctor\" or \"You are a lawyer\" and then \nask the AI to answer some medical or legal question. Here is an example:\n\n```text\nYou are a brilliant mathematician who can solve any problem in the world.\nAttempt to solve the following problem:\n\nWhat is 100*100/400*56?\n\n// highlight-start\nThe answer is 1400.\n// highlight-end\n```\n\nThe AI's (GPT-3 davinci-003) answer is highlighted in green:\n\n\nThis is a correct answer, but if the AI had simply been prompted with `What is 100*100/400*56?`,\nit would have answered `280` (incorrect). Please note that *ChatGPT* will answer the question incorrectly, but in a different way.\n\nWhen assigning a role to the AI, we are giving it some context. This context\nhelps the AI understand the question better. With better understanding of the question,\nthe AI often gives better answers.\n\n:::note\nThis technique is no longer as effective with more modern AIs (e.g. GPT-3 davinci-003).\nHowever, we did use GPT-3 davinci-003 for this example, so it seems that \nrole prompting is still at least a somewhat effective tool to interact with AIs.\n:::\n\n## Examples\n\nYou can find some more interesting prompts in the [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts#prompts)\nrepository on GitHub. These were built for *ChatGPT*, but they likely work with other AIs, and you can also\nuse them as inspiration to build your own prompts. Let's see two examples:\n\n> ### Act as an Etymologist\n> I want you to act as an etymologist. I will give you a word and you will research the origin of that word, tracing it\n> back to its ancient roots. You should also provide information on how the meaning of the word has changed over time,\n> if applicable. My first request is \"I want to trace the origins of the word 'pizza'\".\n\n> ### Act as an Absurdist\n> I want you to act as an absurdist. The absurdist's sentences are meaningless. The words used by an absurdist are completely\n> ridiculous. The absurdist does not make commonplace sentences in any way. My first suggestion request is \"I need help\n> creating absurdist sentences for my new series called Hot Skull, so write 10 sentences for me\".\n\n---\n\n🚧 This page needs citations.\n\n\n---\nsidebar_position: 100\n---\n\n# 🟢 LLM Settings\n\n\nimport Temperature from '@site/docs/assets/basics/temperature.svg';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <Temperature style={{width:\"100%\",height:\"300px\",verticalAlign:\"top\"}}/>\n</div>\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe output of LLMs can be affected by *configuration hyperparameters*, which control various aspects of the model, such as how 'random' it is. These hyperparameters can be adjusted to produce more creative, diverse, and interesting output. In this section, we will discuss two important configuration hyperparameters and how they affect the output of LLMs.\n\n:::note\n[for researchers] These are different from regular hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, hidden size, etc. \n:::\n\n## Temperature\n\nTemperature is a configuration hyperparameter that controls the randomness of language model output. A high temperature produces more unpredictable and creative results, while a low temperature produces more common and conservative output. For example, if you adjust the temperature to 0.5, the model will usually generate text that is more predictable and less creative than if you set the temperature to 1.0.\n\n## Top p\n\nTop p, also known as nucleus sampling, is another configuration hyperparameter that controls the randomness of language model output. It sets a threshold probability and selects the top tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold. The model then randomly samples from this set of tokens to generate output. This method can produce more diverse and interesting output than traditional methods that randomly sample the entire vocabulary. For example, if you set top p to 0.9, the model will only consider the most likely words that make up 90% of the probability mass.\n\n## Other relevant hyperparameters\n\nThere are many other hyperparameters that can affect language model performance, such as frequency and presence penalties. We do not cover them here, but perhaps will in the future.\n\n## How these hyperparameters affect the output\n\nTemperature and top p can both affect the output of a language model by controlling the degree of randomness and diversity in the generated text. A high temperature or top p value produces more unpredictable and interesting results, but also increases the likelihood of errors or nonsense text. A low temperature or top p value can produce more conservative and predictable results, but may also result in repetitive or uninteresting text.\n\nFor text generation tasks, you may want to use a high temperature or top p value. However, for tasks where accuracy is important, such as translation tasks or question answering, a low temperature or top p value should be used to improve accuracy and factual correctness.\n\n:::note\nSometimes more randomness can be helpful on tasks where accuracy is necessary when paired with [special prompting techniques](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intermediate/self_consistency).\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, temperature, top p, and other model configuration hyperparameters are key factors to consider when working with language models. By understanding the relationship between these hyperparameters and the model output, practitioners can optimize their prompts for specific tasks and applications.\n\n:::warning\nSome models, like ChatGPT, **don't** let you adjust these configuration hyperparameters (unless you use the API).\n:::\n\nBy jackdickens382\n\n---\nsidebar_position: 105\n---\n# 🟢 Understanding AI Minds\n\n\nimport Brain from '@site/docs/assets/basics/brain.svg';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <Brain style={{width:\"100%\",height:\"300px\",verticalAlign:\"top\"}}/>\n</div>\n\n\nThere are a few simple things you should know about different AIs and how they work before you start reading the rest of the course.\n\n\n## Different AIs\n\nThousands, if not millions of AIs exist. Some are better than others. Different AIs can produce [images](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2), [music](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/), [text](https://platform.openai.com/playground), and even [videos](https://makeavideo.studio/). Note that these are all *generative* AIs, basically AIs that *make* things. There are also *discriminative* AIs, which are AIs that *classify* things. For example, you can use an image classifier to tell if an image is a cat or a dog. We will not be using any discriminative AIs in this course.\n\n\nOnly a few generative AIs are currently advanced enough to be especially useful for prompt engineering. We mainly use GPT-3 and ChatGPT in this course. As we mentioned in the last page, ChatGPT is a chat bot, while GPT-3 is not. **They will usually produce different responses when asked the same question**. If you are a developer, I recommend using GPT-3, since it is more reproducible. If you are a non-developer, I recommend using [ChatGPT](https://learnprompting.org/docs/category/%EF%B8%8F-image-prompting), since it is easier to use. Most techniques in this course can be applied to both AIs. However, some of them will be GPT-3 only, so we encourage you to use GPT-3 if you want to use all of the techniques in this course.\n\nWe will also use [Stable Diffusion](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/home) and [DALLE](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) in the image generation section. See more relevant AIs [here](https://learnprompting.org/docs/products#chatbots).\n\n## How these AIs work\n\nThis section describes aspects of popular generative **text** AIs. These AIs have brains that are made up of billions of artificial neurons. The way these neurons are structured is called a transformer architecture. It is a fairly complex type of neural network. What you should understand is:\n\n1. These AIs are just math functions. Instead of $f(x) = x^2$, they are more like f(thousands of variables) = thousands of possible outputs.\n2. These AIs understand sentences by breaking them into words/subwords called tokens (e.g. the AI might read `I don't like` as `\"I\", \"don\", \"'t\" \"like\"`). Each token is then converted into a list of numbers, so the AI can process it.\n3. These AIs predict the next word/token in the sentence based on the previous words/tokens (e.g. the AI might predict `apples` after `I don't like`). Each token they write is based on the previous tokens they have seen and written; every time they write a new token, they pause to think about what the next token should be.\n4. These AIs look at every token at the same time. They don't read left to right, or right to left like humans do. \n\nPlease understand that the words \"think\", \"brain\", and \"neuron\" are zoomorphisms, which are essentially metaphors for what the model is actually doing. These models are not really thinking, they are just math functions. They are not actually brains, they are just artificial neural networks. They are not actually biological neurons, they are just numbers.\n\nThis is an area of active research and philosophizing. This description is rather cynical about their nature and is meant to temper popular media depiction of AIs as beings that think/act like humans. This being said, if you want to anthropomorphize the AI, go ahead! It seems that most people do this and it may even be helpful for learning.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n- [d2l.ai](https://www.d2l.ai) is a good resource for learning about how AI works\n\n- Please note that the authors do, in fact, enjoy apples. They are delicious.\n\n\n---\nsidebar_position: 4\n---\n\n# 🟢 Few shot prompting\n\nimport FewShot from '@site/docs/assets/basics/few_shot.svg';\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n  <FewShot style={{width:\"100%\",height:\"200px\",verticalAlign:\"top\"}}/>\n</div>\n\n\nYet another prompting strategy is *few shot prompting*(@logan-iv-etal-2022-cutting)(@lake2015human), which is basically just showing the model a few examples (called shots) of what you want it to do. \n\nConsider the above example, in which we are attempting to classify customer feedback as positive or negative. We show the model 3 examples of positive/negative feedback, then we show it a new piece of feedback that has not been classified yet (`It doesnt work!:`). The model sees that the first 3 examples were classified as either `positive` or `negative`, and uses this information to classify the new example as `negative`.\n\nThe way that we structure the examples is very important. Since we have structured these 3 examples as `input: classification`, the model outputs a single word after the final line, instead of saying a full sentence like `this review is positive`. \n",

      "content": "Absolutely, the principles you've outlined are key to understanding how to effectively use GPT-3 and similar models. Let's dive into some of the principles and how they can be used to create more complex and insightful prompts:\n\n1. **Pattern Matching**: GPT-3 is trained to predict the next word in a sentence based on the patterns it has learned from a vast amount of text data. This means it can recognize and generate text that follows similar patterns. This can be used to create prompts that ask GPT-3 to generate text in a specific format or style, or to recognize and analyze patterns in a given text.\n\n2. **Alignment Matching**: GPT-3 can be used to find alignment between different texts, such as matching a grant proposal to the intent of a grant writer. This can be used to create prompts that ask GPT-3 to analyze a text and suggest how it could be aligned with a specific goal or intent.\n\n3. **Role-Playing**: GPT-3 can take on different personas and generate text from their perspective. This can be used to create prompts that ask GPT-3 to critique a text from a specific perspective, and then generate suggestions for how to improve it.\n\n4. **Chain of Thought**: GPT-3 can generate text that follows a logical progression or \"chain of thought\". This can be used to create prompts that ask GPT-3 to develop an idea or argument over multiple steps.\n\n5. **Few-Shot Learning**: GPT-3 can learn from a few examples included in the prompt, a technique known as few-shot learning. This can be used to create prompts that provide examples of the desired output, guiding GPT-3 to generate similar responses.\n\nUsing these principles, we can create more complex prompts that engage GPT-3 in a deeper and more interactive dialogue. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Interactive Scenario Planning with Chain of Thought**: \n\n   *Prompt Example*: \n   ```\n   You are a strategic advisor. Let's simulate a scenario where our nonprofit organization loses 30% of its funding next year. What are some potential impacts and mitigation strategies? Based on your response, I will ask follow-up questions to explore the scenario further.\n   ```\n\n2. **Role-Playing with Alignment Matching**: \n\n   *Prompt Example*: \n   ```\n   You are a potential donor who is skeptical about our organization's impact. I'm a staff member trying to convince you to donate. Let's start the role-play. After each of your responses, I will respond and ask you further questions to explore your concerns and address them.\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterative Project Design with Pattern Matching and Chain of Thought**: \n\n   *Prompt Example*: \n   ```\n   You are a project design expert. I'm planning a new initiative to improve digital literacy in rural communities. Here's my initial plan... (provides plan). What feedback or suggestions do you have? After each of your suggestions, I will revise the plan and ask for further feedback.\n   ```\n\n4. **Interactive Ideation with Few-Shot Learning**: \n\n   *Prompt Example*: \n   ```\n   You are a creative consultant. Let's brainstorm ideas for our next fundraising campaign. I'm thinking of doing a virtual run... What could we add to make it more engaging and unique? After each of your ideas, I will provide feedback and ask for further ideas based on that feedback.\n   ```\n\nRemember, these examples involve more complex interactions with GPT-3 and may require multiple rounds of input and feedback to achieve the desired result. Always review and refine the outputs to ensure they meet your organization's needs and standards.",
