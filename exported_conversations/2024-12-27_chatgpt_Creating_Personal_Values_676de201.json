Let me see if I’m capturing this right:  \n\n1. You value **projects that feel like personal expressions**, where the work reflects who you are.  \n2. You pay attention to **how much freedom you have to explore, experiment, and take risks without fear of being “wrong.”**  \n3. You’re drawn to **work that feels less like a “job” and more like a natural part of your life.**  \n\nDoes that resonate with you? Would you add or tweak anything?",
