We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.\n\nAbout the role:\nAnthropic’s AI technology is amongst the most capable and safe in the world. However, large language models are a new type of intelligence, and the art of instructing and evaluating them in a way that delivers the best results is still in its infancy — it’s a hybrid between research, engineering, and behavioral science. We’re bringing rigor to this new discipline by applying a range of techniques to systematically discover and document prompting best practices, using our models to improve training and evaluation, developing prompt self-improvement techniques to automatically optimize the model’s performance on any given task, , and finding ways of making it easy for our customers to do the same.\n\nGiven that this is a nascent field, we ask that you share with us a specific prompting, model evaluation, synthetic data generation, model finetuning, or application built on LLMs that you're proud of in your application! Ideally this project should show off a complex and clever prompting architecture, or a systematic evaluation of an LLM's behavior in response to different prompts, or an example of using LLMs for a relevant ML task such as careful dataset curation and processing. There is no preferred task; we just want to see how you create and experiment with prompts. You can also include a short description of the process you used or any roadblocks you hit and how to deal with them, but this is not a requirement.\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nDevelop automated prompting techniques for our models (eg extensions to the Metaprompter)\nFinetune new capabilities into Claude that maximize Claude’s performance or ease of use given particular prompting innovations\nLead automated evaluation of Claude models and prompts across the training and product lifecycle\nHelp create and optimize data mixes for model training\nDevelop and systematically test new, creative, and original prompting strategies for a wide range of research tasks relevant to our fine-tuning and end product efforts.\nHelp to create and maintain the infrastructure required for efficient prompt iteration and testing.\nDevelop future Anthropic products built on top of Claude.\nStay up-to-date with the latest research in prompting and model orchestration, and share knowledge with the team.\nYou may be a good fit if you:\n\nHave significant ML research or software engineering experience\nHave at least a high level familiarity with the architecture and operation of large language models.\nHave extensive prior experience exploring and testing language model behavior.\nHave spent time prompting and/or building products with language models\nHave good communication skills and an interest in working with other researchers on difficult prompting tasks.\nHave a passion for making powerful technology safe and societally beneficial.\nStay up-to-date and informed by taking an active interest in emerging research and industry trends.\nEnjoy pair programming (we love to pair!)\nStrong candidates may also have:\nAdvanced degree in computer science, mathematics, statistics, physics, or a related technical field, or an advanced degree in a relevant non-technical field alongside evidence of programming experience.\nExperience with large-scale model training and evaluation.\nLanguage modeling with transformers\nReinforcement learning\nLarge-scale ETL\nRepresentative projects:\n\nBuilding the prompting and model orchestration for a production application backed by a language model\nFinetuning Claude to maximize its performance when a particular prompting technique is used.\nBuilding and testing an automatic prompt optimizer or automatic LLM-driven evaluation system for judging a prompt’s performance on a task.\nImplementing a novel retrieval, tool use, sub-agent, or memory architecture for language models.\nBuilding a scaled model evaluation framework driven by model-based evaluation techniques.\nDeadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. \n\nThe expected salary range for this position is:\n\nAnnual Salary:\n$315,000—$510,000 USD\nLogistics\nLocation-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.\n\nUS visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n\nWe encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.\n\nCompensation and Benefits*\n\nAnthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

So I've been working on a fractal concept parsing tool that will go through sequentially into a text and chunk smaller and smaller pieces, run it into a LLM asking it for the concepts inside of it, and then run all the concepts across all of a piece, and then try to identify the concepts in a document, and then colorize the document by the concepts.

This approach involves using two LLMs in a coordinated process: one to identify new concepts and another to refine its understanding and embeddings based on these new concepts.\n\n### Project: Continuous Fine-Tuning for Concept Identification and Categorization\n\n#### Objective:\nDevelop a system where an LLM continuously fine-tunes itself by incorporating new concepts identified during the text parsing process.

The idea of extracting key concepts, analogies, and ideas from a document and naming them succinctly is quite aligned with the goals of concept extraction and ontology creation. Let's refine this approach to focus on creating a prompt that can distill the essence of a document into clear, memorable concepts, potentially even generating three-letter acronyms (TLAs) where appropriate.\n\n### Steps to Create a Concept Extraction Prompt\n\n1. **Big to Small Analysis**:\n   - Start with the entire document to get the overall context and main themes.\n   - Break it down into chapters or sections, extracting key concepts from each.\n   - Summarize these concepts into TLAs or concise names.\n\n2. **Small to Big Analysis**:\n   - Analyze small sections (paragraphs or sentences) to identify detailed concepts.\n   - Aggregate these smaller concepts to form a comprehensive understanding of larger sections.\n\n3. **Crafting the Prompt**:\n   - Develop a clever prompt that guides the LLM to extract concepts and suggest TLAs or concise names.\n\n### Example Prompt for Concept Extraction\n\nHere's an example of a clever prompt designed to extract key concepts and generate TLAs:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt Template**:\n\n1. **Understanding the Document**:\n   - \"Read the following document carefully. Identify the main themes, analogies, and key concepts. Summarize each key concept in a few sentences.\"\n\n2. **Extracting and Naming Concepts**:\n   - \"From the key concepts identified, create concise names for each. If possible, generate three-letter acronyms (TLAs) that encapsulate the essence of each concept.\"\n\n3. **Big to Small Approach**:\n   - \"First, provide a high-level summary of the entire document, including the main themes and ideas. Then, break down the document into chapters or sections and repeat the extraction and naming process for each section.\"\n\n4. **Small to Big Approach**:\n   - \"Next, analyze smaller sections of the document (such as paragraphs or sentences). Identify detailed concepts and suggest TLAs. Finally, combine these smaller concepts to form a comprehensive understanding of the larger sections.\"\n\n5. **Example**:\n   - \"For example, if the document discusses the concept of 'Sour Grapes,' explain the context and generate a TLA such as 'SGR' if appropriate.\"\n\n---\n\n### Implementing the Prompt\n\n1. **Load the Document**:\n   - Start with a sample document to test the prompt.\n\n2. **Apply the Prompt**:\n   - Use the LLM to process the prompt and extract concepts.\n\n3. **Evaluate and Refine**:\n   - Assess the output and refine the prompt or process as needed.\n\n### Example Implementation in Python\n\nHere’s how you might implement this using an LLM like GPT-3 or GPT-4:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel\n\n# Load tokenizer and model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')\nmodel = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')\n\n# Sample document (shortened for example)\ndocument = \"\"\"\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition. AI is transforming industries with its ability to automate tasks and provide insights.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Constructing the prompt\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nRead the following document carefully. Identify the main themes, analogies, and key concepts. Summarize each key concept in a few sentences.\n\nDocument:\n{document}\n\nFrom the key concepts identified, create concise names for each. If possible, generate three-letter acronyms (TLAs) that encapsulate the essence of each concept.\n\nFirst, provide a high-level summary of the entire document, including the main themes and ideas. Then, break down the document into sections and repeat the extraction and naming process for each section.\n\nNext, analyze smaller sections of the document (such as paragraphs or sentences). Identify detailed concepts and suggest TLAs. Finally, combine these smaller concepts to form a comprehensive understanding of the larger sections.\n\nFor example, if the document discusses the concept of 'Sour Grapes,' explain the context and generate a TLA such as 'SGR' if appropriate.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Tokenize and generate\ninputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs[\"input_ids\"], max_length=500, do_sample=True)\n\n# Decode and print the output\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\n### Expected Output\nThe LLM should output something like:\n\n```\nHigh-level summary:\nThe document discusses artificial intelligence (AI), its applications such as expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition, and its transformative impact on industries through automation and insights.\n\nKey Concepts and TLAs:\n1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) - Simulation of human intelligence by machines.\n2. Expert Systems (ESY) - AI systems that mimic human expertise.\n3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - AI application for understanding and generating human language.\n4. Speech Recognition (SRG) - AI system for recognizing and interpreting spoken language.\n\nDetailed Concept Analysis:\n- AI: Simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.\n- ESY: AI systems designed to emulate human decision-making.\n- NLP: AI techniques for processing and understanding human language.\n- SRG: Technology for converting spoken words into text.\n```\n\nBy refining this approach, you can create a system that iteratively improves its ability to extract and name concepts, providing a robust tool for document analysis and knowledge management.

      "content": "Sure, let's think through this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Embeddings\nEmbeddings are high-dimensional vectors representing the semantic meaning of text. In the embedding space, similar words or phrases are close to each other, while dissimilar ones are farther apart.\n\n### Step 2: Sharp Turns in Embedding Space\nAnalogies often involve a shift from one concept to another that is contextually related but not directly similar. For example, in the analogy \"Life is like a box of chocolates,\" there is a shift from the concept of \"life\" to \"box of chocolates.\" This shift could potentially create a noticeable change in the direction in the embedding space.\n\n### Step 3: Detecting Sharp Turns\nWe hypothesize that when an analogy is introduced, the embeddings of the surrounding text might show a sharp directional change. This can be identified by comparing the vectors of phrases or sentences before and after the potential analogy.\n\n### Step 4: Vector Operations and Cosine Similarity\nTo detect sharp turns, we can use vector operations. The cosine similarity between vectors can measure the angle between them. A significant drop in cosine similarity might indicate a sharp turn, suggesting the presence of an analogy.\n\n### Step 5: Implementing the Detection Mechanism\n1. **Tokenize and Embed Text**: Break the text into manageable chunks (sentences or phrases) and obtain their embeddings.\n2. **Calculate Cosine Similarity**: Compute the cosine similarity between consecutive embeddings.\n3. **Identify Drops in Similarity**: Look for significant drops in cosine similarity, which might indicate a shift in context or the introduction of an analogy.\n4. **Validate and Refine**: Validate the identified segments as analogies and refine the model based on feedback.\n\n### Example Implementation in Python\n\n#### 1. Setup\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\nmodel = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n\n# Function to get sentence embeddings\ndef get_embedding(sentence):\n    inputs = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors=\"pt\", truncation=True, padding=True)\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).squeeze().detach().numpy()\n```\n\n#### 2. Tokenize and Embed Text\n```python\n# Sample document\ndocument = \"\"\"\nLife is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. \nArtificial intelligence is transforming industries with its ability to automate tasks and provide insights.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Split document into sentences\nsentences = document.split('. ')\n\n# Get embeddings for each sentence\nembeddings = [get_embedding(sentence) for sentence in sentences if sentence]\n```\n\n#### 3. Calculate Cosine Similarity\n```python\n# Calculate cosine similarities between consecutive embeddings\nsimilarities = [cosine_similarity([embeddings[i]], [embeddings[i + 1]])[0][0] for i in range(len(embeddings) - 1)]\n```\n\n#### 4. Identify Drops in Similarity\n```python\n# Identify significant drops in cosine similarity\nthreshold = 0.5  # Define a threshold for significant drop\nsharp_turns = [i for i in range(len(similarities)) if similarities[i] < threshold]\n\n# Print identified segments\nfor index in sharp_turns:\n    print(f\"Potential analogy between: '{sentences[index]}' and '{sentences[index + 1]}'\")\n```\n\n### Expected Output\n```\nPotential analogy between: 'Life is like a box of chocolates' and 'You never know what you're gonna get'\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process\n\n1. **Embeddings as Semantic Representation**:\n   - Understand that embeddings capture the semantic essence of sentences.\n   - Analogies involve a context shift that could be noticeable in the embedding space.\n\n2. **Cosine Similarity for Context Shift**:\n   - Use cosine similarity to measure the semantic shift between sentences.\n   - Significant drops in similarity indicate a possible sharp turn in context.\n\n3. **Practical Application**:\n   - Apply this concept to detect analogies by identifying where these sharp turns occur.\n   - Validate and refine the approach to improve accuracy.\n\n### Refining the Approach\n\n1. **Context Window**: Use a sliding window approach to consider larger contexts around each sentence.\n2. **Threshold Tuning**: Experiment with different thresholds to balance sensitivity and specificity.\n3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Incorporate human validation to confirm analogies and refine the model based on feedback.\n4. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously improve the model by incorporating new analogies and contexts.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of known analogies to train and validate the model.\n- **Model Training**: Fine-tune the model specifically for detecting analogies using this dataset.\n- **Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the model’s performance and make adjustments as necessary.\n\nBy following this approach, you can leverage the unique properties of embeddings and cosine similarity to identify analogies effectively, enhancing your TextRay project and potentially contributing to more advanced concept extraction and categorization methods.",

We don't want to compare life to box. We want to compare life to box of chocolates. And so, I would like to figure out how we can go through potentially a level of averaging of the types of embeddings that go from the type of embedding that is for a single character, word, and then all the way up to the sentence and paragraph, and then maybe even compare paragraphs to paragraphs as potentially analogies. And that way, the largest section is a paragraph, and I want to take an average that is still going to be able to show things inside of it. Maybe like multiple layers of averages. Can you think of a different way of doing this to be able to figure out how we can compare life to box of chocolates where one is a smaller token and the other is a larger token, but we still want to see the left turn, the sharp change?",

Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Tokenize the Document at Different Levels**:\n   - Tokenize the document into characters, words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs.\n   \n2. **Generate Embeddings**:\n   - Generate embeddings for each token level (character, word, phrase, sentence, paragraph).\n\n3. **Averaging Embeddings**:\n   - Compute average embeddings at each level.\n   - For example, average embeddings of words to get phrase embeddings, average phrase embeddings to get sentence embeddings, etc.\n\n4. **Comparing Embeddings**:\n   - Compare embeddings at each level to identify significant shifts (sharp turns).\n\n5. **Identify Analogies**:\n   - Use the identified shifts to pinpoint potential analogies.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet’s implement this step by step using Python and the Hugging Face `transformers` library.\n\n#### 1. Set Up Environment\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\nmodel = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n\ndef get_embedding(text):\n    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\", truncation=True, padding=True)\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).squeeze().detach().numpy()\n```\n\n#### 2. Tokenize Document at Different Levels\n```python\ndocument = \"\"\"\nLife is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. \nArtificial intelligence is transforming industries with its ability to automate tasks and provide insights.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Tokenize into sentences\nsentences = document.split('. ')\n\n# Tokenize into words and phrases within each sentence\nword_tokenized_sentences = [sentence.split() for sentence in sentences]\n\n# Define a simple function to create phrases (for simplicity, we'll use 2-word phrases here)\ndef create_phrases(words, n=2):\n    return [' '.join(words[i:i+n]) for i in range(len(words)-n+1)]\n\nphrase_tokenized_sentences = [create_phrases(words) for words in word_tokenized_sentences]\n```\n\n#### 3. Generate and Average Embeddings\n```python\n# Function to compute average embedding for a list of tokens\ndef average_embedding(tokens):\n    embeddings = [get_embedding(token) for token in tokens]\n    return np.mean(embeddings, axis=0)\n\n# Generate embeddings for sentences\nsentence_embeddings = [get_embedding(sentence) for sentence in sentences if sentence]\n\n# Generate and average embeddings for words within sentences\nword_embeddings = [average_embedding(words) for words in word_tokenized_sentences if words]\n\n# Generate and average embeddings for phrases within sentences\nphrase_embeddings = [average_embedding(phrases) for phrases in phrase_tokenized_sentences if phrases]\n```\n\n#### 4. Compare Embeddings\n```python\n# Function to compare embeddings and identify significant shifts\ndef compare_embeddings(embeddings, threshold=0.5):\n    similarities = [cosine_similarity([embeddings[i]], [embeddings[i + 1]])[0][0] for i in range(len(embeddings) - 1)]\n    shifts = [i for i in range(len(similarities)) if similarities[i] < threshold]\n    return shifts\n\n# Compare embeddings at each level\nsentence_shifts = compare_embeddings(sentence_embeddings)\nword_shifts = compare_embeddings(word_embeddings)\nphrase_shifts = compare_embeddings(phrase_embeddings)\n\n# Identify potential analogies based on shifts\npotential_analogies = {\n    \"sentence_level\": [sentences[i] for i in sentence_shifts],\n    \"word_level\": [word_tokenized_sentences[i] for i in word_shifts],\n    \"phrase_level\": [phrase_tokenized_sentences[i] for i in phrase_shifts]\n}\n\nprint(\"Potential Analogies:\", potential_analogies)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Approach\n\n1. **Tokenization**:\n   - The document is tokenized at multiple levels: sentences, words, and phrases.\n\n2. **Embedding Generation**:\n   - Embeddings are generated for each token level using BERT.\n   - For phrases, we generate embeddings for each phrase and compute their average to represent the phrase embedding.\n\n3. **Embedding Comparison**:\n   - We use cosine similarity to compare embeddings between consecutive tokens.\n   - Significant drops in similarity indicate potential analogies or sharp contextual changes.\n\n4. **Identifying Shifts**:\n   - We identify shifts (sharp turns) by looking for drops in cosine similarity below a defined threshold.\n   - These shifts are analyzed at different levels to pinpoint potential analogies.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Fine-Tuning and Validation**:\n   - Fine-tune the model using a dataset of known analogies to improve accuracy.\n   - Validate the approach with a diverse set of documents.\n\n2. **Iterative Improvement**:\n   - Iterate on the model by incorporating feedback and refining the process.\n   - Experiment with different token lengths and embedding aggregation methods.\n\n3. **Visualization**:\n   - Visualize the identified analogies and shifts in a user-friendly manner to aid analysis.\n\nBy following this approach, you can effectively identify analogies and sharp contextual changes in a document using multi-level embeddings and averaging techniques. This method leverages the power of embeddings and cosine similarity to capture nuanced relationships between concepts, enhancing your ability to extract and categorize knowledge.",
