      "content": "That depends on your nationality:  \n\n- **Visa on Arrival:** Turkey used to offer visas on arrival at airports, but for most countries this has been phased out. Now, many travelers need to apply for an **e-Visa online** before arriving (it’s quick and usually approved in minutes).  \n- **Visa-free entry:** Citizens of some countries (e.g. much of Europe, some Latin American countries, Japan, Singapore, etc.) can enter Turkey without a visa for short stays.  \n- **e-Visa requirement:** Citizens of the U.S., Canada, Australia, and many others need to apply online at [https://www.evisa.gov.tr](https://www.evisa.gov.tr) before traveling.  \n- **Visa on arrival still available:** A handful of nationalities (like some Gulf countries) may still be able to purchase a visa on arrival, but it’s always safer to check before flying.  \n\n👉 If you tell me your nationality (passport country), I can check exactly whether you can enter visa-free, need an e-Visa, or can still get a visa on arrival. Would you like me to look that up for your passport?",
