It consists of panel discussions, media advocacy, and awareness sessions aimed at the adoption of green urban planning, promotion of renewable energy, building capacities in environmental management, enhancement of waste management practices, and development of green skills. Moreover, under SAAVI program, Mosul Space collaborated with NRC and the ITC as a key support organization for the SAAVI Tadreeb platform. Which is an innovative initiative aimed at enhancing agribusiness and agri-tech investment readiness in Iraq. This platform focuses on delivering targeted, modular training programs designed to empower youth and women, strengthening their capabilities in the agricultural sector. The Tadreeb platform aims to build a robust ecosystem that supports sustainable agricultural practices and fosters economic independence for Iraqi communities. Furthermore, Mosul Space organized several trainings on the installation and maintenance of Solar Panels and then linked the top graduates with internships opportunities in local companies.\"\t25\tSustainable Construction, Renewable Energy (e.g., Solar Energy), Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship, Technical Skills (e.g., Engineering, Architecture), Soft Skills (e.g., Leadership, Communication), Media, Advocacy\tYes\tYes\tNinewa Governorate\tYes\tYes\t1500000\t95\t40\t15\tYes\t\"Name: Mustafa Waleed\n\nPosition: Operation Manager\n\nYears of Experience: 11\n\nRelevant Qualifications or Certifications: Has a Bachelor Degree in Electrical Engineering and over ten years of experience working on sustainable development projects with Mosul Space, GIZ, and AVSI International.\"\t\"Mosul Space Organization for Development aligns seamlessly with the BEIT project objectives and expected results.

This aligns with BEIT's goal of increasing green affordable housing and decent employment, as we actively contribute to developing skills and creating jobs in sustainable construction.\n\nExpected Result 3: Mosul Space enhances the local business environment by integrating MSMEs into larger networks, providing them with essential skills, and facilitating their participation in the economic landscape, especially in the construction sector. Recently we worked on formalizing the private sector by providing legal coverage for SMEs in Mosul in collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce.

This partnership allows us to extend our impact in these areas, reaching more beneficiaries.\n\nEnhancement of Green Practices: Our involvement in projects like the Oasis program and the Agriculture Innovation Hackathon parallels BEIT's commitment to green housing. By collaborating with BEIT, we can leverage additional expertise and resources to expand these initiatives, promoting sustainable construction practices more broadly.\n\nEmpowerment of Local MSMEs: Supporting local MSMEs is at the core of our mission. BEIT’s emphasis on improving the business environment and integrating local MSMEs into the construction sector complements our ongoing efforts to build capacity and enhance economic participation at the local level.\"\t\"Certainly, here are a few key aspects that highlight Mosul Space Organization for Development's potential role and contributions to the BEIT project:\n\nExtensive Network and Partnerships: Our well-established relationships with local and international NGOs, government bodies, and the private sector enhance our capability to mobilize resources, share knowledge, and foster collaborations that are crucial for the success of large-scale projects like BEIT.\n\nProven Track Record in Project Implementation: We have successfully designed and executed various projects that align with the goals of the BEIT project, such as empowering women-led SMEs, promoting green technologies, and enhancing workforce skills. Our experience in managing donor-funded projects, adhering to stringent reporting and compliance requirements, positions us as a reliable partner for BEIT.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Outreach: We have a strong presence in the community and a deep understanding of the local context, which enables us to effectively engage with and mobilize diverse groups, including vulnerable populations. Our outreach efforts are supported by innovative approaches and technologies that ensure wide participation and engagement.\n\nCapacity Building and Training Expertise: With our comprehensive training programs and capacity-building initiatives, we are equipped to upskill local workers and entrepreneurs, particularly in green construction and sustainable practices, directly contributing to the employment and housing goals of the BEIT project.\n\nInnovation and Technology Utilization: Leveraging our Makerspace and technological resources, we can innovate and provide technical solutions for affordable and sustainable housing, aligning with BEIT’s focus on green affordable housing.\"\tabdulla.thaier@mosulspace.org\t3000\n10/31/2024 8:25:05\tQAF Lab\t\"www.qaflab.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/qaflab.iq\nhttps://www.instagram.com/qaflab/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/qaflab\"\tMaryam Al-Fakhree\tPrograms Manager\t\"Email: maryam.alfakhrey@qaflab.com\nMobile: +964 770 417 6699\"\t2019\tPrivate Company\t32\t6\tNo\t\t20\tRenewable Energy (e.g., Solar Energy), Entrepreneurship, Technical Skills (e.g., Engineering, Architecture), Soft Skills (e.g., Leadership, Communication), Media production, AC and HVAC systems\tYes\tYes\tNinewa Governorate\tYes\tYes\t700000\t80\t30\t20\tYes\t\"Name: Sana Basil Mohammed\n\nPosition: Founder and CEO (Pure Design Studio)\nYears of Experience: 6\nRelevant Qualifications: \n      B.Sc. in Architecture Engineering, University of Mosul, Iraq\n\tMA in Interior Design, Coventry University, UK\n\tCMI: the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) engages with   businesses and academic institutions.\n\"\t\"QAF Lab aligns closely with the BEIT Project’s mission by combining our\nexpertise in climate resilience, innovation, and youth employment.\nThrough initiatives like TAWASOL and partnerships with organizations such as\nCEWAS, we have developed a robust framework that supports job creation,\nespecially for young Iraqis, and empowers MSMEs in high-growth sectors.
