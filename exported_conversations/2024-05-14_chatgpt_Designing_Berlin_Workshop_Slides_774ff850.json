      "content": "I’m working on a presentation for a workshop I'm working on in Berlin, I would like your help in crafting a prompt to send to a graphic designer to help me design a series of around 20 slides to describe and enthuse an audience around our one day Color Analysis workshop. The audience is in Berlin, they have a tech background and may not have the appropriate knowledge for selecting the colours that work well with their skin tone. The company's name is  Remerge and the day will begin with our 20 slide presentation and then individual colour sessions for the rest of the day.\nThe presentation will include some information on the history, colour analysis process, and benefits to overall wellbeing, confidence, unused articles of clothing clogging closets and landfills. Our goal is to excite the team members for their sessions by going over the history beginning with the Johannas Itten from the Bauhaus movement in Germany, and  demonstrating appropriate and inappropriate colour choices chosen by icons online, including the queen, Olivia Coleman, and Julia Roberts (who surprisingly always wears the wrong colour. As well as concluding with takeaways including methods for culling a wardrobe and being generally ecological and awesome.\n\n\nHere is my first slide presentation flow:\nWelcome to Color Analysis\nVisual: Company logo and a vibrant, inviting image related to color (e.g., a color wheel).\nDescription: Brief welcome and overview of the workshop.\nHistory of Color Analysis\nVisual: Portrait of Johannes Itten and images from the Bauhaus movement.\nDescription: Overview of the origins and evolution of color theory.\nInternational Color Theories\nVisual: Artwork or symbols representing Sufi color symbolism, a diagram of chakras with their corresponding colors, an illustration of the five elements with associated colors, and traditional Yoruba art showcasing color use.\nDescription: Highlight key international color theories (Sufi, Indian, Chinese, African).\nCelebrity Color Examples\nVisual: Photos of Keira Knightley, Julia Roberts, and the Queen in different outfits.\nDescription: Show how celebrities use color to enhance their image with visual examples.\nChoosing the Right Colors\nVisual: Side-by-side comparisons of the celebrities wearing suitable and unsuitable colors.\nDescription: Illustrate the impact of wearing appropriate versus inappropriate colors.\nBenefits of Color Analysis\nVisual: Infographic or icons showing increased confidence, wellbeing, and wardrobe efficiency.\nDescription: Discuss how color analysis can boost confidence, wellbeing, and wardrobe efficiency.\nWellbeing and Productivity\nVisual: Visual showing how different colors can affect mood and productivity.\nDescription: Summarize findings on how color affects mood, stress levels, and productivity.\nEcological Benefits\nVisual: Visual showing a cluttered wardrobe versus a curated, eco-friendly one.\nDescription: Discuss how mindful wardrobe choices can reduce environmental impact.\nThe Color Analysis Process\nVisual: Photos or illustrations of the drape and swatch method used by Melissa.\nDescription: Explain the drape and swatch method used in color analysis.\nTransform Your Life with Color\nVisual: Motivational quote related to personal transformation through color.\nDescription: Summarize key points and end with an inspirational quote.\nQuestions & Answers\nVisual: Simple, clean slide encouraging questions.\nDescription: Open the floor for audience questions and provide answers.\nthanks. It's ok, although I'd like to frame the entire presentation around the three impact areas\n1. personal wellbeing and financial wellbeing. \n2. positive business impacts (productivity) and wellbeing at work.\n3. environmental impacts (reduction in landfill waste, consume better) \nthink step by step about how to reorganise the slides with these themes. I'd like to mention it at the start, tell them I the middle and remind them at the end. \nCome up with 3 alternative thematic flows to express this goal and present it in a markdown table \n",
