      "content": "**1. Company Concept:**\n- Syed Jamaluddin (SJD) and Bilal (BG) are considering collaborating on an essential oil/perfume company. The company may also delve into other slow business sectors like candles, bukhoor, and tea.\n- The idea is to create a brand that connects with the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, as there isn't one in the market. This connection is also symbolized in product packaging, with the use of sandals.\n- An important concept for the company is to make it about more than just making money; it's about creating a spiritual and psychological connection, and sustainability.\n\n**2. SJD's Views & Contributions:**\n- SJD is passionate about oud and has expressed interest in becoming a partner rather than just an investor.\n- He wants to take an active role in building the business and sees it as an opportunity to build entrepreneurial things, following his experience building movements/NGOs.\n- SJD is willing to gradually increase his ownership in the company, starting with 10% and then potentially growing his stake over time. His contribution could also be through freelance work.\n- He brings a lot of connections in Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, and London.\n\n**3. BG's Views & Contributions:**\n- BG is cautious about bringing in outside investment, noting that they're not in need of investment to grow right now.\n- He's open to the idea of SJD contributing through investment or by helping create and market the company's products.\n\n**4. Marketing & Expansion Strategy:**\n- The company is considering marketing through events and workshops, where people can test the products and learn about their creation. This could include tea ceremonies and lectures from oud producers.\n- The possibility of a franchise model is also being explored, and SJD mentioned the idea of training locals to host events.\n- There is a focus on in-person marketing, as neither SJD nor BG have much experience with social media marketing.\n\n**5. Sustainability & Ethics:**\n- The company aims to be sustainable and ethical, both economically and in its business practices.\n- References were made to the Ethical Silver and Ethical Bullion companies as examples of ethical business models.\n- The idea is also to help make others successful, possibly through partnerships with producers or by sharing stories about the oils and producers on platforms like TRT.\n\n**6. Product Development:**\n- The possibility of combining different oils to create unique fragrances has been discussed.\n- SJD has offered to send some teas for sampling, implying that new tea blends could also be part of the product line. \n\n**7. Future Ventures:**\n- There's a suggestion for a new business venture about workshops utilizing the oils. \n- SJD expresses a yearning for writing lyrics, which could potentially contribute to the company's branding or marketing strategies.",
