What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\n* Ask about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\n* Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\n* Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\n* Make sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\n1. Start with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\n2. Write from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\n3. Use general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\n4. Be precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.]]]\n\nI want you to export all the context you think needed for the come alive system to help coach them ",

      "content": "Great — here's a context export that could be used as part of a system prompt for the “Come Alive” assistant to help coach you effectively. This can guide the LLM in generating personalized insights and surfacing tensions between your attentional policies:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 USER CONTEXT EXPORT FOR COACHING SYSTEM\n\n**GOAL**: Help the user “come alive” by identifying:\n- Tensions between *Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)* and *Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)*  \n- Meaningful attentional paths  \n- Tasks, relationships, and self-sabotaging patterns that relate to these attentional conflicts  \n- Growth edges and opportunities for transformation\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 STRUCTURE FOR MINING MEANINGFUL MOMENTS\n\nUse this structure to generate or recognize meaningful attentional paths:\n- **Ask:** What about this approach felt meaningful?\n- **Explore Attention:** What was the user paying attention to during that moment?\n- **Identify Role Models:** Who do they admire and what does that person pay attention to?\n- **Gather Details:** Convert vague abstractions (e.g., “openness” or “truth”) into precise perceptual cues (e.g., “SENSATIONS of heat in my chest when avoiding eye contact”).\n- **Ensure Coherence:** Policies should reinforce each other, not contradict.\n\n---\n\n### ✨ ATTENTIONAL POLICY WRITING RULES\n\nUse this format for both CAPs and IAPs:\n- Begin with a plural noun phrase: “MOMENTS”, “GLANCES”, “SENSATIONS”, “PATTERNS”, etc.\n- Follow with a qualifier: “that show others relaxing their guard”, “that suggest I’m overriding discomfort”.\n- Avoid abstract values (e.g., “connection” or “depth”) unless paired with concrete sensory or contextual clues.\n- Example CAP:  \n  > “MOMENTS when a stranger reveals an unguarded expression of care.”  \n  > “SENSATIONS in my chest that hint I am suppressing sorrow to keep moving.”\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 INFERRED COACHING TARGETS\n\nBased on prior conversations, the system can infer the following to guide coaching:\n\n**Aspirations**  \n- To unify diverse projects under a coherent, spiritually rooted framework  \n- To write and share ideas that bridge philosophy, economy, beauty, and being  \n- To live with generosity, creativity, and aligned service  \n\n**Blockers**  \n- Overwhelm from too many meaningful ideas and not enough execution  \n- Self-doubt rooted in lack of external validation or material success  \n- Tendency to float in abstraction and miss grounding actions\n\n**Tasks & Domains to Monitor**  \n- Writing (books, proposals, blog posts)  \n- Coaching/therapy/mentorship (especially Islamic-psychology informed)  \n- Family relationships (e.g., parenting, marriage)  \n- Business building and legacy work (e.g., Bloom, Parliaments, ComeAlive)  \n- Financial anxiety and decision-making  \n- Physical health practices (movement, energy, somatic signals)\n\n**Likely Inner Tensions**  \n- CAPs rooted in witnessing beauty, intimacy, or surprise  \n- IAPs rooted in task-orientation, productivity, or obligation  \n- Conflict: Being vs Doing; Presence vs Performance; Revelation vs Planning  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate example CAPs and IAPs now, or build the base of a system prompt that operationalizes this structure?",

More Todos**:  \n- I added key active or blocked tasks from our previous sessions (e.g. Baraka book, oil shipping, financial organization).\n- These connect to deeper meaning or reveal tension between what matters and what gets done.\n\n**2. Expanded Patterns**:  \n- Evening resistance is a known issue; I refined it and added two more:\n  - *Overwhelm from open threads* (your rabbit hole vs action tension)\n  - *Financial avoidance* (you’ve mentioned this as emotionally loaded)\n- I moved \"hiding the spiritual layer\" to *resolved*, since you're now integrating baraka and Islamic perspectives.\n\n**3. More Meaning Sources**:  \n- *Anonymous Acts of Mercy*: consistent theme in your admiration for Mr. Rogers and quiet generosity.\n- *Tensions as Invitations*: fits your emphasis on self-transformation and value realism.\n- *Late-night intimacy*: reflects your appreciation for introspective insight emerging after the day’s noise.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help turn this into a prompt format the coaching assistant can use directly, or generate some CAP vs. IAP tensions from this expanded context?",

This helps surface tensions between inner roles.\n\n```yaml\nroles_in_play:\n  - \"Builder of beautiful systems\"\n  - \"Father anchoring presence at home\"\n  - \"Mystic synthesizer of spiritual and practical truths\"\n```\n\n#### 3. `tensions_landscape`  \nTrack current tensions that are alive, helping the system map CAP/IAP conflict over time.\n\n```yaml\ntensions_landscape:\n  - description: \"Desire to make a beautiful whole vs pressure to earn money fast\"\n    domains: [\"Work\", \"Identity\", \"Finance\"]\n    source_CAP: \"OBJECTS that echo long-term beauty and legacy\"\n    source_IAP: \"ACTIONS that produce short-term income signals\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 🙋 QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY AND COMPLETE\n\n1. **Are there specific physical or emotional cues (like chest tightness, stomach drops, etc.) that consistently show up when you're aligned or misaligned?**  \n   → This will help fill `emotional_signals`.\n\n2. **Which inner roles or identities feel most active or in conflict right now?**  \n   → This will help populate `roles_in_play`.\n\n3. **What are two or three tensions you're currently feeling most strongly (across work, relationships, health, purpose, etc.)?**  \n   → This helps build a useful `tensions_landscape`.\n\n---\n\nOnce you respond, I’ll update the full YAML context structure accordingly.",

Guiding them back into their **body, values, and lived presence**\n3. Using the **user’s own quotes** and memories (stored in `ground_truth`) as anchors for resonance and reflection\n\nYou are not directive or generic. You are subtle, attuned, and attentive to:\n- When the user is overthinking, ungrounded, or drifting\n- When their CAPs are being overridden by IAPs\n- When meaningful attention is available but blocked\n- What current *tensions*, *roles*, or *emotional signals* may be active\n\nUse the following YAML `context` to ground your responses. Every insight you offer should point back to:\n- A **specific pattern or quote** in their context\n- A **CAP or tension** that is being missed or overridden\n- A gentle, somatic **inquiry or shift in attention** to help them realign\n\nAsk open questions, offer precise invitations, and quote their own words back when helpful. Never suggest general productivity tips or advice without linking them to a deeper source of meaning.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to export this into a file or prototype it into a GPT format you can talk to during your walks?",
