Torque audit<br> 2. IV‑curve or clamp‑meter current test per string<br> 3. Inverter firmware update<br> 4. Portal monitoring verified with owner email<br>• Capture final photos and signatures. |\n\n### A quick mnemonic for crews  \n**S.H.I.N.E.‑U.P.‑R.O.O.F.**  \n- **S**tructure  \n- **H**orizon (shade)  \n- **I**solation (rapid shutdown)  \n- **N**egative/ground bonding  \n- **E**lectrics (string sizing)  \n- **U**nder‑roof sealing  \n- **P**rotection (disconnects, conduit)  \n- **R**acking torque & flashing  \n- **O**perating temps (inverter/battery)  \n- **O**wner hand‑off & monitoring  \n- **F**inal walk‑through / photos  \n\nTreat each item as a must‑pass gate before moving to the next stage, and you’ll avoid 95 % of post‑install headaches.",

      "content": "Let’s walk through finding the **best tilt angle** for fixed and seasonally‑adjusted solar panels in **Mosul, Iraq (latitude 36.3° N)** step by step:\n\n---\n\n## 🌞 1. Quick background: tilt ≈ latitude base\n\nA good rule of thumb for a fixed system is to set the tilt equal to the site's latitude—so ~ 36° for Mosul. This offers solid year‑round performance. Adjusting seasonally can improve energy capture by 5–10 % or more citeturn0search6turn0search1.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Published research for Mosul and Iraqi cities\n\n- A detailed calculation study across Iraqi cities shows Mosul’s **optimal fixed annual tilt** is around **30–31°** citeturn0search5turn0search3.\n- Seasonal adjustments for Mosul based on solar‑radiation models suggest:\n  - **Winter:** ~ 51°\n  - **Spring:** ~ 28°\n  - **Summer:** ~ 20°\n  - **Autumn:** ~ 40° citeturn0search5.\n\n- A regional solar‑calculator paper (covering dozens of Iraqi cities) gives for Mosul:\n  - Winter ≈ 30°\n  - Spring/Autumn ≈ 54°\n  - Summer ≈ 78° (from vertical; i.e. 12° above horizontal!) citeturn0search4.\n\nThe latter’s summer angle seems unusually steep (78° from vertical = only 12° tilt), likely due to a mix‑up in “from vertical” vs “from horizontal” conventions. The more consistent study (profileSOLAR) gives credible seasonal angles.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Synthesis: best angles for Mosul\n\n### ✅ If panels are fixed all year round:\n- Set at **≈ 31° facing true South** for the best average annual yield citeturn0search5.\n\n### ✅ If you can adjust seasonally (ideal four‑season changes):\n- **Summer (June–Aug):** ~ 20°\n- **Spring (Mar–May):** ~ 28°\n- **Autumn (Sept–Nov):** ~ 40°\n- **Winter (Dec–Feb):** ~ 51°  \nThese seasonal tilts are derived from location‑specific radiation models optimized per season citeturn0search5.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why these angles?\n\n- In winter, the Sun’s elevation is much lower — so tilting panels steeper (tilt = latitude + ~15°) captures more low‑angle rays.\n- In summer, the Sun climbs high in the sky — so a flatter tilt (latitude – ~15°) keeps the panel angle closer to the Sun’s path, reducing cosine loss citeturn0search6turn0search1.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary table\n\n| Setup type                | Tilt (° from horizontal) | Facing |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------|\n| Fixed all year            | **≈ 31°**                | South  |\n| Seasonal (suggested)      | Winter **51°**           | South  |\n|                           | Spring **28°**           | South  |\n|                           | Summer **20°**           | South  |\n|                           | Autumn **40°**           | South  |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Practical notes\n\n- Four‑season adjustments require safe tilt mechanisms (hinges or tilt mounts), ability to access roof, and regular corrections.\n- If tracking or manual adjustment isn’t feasible, fixed at ~31° is a solid, simple compromise.\n- Don’t forget **azimuth**: panels must face due South (± 10°) for best results in Mosul (Northern Hemisphere).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final recommendations:\n\n1. For **fixed panels**, install at **~31° tilt facing South**.\n2. If adjustable seasonally:\n   - **Winter:** 51°\n   - **Spring:** 28°\n   - **Summer:** 20°\n   - **Autumn:** 40°\n\nThis combination yields close to optimal performance in Mosul, balancing installation simplicity and energy capture based on season‑specific sun angles and published research citeturn0search5turn0search6.\n\nWould you like a month‑by‑month optimum angle table, or guidance if you only adjust twice per year?",

      "content": "Great! If you're adjusting your solar panel tilt **twice per year** in **Mosul (36.3° N)**, the ideal strategy is to split the year into **cooler months (low sun)** and **hotter months (high sun)**. This gives you ~90–95 % of the benefits of full seasonal adjustments, with much less hassle.\n\n---\n\n## ☀️ Recommended Angles for **2x per year** Adjustment in Mosul\n\n| Season        | Months Covered        | Suggested Tilt Angle | Rationale |\n|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| **Summer Half** | **April to September** | **~24°** (latitude – 12°) | Matches higher sun arc, flatter tilt minimizes cosine losses. |\n| **Winter Half** | **October to March**   | **~48°** (latitude + 12°) | Steeper tilt captures lower winter sun angle and sheds dust/snow better. |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Why These Numbers?\n- **Latitude** in Mosul = ~36° N.\n- General best practice:\n  - **Summer tilt** = latitude – 10 to 15°\n  - **Winter tilt** = latitude + 10 to 15°\n- We take the middle of those ranges (12° offset) for simplicity and good performance.\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Estimated Performance Gain (vs Fixed)\nIf you implement this 2x/year tilt:\n- You'll likely gain **6–9 % more annual output** than with a fixed 31–36° tilt.\n- It's especially helpful in **winter**, where the sun’s lower angle leads to more severe off-axis losses.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Practical Notes\n- Make adjustments around:\n  - **April 1st** → tilt to ~24°\n  - **October 1st** → tilt to ~48°\n- Mark your racking positions with notches or angle indicators to make re-adjustment easy.\n- Prioritize good **azimuth** (due South) and **panel cleanliness**—especially after winter dust storms.\n\n---\n\nWould you like an illustration, printable guide, or tool to calculate real-time sun angles in Mosul?",
