      "content": "can you make some posters using HTML given the interviews and some of the insihts below: [[[insights and quotes from Ahmed: 3. **The Market Fear Phenomenon**\n**Arabic:**\n\"كيفية الدخول في السوق، كيفية؟ كسر حاجز، رهبط، رهبة السوق، ونمطية البناء، يعني اليوم الخريج من يطلع على السوق عنده رهبة يخاف من السوق، كيف يتعامل من السوق؟... أكو أكو حكمة تقول إي أن الخجل يضيع نصف الفرص، فنحن من نريد نقوي جرأة الشخص المقابل حتى نخلي لك يصطاد الفرص بطريقة أسلم وأسرع\"\n**English Summary:** Ahmed identifies a critical issue: graduates experience genuine fear when entering the job market. They don't know how to interact with the market or break through its patterns. He quotes a wisdom saying \"shyness wastes half the opportunities.\" His training focuses on strengthening graduates' courage and confidence so they can \"hunt opportunities\" more safely and quickly. This addresses not just technical skills but the psychological barriers that prevent talented engineers from succeeding.\n4. **The Hidden Job Market Reality**\n**Arabic:**\n\"يعني اليوم انتقل لك ماكو شغل بالسوق ما تمام. أقول لك لا، أكو شغل، لكن أكو ناس ما تعرف تشتغل وأكو ناس ما تعرف تسوق لنفسها... أكو ضعف في التوجيه، أكو ضعف في من يتكفل في هذا المشروع وتطويره، أكو ضعف في التسويق\"\n**English Summary:** Ahmed challenges the common narrative that there are no jobs in Iraq. He insists jobs exist, but identifies three critical weaknesses: people don't know how to work effectively, they don't know how to market themselves, and there's a lack of guidance and mentorship for developing careers. The problem isn't job availability but rather the gap between what employers need and what graduates know how to offer or communicate.\n5. **The Talent Scouting Promise**\n**Arabic:**\n\"شوف رح أكلك رح أقولك أستاذ بلا شغلة، أي شخص متميز ومبدع، راح أسحبه بلا ما أرجع لكم. بس إذا ما متميز المبدع، رح أحاول أوفر له قدر المستطاع، فرص توظيف مع الأصدقاء والمعارف\"\n**English Summary:** Ahmed makes a bold commitment about internships from Bilal's program. He promises to directly hire any trainee who proves exceptional and creative - he'll \"pull them\" without asking permission. For those who aren't quite at that level, he commits to leveraging his network of friends and contacts to find them employment opportunities. This demonstrates both his confidence in identifying talent and his extensive professional network built over 16 years.\n6. **The Recent University Workshop**\n**Arabic:**\n\"آخر تدريب كان هو عن كيفية دمج المهندسين الخريجين حديثي التخرج، كيفية اندماجهم في سوق العمل؟ وكيفية أخذ رصانة تخصصية علمية إم مع معرفة الأسعار، ومتطلبات واحتياجات. القطاع الخاص... كان تقريبا أسبوعين بدعوة وكريمة ناشرها حتى بالإنستغرام، وبصفحتي بدعوة كريمة من كلية جامعة النور\"\n**English Summary:** Two weeks before the interview, Ahmed delivered a workshop at Al-Noor University College focusing on integrating new engineering graduates into the job market. The training covered gaining professional credibility, understanding market pricing, and meeting private sector requirements. He co-presented with Professor Dr. Saad Al-Taan, the engineering dean who was formerly Iraq's embassy attaché. Ahmed promoted this workshop on Instagram, demonstrating his use of social media for professional development initiatives.]]]\n\nYou can make them however easiest for you using HTML, perhaps some shape libraries online, svg? - keep them bold, something inspiring and then a little bit of detail and if you want you can make a div undernearth with\"meta\" information for me, who said it, why it's important, etc",

      "content": "The user wants me to create posters for all interviews, not just Ahmed. They want me to:\n1. Make the whole HTML a poster format\n2. Think about libraries, JavaScript libraries, icons that could help\n3. Make better typography\n4. Work in English for now (they'll translate to Arabic later)\n5. They said the current design doesn't look that pretty, so I need to improve\n\nLet me think about what would make better posters:\n- Better typography libraries (like Google Fonts, typography.js)\n- Icon libraries (Font Awesome, Feather Icons, Heroicons)\n- CSS frameworks for better design (Tailwind CSS)\n- JavaScript libraries for animations or interactions (GSAP, AOS)\n- Better layout and visual hierarchy\n- More modern, clean design\n\nFrom the interviews, I can extract key insights:\n\nFrom Anfal's interview:\n- The parametric design approach combining heritage with sustainability\n- Using Grasshopper for climate-responsive facades\n- The 50+ houses she's designed with insulation\n- Her frustration with clients wanting appearance over function\n- The biophilic design concept\n\nFrom Wifaq's interview:\n- The reverse engineering approach to problems\n- The power shift in consumer awareness (2018)\n- The policy paper idea for government subsidies\n- The connection between temperature and divorce rates\n- The vision for Mosul's 7km expansion\n\nFrom Laith's interview:\n- Trust is everything in Mosul's market\n- The visual feedback concept for architects\n- Combining heritage with modern sustainability\n- The fear graduates have entering the market\n- Using interior gardens in 150sqm homes\n\nLet me create a more beautiful, modern poster system.You're right - let me create a much more beautiful poster system! Here's a modern approach using better libraries and design:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\"

Let me look through the interview for other key insights from Anfal.\n\nFrom Anfal's interview, here are some other powerful insights:\n1. Her experience with actually building a 3D printed climate-responsive mashrabiya prototype for $250\n2. The fact that in hot climates, people know they need roof insulation - it's \"تحصيل حاصل\" (a given)\n3. Her frustration that after completing her innovative master's project, she felt discouraged because the market wasn't ready\n4. How she had to work independently because offices wouldn't let her implement sustainable ideas\n5. The insight about washing walls daily - how Mosul's culture of daily floor/wall washing drives material choices\n\nI think the most powerful one would be about the universal demand for roof insulation - it shows market readiness exists.Here's the Arabic version with a new insight from Anfal replacing \"Parametric Heritage\":\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">\n<head>\n

**Arabic numerals**: Using Eastern Arabic numerals (٠١، ٠٢، etc.)\n4. **Cultural adaptation**: The quotes and insights are properly translated to maintain their impact\n5. **New Anfal insight**: Replaced \"Parametric Heritage\" with the powerful insight about universal roof insulation demand - \"السطح تحصيل حاصل\" (roof insulation is a given)\n\nThe poster maintains the visual design quality while being culturally and linguistically appropriate for Arabic readers.",

Her experience with actually building a 3D printed climate-responsive mashrabiya prototype for $250\n2. The fact that in hot climates, people know they need roof insulation - it's \"تحصيل حاصل\" (a given)\n3. Her frustration that after completing her innovative master's project, she felt discouraged because the market wasn't ready\n4. How she had to work independently because offices wouldn't let her implement sustainable ideas\n5. The insight about washing walls daily - how Mosul's culture of daily floor/wall washing drives material choices\n\nI think the most powerful one would be about the universal demand for roof insulation - it shows market readiness exists.",

**Typography**: Tajawal for headers (modern Arabic), IBM Plex Sans Arabic for body, Amiri for quotes (classical Arabic serif)\n2. **RTL Layout**: Proper right-to-left direction and alignment\n3. **Arabic numerals**: Using Eastern Arabic numerals (٠١، ٠٢، etc.)\n4. **Cultural adaptation**: The quotes and insights are properly translated to maintain their impact\n5. **New Anfal insight**: Replaced \"Parametric Heritage\" with the powerful insight about universal roof insulation demand - \"السطح تحصيل حاصل\" (roof insulation is a given)\n\nThe poster maintains the visual design quality while being culturally and linguistically appropriate for Arabic readers.",
