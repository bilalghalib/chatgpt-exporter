      "content": "Here’s what I found on how entity[\"software\", \"Claude\", 0]’s usage limits work — including how you can check how much you have left and when your limit resets. Some details are clear; others are somewhat opaque.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ What we *do* know  \n- In the Help Centre article “Usage Limit Best Practices”, Claude says that for paid plans (Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise), you can go to **Settings → Usage** to view your progress-bars showing:  \n  - how much you’ve used of your **current session (5-hour window)**  \n  - how much of your **weekly usage limit** you’ve used. citeturn0search1  \n- Also from the article: the weekly limit reset is stated for “Opus only and all other models” separately in the usage section (i.e., the weekly cap applies across models) citeturn0search1  \n- From the “About Claude’s Max Plan Usage” article: The Max plan offers much higher usage, but still *does* have weekly and monthly caps as needed. citeturn0search2  \n- From a FAQ site: “Weekly caps: reset every 7 days … Check via `/usage` command in Claude Code or Settings → Usage in Claude apps.” citeturn0search3  \n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ What is *not* clearly specified (or is variable)  \n- I couldn’t find a public document that states **exactly how many hours or how much “usage” (e.g., time, tokens, messages)** is the weekly cap for your specific plan.  \n- It’s unclear exactly *when* the weekly period starts/ends for your account (for example “Monday midnight” vs “7 days from your last reset”).  \n- Some community reports suggest the weekly cap may be **per account** and resets 7 days after starting, rather than synchronized to calendar weeks. citeturn0search7turn0search3turn0search5  \n- Users report that different models (Opus vs Sonnet) consume your weekly allowance differently, so “how much left” depends on which model you’re using. citeturn0search0turn0search7  \n\n---\n\n### 🔍 What *you* should check to figure out how much you have left  \nHere’s what you can do:\n\n1. Log into your Claude account (web or application).  \n2. Go to **Settings → Usage**.  \n   - There should be a section showing your current session usage (5-hour window) and your weekly usage. (Help article says you’ll see this for paid plans). citeturn0search1  \n3. Check the session expiry: If you’ve been warned “Approaching weekly limit”, it may also show how much usage remains in that weekly cap.  \n4. If you’re using the command-line/Claude Code version, you may be able to run a command like `/usage` to get your usage stats. citeturn0search3turn0search5  \n5. To figure out when the weekly cap resets: \n   - Note the time when your weekly usage bar was last reset (or when you first used a session after a reset).  \n   - If it seems you hit the reset exactly 7 days later (or something close) then your “week” is likely a rolling 7-day window from reset.  \n6. Monitor how your usage of different models (Sonnet vs Opus) affects your bar — if one model consumes more usage, you may want to optimise (e.g., use Sonnet when possible).  \n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Some extra advice (given your heavy research/work context)  \nSince you use Claude for substantial work (research, writing, maybe using large attachments), you may want to:\n\n- **Track your usage manually** for a week: note the time you start, how many messages/attachments you send, and when you get the “approaching limit” message. Use that to estimate how much “budget” you have in practice.  \n- **Batch tasks**: Instead of many small chats, group related tasks into fewer sessions to reduce overhead. The Help article recommends this. citeturn0search1  \n- Use projects (upload large documents once) rather than repeatedly uploading them, which the article says can reduce usage consumption. citeturn0search1  \n- Consider switching models or changing how you use attachments if you’re hitting limits often.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can check for **your specific seat/plan** (e.g., Pro vs Max) what exact weekly limits users are reporting *right now*, what the reset times are, and whether there’s a clear scheduler.
