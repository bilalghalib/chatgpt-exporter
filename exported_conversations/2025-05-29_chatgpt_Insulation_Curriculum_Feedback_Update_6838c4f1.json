I guess to point out that wealthy people might need to be sold to differently because they don't care how much they pay for electricity, they might be more convinced about the health benefits or...\n\nwhat data? how do we collect the data in a way that builds credibility?\n\nyay day 5 we got the financial literacy plan in there\n\nWhat can we do for day five evening, this is where they should be getting certified, we need to be able to assess them for some practical things, and to connect them to the job market, i had intended to have professionals come and review their work, although it's different than the solar training, there's no one thing to do, i wonder how to do this best, ideas? \n\nDay 6 homeowner is the person themself or their father, the idea is to design the best intervention for your home and perhaps to \"be sold on it\" yourself. It might be interesting to allocate 500$ to be used for home insulation improvements for the participant with the highest scores, most engagement, best design, not sure what else could be nice to use so there's some competition and we allocate 250$ for the top 3 participants to do an actual install? or 500 and 250 for #2\n\nDay 6 is optional so we can't put the certification in it. the actual client is the person themself or people close to them they can access their homes (privacy is a big deal, not everyone can go to anyone's home)\n\ni like the alumni network whatsapp feedback from senior practitioners the trainer is that person, although it'd be nice to have more folk\n\nthere i sno interest in mosul, it's ofrbidden so we don't put it on the Financial literacy exam, roi, business model concepts, \n\nOk, here's my feedback, review, think about how to address each element in 2-3 orthogonal ways pick the best one and then update the document in full\n]]]",

I don't see that element represented in the 3rd part of the day regularly, i sort of have this idea that each day they deepen and expand their sheet so initially they only have ROI for one, and then all of them. then the ROI starts including thigns other than financial, then we talk about the two main (no need for 3) kinds of customers, price sensitive and price insensitive - and it means we focus on different ROI\n\nThen we also want them to figure out things like BOM, costs for labor, time estimation, othe rbusiness expenses and make a financial model and business model for a potential business, how many of each would they need to do a month, how mnay people are in mosul, the north of iraq, etc how can they find them/market? what would they like hteir nieche to be, which of the different interventions, does it make business sense, what investment do they need to start, can the training organization provide shared tool library (i think so) \n\nfor any research please add references 2024 NTU study. what's an anemometer and do we talk about the potential ROI of rooftop venting, it's an underutilized thing in mosul \n\ni guess i do see you've set up the last part of the day to be business related not bad \n\nThe point of attending the clients wedding was to say, if you do a quality job with high standards, you will have a long life as an installer and word of mouth grows \n\nI would like to add an optional blower door assessment (depending on if we can get one) \n",

I’ve re-worded accordingly. |\n| **Roof-assessment ‘warranty documents’?** | We mean the **manufacturer’s coating or membrane warranty** sheets that state adhesion/reflectivity guarantees (e.g., “Cool-Roof X – 5 yr adhesion, 80 % initial SRI, ≤ 5 pt loss in 3 yr”). The checklist now asks trainees to *photograph or scan* those sheets. |\n| **Daily Business / ROI work felt hidden** | The **Business Lab block** is still there each day, but I’ve made it explicit that they *open and extend the same Google-Sheets ROI workbook* every afternoon. |\n| **Customer archetypes** | Renamed to **Price-Sensitive** and **Price-Insensitive (Comfort-Driven)** to mirror your wording. |\n| **BOM, labour, time, expenses** | Added a “Mini-P&L line-item table” inside Day 3 & Day 5 Business Labs. |\n| **Rooftop-vent ROI & anemometer** | Day 4 now includes a quick-calc worksheet: *vent airflow (m³/h) × ΔT × hrs_off_generator × fuel_cost* ➜ Dinar savings. Added one-line anemometer explanation right in the agenda, not just glossary. |\n| **Phase-2 installs for everyone** | Text now clarifies: *all participants may earn Phase 2 certification by self-funding an install; micro-grant just makes it easier for the top three.* |\n| **Blower-door option** | Already present; cross-referenced in Day 1 Studio block and in Tools Glossary. |\n\n---\n\n## 2 — Patch Notes (copy-replace in your master document)\n\n### **Table 1 – Learning Objectives (small edits)**\n```diff\n@@ Day 4 Learning Objectives\n- Design cross- & roof-vent strategies; estimate rooftop-vent ROI (fan-off hours/year)\n+ Design cross- & roof-vent strategies; estimate rooftop-vent ROI with anemometer-based airflow calc\n```\n\n### **Daily Rhythm pre-header (wording tweak)**\n```diff\n- Information (I) → Project Studio (S) → Business Lab (B)\n+ Information (I) → Project Studio (S) → Business / Customer Lab (B)\n```\n\n### **Day 4 – Air Sealing & Venting (Business Lab row)**\n```diff\n- Assemble photos, graphs, vent ROI; match message to customer type.\n+ Extend ROI sheet with vent-savings tab (airflow × ΔT × run-hours); attach anemometer readings; craft customer-type pitch.\n```\n\n### **Phase 2 paragraph (clarity)**\n```diff\n- Execute installation funded by grant or self-financed.\n+ Any participant may complete an installation (micro-grant winners funded, others self-finance) to qualify for Phase 2 certification.\n```\n\n### **Appendix C – Roof-Assessment Checklist (replace)**\n```markdown\n**Appendix C – Roof-Assessment Checklist (v2)**\n- Substrate cleanliness: □ Pass □ Fail\n- Standing/ponding water zones noted (m²): _______\n- Expansion joints condition OK? □ Yes □ No\n- Tile removal area (m²): _______\n- **Warranty doc captured?**  □ Photo □ PDF  (Brand/Term: ____________)\n- Compatible primer required? □ Yes □ No\n- Solar-ready conduit present? □ Yes □ No\n```\n\n### **Appendix D – Data Collection Protocol (extract)**\n```diff\n- Orthogonal photos: straight-on, perpendicular to surface (roof, wall, vent).\n+ Straight-on (orthogonal) photos: camera 90 ° to roof/wall/vent–no tilt.\n```\n\n### **Tools Glossary (anemometer line)**\n```markdown\n**Anemometer**: hand-held vane measuring air-speed (m/s) to quantify roof-vent or cross-vent airflow for ROI sheet.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3 — Version Stamp  \n> **Insulation Training Curriculum – Revision 2.2 (29 May 2025, 21:45 CET)**  \n\nNo canvas update was triggered per your request; just slot the green-highlighted patches into the live doc.  \nLet me know if anything else needs tightening!",
