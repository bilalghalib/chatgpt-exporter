In that moment, tears welled up - a complex mixture of joy, worry about his future with wars raging in Palestine, wonder, and love. The thought arose clearly: this one moment is enough for a life to be worth having lived. All the difficulty, the joy, the learning, the travel, the writing - this single moment of direct knowing contained everything. This is what The Way feels like - when the knowing self moves into action, a sense of doing without doing, what the Taoists call wu wei.\n\nIn an era where Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform education and knowledge acquisition, this moment of direct knowing raises profound questions about how we learn, what we know, and who we become through the process of learning. For nearly a decade, I've been building systems to help people learn about knowledge landscapes through educational assessments. While marginally better than giving someone access to Wikipedia and suggestions to \"google it,\" these database models of education miss something crucial - they can't support goal reflection and articulation, don't know your blindspots, can't explain things by walking backward from where you want to go to your current level of knowledge.\n\n## The Crisis of Modern Knowing\n\nThe sense of love and joy when I'm with my baby, or the amazement when seeing dolphins in the ocean - isn't interpreted. Somehow it's clear, yet if people asked, I couldn't defend it. In our modern world, this makes these ways of knowing lesser than the \"more correct\" answers about evolutionary adaptation or survival mechanisms in a hostile world. We face a crisis of knowledge where our most meaningful experiences are considered the least valid, where trust in direct experience has been replaced by fear and the need for constant interpretation.\n\nConsider how this plays out in the history of human understanding. For centuries, astronomers observed the peculiar motion of planets in the night sky - sometimes appearing to move backward in their journey across the heavens. This \"retrograde motion\" demanded explanation. The transmitted knowledge that Earth was the center of the universe forced scholars to create increasingly complex mathematical models. They added circles within circles, epicycles upon epicycles, performing intellectual gymnastics to preserve their fundamental assumption. It wasn't until we allowed ourselves to see differently - to consider that perhaps we weren't the center - that a simpler, more elegant truth emerged.\n\n## Time, Presence, and Natural Rhythm\n\nClock time is one where the tick-tocking determines life, versus one where we might be more connected to natural rhythms and the implications it has on integrating one into a dynamic with the world. Seeing the sun setting, knowing the work day is done versus watching a clock slide to 5pm and jumping for joy. The entrainment we get into with clocks dictating our days is harsh and sharp versus the gradual feeling of waking up groggy at dawn and booting up over the course of an hour as the sun slowly starts warming the earth.\n\nAs we connect more to the cycles of life - harvest seasons, planting seasons, resting seasons, acting seasons - I believe we get into more harmony and less tick-tock investment return thinking. \"I paid x for this and it's been 12 months and I expect a 5 percent annual return\" versus planting, praying, abundance, sharing. There's a relationship between time and presence and gifts and abundance, and clock time and forethought/planning/projection and earning and extracting.\n\n## The Architecture of Trust\n\nThere are minds built differently than our modern consciousness allows us to imagine. I remember a story of a sheikh who was in a car accident where the driver was killed. The person in the backseat jumps out and rushes to the window where the sheikh was sitting, blood dripping from his face, desperately asking if he's OK. The sheikh simply says \"I am ok, God be praised, I have set my intention and prayed my istikhara prayer, requesting permission and blessings for this car journey.\" The idea that someone can be in an urgent situation like this and remain calm because of a foundational belief that they are in the care of a most Merciful Lord makes me wonder what it would be like to inhabit a mind like that. What would the world be like if we had even 1% of the population with eyes that see the world like that?\n\nThis sort of trust creates a new ground of being that connects us beyond time and presence to the ultimate, and in that grounding, we can pour forth in this world all our gifts without fear of loss.\n\n## Ethical Development and the Role of Friction\n\nKnowing what is beautiful and Good is one thing - it fills the heart with song. I want to give time to visit a sick person, then there's the effort of going and clearing the snow off the car and driving to the hospital, buying flowers, and spending time with the person. That process is effortful; there's friction there. You choose to become the goodness that you imagined.\n\nIn the light of oneness, this friction sands down the self-absorbed, individuated part of you that would rather want for itself - coffee from that fancy shop rather than flowers for that person, sleep in your warm bed rather than scraping snow off the car. The self-absorbed self is shrunk every time we prioritize beauty and goodness. The process of doing this enacts beauty and goodness and makes it a reality in the world.\n\nI was once in a refugee camp in Syria where I was given the most delicious meal I had in months. The desire to be generous to guests, the hospitality culture, reveals something fundamental about trust and gift-giving. The (non-intellectuated) thought that \"I have received so I will give\" creates a different kind of social reality. It's critical that the gift doesn't become a transaction - this is related to the disindividuating practices.\n\n## Learning in the Age of AI\n\nLLMs can transform education along the same vector previous technologies have, making it more accessible, personalized and relational. In the Middle Ages, a prince may have had a tutor, in the Industrial Era the printing press made books accessible to those with disposable income, later cultural innovations like the Public Library brought access to more people, the internet brought searchability with database queries, Wikipedia, Brilliant and YouTube brought multi-modal and social learning to our pockets.\n\nYet we must be careful not to create systems that further separate us from direct knowing and ethical development. When college dropouts can build technologies that transform the world before they have learned how to mourn the loss of their parents, or raise a toddler with patience and love, we must question our direction. The metrics might be the problem - coming up with a measure takes away from the quality of creating the situation of beauty.\n\n## The Way Forward\n\nThe shift in thinking is to focus on our purification and action and creating situations for this rather than thinking about systems and metrics only to intervene strategically. The most strategic thing to do is to make real Goodness and beauty. This makes it... real.\n\nSuccess should be in every step for a king, president and shop owner. Success is in right action at the right time derived from right seeing. These, in aggregate, create a more beautiful world, although it doesn't matter. What matters is that we become beautiful in trying, that we make real the possibility of beauty and trust in a world increasingly structured around fear and extraction.\n\nLLMs and AI can either continue to be designed and marketed towards becoming your \"assistant\" or they can be designed and marketed towards becoming your assistant and coach. They can help you do. Or they can help you do things you never thought possible. We have a choice in how we develop and use these technologies - whether they will further separate us from direct knowing or help us bridge the gap between where we are and who we might become.\n\nThe Way is not a path to follow but a reality to create, moment by moment, choice by choice, in the eternal now where all possibility resides.\n</antArtifact>\n\nWould you like me to analyze this draft for areas that need strengthening or clarification? I can also suggest sections that might benefit from additional examples or deeper exploration.",
