            "extracted_content": "Constitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP"

You've shared some interesting observations about IAPs (Instrumental Attentional Policies) and raised important questions about their unconscious nature and relationship to meaning.\n\nFrom reviewing both the document and your observations, I can synthesize a structured definition:\n\nAn IAP (Instrumental Attentional Policy) is:\n1. A pattern of attention and behavior driven primarily by external pressures, anticipated consequences, or conditioned responses\n2. Characterized by:\n   - Focus on a specific, narrow outcome (staying alive, keeping a job)\n   - Attention split between the action and monitoring its effectiveness\n   - Willingness to automate or delegate if possible\n   - Rationale based on clear cause-and-effect reasoning\n   - Often accompanied by catastrophizing thoughts or anxiety\n   - May operate unconsciously or become habitual over time\n\nRather than calling it a \"not source of meaning,\" we might more accurately describe it as a \"pressure-response pattern\" or \"instrumental behavior loop.\" The key distinction is that IAPs:\n\n1.

            "extracted_content": "this one resonates as a source of meaning although where difference elements can come together beautifully is what i might say \nmoments when setting up enables organic flourishing, it's about things happening and seeing people light up ina. context and finding themselves in new inspiring giving situations connecting with themselves and others - like in a hackersapce and seeing a kid with an angle grinder, i love the ridiculousness too, haha, and the idea that who knows what this means about a more unique and different future. If these situations were allowed to happen (kid with angle grinder) maybe we'll have new kinds of metal art as the kid makes things as a teenager instead of the standard give a kid a guitar thing. this idea that the future will be weirder, and likely more beautiful than i can imagine because we're creating different starting conditions and chuckling about being a part of the weird beauty is also important to me :) so diversity is important in that regard and why creating these spaces where difference can meet, sort of acknowledging that today sort of \"sucks\" - peopel goto school and go to college get a job and then are unhappy instead of finding themselves and their gifts and having space to explore thesmelves each other the world and showing possibilities and new affordances!\ni feel hopeful, joyous, mischievous, sort of passively humble happy to be a part and not a part of that persons growth and destiny - i can't take too much credit, or any at all, it's a weird emotion that is sort of a block for me too because my work is to create these environments with my social enterprise accelerator bloom, or in my workshops, or in my work supporting the developments of hackerspaces and makerspaces internationally i have never felt like i did anything because i'm in the background, so i feel backgrounded? happily useless? I remember going to the hackerspace All Hands Active in Michigan many years after starting it and realizing they don't remember me and there was so much awesome stuff happening I sort of was happy and sad and it was a meaningful moment :) Identify more from this conversation perhaps and let's move onto the pattern - maybe the guilt pattern of feeling useless or like I did nothing with my life... it's been so hard to write about my work or talk about my \"professional expereince\" because so often I feel unsuccessful and even more so when people take my setups and start businesses, get married, and grow beyond what I can. I tell myself I'm a \"happy mother bird\" watching the kids fly, yet there's a sadness there too. and then when I dont' have a lot of money and they do, I sort of feel like, shucks, I should have taken a stake in their business or something, haha, although I'm supported by a lot of good will around the world, so that's a perk. Recently though I've been even more behind the scenes supporting the bloom team which supports the teams in our program, so it's fewer people even. And then as Bloom looses funding because of international development money shifting to ukraine. and the warn in palestine I find myself looking for other jobs and feeling like, who am i, what have i done, how do i update my professional profile, i never cared about professional profile till i had a baby and a house and a startup business training project (bloom.pm) in Lebanon that's leaking staff and has no money and only one small program in Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan and with the syrian diaspora today. I think there are some interesting elements here, if you need to ask questions follow the process of the values card generation that i shared with you to ensure you ask the right questions to evoke the right responses to build the right source of meaning cards, both CAPs - and IAPs, a source of doing? or source of triviality? It's not a source really, it's the forces of stasis? Or how do non meaningful actions start to get embedded? I sort of feel like there are some unseen elements like Catastrophizing thinking that if i lose my job i'll be poor, hungry, on the streets, no one loves me, .... I will die (this is likely at the end of lots of these) and otherwise patterns set up pavolvianly with no thought what so ever, doing duolingo and mantaining a streak, there's some sort of instrumental goal, ooh look at the number going u pand to ther right, and there was probably some sort of original CAP way back when when you downloaded the language learning app, although it's long forgotten and doesn't touch base when you do the action. I guess we're talking a lot of actions and not attentional policies, I guess because these things are unconcious. I wonder if the IAPs we're talking about might need to account for the automatic and/or unconcious behaviors - it might be something we can only derive in hindsite, for instance when I'm hyperfocusing I don't \"know\" I am, because I'm all in there so focused, and when I get in a rabit hole on wikipedia researching I'm lost so it's hard to be able to talk and express what I'm attending to, maybe there's something there to understand what does it imply and mean for our system and is there something about this that makes it stronger? Here's what Joe Edelman says about Instrumental APs;\n\n\nThank you for this rich sharing. Let me try to derive a few sources of meaning (values cards) following the proper process, and then we can look at the patterns.\n\nFirst, let me ask about the context creation element:\n\"When you see someone light up in a context you helped create - like the kid with the angle grinder - what specifically are you paying attention to in those moments?\"\n\nAlso, about the background role:\n\"In those moments when you're witnessing growth you helped enable but aren't directly involved in, what exactly catches your eye or heart? What specific things do you notice?\"\n\nThose questions are aimed at getting precise focus words and guidance sentences.\n\nYour sharing suggests a fascinating tension between two potential sources of meaning:\n\nCreating conditions for emergence/growth\nWitnessing unique unfolding/development\nBut before mapping the tension pattern, I want to ensure we get the attention policies precisely worded.\n\nCould you share more about what specifically you're attending to when you:\n\nNotice a space is working as intended\nSee someone discovering their unique path\nWitness unexpected connections forming\nThis will help us craft proper attention policies with clear FOCUS words (like MOMENTS, SPACES, OPPORTUNITIES) and specific guidance about what to notice.\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nOkay. So I wanna see someone light up. I'm paying attention to my feelings of surprise, awe, excitement, curiosity, wonder, a little bit of danger and the fear that comes from, like, wonder if you'll set this place on fire, but that's cool. And on edge Feeling Maybe what other people think. And see. Like, people think this is crazy. That's crazy. That's awesome. The sparks that fly the unlikeliness of this scenario, Yeah. Yeah. I see how they're doing well, and they're growing, and I'm happy. Do well and grow. And also happy to have trusted in the process of creating these situations and being patient and knowing and just believing and then the happiness that comes from surprise and the joy and the wonder and the awe that I can trust my deeper intuitions about 1, Is a good and beautiful situation. And also maybe in God and realizing, like, connecting people to their humanity. Nature and all the possibilities that god has put in us. Making it more possible. So seeing beauty and in belief You're not supposed to ask what I'm attending to. When you're getting value Claude, by the way. But what I'm attending to when the space is working is that there's unexpected stuff situations that I couldn't possibly imagine or design. Yeah. People talking about things that I appreciate. For instance, someone came to visit all transactive hackerspace. He left calling it the world's friendliest hackerspace. And I was like, I'm proud That my value of kindness is showing up through the kind of space that I promoted in the initial conditions of the people and the the hugs that we gave So when I see someone discovering their unique path, it's like I'm so glad that I could be apart of that. And I feel in some way that I am and I'm glad that we have more people on the side of Good. You know? There's another one. You know, unexpected connections. Just dislike mischievous, grinning humor of, like, I know what's possible. When this unlikely thing happens, and it's likely gonna be surprising and good. Exciting is better than the status quo. So let's go.\n\n\nLet me try to derive a source of meaning from this, following the proper process and focusing on concrete attention points:\n\nyaml\n\nCopy\ntitle: \"Sacred Emergence Witnessing\"\ncontext: \"When creating and witnessing spaces where unlikely beauty unfolds\"\nattention_policies:\n  - focus: \"MOMENTS\"\n    guidance: \"where unexpected combinations light up new possibilities\"\n  - focus: \"EXPRESSIONS\"\n    guidance: \"of surprise and wonder when someone discovers their capacity\"\n  - focus: \"SITUATIONS\"\n    guidance: \"where initial conditions enable unpredictable flourishing\"\n  - focus: \"SPARKS\"\n    guidance: \"of connection between unlikely elements meeting\"\nBefore I continue deriving more, could you validate:\n\nAre these truly what you're attending to?\nAre the FOCUS words concrete enough?\nIs the guidance specific about what to notice?\nI see another potential source of meaning around trust in the process/divine unfolding. Should I explore that with some questions about what specifically you attend to when you notice that operating?\n\nAlso, I notice emotional markers that might signal tension patterns:\n\nJoy/wonder when witnessing emergence\nBackground happiness with hint of loss when seeing growth beyond you\nMischievous excitement about enabling unlikely connections\nAnxiety/self-doubt when trying to claim professional impact\nWould you like me to:\n\nRefine this first source of meaning?\nExplore the trust/divine connection source?\nStart mapping the tension pattern between visible impact and background enablement?\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\n2 3\n\n\nLet me explore the trust/divine connection source first with some questions:\n\nWhen you mentioned \"trusting my deeper intuitions\" and \"connecting people to their humanity, nature and all the possibilities that God has put in us\" - could you tell me about a specific moment when you felt this trust validated? What exactly were you paying attention to?\n\nFor the tension pattern between visible impact and background enablement, I'm seeing a potential CAP/CAP tension. But first, let me confirm:\n\nThe conflict seems to emerge when:\n\nYou're witnessing beautiful growth you helped enable\nProfessional/practical needs arise to \"prove\" impact\nThis creates tension between your natural way of operating (background enablement) and external demands for visible achievement\nDoes this capture the tension point? If so, could you share a specific moment when you felt this tension most acutely? What were you attending to in that moment?\n\nThis will help us:\n\nDefine the second source of meaning clearly\nDocument the pattern tension accurately\nIdentify the specific competing attention policies\n[Note: Aiming to get precise attention policies rather than abstract concepts or feelings]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nI guess when I see that what I believe in in terms of open spaces of creativity and play in curiosity and connection and humanity inspires people to join a volunteer to give hundreds and thousands of hours by now to support a nonprofit space that is helping people get back to their hands and their humanity and their creation and to share right we start often with these sharing nights and that communication through material through space is just beautiful he has external demands. Yeah it's sort of external demands. What are the instrumental attention policies here and the emotions related to it it's like fear that I won't get a job or making enough money or be seen as succes and how these relate to the way Joe was describing IP's yeah and so the tension point is recent like I'm trying to put something up on LinkedIn. People ask me for a bio and I'm like I'm just a guy I do stuff. That's it.

Sources of Meaning (formerly CAPs):\n- More clearly defined structure with title, context, description\n- Attention policies focused on noticing emergence and enabling growth\n- Clear ties to intrinsic values and meaning\n\n2. Context Driven Operational Policies (formerly IAPs):\n- Renamed to better reflect their nature as responses to external pressures\n- Added explicit trigger conditions\n- Operational policies focused on measurable outcomes and visible results\n- Clear connection to survival needs and social pressures\n\n3. Patterns:\n- Now specifically map tensions between meaning sources and operational policies\n- Include emotional markers as key indicators\n- Focus on manifestation in specific contexts\n- Include potential resolutions that honor both sides\n\n4. Resolution Approaches:\n- Look for ways to integrate meaningful attention with practical needs\n- Create new policies that serve both meaning and operation\n- Find ways to translate between different modes of attention\n\nWould you like me to:\n\n1. Develop more specific pattern examples using this updated model?\n2. Explore how multiple CDOPs might interact with a single source of meaning?\n3. Look at how to identify and work with pattern manifestations in practice?",
