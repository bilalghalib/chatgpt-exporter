Alomari* Dr. N. T. Alqimaqche*\n*Faculty Members in Mosul University - College Of Engineering - Department Of Architecture\nKEYWORDS: Sustainable architecture, Islamic principles of sustainability, Islamic regulations, Built\nenvironment\nABSTRACT:\nSustainable development may be defined, from an Islamic point of view, as a multi-dimensional process that seeks to strike a\nbalance between economic and social development on one side, and the environment on the other. It seeks for humans to\nuse resources in the best possible way.\nThere are numerous citations from the Qur’an and the hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Mohammad) that mentioned the wise\nutilization of natural resources. They all lead to the conviction that all elements, species, habitats and ecosystems are part of\nthe perfect universe created by GOD. Hence ,respecting the law of nature and all its components is an obligation of every\nMuslim, who by definition has “submitted” himself, body and soul, to the Creator.\nDepending on the main Islamic concept in the Qur’an “And remember when He made you successors after the 'Aad and\nsettled you in the land, [and] you take for yourselves palaces from its plains and carve from the mountains, homes. Then\nremember the favors of Allah and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.” ( Al-'A`rāf, 7:74), this paper tried\nto discuss the main principles of Islamic roles that deal with nature as a main resource to architecture and built up area and\nhuman as a wise and rational consumer for these resources.\nThe paper aims to increase awareness to the importance of the theme of sustainability in architecture by expounding the core\nof the conceptual basis for the same. It also presents some general principles and ideas around which a comprehensive theory\non sustainability in Islamic architecture, in line with the requirements of the Islamic worldview while fully conforming to the\ndictates of different circumstances, environments and cultures, can be developed today. To deal with such an issue , the paper\nwill try to project the built environment and architecture of the old resident area of Mosul city within the Islamic principles of\nliving to investigate how Islam deals with such an environment and its resources sustainably.\n1. ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS IN ISLAM\nThe ethical base of Islam which is derived from the imperatives laid down in the Qur’an and expressed in the\npractice of the Prophet, comes under numerous headings. They can however be distilled into just three categories\nbearing in mind public good to be the ultimate objective. They are to do what is right, forbid what is wrong and\nact with moderation at all times: “Let there be a community among you who call to the good, and enjoin the right\nand forbid the wrong. They are the ones who have success” (Al ’Imrân, 3:104).\nAs Abed Al-Rahim (2010: 2-13) refers, the Qur’an uses an environmental theme in exhorting humankind to be\nmoderate, “it is He who produces gardens, both cultivated and wild, and palm trees and crops of diverse kinds\nand olives and pomegranates both similar and dissimilar. Eat of their fruits when they bear fruit and pay their\ndues on the day of their harvest, and do not be profligate. He does not love the profligate” (Al An‘âm, 6:141).\nThe Qur’an refers to creation or the natural world as the signs (ayat) of Allah, the Creator. Ayat means signs,\nsymbols or proofs of the divine. As the Qur’an is proof of Allah so likewise is His creation. Islamic unique\nperception of man and his position on earth necessitated the formation of a compelling and comprehensive view\nof the natural environment as well (Nasr, 1993: 130-131). This is so because man totally depends on nature for\nhis survival. Also, nature is a ground for man’s realization of his spiritual purpose on earth. Simply put, man is an\nintegral part of the total natural setting. Man is nature himself, sustaining nature means sustaining his self,\ndamaging nature means damaging his self and his prospects of a civilization achievement.\nOwing to all this, Islam attaches so much importance to the subject of environment clearly expounding man’s\nrights over it and his responsibilities towards it. Islam teaches that environment is part of the universal web of\ncreation. Its role is two-fold: to worship its Creator (in ways suitable to it), and to be subjected to serve the\nexigencies of man, so that God’s vicegerent can smoothly carry out his honorable task of managing earth. (Omer,\n2009: 115-116)\n1.1 Basic Roles of Sustainability in the Quran\nThe Qur’an highlighted some principles and guidelines on sustainability, which include (Matali, 2012: 35-38):\n1. Adl (Justice) - governing human relationships and other living creatures;\n2. Mizan (Balance) - governing not only human social and economic relationships but also the environment,\nespecially in ensuring the equilibrium of nature, the use of resources and life cycle of all species;\n3. Wasat (Middleness) - choosing the middle path in economic planning, social conduct, scientific pursuits,\nideological views, material, water and energy consumption;\n4. Rahmah (Mercy) - governing all aspects of human relationships and treatment of all living animals, plants and\ninsects including micro-organisms;\n5. Amanah (Trustworthiness and custodianship) - Humankind is considered to be a trustee appointed by the\nCreator, for all earth’s assets;\n6. Taharah (Spiritual purity and Physical cleanliness) - generating contented individuals through spiritual purity,\nconscious of the presence of his/her Creator, that would result in a balanced society, living in harmony with the\nenvironment; cleanliness that would generate a healthy society devoid of air and water pollution, as well as\ngenerating a clean economy devoid of usury and deceitful marketing techniques and business transactions;\n7. Haq (Truthfulness and Rights) - Truthfulness in all dealings that recognizes the respective rights of others\n(humans, animals and plants);\n8. Ilm Nafi’ (usefulness of knowledge and science) - Knowledge, whether theological, scientific or technological,\nmust be beneficial to others (individuals and society) including future generations.\n1.2 Sustainable Architecture\nEnvironmental sustainability is a concept coined at the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Environment (2002)\nwhere the concept of Sustainable Development was redefined to mean that all development must stand on three\npillars (Figure 1): economic development, social development and environmental protection. If any of the three\npillars is overlooked in our development strategies and work plans, such developments cannot be called\nsustainable development. Environmental sustainability ensures that the harmonization of the three concepts is\napplied by planners and developers in practice.\nFigure 1. An indication between\nthe three pillars of sustainability\n(Scott, 2009, p. 36)\nSustainable architecture is a general term that describes environmentally conscious design techniques in the field\nof architecture. It is framed by the larger discussion of sustainability and the pressing economic and political\nissues of our world. According to LEED rating systems, sustainable architecture seeks to minimize the negative\nenvironmental impact of buildings by enhancing efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and\ndevelopment space (USGBC, 2005: 4). The idea of sustainability, or ecological design, is to ensure that our\nactions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations. The term can be used to\ndescribe an energy and ecologically conscious approach to the design of the built environment.\nOn the other hand, architecture, in general, should always be in service to people. It is never to be the other way\nround, that is to say that architecture should evolve into a hobby or an adventure in the process imposing itself on\nsociety while forsaking, or taking lightly, people’s identities, cultures and the demands of their daily struggles.\nArchitecture, first and foremost, should remain associated with functionality. It should not deviate from its\nauthentic character and stray into the world of excessive invention and abstraction. (Bianca, 2000: 40)\nCentral to Islamic architecture is function with all of its dimensions: corporeal, cerebral and spiritual. Form\ndivorced from function is inconsequential (Omer, 2009: 112). This, however, by no means implies that form\nplays no role in Islamic architecture. It does play a prominent role, but its relevance is a supportive one\nsupplementing and enhancing function. Form is important, but in terms of value and substance it always comes\nsecond to function and its wide scope. There must be the closest relationship between the ideals that support the\nform of buildings and the ideals that support their function, with which the users of buildings must be at ease. A\nconflict between the two is bound to lead to a conflict of some far-reaching psychological proportions in\nbuildings users. This way, the roles of form become equivalent to the roles of function.\n1.3 The Islamic Built Laws\nThe built laws or principles as mentioned in Fiqh books illustrate the responsibilities of both individuals and\nauthority in Islamic law (Hammad 1997: 54-60). Hakim (1986: 6) defines Fiqh of building processes as: \"the\nmechanism of interpreting and applying the value system of the shari'a (Islamic divine law) within the processes\nof building and urban development... its primary sources, the Qur'an and the Sunna (or traditions of the Prophet)\nare crucial for the transfer of the value system to design and urban form.\" Islamic built laws were used to define\nthe rights, responsibilities of people and how to respond to one's needs as outlined above without conflicting\nother people's interests (Al-Ibrahim 2003: 63-80). In this sense, Akbar (1988: 20) pointed out that\nAhmed (2003: 12) suggested that the Islamic built laws (driven from Islamic principles) can be listed as the\nfollowing:\n1.3.1 No-Harm principle:\nNo-Harm principle means that residents' initiated action, which is considered harmful to others, should be\nprevented when affected people ask so (Hakim 1983: 32).\n1.3.2. Openings and projections:\nAkbar (1989: 28-35) stated that any individual could project part of his upper floor, such as Mashrabiyahs or\ncantilevers, on to a through street as long as no damage is caused to the public. Projecting cantilevers over main\nroads are permissible because the roads are the remains of `dead' lands that could have been `revived' in the past.\nHe/ she can also open windows and doors on to these roads providing they do not cause harm to their neighbors.\n1.3.3. Right of appropriation of open spaces:\nAs long as this causes no harm, residents should be free to appropriate open spaces in their residential settlements\nfor a wide range of social and economic activities determined and permitted by the residents themselves without\noutside intervention (Akbar 1989: 29, and Hakim 1986: 9).\n1.3.4. Right of easement (servitude) (Irtifak):\nRight of easement (servitude) is an exclusive benefit of a property over another adjacent to it, where the two are\nowned by different owners. This benefit belongs to the first property, even if its owner changes, unless this\nbenefit has been relinquished through a conventional transaction (Akbar 1988: 28).\n1.3.5. Right of pre-emption (Shufah):\nThe right of pre-emption (Shufah) is the right of a neighbor or a partner to substitute himself/ herself for the\nbuyer of an adjacent property or structure when offered for sale by another neighbor or partner (Akbar 1988: 29).\nThe above principals have defined the user’s rights in terms of how to build, alter or extend his/ her property.\nThey also provide a flexible framework to the property user/owner that enables him/ her to change his property\nwithout harming his neighbors and violating their rights.\n1.4. Sustainable Issues in Islamic Architecture\n1.4.1. The Use of Resources\nCentral to the understanding of Islamic architecture, as both a concept and sensory reality, is the understanding of\nthe Islamic concepts of man and the environment. This is so because it is man who perceives, creates and uses\narchitecture. It is man who produces or destroys architecture. It is man who enjoys or suffers from architecture.\nFurthermore, architecture and natural environment are inseparable, at both the conceptual and practical planes.\nThe environment holds enormous potential and diversified resources meant only for man, God’s vicegerent on\nearth. They are to be seen as the facilities which facilitate each and every aspect of man’s fleeting stay on earth.\nThe environment is further to be seen by man as an “ally” or a “partner”, so to speak, in the execution of his\nearthly mission. After all, in order to create an architecture, man borrows diverse natural ingredients, such as\nspace, water, clay, timber, stone and other minerals, placing the newly created or built elements back into the\nexisting natural contexts. In other words, the built environment is in so many ways the natural environment that\nhas been borrowed, utilized, manipulated and processed. Man himself constitutes a part of the universal natural\nsetting. It goes without saying that some of the most prominent features of Islamic architecture must always be as\nfollows: it is heavily loaded with the Islamic spirituality; it is economic and safe; it is users friendly; it is\nenvironment friendly; and, it is sustainable.\n1.4.2. Complementary with Context\nIt is the nature of Islam that provides humanity with basic rules of morality and guidelines of proper conduct in\nthose spheres of life which are not related to prescribed ritual worship, such as the spheres of building, planning\nand general development, for example. Upon such general principles and guidelines, people can establish\nsystems, regulations, views and attitudes in order to comprehend. and regulate their worldly life in accordance\nwith their time, region and needs. Since every age and geographic location have their own problems and\nchallenges, the solutions and perceptions deduced from the fundamental principles and permanent values of life\nhave got to be, to some extent, different. Their substance, however, due to the uniformity and consistency of the\ndivinely given foundation and sources from which they stem, will always be the same. Islam is based on essential\nhuman nature, which is constant and not subject to change according to time and space.\nIn addition, Islam ensured the right of natural resources exploitation (sun, air and water) for all, without abusing\nthe individual rights on others.\n1.4.3. Diversity with Unity\nMuslim architects tend to, firstly, identify the general Islamic guidelines and principles pertaining to the\nenterprise of sustainable building, on top of which are those related to the notions of man and the environment in\nIslam. Next, they must be aware of the implications of the challenges of regions diversity in which they live\nentail. If something was the norm during a period and in a particular ecological setting, such by no means can be\nthe same in every subsequent period and in different ecological settings. Technological advancements rapidly\nchange; demands of different eras fluctuate, even under the same ecological conditions; climate exigencies must\nbe painstakingly heeded; and, lastly, human psychology also changes with the change of time and space posing a\nnumber of exigencies of its own. No architectural plan and design which served as a solution for an age and place\ncan be simply copied to another age and place without properly modulating it to its environmental and socio-\ncultural requirements. To do that is to betray the dynamic spirit of both the common sense and the perpetual\nmessage of Islam. Blind and ignorant imitations, even in sheer religious matters, are categorically rebuked by\nIslam. By taking hold of the general Islamic guidelines and principles with reference to creating a sustainable\narchitecture, on the one hand, and by studying the needs of different times and situations so that the former can\nbe accurately understood and applied, on the other, Muslim architects in reality perform a degree of ijtihad,. In\ndoing so, in no way can a serious, enlightened, accountable and willing person be a loser as far as the execution\nof matters ordained by God is concerned. He can never be wrong. Verily, this divine assurance should serve to\nthe Muslim architects and designers as a starting point to look carefully and critically at the state of architecture\nand how buildings in the Muslim world are planned and designed, as well as to start contemplating the prospects\nof finding much better sustainability solutions which will be inspired by and infused with the values of Islam, and\nwill be responsive to the exigencies of different times and regions.\n2. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY\nThe objectives of the research are to study how far Islamic values and sustainable architecture have been applied\nto residence area in old Mosul city (MOC) in Iraq country. The research main question is lay under the\ninvestigation of ; how much Islamic architecture and sustainable architecture principles are synchronized\nThe research objectives are carried out through a pilot study in a selected area on the inner city, data is obtained\nwith survey as a purposive sample, building sketches and photographs.\n2.1. The Case Study: Mosul Old City\nIn the Mosul Old City in Iraq, urban tradition is greatly presented as demonstrated by the traditional alleys,\nhouses doorways, the old Islamic public buildings. For testing the theoretical framework (Islamic roles and\nprinciples mentioned above), a part of the historic fabric of (MOC) has been selected, (Fig.2). The case study has\nbeen elected due to the variety of its building styles and their ages; purposes and types. It includes several houses,\na number of public buildings like public baths, schools, and some significant religious building (mosques).\nFigure 2. Layout of Mosul\nold city within whole fabric\nof Mosul\n(Directorate of Municipality\nof Mosul city)\n2.2 Sustainable Architecture within (MOC)\nThe form of Mosul urban fabric returns wholly to Arabic, and Islamic in fluencies. It does not generally differ\nfrom any other Arabic–Islamic city. It is, however, considered the production of this great cultural tradition.\nThe table below (Table 1) indicates manifestation of architectural sustainability which have been obtained during\nsurvey, such appearances dealt with the concept of sustainability spontaneously, due to the (conscious)\ninvolvement of designer and architect within Islamic principles and roles.\nThe survey also indicates that the use of these concepts were at macro and micro levels of the architecture and the\nurban design of the built environment, and muslin architect dealt with such environment with various degrees of\nawareness, to establish safety and humanity, with wise and various use of natural resource.\nTable 1. indicates some of architectural sustainability appearances corresponding to Islamic principles in old\nMosul city.\n\"\nExample Sustainable\nappearance\nSustainable\nissue\nIslamic role &\nBuilt law\nRelated Qur’anic\nverses or prophetic\nhadiths\nThe compact\ngrain with\norganic fabric\nand space\nhierarchy\nThe wise Use\nof space\nResources\nWasat\n(Middleness)\nOpenings and\nprojections\n\"That home of the\nHereafter We assign\nto those who do not\ndesire exaltedness\nupon the earth or\ncorruption.

CONCLUSIONS:\nThe Islamic world has enriched human history with its scientific and artistic achievements, and contributed both\nwithin and outside of Islamic borders to the advent of the modern era. The field of Islamic Architecture is a key\nexample of this rich legacy. This can be witnessed in the timeless and unprecedented buildings throughout\nIslamic civilization, among them.\nThe unity of Islamic architecture is related of course not only to the unity of cosmos and beyond that realm to the\nunity of the divine principle itself, but also to the unity of life of the individual and the community which the\ndivine law makes possible. By refusing to distinguish between the sacred and profane, by integrating religion into\nall facets of life and life itself into the rhythm of rites and patterns of values determined by religion, Islam creates\na wholeness, which is reflected in its architecture.\nIt was clear from the survey held in Mosul city which represents one of the cities established by Muslim\narchitects and designers that there is a great awareness to issues of sustainability with their three pillars. That\nawareness is reflected in both macro and micro levels so that we can find this wise usage of resources in the\nspace and fabric, in the material and construction, in the single building and its inner and constructed elements,\nand in the whole urban grains.\nThese sustainable pillars were also reflected sharply in the optimum collaboration between man and his\nenvironment, which is one of the most obligations in Islamic faith.\nIt is also clear that by depending on Islamic principles (No- Harm, Mezan, Ilm Nafi’….etc.) architects created\nbuilt environment with a high responsibility to the natural and local resources, without refuting the richness\n(saying diversity and variety) of such environment, and by using these local resources they also could save to the\nenvironment its health and strength.\nGiven the way Islam looks at development, we can also seek Islamic solutions to global issues which threaten\nenvironment, so that we can keep our universe clean and healthy with enough resources to the future generations.\nmake two tables and identify 5 columns that will help us determine what the mechanism of action and principle is that makes the vernacular architectural process more sustianable, how it connects with a LEED certification element, what the principle is and what percentage of emissions/carbon it can help reduce from the average home in Iraq \nyou can ask me 5 questions to help you do this well and gather the information you need, you can also use everything in our context window, be thorough ",

Compact Urban Fabric and Space Hierarchy**\n\n- **Mechanism:** Traditional Mosul architecture features closely packed buildings and a hierarchy of spaces (public to private), which reduces land use and promotes efficient resource utilization.\n- **Modernization:** By encouraging high-density housing and retrofitting existing homes to better utilize space, urban sprawl can be minimized.\n- **LEED Connection:** **Neighborhood Development (ND)** credits reward smart location choices and efficient land use patterns.\n\n#### **2. Use of Local Materials**\n\n- **Mechanism:** Using materials like stone and gypsum reduces the embodied energy associated with transportation and is suitable for the local climate.\n- **Modernization:** Sourcing local, recycled, or sustainably harvested materials reduces environmental impact.\n- **LEED Connection:** **Materials & Resources (MR)** credits focus on responsible sourcing and reducing the environmental impacts of materials.\n\n#### **3. Natural Ventilation**\n\n- **Mechanism:** Built tunnels and courtyards in traditional designs facilitate airflow, reducing the need for air conditioning.\n- **Modernization:** Incorporating modern wind catchers, solar chimneys, and enhancing natural ventilation in design reduces energy consumption.\n- **LEED Connection:** **Energy & Atmosphere (EA)** credits reward optimizing energy performance.\n\n#### **4. Internal Courtyards with Shading**\n\n- **Mechanism:** Courtyards provide natural light and ventilation while shading reduces heat gain.\n- **Modernization:** Adding green roofs or rooftop gardens improves insulation and reduces urban heat island effects.\n- **LEED Connection:** **Sustainable Sites (SS)** credits include heat island reduction strategies.\n\n#### **5. Water Wells and Rainwater Harvesting**\n\n- **Mechanism:** Traditional homes often had wells and systems to collect rainwater.\n- **Modernization:** Implementing rainwater harvesting systems and greywater reuse reduces reliance on municipal water supplies.\n- **LEED Connection:** **Water Efficiency (WE)** credits focus on reducing water consumption.\n\n#### **6. Recycling Building Materials**\n\n- **Mechanism:** Traditional practices involved reusing materials from old buildings.\n- **Modernization:** Using reclaimed materials and recycling construction waste reduces the demand for new materials.\n- **LEED Connection:** **Materials & Resources (MR)** credits for construction waste management.\n\n#### **7. Thick Walls with High Thermal Mass**\n\n- **Mechanism:** Thick walls made of stone or earth absorb heat during the day and release it at night, stabilizing indoor temperatures.\n- **Modernization:** Enhancing walls with modern insulation while maintaining thermal mass properties improves energy efficiency.\n- **LEED Connection:** **Energy & Atmosphere (EA)** credits for optimizing energy performance.\n\n### **Common/Locally Available Construction Materials and Knowledge**\n\n- **Materials:** Stone, gypsum, clay bricks, local marble, wood.\n- **Knowledge:** Traditional building techniques, craftsmanship in stone masonry and woodwork, understanding of local climate for passive design.\n\n### **Notes on Emissions/Carbon Reduction Estimates**\n\n- **Estimates are approximate** and based on general industry data for energy efficiency improvements.\n- Actual reductions may vary depending on specific building conditions, technologies used, and occupant behavior.\n- **Collective implementation** of these principles can lead to significant reductions in a building's carbon footprint.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy modernizing these vernacular principles with contemporary technology and materials, we can create sustainable housing that:\n\n- **Respects cultural heritage** while meeting modern efficiency standards.\n- **Reduces environmental impact** through efficient use of resources.\n- **Enhances occupant comfort** and promotes community well-being.\n- **Aligns with LEED certification**, ensuring recognized sustainability benchmarks are met.\n\nThese strategies not only contribute to the sustainability of individual homes but also support broader environmental goals and community resilience in Iraq and similar contexts.\n\n---\n\nI hope these tables and explanations provide a clear understanding of how traditional Islamic architectural principles from Mosul can inform modern sustainable design, both in retrofitting existing homes and in planning new green architecture.

This compatibility is associated with the\nenvironment and with the efficient exploitation of the resources of the natural environment in\naccordance with the evolution of life and its means over the years. It is obvious to everyone the fact\nthat the teachings of the Islamic religion include a lot of the principles of sustainability, which\noverlap with the social organization and behavior of the humanitarian community and are reflected\non the production both at the level of urban planning standards for cities and urban agglomerations\nor the features of the traditional architecture. This paper is an attempt to define the concept of\nsustainability in the references of traditional Islamic architecture, in general and housing in\nparticular, through a review of the relationship between man and the environment and its\npreservation within the Islamic perspective.\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, the adoption of the concept of green architecture became of an important influence\nin many European countries, in the American continent and East Asia [1]. and the expression of\npositive reaction to the concerns of climate change and population growth, there became a great\ninterest among the various public, private and industrial institutions in these countries in this issue It\nhas become necessary to have geometric authorities functioning at the level of the professional\nassociations and government institutions to be responsible for the construction industry in our\ncountry and to take important decisions on the subject of sustainability in the built environment.\nEnvironment and Islamic Thinking\nAlthough the word environment has not been mentioned verbally in the Quran, Contemplating in\nthe verses, we find that the concept of the environment in the Quran and the Sunnah is referred to as\nthe \"Earth and what is on it and around it\" [2]. There are many Islamic rules that are inspired by the\nguidance of the Holy Quran and the Sunnah urging individuals and groups to preserve the\nenvironment to keep it clean and in order. Allah says \"and those who harm male and female\nbelievers without a reason endured slander and manifest sin\"[3].\nThe concept of environment and its preservation from all forms of pollution is associated with\nthe doctrine of the Muslim This is clearly embodied in the Prophetic Hadith \"Faith is of about 70 or\nseveral more kinds, the best among them is to say there is no god but Allah and the last is to remove\nAll rights reserved.

If the environment, according to the western\nthinking, is the space or the area in which people live including human and natural phenomena that\naffect and are affected by it, he Islamic concept of the environment is much deeper than its western\nequivalent, as it links the environment with faith system of the Muslim who believes in one God\n[4], the environment is the framework in which humans live and they practice social and productive\nactivities. Thus, the environment is the source of wealth and production, and maintaining it and the\nrationalization in the use of its resources enhance production and giving\nGreen Architecture and the Traditional Architecture\nThere is no doubt that the treatment of ancestors of environment was not random or innate, but\nbased on the profound legacy of experiences and learning through the principle of \"trial and error\".\nThis was supported by a creative thought and penetrating insight. The depth of these experiences\nwas demonstrated in modern studies over hundreds of years. Elements of sustainable design is\nintegrated with the design intellect by using local building materials and carefully planned simple\ntechniques, which stem from their local environment where solutions were effective and interactive\nwith the environment and with the available resources without the need to convert or control them.\nPaul [5] in his book \"The Encyclopaedia of the Classical Architecture\" ascribed the success of\nthe traditional architecture, in addition to being a product of the logical correspondence to the\navailable resources in the environment, the climatic factors and the community principles, there are\nmany upholders of the concept of sustainability who laid great attention to traditional architecture in\nthe Arab Homeland. The number of studies that investigated the classical architecture increased in\nnumber. These studies aimed to provide a new utilization of traditional architecture such as the\ncentral courtyard and wind towers to be used in areas that have a similar climate Murtadha [6].\nwhen we consider traditional architecture, we are either looking for the thought behind its building\nto learn how to build in the future, or, as it is the case in the last few years, scholars started to look\nat traditional Islamic architecture in more depth linking between the principles of Islam and the\nprinciples of sustainability. Murtadha concluded his book, \"Principles of Islam in the Built\nEnvironment\" and in the last chapter entitled \"Sustainability: Rethinking in Islam\" confirms that\nmost of the principles of Islamic architecture \"can be included within the concept of sustainability.\nIt is beyond dispute that the sustainability advocates concede that the intellectual trends of ancient\ncivilizations and traditional societies embraced the ideas and principles that form the basis of\nsustainability. Of the most important calls of sustainability is to provide our needs at the present\ntime without reducing the chances of future generations to achieve, but the researcher finds that, the\nKoran and the Sunnah, and since more than 1400 years contain similar principles to the ones\nsustainability calls for in our present time [1]. Figure 1 shows, Al-Kadumia city in Baghdad and the\nnarrow streets, The compact style and winding paths make apartment buildings close to each other\nto give the shading to the walker in these paths and block sunlight from residential and surrounding\nbuildings.\nFig. 1, Al-Kadumia city in Baghdad and its narrow streets\n26 Advances in Green Science, Engineering and Built Environment\nThis style also helps in reducing the area exposed to sunlight, which in turn reduces the heat gained.\nHousings is an essential part of the city fabric, and there is no analgesic lofty solo house design as\nhouses are adjacent to each other without distinction between houses of the rich and the poor of\nhow the housing unit is projected or the outer treatment. The excellence is inside, and this is one of\nthe most prominent features of the traditional architecture which is the unity of the appearance,\nwhile the difference and the excellence are in the essence. The difference in the size and areas of\nhouses, and the number of courtyards, which affects the spatial system of these units. This adds\nsome merits to the environmental performance within the overall design of the urban Fabric through\nthe formation of different places in the pressure and dislocations antenna which helped achieving\nnatural air movement between the parts of the urban fabric, the inside of the dwelling, and the\nmultiple spaces of house. The streets of cities were directed from north to south, the interfaces of\nbuildings and roads are not exposed to the sun this is what makes the streets gain a shadow\nthroughout the day and are exposed to north wind. The streets and alleys of the city were marked of\nbeing narrow to provide shadowsit also zigzag, to not be converted into windtunnels for winter.\nThe Principles of Sustainability in Traditional House: Adaptation and Protection\nAdaptation is the exploitation of potential resources in harsh environmental circumstances and\ndealing with these circumstances to achieve heat comfort to dwellers and to exploit natural sources\nof energy.Protection is to eliminate the impact of harsh environmental circumstances. There are\nmany basic principles on which the architecture of the traditional dwelling is based. This\narchitecture includes the concept of sustainability and it can be modified to be guiding indications\nto contemporary sustainable design:\nThe direction towards the internal courtyard it is provides Protection against climatic factors,\nnatural light, social privacy and natural ventilation Through planting the yard and establishing\nbodies of water that make the courtyard shaded and its air cool and transmitted to the adjacent\nrooms, figure 2 shows the air is conditioned to make the courtyard cool and pleasant in the\nmorningat noon, the air begins to move from the shaded alleys adjacent to the courtyard and then to\nthe internal spaces and in the evening the courtyard begins to lose its temperature to the outside air,\nand begins to pull cool air from the top, where the hot air ascends to the top and the temperature\ndrops.\nFig.2,The air conditioned in courtyard\nAelchenachel whose most important benefits are natural ventilation, natural lighting and shadows,\nsince they allow air to plunge to the surface figure3, shows theAelchenachel and exterior windows\nand openings were characterized by their small areas.They were treated with decorations and\ncolored glass to prevent direct rays from entering. They were also narrow from inside and wide\nfrom the outside to expand the viewing angle. As for the building materials, local materials which\nsuit the environment were used. As for the building materials, local materials which suit the\nenvironment were used. These have a high heat capacity and thermal insulation they are renewable\nso they are sustainable materials.

The buildings and housings at\npresent lack the correct direction that suits the nature of the climate and the environment. The\ndirection of buildings their openness to the outside caused a problem in the size of the holes and the\nbuilding materials used. This in turn led to the use of artificial means aiming to avoid environmental\nproblems generated, and this has negative effects on the economic aspect represented in resources\ndepletion.\nSummary\nTraditional architecture gives us examples of how simple the principles this architecture was\nbased on and the idea that these principles are still valid at the present time as they were hundreds\nof years ago. These principles stand to confront modern construction methods that did not prove to\nbe of more validity than traditional solutions.\nContemporary architecture is confronting many challenges to prove that it is able to\naccommodate the requirements of sustainable development and maintaining them. The use of the\nmodern techniques of present time and the future can make the use of principles of traditional\narchitecture easier and more effective to achieve the principles of sustainable architecture\nBuilding materials in eco-energy houses from Iraq and Iran\nAmjad Almusaed a,*\n, Asaad Almssad b\na Albasrah University, Denmark\nb Karlstad University, Sweden\nA R T I C L E I N F O\nA B S T R A C T\nArticle history:\nReceived 17 August 2014\nReceived in revised form 24 December 2014\nAccepted 5 February 2015\nAvailable online 11 March 2015\nKeywords:\nEnvironmental profiles\nEcological materials\nEnergy efficiency\nVernacular habitat\nBuilders from the Western part of Asia are trained to make buildings that can fulfil certain\nrequired functions while giving full consideration to all sites and environmental\nconditions.

Introduction\nVernacular habitats developed their individuality by tapping into nearby resources and exploiting them to confront the\nproblems posed by a local environment. If rain is seasonal, the roof structure must also function efficiently in the dry season\n(Woolley, 2006). When it is warm, large, a high roof space continuum with the living area is practical. Temperature extremes\ncall for thick insulating walls and roofs to maintain a comfortable internal environment (Almusaed, 2004). The most\nimportant question that needs to be answered is what is the relationship between the outer conditions of temperature,\nsunshine and rain and the inside thermal comfort. For different climatic sessions, it is necessary to take into account building,\narea, orientation, colours, etc. Although it is quite a complicated matter to theoretically solve these problems, it is possible to\n* Corresponding author.

In this way, the practical\nproblem can be solved (Ginvoni Man, 1976). Throughout history, the human being has striven to erect shelters that fulfil\nbasic needs relating to his survival, shelter that provides an environment favourable to his physical requirements. During his\nyears of effort to achieve that environment, many local variations in dwellings have evolved (Wenzel, 1996). According to a\nUN document, the purpose of the habituation process is not to build houses but to ovulate a competent house. In other words,\nthe house should provide the security of technical advice and be involved in acquiring small loans and cheap materials (Stulz,\n1981). Climatic conditions compel the builder to find an efficient solution to serve the human being and the comfort of his\nexistence. Building materials have an important impact on the home’s functions and inhabitants. Environmental building\nmaterials add value to human life and reduce the negative impact on the environment drastically. In West Asia, climates,\nenvironmental elements with heavy buildings and shaded courtyards are common. These climates typically have a huge\ndiurnal temperature range, and houses tend to employ an arrangement of these measures, with the particular mix being\nmodulated to suit local micro-climatic characteristics. Selecting and specifying environmental building materials are often\ncomplicated processes (Jester, 1995).\nBuilders from this region created their habitats taking into consideration the above-mentioned question, in an efficient\nmanner and to fit human needs by adapting to local environmental parameters. Each building material displays the different\nphysical characteristics; the structure requires rigid strength to support the dead weight of the roof and walls. If the situation\ndictates the range of fitting materials, together they command the form. West Asia’s vast landmasses are diverse in geology\nand climate (Almusaed, 1997). This investigation has to find suitable solutions for building materials and then study\ndifferent building materials from various sources and based on its characteristics of eco-energy house efficiency. The main\nlesson we can learn from this study is not only to further the conservation and repossession of the form of habitats already in\nexistence, but also to rethink what can form new habitats for the future (Fig. 1).\n2. Climate-specific effects\nClimate is the main factor that directly affects the construction process and building materials in West Asia. This region is\nsituated in the subtropics’ climate zone. It is affected by the subtropics’ high-pressure belt, which reaches the farthest north\nin the summer. The sky in West Asia is bright and glaring, even when thinly clouded. As one goes inland from the equator,\nseasonal differences in climate become more marked with a wetter wet season, and a drier winter period (Kukreja, 1978).\nThere are many factors that affect building materials of traditional buildings from West Asia. Solar radiation deteriorates\norganic materials by initiating chemical reactions within the material and causing oxidation. Fig. 2 shows the monthly\naverage temperature and sunshine hours in the West Asia Region. In this region, edifices have to be planned with great\nattention and thought, and with due respect for climate. Shade and protection from dust storms may have the highest\npriority in some areas, whereas in other areas, ventilation and the trapping of air streams and breeze are the primary goals.\nThe effect of climate over the building materials is large; high temperatures, for example, can affect all types of materials in\ngeneral. The speed of a chemical reaction doubles for every 10 8C increase in temperature (Nielsen, 2010).\nIn addition, increasing levels of humidity can increase the deterioration physically and by creating an environment for\nharmful fungus and microbial growth as well as insect attacks. Changes in humidity also cause deterioration through\nchanges in volume and stress within the material.\n3. Investigation methods\nAN environmental profile is achieved on the basis of the SBI (DK) calculation programme, BEAT 2000, which is a\nstandardised technique for classifying and measuring the environmental effects related to building materials in their life\nFig. 1. The different building systems categories from West Asia Region.\n44\nA. Almusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–54\nFig. 2. The average weather in West Asia Region.\ncycles (11). It consists of seven parameters that cover all essential physical environmental impacts and effects. It is possible\nto examine an environmental profile indicator using the same indicator on another one. The first indicator is resource\nconsumption, where the environmental impacts of resource benefits can be composed of a loss of resources and space\nconsumption and risks of gas extraction or a cultivation process. The study will use three circumstances. The first is the\nability of the material to engage in a recycling process, where it can provide for the immediate environment by reducing the\nuse of new resources. Knowledge materials are a part of the renewable resource process, such as, in the building of plant\nmaterials, mainly wood, or non-renewable resources, such as mineral substances like brick, concrete and metals. The second\nindicator is the environmental impact of energy consumption. In this situation, the study will use three circumstances:\nrenewable feedstock energy, the heat of combustion of renewable resources, where is wood is the principal base\nproduct; non-renewable feedstock energy, such as plastic; and renewable energy, such as energy from wind and\nhydropower production and biofuels. Last is non-renewable energy, such as coal, oil, gas. These energy sources are\ncharacterised by a limited quantity at disposal, and their use gives rise to, among other things, the greenhouse effect.\nThe third indicator is a greenhouse effect, which shows the environmental impact of greenhouse-gas emissions. The\nanthropogenic greenhouse effect is due to cord gases (including carbon dioxide, methane and other) for the retention\ntraps heat radiation that would otherwise radiate from the earth into space. In this way, they contribute to atmospheric\nwarming. Acidification influence is a fourth indicator that shows the environmental impact of the emissions of\nacidifying compounds (mainly sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides), which attack plant foliage and acidify the soil.\nNitrogen impact is a fifth indicator, which shows the environmental impact of the discharge of substances containing\nnitrogen or phosphorus. They can cause the growth of algae or plants to increase out of balance in relation to, and to the\ndetriment of, the global ecosystem. The toxification effect is a sixth indicator of the environmental profile, showing the\nenvironmental impact of the emissions of substances that have acute and chronic toxic effects on humans. Disposability\nis the last indicator of environmental profiles and shows what happens to a building, structure or material once its life is\nover. In this situation, the study will use three circumstances: recycling/high-value recycling, the direct reuse of the\nmaterial in its original form or reuse of the material innovatively through the production of new materials (Marsh,\n2000). A low-worth recycling/incineration, the recycling of material for the production of brand new materials of lower\nquality, or burning the material with energy; and hazardous waste, where the material contains substances that must be\ndisposed of according to law (Table 1).\nComparisons are an instrument of inquiry. Materials related to environmental impacts can be assessed in relation to other\nfactors such as energy consumption and the greenhouse effect, which is divided into the following:\nMaterials\nAcclimatisation\nA material impact on the environment should not be observed in isolation from other environmental factors. The\nenvironmental impact of certain materials or structures can be compared to other factors (Dinesen, 1997). The\nenvironmental profile can compare the environmental impact per m2-floor areas of the house’s acclimatisation needs and its\nbuilding materials. The calculation of housing accumulation requires using the approach developed by SBI for the calculation\nprogramme BV95. The calculated cooling & heating requirements are then converted to gross energy consumption and CO2\nemissions.\nA. Almusaed, A.

Specific building materials nominated\nA building is built to be occupied by humans. As such, it makes sense that architects, be they Classical, Renaissance,\nModern, or contemporary, would use the human body as inspiration or a principle of design (Korydon, 2012). The building\nenvelope is a man’s barrier against external atmospheric conditions and their fluctuations. Builders from this zone have\nchosen three varied categories, in the building material’s selecting process. These are mineral materials, organic materials\nand mixture material.\n4.1. Organic building materials\nThis is the first building material utilised by human beings in the building process. It comes from renewable resources and\ncan be extracted by humans easily; therefore, it is an ecological material with many good proprieties and can be successfully\nused in the construction process. It is a large part of human life (Brown, 1990). It is a popular building material because of it is\nspecific environmental friendliness and great energy values. The main benefits of these materials are their cheapness,\nprevalence, and excellent proprieties of thermal and acoustical insulation.\n4.1.1. Reeds\nReed is an organic building material; it has good resistance to water actions. It contains a high ratio of silicon substance,\nwhich leads to it being durable and flexible in technical action and structures; however, it is a highly flammable material. The\nhigh concentration of silica in the reeds makes this material unattractive for insects and other animals. Reed meets all the\nrequirements to be an efficient insulator. The form of the stem allows it to serve all manners of functions (Elias, 1980). It is an\nexcellent thermal and acoustic insulator material. The relative durability and flexibility in construction are the most\nimportant proprieties of reeds. The unique properties of reeds have been noted for a long time, in all regions of the world\n(Lauren, 2000). The influence of reeds on pathogenic bacteria is particularly intense. Reeds from the marshland region consist\nof several types of plants whose stems differ in thickness, flexibility and chemical composition. The most popular reeds used\nin the construction process are ‘‘Ihdri’’, the regional name of this type of reed. The building of walls with reeds is much less\nlabour intensive than that with other materials such as brick, adobe, or stone, and requires considerably less skill. Reed\nbuilding is forgiving, encourages individual creativity, and leads to final structures that are climatically adapted and energy\nefficient. Reed does have some disadvantages. Its natural durability is lower than wood, and it must be treated with\npreservatives to last in exposed locations.\n4.1.2. Straw\nStraw is a material with high thermal efficiency. It has an R-value substantially better than those of other traditional\nbuildings, depending on the type of straw; it consists of barley that is 36% cellulose, 26% pentoses, 17% linen, wax, protein and\nash – a composition very similar to wood. The straw has excellent insulation properties. Straw’s biological functions include\nits axis for water. Therefore, straw bales are good at transporting moisture and thus regulate interior humidity, provided they\nbear the diffusion through open screen and coatings. Straw’s weaknesses are risk of fire, insects or decay refraction caused by\nlong-term, high moisture content (Gillv, 1970). Straw can provide greatly improved comfort, and dramatic energy savings\ncompared to more expensive traditional building structures because they allow for smaller heating or cooling systems in\nconventional homes because of the increased insulation. Bale building is of particular value in severe environments where\nenergy is costly.\n4.1.3. Wood\nWood is an organic material, a natural combination of cellulose fibres (that are strong in tension) embedded in a matrix\nthat resists compression (Janssen, 1988). The principal components in wood are cellulose (40–50%) and hemicellulose\n(15–25%), with lignin (15–30%) as well as other material such as sugar, starch and protein. The technical properties of wood\nare highly dependent on the type and moisture content. It also contains varying other elements depending on the type,\n46\nA. Almusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–54\nwhich defines its smell, colour and resistance to pest damage. There are two forms of wood, softwood and hardwood, which\nare subdivided into a number of different types (Edward and Joseph, 2011).\nWood has a high caloric value (between 12.5 MJ/kg and 20.1 MJ/kg). Thermal re-utilisation of untreated and uncoated wood\nis un-problematic. Re-utilisation is possible if the wood is dismantled without damage. Untreated old wood conventionally can\nbe used as raw material for a number of different applications (Woolley, 2006). The conversion of wood into a sustainable,\nrenewable resource to be used as a main building material could be beneficial in various areas of the world.\n4.2. Mineral building material\nMineral materials are made from non-renewable resources dug on land or at sea. They are homogeneous, naturally\noccurring solid inorganic materials with a clear crystal structure and a definite chemical composition (Damon, 1983).\nBuilders from this zone have found good building materials from the local neighbourhood. Two essential building materials\nwere selected in the building process: clay and brick, which are near the required scale of humans.\n4.2.1. Clay\nToday, clay offers the only practical prospect for building the five hundred million houses that will be required in the\ncoming years (Anil, 1981). A mass of clay has extraordinary formability and robustness. Excellent adhesion and bonding\nforces count as the main properties of clay.\n4.2.2. Brick\nBrick is used as a principal building material from zone ‘‘I’’. The typical house from Sumerian age was a one-story\nconstruction made from baked or sun-dried mud-brick. The family house included the following structure functions: a living\nroom, kitchen, open courtyard, servant’s residences, etc. A brick-building element has excellent thermal resistance (Barry,\n1988).\nThe material is very efficient in energy consumption and can be accepted as a bio-ecological material, especially in West\nAsia. Clay bricks are a more thermally inert material, and chemical reactions are relatively low. Thus, the effects of green\nhouses are limited (Manand har, 1983). The recycling of clay bricks can be a difficult process due to the unavoidable mortar,\nrender and plaster residue that tends to adhere to the bricks, particularly when such products have high cement content.\nHowever, older brick is easier to recycle because much of it was constructed using lime mortar (Manfred et al., 2006).\n4.3. Mixture of building materials\n4.3.1. Clay + straw\nThis is one of the ancient building practices known. Clay is odourless, non-toxic and pleasant to work with in combination\nwith straw, creating a soft to pulpy prepared mix of clay and vegetable fibres (straw) that can be used for filling the panels in\ntimber-framed buildings or pressed in moulds for making clay bricks and boards. Ready-made mixes are now available on\nthe market. The density of the mixture building material of clay and straw is 1200–1700 kg/m3\n. A mix of clay and straw is a\nheterogeneous material, with good thermal properties (Easton, 1996).

Building systems of heritage practices (case study from Basra habitats)\nThe city is located in a region of the historic area of Sumer, the hometown of the fictional character Sinbad the Sailor, and a\nsuggested place of the Garden of Eden. It held a significant position in the early regional history and was founded in 636 AD. It\nincludes three different habitat arrangements. The first appeared in the north part of the city in the zone of marshes, Zone III.\nAnother type appeared in the south part of the city in the desert area, Zone II. The last appeared the middle part of the city\nbeside the big-city river Shat Al-Arab, Zone I, as shown in Fig. 4.\nFrom the practical experiences of the building process, specific habitat units from historical experiences were more\nrelated to the objective context (Solar Handbook, 1986). One of the most effective interventions of an old building from this\nregion was respecting balances between many environmental factors to create a particular building style, which makes the\nbalances between human life and the milieu condition optimal. The notion of ecological building is not an absolute\n(Almusaed, 1996; Marsh, 2000). It is, therefore, more correct to use the words more or less environmentally friendly, healthy\nor willing ecology (Doran and Cather, 2013). However, that is not sufficient in practical experience. Accordingly, old builders\nof the city and region took into account many other factors. One important factor was the implication of bio-climatic\nconcepts in the building process\n- Why a bio-climatic building concept?\nThe climate has a primary influence on architectural form, not only in the challenges it poses to the builder but also in\nthe materials it supports. In bio-climatic building conception, the edifice is converted to a subsystem of a vast\nenvironmental system that should be examined carefully. The holistic integration of subsystems in the system is critical.\nThere are clear interpretations in native architecture (Houben and Guillaud, 1984). The temperature of the ground or walls\ncan be substantially different from that of the neighbouring atmosphere. In bio-climatic buildings from Basra, the earth is\nvaluable as a shelter, particularly in conjunction with landscaping.\n- Specific houses From Basra\nBasra’s traditional habitat has evolved within these constraints; it can be defined as architecture without architects: not\nthat it is created without overall supervision, just that it is not in the hands of a sophisticated urban professional. Instead, it\nis vernacular in that it is the product of well-tried local craftsmen raised in the use of local materials to confront local social\nand environmental conditions. Glazed windows are not part of the Basra tradition. In the warmer regions, glass inhibits the\nflow of air in summer. Openings are sealed against the winter cold by opaque shutters or cloth screens. Rural housing often\nlacks window openings, making for a dark interior (Namdin, 1996). Building materials are convenient, readily available and\ncan be made and used by the city builders to build their habitats. In all housing’ models, the allocation of habitat functions\nin the house resembles the shape of a tree, where the main building element is a courtyard, which is point ‘‘zero’’ in the\nhouse structure. The most common characteristic of the houses of the hot and humid regions is their openness. They are\nconstructed to catch every breeze that occurs, for natural air currents are the best relief in humid climates [8-2]. All habitat\nfunctions are allocated around the courtyard with a hierarchy approach. The most important is for functions of living, such\nas a living room. Next come service areas, such as kitchens. In this study, we investigated three different cases where old\nbuilders constructed something appropriate for the environmental, climatic and human requirements.\n5.1. ‘‘Old Basra Habitat’’ from zone I\nA high temperature, ‘‘T’’, due to the heat island phenomenon is a major risk factor that affects housing configurations and\ncompositions in this zone. The recommendation is to create a habitat unit that adapts to extreme climate with a series of\nFig. 4. Building zones from Basra.\n48\nA. Almusaed, A.

Traditional house from zone I (Old Basra Habitat).\ninterferences such as significant thermal insulation, profound shadows on facades, and natural stream ventilations\nthroughout the building functions and structures (Fig. 5).\n5.1.1. The house mechanism\nIn Old Basra, a house is considered beautiful if it is capacious and if the situation is airy and exposed on all sides to the\nwind, especially to the northern breeze. A healthy house has its courtyards, basins of water, and wooden pieces on the\nfront of the fac ¸ade ‘‘Shanashil.’’ A handsome house is seen without terraces, with ‘‘Shanashil’’ on which the family may\nsleep during the night (Fathy, 1986). Most of the old Basra distinct habitats are decorated, usually to show invisible spirits\nand demons and to satisfy local traditions. Building materials have to be strictly respected (see Fig. 10). The habitat area is\ndivided into two functional zones: a social area that includes the living room, kitchen, storage room, and bathroom and a\nprivate area that includes bedrooms. Communication between all operational areas occurs throughout the courtyard\n(Table 2).\n5.1.2. Technical house description\nThe habitat area of this edifice is ca. 125 m2: the social area is 30%, the private area is 45%, and the courtyard is 25%. The\nbuilding materials used in the creation of the house are as follows:\nThe roof is made of 10 cm of clay and straw, which improves the roof’s resistances to waterproofing and high temperature;\n3 cm of pressed straw; 10 cm of reeds; 5 cm of pressed straw and 10 cm of wood as a structural element.\nThe floor is made of a 40 cm layer of clay and eventually sand as a healthy ground, and a 12 cm layer of brick.\nThe exterior wall is combined with an inner wall with 24 cm of brick.\nThe upper fac ¸ade is made of wooden elements (Shanashil unit), with a thermal roll.\nThe interior wall is made of 12 cm of brick.\nThe estimated life cycle is 100 years.\nTable 2\nDifferent material uses in creating and the percentage of material in layers.\nExternal walls\n(46%) of\ntotal areas\nGlass panels\n(1%) of total\nareas\nRoof (10%)\nof total area\nGround slab\n(15%) of total\nareas\nInner walls\n(13%) of total\nareas\nl level slabs\n(9%) of total\nareas\nFoundation\n(6%) of total\nareas\nMaterials Areas Mat.

House environmental impacts\nThis is a category of heavy construction. Brick is the main material used in this construction. The impact on the\nenvironment by acclimatisation or building materials is limited. The houses are located in row buildings in front of a narrow\nstreet, placed directly by the old city river. The houses were built in the beginning of the last century.\nThe results show that the release of CO2 is relative low; however, it is higher than other categories of houses. Fig. 6 shows\nthe influence of the greenhouse effect distributed on habitat development and the environmental profile for 1 m2\n.\nThe environmental impact of the materials is a representation of the results shown in the environmental profile of the\nsame house’s materials.\n5.2. ‘‘Marshes House, Unit’’ from zone II\nA high humidity ‘‘H’’, due to marsh water, is a major risk factor that affects housing configurations and compositions from\nthis zone. A recommendation is to create a habitat unit with a building material resistant to water and humidity.\n5.2.1. The house mechanism\nThe location is a historic site, from the Sumerian time. The housing configuration was founded for the preliminary time in\nthe ‘‘Ur’’ city, where the initial settlement was founded (Ilay and Barry, 1998). UNESCO recognises the lacustrine region in the\nnorth of Basra as a monument of nature, representing one of the largest sites of unique ecosystem types in the world. There is\na low density of people living in symbiosis with impressive flora and fauna full of rare species. In the north of Basra, on an\n‘‘Artificial Island’’, the house was built in water with a weak current, and the habitat unit is made of reeds and a mixed of clay\nand straw (Tobias et al., 2009). There are two ways to make the island suitable for the construction process: one is choosing\ngood ground and the other is making it suitable for a particular case. Fig. 7 shows the different procedures for building an\nartificial island.\n5.2.2. Technical house description\nThe habitat unit area is 147 m2 (7 21) m:\nThe habitat entrance is oriented towards the northwest, where the dominant wind originates.\nFig. 7.

The height of the\npillar (Shabe) can reach 10 m. The diameter of the pillar (Shabe) is approximately 70 cm at the base and 20 cm at the top (Fig. 9).\n5.2.3. The house’s environmental impacts\nThe house is made of lightweight constructions. The principal building material applied is reed. Table 3 shows different\nmaterial used in the composition and the percentage of building materials in layers.\nA demonstration shows that houses made of reeds are friendlier environmentally, with a positive impact on the\nenvironment and less energy consumption. A short life cycle material presents negative aspects to a building system. Fig. 10\nshows the greenhouse effect for a habitat construction and the environmental profile for 1 m2\n.\n5.3. The ‘‘Al-Zubeir House, Unit’’ from zone III\nThe sandy wind ‘‘W’’, which is due to the Sahara Desert environment in the Arabian Peninsula, is a major risk factor that\naffects house configurations and compositions from this zone. Here, a blind wall is recommended.\n5.3.1. The house mechanism\nIn many ways, the earth is the most prominent material used in natural buildings. Earth can be found everywhere, and, as\na result, it used to be said that the majority of the world’s population still lived in earth buildings (Keefe, 2005). Of course,\nconcrete and bricks are made of material from the earth, but what will be discussed here are structures that are made of earth\nin its most natural state, with a minimum amount of treatment or processing (Wenzel, 1996). Strong prevailing sandy winds\nprovoke a builder’s response, resulting in lower, blind fac ¸ades, flatter buildings offering less resistance and thus less prone to\nbuilding damage and human discomfort. Experiences from the old building process show that malleable building materials\ncan be employed when the climate is humid and are rigid when the climate is dry. Usually wet clay is used directly, mixed\nwith Straw, and perhaps given more body by adding gravel or stone. This is prominent in areas of the world where earth\nA. Almusaed, A.

A compositions clay and straw are main building materials from northern and Eastern part of Basra.\nbuildings may have a relatively short life as part of a nomadic existence. When abandoned, they will not leave anything\nunpleasant behind (Wenzel, 1996). The extraction of clay, especially on a site where a house is due to be created, is a zero-\ncarbon solution for construction, and clay and straw walls and floors can be used as a direct substitute for mass concrete\n(Marchell and Leary, 1974).\nThe ‘‘Al-Zubeir House, Unit’’ building, in its architecture without architects, notes that inexperienced builders fitted their\nwork to the local environment and topography. Basra’s vast variety of environments and local microclimate assures a\ncorrespondingly wide range of a reply. The beauty of the ‘‘Al-Zubeir House Units’’ design derives less from self-conscious\ndecorative attempts than from unadulterated, practical outlines produced by adapting regional material to be as economical\nas possible, resisting aggressive environmental elements and employing beneficial ones. Habitats from an Al-Zubeir district\nare truly vernacular, utilising only slightly altered material from its immediate surroundings. Rural, desert architecture is\nremarkable for its sculptural shapes achieved in clay.\n5.3.2. Technical house description\nIn this zone, edifices have to be planned with great attention and thought and with due respect for climate. Shade and\nprotection from dust storms may have the highest priority in some areas, whereas in other regions, ventilation and the\ntrapping of air currents and breeze are the primary considerations (Kukreja, 1978) (see Fig. 11). The courtyard space is an\nessential element in the habitat from zone III, where all habitat functions are allocated together and are oriented towards the\ncourtyard. Intimacy is necessary in cultural life. All primary functions are oriented towards the house courtyard directly. The\nunit involves just one level (Fig. 12).\nFig. 12.

The conglomeration of buildings\ncreates a progression of private space, which is enclosed by a clay wall; therefore, a courtyard is created by this process\n(Jensen, 1997). The system was developed for individual utility, free of fixed rules. Each building is oriented in relation to its\nneighbours.\n5.3.3. House environmental impacts\nThe principal building material applied is clay and straw. Table 4 shows the different material used in house compositions\nand the percentage of materials in layers.\nThe house material components are environmentally friendly and better employed in energy-efficiency features.\n6. Conclusion\nDefining the qualities of an environment is neither easy nor absolute. They vary with time and change as people’s\nexpectations and education changes. Moreover, adapting to a new-architectural idea with a vernacular conception is difficult\nfor many architects who have been educated in a culture that despises the aesthetics of what they see as ‘twee’ vernacular\ncottages. Incidentally, the aesthetic and functional housing opportunities remain innumerable and fun opportunities.\nRespect is given a high priority. Strategies to reduce environmental impacts can and should vary depending on the site. The\nselection of building materials is, overall, crucial because there is little difference in the material’s environmental impacts\nand because they play a vital role both architecturally and in terms of the impact on the external environment near a\nresidential use. For instance, the term ‘‘environmentally compatible’’ suggests that acceptable effects for humans and\necosystems can still be achieved with maximum amounts of emissions and limited contamination. This study discusses the\nrequirements of building materials suitable for bio-climatic building in West Asia, where the meaning of the contemporary\nbuilding category is an application of the bio-climatic concept, which is very complex. Everywhere, sustainable home\nthinking about the environmental impacts in the overall processes is implicit in houses.\nBasra had three different microclimates (a marshland district, desert region and regular hot climate in the city centre).\nThis study tries to investigate an existing habitat in the Iraq–Iran area that has different microclimates. Vernacular building\nmaterials such as clay, brick, straw and wood, are the most popular building materials used in this region. The Ecology of\nBuilding Materials is a challenge regarding the possibilities for existing materials and the evaluation of new materials.\nNevertheless, a complete ecological structure does not exist. However, a building can always be made more ecological and\nless environmentally impactful. The principal conclusion of the study shows that:\ni. The local microclimate directly influences the conformation of habitat. Therefore, the choice of building materials takes a\nhigh priority in the building process. Clay and straw, breeds, and brick are most frequently applied building materials.\nii. Natural materials were used efficiently in vernacular houses. It is clear that when insulating habitats; the interrelated\nenvironmental impact of the selection of insulation materials is not relevant compared to the savings in energy.\n54\nA. Almusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–54\niii. Acclimatisation has a greater impact on the environment than building materials.\niv. Heavy materials (Bricks) used in the exterior or interior reduce energy requirements. In contrast, clay- and reed-based\nmaterials have a lower material-related environmental impact.\nv. To support the meaning of the building in the residual value of the primary fabric, maintenance and repairs must be\ncarried out on all components corresponding to their specific renewal cycles.\nvi. For future research, the life cycle of building materials by focusing on the experiences of vernacular houses from this zone\nshould be increased the create a creative intervention where innovative material can be used in new buildings with an\nincreasing life cycle of current materials.\nvii. Brick, clay and wooden constructions should be improved to occupy a more considerable place in our residential\nbuildings than they do today.\nThe objective of the study is to assist architects and designers in selecting suitable solutions in terms of building\nmaterials. In addition to studying different building materials from various sources and their characteristic, it is necessary to\nadapt to traditional materials in modern, innovative applications and create a good solution in terms of building materials for\nWest Asia specifically.",

This study carefully examines how\nenvironmentally friendly materials support sustainable building practices, emphasizing three key areas of\ninvestigation: the broad spectrum of feasible green materials, the quantitative differences in emissions between\ngreen and conventional materials, and the overall effect of these materials on the economy and health. The study\nemploys a robust quantitative approach, leveraging numerical optimization and detailed analyses to explore a\nwide array of environmental resources, including recycled, renewable, and low-impact options. A comparison\nbetween materials is completed, offering refined insights into the environmental benefits of green materials\nacross the entire life cycle-from manufacturing to lifecycle. The primary findings highlight the observable\nbenefits of using these materials and demonstrate how they can drastically lower emissions and environmental\neffects. It offers verifiable proof of the viability of removing dangerous exposures and promoting healthier indoor\nenvironments by utilizing environmentally friendly materials. The graphical information and numerical findings\nthat are provided in this paper form the basis for putting workable and significant strategies into action. The\nresults support the broad use of green materials by providing evidence of their beneficial effects on economic\ngrowth, environmental preservation, and human health. The strong quantitative evidence highlights the applicability\nof these suggestions and offers a convincing case for incorporating sustainable practices in the building\nindustry.\n1. Introduction\nHuman activities are causing serious environmental damage,\nincluding tsunamis, wildfires, floods, and droughts. These are all exacerbated\nby global warming, which is causing the sea level to rise and the\nozone layer to deplete. Depleted ozone increases the risk of skin cancer,\nand can have an adverse effect on the plantation and soil. Greenhouse\ngases also impact the ozone layer. For instance, carbon dioxide can\ncontribute to the development of polar stratospheric clouds, which can\nquicken the rate of ozone depletion (Arnesson, 2019). A source of carbon\ndioxide production is the building construction sector. The construction\nindustry is booming in urban areas due to the growing number of people\nliving in cities (Ghalandari et al., 2023). In 1950, there were 751 million\nurban dwellers; by 2030, that number is expected to reach 5 billion\nleading to a dramatic rise in construction, and hence construction materials.\nMillions of tons of wastage are generated annually from these\nbuilding supplies. Greenhouse gases are exacerbated throughout the\nconstruction process, from raw material extraction to final disposal\n(Cheng et al., 2016). The materials used in a building’s envelope (outer\nshell of the building), can have a significant impact on the amount of\nenergy the building uses and the amount of greenhouse gases it emits.\nThe materials selected, how they are used, and the quality of construction\nall have a part in determining a building’s energy performance\n(Agencia Internacional de Energía, 2018). Emissions from the construction\nindustry are largely attributable to the manufacturing of\ncarbon-intensive materials like concrete and steel (Batayneh et al.,\n2007). According to research conducted in 2010 by Hui Yan (Hui Yan\net al., 2010), the production, transport, and use of energy for construction\nequipment account for 98.6–99.2 percent of all emissions. Of\nthis total, 81.6–86.7 percent are embodied GHG emissions, 6.1–8.4\npercent are from transportation for building materials, and 6.4–8.6\npercent are from energy use. Mavi et al. (Kiani Mavi et al., 2021) claim\nthat construction has a disproportionately harmful impact on the environment,\nand this problem is more pronounced in less developed nations.\nIn Malaysia, construction accounts for 24% of CO2 emissions\n(Klufallah et al., 2016), in India, it accounts for 53.4 % of national CO2\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: mirfasil@nitsri.ac.in (F.Q.

Mir\nemissions (Sharma et al., 2011), and in Nigeria, emissions from construction\nand manufacturing industries increased from 2557 to 23714\nGg of CO2 equivalent between 2000 and 2015, an approximately 827%\nincrease (FRN, 2018). According to the research conducted by Tirth\net al. (2019), steel, bricks, cement, and concrete collectively account for\nroughly 66% of the aggregate emissions, while other\nconstruction-related sources account for 74% of all emissions. According\nto a 2014 study by Guzman et al. (Solís-Guzm´\nan et al., 2009), construction\naccounts for 40% of annual waste production and materials\nconsumption in the European Union. Based on the findings of the 4th\nAssessment Report conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC) (Reay et al., 2007), it was determined that\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originating from buildings accounted\nfor a total of 8.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\n(t-CO2-e) in the year 2004. According to Mardiana et al. (SB, 2015),\nprojections indicate that the total carbon dioxide equivalent emissions\n(t-CO2-e) could potentially reach a value of 15.6 billion by the year\n2030. This would result in a 26% rise in carbon dioxide emissions, which\nwould account for around 30–40% of the overall greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn a study conducted by Ezema et al. it was found that buildings\ncontribute to approximately 33% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions\nassociated with energy use, amounting to 7.85 gigatons (Gt). It is\nanticipated that the emissions will experience a rise from 11 to 15.6 Gt\nby 2030. (Ezema et al., 2016). The materials used in external walls,\nupper floor constructions, and ceilings are particularly\nemissions-intensive, accounting for 84.2% of the total emissions from a\nbuilding. For example, the embodied energy of steel is about 32 MJ per\nkilogram and for cement is about 7.8 MJ per kilogram. If the consumption\nof construction materials does not change, the world’s cement\nproduction could reach 3.5 billion metric tons by 2050. Fig. 1 depicts the\nCO2 emission condition of the major construction materials, as found in\nstudies of Wu et al. and Zhu et al. (Wu et al., 2023) (Zhu and Chen, 2010)\nregarding the matter of environmental pollutants and life cycle energy\nconsumption associated with the manufacturing of materials utilized in\nresidential building. It is evident that aluminum produces larger quantity\nof carbon-dioxide emissions and timber produces higher rate of\nwaste.\nOver time, scholars have directed their attention towards the integration\nof building materials that are reusable, recyclable, or biodegradable.\nThis approach aims to mitigate the negative impacts of waste\ngeneration, pollution, and energy consumption. Examples of such materials\ninclude wood, earthen materials, bricks, crushed or recycled\nconcrete, Gypsum or Drywall, Straw Bale Insulation, Wool Carpet, and\nResults in Surfaces and Interfaces 14 (2024) 100206\nLinoleum Flooring. The study conducted by Irshidat and Al-Nuaimi examines\nthe effects of using carbon dust, a byproduct of aluminum facilities,\ninto the production of cementitious composites (Irshidat and\nAl-Nuaimi). Work on the physical characteristics of a three-component\nmineral binder, consisting of hydrated lime and cement bypass dust,\nwhich is a residual material generated during cement manufacturing has\nbeen done (Owsiak et al., 2020). Glass debris was utilized as a fine\naggregate by Jing et al. (2020) in architectural mortar, while Wang et al.\n(2020) examined the micro-properties and mechanical properties of\nstrain-hardening cementitious composites incorporating recycled brick\npowder. The study conducted by Srimahachota et al. (2020) presents\ncompelling evidence on the considerable potential of utilizing recycled\nnylon fibers derived from discarded fishing nets as a reinforcing agent in\ncement-based products. The utilization of plastic waste in various\nmanners is elucidated by webb et al. (Webb et al., 2013), who conducted\na study on the influence of plastic biomineralization on the resilience of\nplastic-reinforced brickwork. Wang et al. investigated the interfacial\nbonding activity between steel and sawdust by analyzing the mechanical\nand micro characteristics of cementitious composites (Liu et al., 2021).\nMultiple studies have been conducted by researchers worldwide to\ninvestigate carbon emissions resulting from the construction of different\ntypes of structures. A compilation of select studies is presented in Table 1\nand the LCA method is also shown in Fig. 2. Table 2 displays a compilation\nof research that have been examined in relation to the carbon\nfootprints of different construction materials.\nIn order to reduce the environmental ramifications of the construction\nsector, it is imperative to foster the advancement of novel construction\nmaterials characterized by reduced emissions. The sustainable\ndevelopment strategy pertaining to construction materials involves the\nefficient utilization of those resources, while simultaneously dealing\nwith the adverse environmental consequences associated with their\nproduction and utilization (Frontczak and Wargocki, 2011). A green\nbuilding material is designed for the same purpose and eventually the\ngreen building movement seeks to design, construct, and operate\nbuildings that have a minimal impact on the environment and human\nhealth (Fithian and Sheets). Guna et al. (kumar Guna et al., 2021)\nexplained how to make gypsum ceiling tiles using wool and coconut\ncoir, two inexpensive and biodegradable resources. Sugarcane fiber and\noil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) fiber have both been claimed to be\nuseful as wall insulation against the cold (Rama Rao and Ramakrishna,\n2022). Several studies have shown that bio-based insulating concretes\ncan be made by recycling agricultural lignocellulosic materials and\nnatural fiber as bio-aggregates (Asdrubali et al., 2015)– (Sui and Liu,\nFig. 1.

Rice straws have been utilized as a means to construct hollow\ngypsum blocks, with the objective of producing exceptionally lightweight\nwalls (Singh et al., 2022). Sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) is an\nefficient supplementary cementitious material (SCM) that has been\nstudied for its slump, water absorption, porosity, microstructure, and\nmechanical properties in the production of green concretes (Agwa et al.,\n2022). Many studies by Bheel et al. and Rid et al. have called for the\nreplacement of traditional cement with abundant agricultural and industrial\nwaste, such as sugar cane bagasse, regenerated coal from waste,\neggshell powder, and fly ash, in order to reduce dependency on\nnon-renewable materials and minimize CO2 emissions (Bheel et al.,\n2022), (Rid et al., 2022). Krishna et al. (2020) looked into the best way\nto boost the ductility of concrete by incorporating coconut coir fibers,\nand they found that adding 1.5 percent of these fibers yielded the best\nresults. They also found that using sisal fibers yielded the best results for\nboosting the strength of concrete. It has been found that lightweight\nconcrete reinforced with natural fibers can significantly reduce heating\nand cooling costs (Asim et al., 2020). Lei Gu and Togay (Gu and\nOzbakkaloglu, 2016) collated studies on the effects of plastic waste\naddition on concrete’s characteristics and shape, as well as on plastic\nwaste recycling methods. The use of recycled waste materials in pavement\nconcrete was examined by Toghroli et al., in 2018 (Shariati et al.,\n2018). Recycled materials such as crushed glass, steel slag, steel fiber,\ntires, plastics, and asphalt have all been examined for their potential\nreuse. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and marble dust have been used\nto create composites for building (Krishna et al., 2020). According to\nanother study by Haque and Islam (2021), PET plastic bricks were utilized\nto construct the Rohingya refugee camp. Another effort to lessen\nthe world’s reliance on fossil fuels, which contribute to greenhouse gas\nemissions (GHG), net-zero emissions buildings (NZEBs) have gained\ntraction. In order to qualify as a NZEB, a building must have both a high\nlevel of energy efficiency and the ability to generate enough\nemission-free renewable energy to cover its energy needs for an established\namount of time (Jaysawal et al., 2022). The American Institute of\nArchitects (AIA) has put up a plan for a zero-emissions built environment\nby the year 2030. This paper is focused on the review of use of\n3\nT. Tazmeen and F.Q.

Green building materials\nSustainable development encompasses a set of objectives that\nconverge into three fundamental dimensions, referred to as the 3Ps:\nenvironmental, economic, and social pillars. The concept of sustainability,\nas outlined by Barbier (1987) (Barbier and Burgess, 2017),\nemphasizes the potential trade-offs that exist between various economic,\nenvironmental, and social objectives, each having their own positive or\nnegative implications. Green building materials refer to materials that\noffer suitable performance and durability, requiring minimal maintenance,\nwhile simultaneously reducing the extraction of raw materials,\npollution generated during manufacturing and use, and energy consumption.\nAdditionally, these materials possess the highest potential for\nreuse or resource recovery (Rousseau).\nresistant to moisture and pressure, and comparable in performance to\nstandard plastic foams. Yuanyuan et al. introduced the use of translucent\nwood whose formation they mentioned in Biomacromolecules (Li et al.,\n2016). This procedure necessitates the elimination of lignin, a substance\ncontained in the cell walls of wood. The glass in windows might be\nreplaced with this translucent wood, which would make them cheaper\nand stronger. In addition to letting in natural light, the varying degrees\nof transparency in these windows also offer a measure of privacy.\n2.1. Wood, bamboo, and straw bales\nWood possesses numerous advantages in comparison to contemporary\nindustrial building materials such as concrete or steel, including\nlower upfront costs, greater ease of construction, a more aesthetically\npleasing final product, and a longer useful life span provided it is kept\ndry and free of pests (Becker et al., 2011). Even though wood may bend\nunder pressure without losing its integrity, it is at its strongest when\nsqueezed vertically (Pacheco-Torgal and Labrincha, 2013). It has the\nmuch-desired ability to dampen noise and echoes, making it a valuable\ncommodity. High-density rice straw elements coated in cement skins\nhave been subjected to several tests (Thormark, 2006). After undergoing\na 2-h fire testing procedure, it was seen that straw bales coated with\ncement plaster exhibited structural integrity, as neither the flame nor\nsufficiently high temperatures to ignite the interior straw of the bales\nwere able to penetrate through the plaster to the opposite side. Scientists\nfrom the Fraunhofer Institute (Sharma et al., 2011), and Wilhelm\nKlauditz-Institute (WKI) in Braunschweig have created a new type of\nwood-insulating foam with exceptional properties. Instead of utilizing\nconventional high-impact plastic foams derived from petrochemical\nsources, this alternative wood foam can serve as a viable substitute.\n(Krieg et al., 2014). This resulting wood foam is highly insulating,\n2.2. Concrete\nThe inherent environmental sustainability of concrete as a construction\nmedium is well recognized; nonetheless, environmental concerns\nmostly arise from the inclusion of cementitious elements in its\ncomposition. Approximately one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) is\nreleased into the atmosphere during the production of each metric ton of\nPortland cement. It is estimated that about 7% of all carbon dioxide\nemissions worldwide come from the cement sector (Malhotra, 1999).\nThe utilization of fly ash as a significant pozzolan in conjunction with\nPortland cement is a convenient option. The utilization of fly ash in\nconcrete mixtures offers several noteworthy advantages; including a low\nheat of hydration, improved strength and durability characteristics,\ncost-effectiveness, and a proportional decrease in CO2 emissions (Iqbal\nand Jahangir, 2017). The utilization of recycled concrete as aggregate is\na viable resolution to the challenges associated with the extraction of\nnatural aggregates from quarries and the management of waste concrete\n(Bazant et al., 2000). To make new concrete mixes, crushed concrete\naggregate can be recycled. The slump value of recycled concrete mixtures\ndecreases dramatically because crumbled concrete absorbs more\nwater than new coarse material. Recycled aggregates’ surface irregularities\nalso reduce their workability in mixes. Using a superplasticizer in\na concrete mixture greatly reduces the aforementioned complications. If\ntaken into account during the planning phase, a 13% drop in compressive\nstrength caused by using 20% recycled crushed concrete could be\nacceptable (Batayneh et al., 2007). One of the green building materials\nthat has been approved as being good for the environment is autoclaved\naerated concrete (AAC). Porous, non-toxic, renewable, and recyclable,\nAAC can be used over and over again (Kalaipandian et al., 2018). The\nbyproduct of thermal generating plants, fly ash, is used by AAC. While\ntypical clay bricks require 8 kg of coal to produce one square foot of\ncarpet area, AAC blocks only require 1 kg (Khandve and Rathi, 2015). To\n4\nT. Tazmeen and F.Q. Mir\nreduce energy consumption and pollution produced by regular cement,\nresearchers from Mexico’s Michoacan University of San Nicol´\nas de Hidalgo\ndeveloped a special cement that collects solar energy during the\nday and emits it at night (Han et al., 2017). Roads, highways, bike\nroutes, and buildings could all benefit from the illumination provided by\nthis phosphorescent cement. This revolutionary cement doesn’t fade in\nthe sun and has a 100-year lifespan. Martian concrete is 100% recyclable,\nuses no water, and is made from a combination of sulfur and raw\nminerals found in the Martian crust (Ghalandari et al., 2023). By\nincorporating bacteria into a base of sand, water, and trash,\nself-repairing concrete has been developed. This makes it possible for\nconcrete to fix tiny cracks all by itself, without any help from humans\n(Jonkers and Schlangen, 2007). Designers have created a smog-eating\ncement that can withstand the effects of air pollutants over time. Cassar,\n2014 conducted laboratory experiments and field research to\nconclude that a smog-eating cement façade on a five-story structure\nwould increase construction costs by 15% but decrease air pollution by\n20%. That means that air pollution could be cut in half if all the buildings\nin a major city were constructed with this material.\n2.3. Recycled tires\nBefore people learned they could reuse old tires as construction\nmaterials, many discarded them instead of recycling them. Shredded,\nchipped, ground, or crumb rubber is utilized in cement composites and\nconcrete for recycling (Bazant et al., 2000). A recycled tire crumb is a\nviable option for enhancing a variety of flooring types. By guaranteeing\nthe necessary technical performance (such as moisture/vapor transfer,\nflammability, etc.), they can also be employed commercially on a wide\nscale as part of a roofing system (Malhotra, 1999). Crumbed rubbers are\nparticularly useful as a waterproof membrane/damp-proof course to\nprevent water from seeping through the ground. According to Baricevic\net al. each year, waste tyres yield over 250,000 tonnes of recycled tyre\npolymer fibre. Concrete has scattered reinforcement made of a variety of\ntypical fibre kinds, including carbon, nylon, steel, polypropylene, glass,\netc. As a result, recycled discarded tyres can provide a sustainable\nsubstitute for these common fibres, lowering building costs and detrimental\nconsequences on the ecosystem (Bariˇ cevi´\nc et al., 2018). As per\nHambirao and Rakaraddi (2014), shredded rubber fibres can serve as a\nsuitable replacement for reinforcement in deep foundations and raft\nfoundations, resulting in increased unconfined compressive strength at\noptimal replacement ratios (Hambirao and Rakaraddi, 2014).\n2.4. Ground granulated blast furnace slag\nGround Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) is a substance\nderived from the steel industry. It is a glassy granular material that is\nproduced when molten blast furnace slag is rapidly cooled, typically\nthrough water immersion (Ainie Mat Dom et al., 2022). GGBFS exhibits\ncementitious qualities and possesses a specific gravity of 2.9. Experimental\nresults have shown that the optimal degree of cement replacement\nranges from approximately 50% to as high as 70% and 80% in\ncertain cases. Similar to fly ash, this one also improves the mechanical\nand durability properties of concrete while decreasing the heat of hydration.\nConcrete made using GGBS cement has higher ultimate strength\nand a larger concentration of the strength-boosting calcium silicate\nhydrates (CSH) than concrete made with Portland cement. Hwan and\nLin found that GGBFS has cementitious properties, making it a potential\nhigh-percentage substitute for cement (Hwang and Lin, 1986). Macphee\nraised concerns about the potential for corrosion of steel reinforcement\nin concrete containing slag cement due to changes in the pore solution.\nHowever, the study also suggests that the altered pore structure of slag\nconcrete may actually help to reduce corrosion by increasing the resistivity\nof the concrete (Macphee and Cao, 1993). Hussain (Hussain\net al., 1995) reported that increasing the C3A content in concrete from\n2% to 14% led to a 2.43-fold and 2.45-fold increase in chloride binding\nResults in Surfaces and Interfaces 14 (2024) 100206\ncapacity and reinforcement corrosion initiation time, respectively. This\nsuggests that C3A plays a crucial role in enhancing concrete’s resistance\nto chloride ingress and corrosion protection of embedded steel. Yeau and\nKim (2005) investigated the impact of GGBFS replacement on the\ncorrosion resistance of two Portland cement types (I and V) through\nvarious tests like permeability, diffusivity, and corrosion area analysis.\nThey concluded that Type I cement concrete exhibited lower permeability\nand protected the steel better compared to Type V. Increasing\nGGBFS replacement in Type I further enhanced its corrosion resistance\nagainst chloride ingress and potential steel damage.\n2.5. Glass bricks\nThis invention, as documented in the Glass Structures & Engineering\njournal (Oikonomopoulou et al., 2018), endeavors to amalgamate the\nconventional architectural style of the city with the global architecture\nprevalent in major urban centers. Within the structure, a deliberate\narrangement of glass bricks and traditional clay bricks is observed in a\nslow alternation as one ascends, creating an illusion of the building\nlevitating over the roadway (Oikonomopoulou et al., 2018). Advanced\nlaser technology was employed to cut bricks, while laboratory-grade UV\nlamps were utilized to facilitate the curing process of the adhesive\nemployed in compacting the bricks. Milk was employed due to its\ndiminished transparency, rendering it a suitable liquid for the creation\nof reflected surfaces and the first leveling of bricklayers. The glass bricks\nexhibit exceptional durability, surpassing that of concrete, and possess\nthe ability to endure the impact of a vehicular collision. Indeed, the glass\nconstruction was found to possess superior strength compared to concrete,\nas demonstrated by the strength tests conducted by the team from\nDelft University of Technology. One of the primary benefits associated\nwith glass is its total recyclability. As an illustration, during the installation\nprocess, several flawed bricks were subjected to melting and\nsubsequent remolding.\n2.6. Eco-friendly tiles\nAn environmentally friendly tile that can be used as an alternative to\ntraditional flooring because it is made using less energy. When\ncompared to regular tile, the price is far lower. They are simple to install\nand come in a wide variety of designs to meet the needs of any customer.\nThis tile enhances the efficiency of the interior environment. When\ncompared to traditional tiles, eco-friendly options are more affordable\nsince they are produced on-site, eliminating the need for costly transportation\n(Bakhoum et al., 2015).\n2.7. Biocomposites\nBiodegradable materials are manufactured from renewable resources\nthat break down when exposed to microbes, leaving behind only\ninnocuous byproducts (Energy). Natural fibers are used in bio-composite\nreinforcement, whereas biopolymers are used in bio-composite matrices\n(Energy) (Wong et al., 2002). In comparison to the polymeric matrix,\nnatural fibers are more rigid and robust. PHB is an organic and biodegradable\npolymer that has many benefits over petrochemical plastics,\nsuch as biodegradability, the use of a low-cost renewable carbon source\n(sugar or corn starch), the use of less energy during production, and the\nrelease of fewer greenhouse gas emissions throughout its life cycle.\nNatural fibers (NFs) are a viable choice as a reinforcing element for\nbio-composites owing to their relatively high specific strength and\nstiffness. Kenaf is a bast fiber with huge potential as a reinforcing fiber in\ncomposites and a priority for choosing green materials, as it absorbs\nmore carbon dioxide than any other plant (one ton of kenaf absorbs 1.5\ntons of ambient CO2) (Akil et al., 2011). The most significant studies\nexamining the characteristics and roles of bast fibers in composites and\nbio-composites are shown in Table 3, proving that these entirely\nbio-based materials can be used safely and effectively in building.\n5\nT.

(2007)\nKhan et al. (1999)\n2.8. Insulated concrete forms (ICF)\nInsulated concrete forms (ICFs) consist of a construction system\nwherein layers of insulation materials are utilized to encase concrete\nwalls. The aforementioned technology exhibits a high level of energy\nefficiency while concurrently enhancing the structural integrity of the\nwalls. This is recognized for its robustness and extended lifespan. The\nmaterial is mostly utilized as a construction component in low-rise\nstructures intended for residential and commercial purposes. U.S.\nHousing and Urban Development Carried Out a Study in 2001 revealed\nthat the cost of modular construction is approximately 3–5% more\ncompared to traditional building methods (Bazant et al., 2000). Apart\nfrom cost considerations, there are numerous performance advantages\nsuch as fire resistance and energy efficiency.\n3. Emissions of green building materials concerning\nconventional building materials\nIn this section, several scholarly articles were examined. The selection\nof these articles was based on their ability to effectively demonstrate\nthe advantages associated with the construction of sustainable\nbuildings. These studies highlight the potential and advantages of\nadopting a sustainability-focused strategy for building in a fast-emerging\ncountry seeing significant growth in its construction industry. Both\npublications examined prototypes constructed using environmentally\nfriendly building materials as well as conventional materials. In their\nstudy, Bakhoum et al. (2015)utilized a Sustainable Decision Support\nSystem (SDSS) to conduct a comparative analysis of different structural\nbuilding materials. On the other hand, Lalit Srikar (Srikar et al., 2022)\nemployed Auto CAD 2021 and SketchUp software for rendering the\ndesign of building models, while STACK software was utilized for\nquantity and cost calculation purposes. Bakhoum et al. examined the\nsustainability evaluation of materials throughout three distinct periods\nof their life cycle: production, construction, and demolition. Life cycle\ninventory (LCI) information for building materials in both green and\ntraditional structural systems is displayed in Fig. 3. The findings from\nBakhoum et al.’s paper (SDSS) indicate that the Eco-friendly system\noutperformed the traditional method throughout all three phases. The\ndata presented in Fig. 4 demonstrates that the environmentally\nconscious system showcased 64.7%, 64.4%, and 84.6% sustainability\nrates for the manufacturing, construction, and demolition stages,\nrespectively. In contrast, the conventional system achieved sustainability\npercentages of 54%, 63.9%, and 75.7% for the same phases.\nThe scores for sustainable elements in the two studied systems are\ndepicted in Fig. 5. The Ecofriendly system exhibited higher sustainable\nscores across all sustainable factors in comparison to the conventional\nsystem. This can be attributed to the significantly greater quantities of\nmaterials utilized in the latter system, with conventional materials\nFig. 3. LCI statistics for recycled materials.\n6\nT. Tazmeen and F.Q. Mir\nResults in Surfaces and Interfaces 14 (2024) 100206\nFig. 4. Sustainable evaluation of Eco-friendly and conventional systems through the different phases.\nFig. 5. Sustainable factors scores for Eco-friendly and conventional systems (Phase I.\nexceeding eco-friendly materials by more than 2.5 times. The Eco-\nfriendly method had a greater resources/waste factor score compared\nto the traditional system, with a difference of 9% in phase II and 35% in\nphase III, representing the highest disparity observed between these\nphases. However, the Eco-friendly system had a drop of 6% in its reuse\nfactor score during phase III, when compared to the traditional method.\nAccording to the results obtained from the Sustainable Development\nSustainability System (SDSS), the eco-friendly system demonstrated a\nhigher sustainability rank of 67% compared to the conventional system,\nwhich achieved a sustainability rank of 56%. This information is visually\nshown in Fig. 6.\nLalit Srikar in his paper offered a comparison table of embodied\nenergy as well as a comparison chart of power usage. According to the\ndata presented in Fig. 7, the calculation of embodied carbon indicates\nthat the sustainable construction model has the potential to achieve\nannual savings of up to 36.5%. This measure will significantly ease the\nenvironmental consequences associated with the construction of the\nstructure. The utilization of locally sourced materials can contribute to\nthe enhancement of the local economy. The incorporation of several\nsustainable features such as a solar power system, rainwater harvesting,\nand the use of alternative building materials significantly reduces the\nelectricity consumption of the sustainable building. The annual savings\npercentage was determined to be 44.4% as visible from Fig. 8.\nYu-Hsiang et al. (Cheng et al., 2015) compared and tested eight\nbuilding materials (ceiling, cabinetry, flooring): calcium silicate, mineral\nfiber, gypsum, and wood, each in both conventional and \"green\"\n7\nT. Tazmeen and F.Q. Mir\nResults in Surfaces and Interfaces 14 (2024) 100206\nFig. 6. Overall sustainable evaluation for eco-friendly and conventional systems.\nFig. 7. Embodied energy comparison chart.\nversions. Green materials exhibited lower primary emissions of carbonyls\nand BTEX, along with reduced molar yields and secondary\ncarbonyl emissions, especially for wood flooring and gypsum board.\nBoth green and conventional pairs reacted with ozone. While conventional\nmaterials are typically cheaper, green options boast lower VOC\nemissions. Fleecy and porous materials displayed higher ozone reactivity\ncompared to smooth and nonporous surfaces. The observed secondary\nemissions suggest moderate indoor ozone concentrations can\nsignificantly increase carbonyl levels, particularly formaldehyde and\nacetaldehyde, potentially raising chronic health concerns for some materials\n(CSB, WF, GCSB, GGB). This emphasizes the need for improved\nbuilding material testing protocols to encompass heterogeneous\nozone-material interactions.\nSu et al. (2021) researched green building technologies in Dalian and\nfound that high-performance building envelopes (outer layers) were the\nmost cost-effective and impactful, with 73% adoption. While green\nmaterials are good for the environment, they must also meet basic\nhuman needs for wider green building acceptance. The current focus for\ncarbon emission reduction is improving the effectiveness of green materials\nso they can effectively replace traditional materials with high\nenergy consumption and emissions in construction. Zhao et al.’s (Zhao\net al., 2020) work highlights the immense potential of energy theory in\nguiding the development of sustainable construction materials. By\nprioritizing green concrete and continuously improving its efficiency,\nwe can pave the way for a future where our built environment thrives in\nharmony with our planet. Wu et al. (2017) in their research delves into\nthe carbon emissions of green buildings, pitting them against their\nnon-green counterparts. Using a sophisticated life cycle assessment\napproach fueled by the BELES(Building Environmental Load Evaluation\nSystem) platform and data from 26 real buildings, the study yields\nrevealing findings: Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) systems reign supreme\nin minimizing Life Cycle Carbon Emissions (LCCO2) for both\nresidential and commercial buildings, Green commercial buildings shine\nbrighter, boasting a 32% reduction in LCCO2 compared to their\nnon-green counterparts. Residential green buildings also contribute, but\nwith a 10% drop. This suggests more potent carbon-reduction strategies\nwithin the commercial green realm.\n8\nT. Tazmeen and F.Q.

Green building materials and health\nThe impact of construction materials on human health is an unavoidable\nfactor. However, the shift from traditional building materials\nto environmentally friendly materials has been implemented in order to\nmitigate the overall impact on human health in both indoor and outdoor\nsettings. The utilization of green building materials (GBMs) including\nnon-toxic, natural, and organic components has promise in addressing\nthe decline in indoor air quality (IAQ) and minimizing the overall\nnegative effects on human health (Persily, 2015). Previous studies have\nprimarily concentrated on examining the effects of incorporating environmentally\nfriendly design, materials, and building methods on the\nwell-being and efficiency of individuals who ultimately utilize a given\nfacility. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a\ncomprehensive guideline to enhance indoor air quality (IAQ) standards.\nBased on the established guidelines, indoor pollution originates from\nfour primary sources. The available resources include building materials,\nhousehold electrical appliances, heaters, and soot generated by\nculinary activities. According to LIQUN and Yanqun (Liqun and Yanqun,\n2011), buildings and ornamental materials were identified as the primary\ncontributors to indoor pollution. The primary detrimental effects\narising from these sources are radioactive and chemical contamination.\nDecorative materials and elements, such as brick walls, stones, and\nconcrete, have the potential to emit radioactive substances. Chemical\ncontamination emanates from various sources, including the textile,\npaint, and glue industries. Both of these factors have the potential to\ncontribute to the development of cancer over an extended period, posing\na significant risk to the health of individuals residing in the affected\nenvironment, particularly youngsters. Indoor chemical pollutants and\ntheir negative effects are given in Table 4.\nAs per the United States Green Building Council (2006), \"green\nbuilding\" refers to a set of practices that aim to lessen adverse effects on\nthe environment and the economy. Surveying the building’s inhabitants\nis the quickest and easiest technique to gauge IEQ and gauge their level\nof contentment within it (Ramsay et al., 1990). The Center for the Built\nEnvironment at the University of California, Berkeley developed a tool\ncalled \"cognitive interviewing\" to test the comprehension and accuracy\nof replies from building occupants in several research (Huizenga et al.,\n2003). Across the board, research shows that people who work in\nLEED-certified buildings are happier with the conditions in those facilities.\nUnlike Altomonte et al. (Altomonte, 2013), Huizenga et al. (2003),\nLee et al. (Zakeri et al., 2022), and Abbaszadeh et al. (2006) all\ndiscovered that inhabitants of LEED buildings reported greater satisfaction\nwith thermal comfort. When comparing the lighting and\nacoustics of various building styles, neither Huizenga nor Abbaszadeh\nidentified any statistically significant differences. The literature review\non the topic of green buildings and health is summarized in Table 5. The\nliterature on the correlation between green construction materials and\nIEQ metrics is summarized in Table 6.\n5. Impact of green building materials on economics\nNalewaik and Venters (2010) found that when green sustainable\nbuildings first entered the public consciousness, there was a consensus\nthat they were more expensive to construct. According to Aneta (Mesjasz-Lech\nand Włodarczyk, 2022), many property owners are not reaping\nthe financial benefits of green building construction or retrofits because\nthey are not employing energy-efficient technologies or sustainable\noperational approaches. According to Buys and Hurbissoon (Buys and\nHurbissoon), it’s important to take into account both direct and indirect\nTable 4\nMajor indoor air pollutants and their negative effects.\nPollutants Negative Effects References\nBenzene Toluene Xylene Ethylbenzene Styrene HCHO Bone marrow damage, thrombopenia, leukopenia, anemia Extremely toxic to the liver, blood, nerves, and mental health.

Lower operating\nexpenses, higher capital values, and more rental revenue are all advantages\nof a green building. Eco-friendly structures improve not just\nthe health of the building’s inhabitants, but also their productivity,\nmarketability, and public perception as a whole. In Table 7 we see the\nmonetary gains from using environmentally friendly construction\nmethods and materials.\n6. Conclusion\nThis paper comprehensively explores the impact of green materials\non sustainable development in the context of building construction. By\nciting a multitude of studies and drawing upon diverse sources, the\npaper underscores the myriad advantages associated with this transformative\nconstruction methodology. Key discussion points include the\ndiverse benefits of green materials, ranging from a notable decrease in\nenvironmental impact to improvements in the physical and mental\nhealth of occupants. The paper emphasizes the crucial role of green\nmaterials as instruments for sustainability, aligning strongly with international\nobjectives related to climate change, resource preservation,\nand resilient communities. Furthermore, it delves into the positive effects\non carbon footprint reduction and energy efficiency, ultimately\nleading to significant cost reductions over a building’s lifespan.\nAddressing the crucial aspect of indoor air quality, the paper highlights\nhow green materials contribute to a healthier living environment by\nreducing allergens and harmful substances. Despite their potential advantages,\nthe paper acknowledges challenges in the implementation of\ngreen materials, such as early financial impediments and the need for\nspecialized expertise in the building sector. The collaborative nature of\nsolutions is stressed, advocating for close partnerships among policymakers,\nindustry stakeholders, and researchers to advance, make\navailable, and cost-effectively integrate green materials and technologies.\nUltimately, this paper concludes that green materials are not\nmerely optional but fundamental components of any sustainable\ndevelopment strategy. The presented findings and insights serve as a\nrobust foundation for informed decision-making regarding the use of\nenvironmentally friendly materials in construction methods.\nTable 6\nLiterature on the relationship between green buildings and IEQ parameters.\nIEQ parameter References Remarks\nIndoor Air Quality (IAQ) No Title (2000) Wargocki et al.

      "content": "### **Explanation of the Stack Effect**\n\n**What is the Stack Effect?**\n\nThe **stack effect** is a natural phenomenon that occurs in buildings due to the difference in indoor and outdoor air temperatures, causing air movement inside the structure. It relies on the basic principle that warm air rises and cool air sinks.\n\n**How Does It Work?**\n\n1. **Warm Air Rises:**\n   - During the day, especially in hot climates like Mosul's, the air inside a building can become warmer than the air outside.\n   - Warm air is less dense than cool air, so it rises upwards within the building.\n\n2. **Creating Upward Airflow:**\n   - As the warm air rises, it seeks an escape route, typically through openings at the top of the building, such as vents, skylights, or solar chimneys.\n\n3. **Drawing in Cooler Air:**\n   - When the warm air exits from the top, it creates a slight vacuum (lower pressure) inside the building.\n   - This vacuum pulls in cooler air from lower openings, like windows, doors, or vents near the ground level.\n\n4. **Continuous Air Movement:**\n   - This process sets up a continuous airflow: cool air enters at the bottom, warms up as it moves through the building, rises, and then exits at the top.\n   - This natural ventilation helps to cool the indoor spaces without the need for mechanical fans or air conditioning.\n\n**Why is the Stack Effect Important in Building Design?**\n\n- **Enhances Natural Ventilation:**\n  - Utilizes temperature differences to circulate air, improving indoor air quality.\n- **Reduces Energy Consumption:**\n  - Lowers reliance on mechanical cooling systems, saving energy and reducing utility bills.\n- **Improves Comfort:**\n  - Provides a cooling effect, making indoor environments more comfortable during hot weather.\n\n**Applying the Stack Effect in Mosul Homes**\n\n- **Solar Chimneys:**\n  - A solar chimney is a vertical shaft designed to enhance the stack effect.\n  - Painted black or made of heat-absorbing materials to maximize heat gain from the sun.\n  - As the chimney heats up, it increases the temperature difference, enhancing the upward airflow.\n- **Design Considerations:**\n  - **Placement of Openings:**\n    - High vents or openings at the top for warm air to escape.\n    - Low openings on the shaded side of the building to draw in cooler air.\n  - **Size of Openings:**\n    - Proper sizing ensures sufficient airflow without causing drafts.\n  - **Use of Courtyards:**\n    - Central open spaces can act as chimneys, promoting vertical air movement.\n\n**Benefits in Mosul's Climate**\n\n- **Hot Days and Cool Nights:**\n  - The significant temperature difference between day and night amplifies the stack effect.\n- **Energy Efficiency:**\n  - Reduces the need for air conditioning during hot days.\n- **Sustainability:**\n  - Aligns with traditional building practices that respect the local environment.\n\n**Simple Analogy**\n\n- Think of a fireplace chimney:\n  - When a fire burns, it heats the air, which rises up the chimney.\n  - This rising warm air draws in cooler air from the room to feed the fire.\n  - Similarly, in a building, the rising warm air exits through the top, pulling in cooler air from below.\n\n**Visual Representation**\n\nImagine a building as a box:\n\n- **Bottom Openings:** Windows or vents near the ground allow cooler air to enter.\n- **Interior Space:** Warm air inside rises naturally.\n- **Top Openings:** Vents or chimneys at the roof let warm air escape.\n- **Airflow Pattern:** Cool air in from the bottom ➔ warms up inside ➔ rises ➔ exits from the top.\n\n---\n\nBy understanding and utilizing the **stack effect**, architects and homeowners in Mosul can design buildings that stay cooler naturally, saving energy and improving comfort. This principle has been used in traditional architecture for centuries and remains a valuable strategy in modern sustainable design.",

Here's an ideal structure that encapsulates the best elements of this content for an audience interested in innovating with past principles to build the future sustainably:\n\n---\n\n### **Innovating with Heritage: Building Sustainable Futures Inspired by Vernacular Architecture**\n\n#### **Introduction**\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of construction and urban development, modern builders and designers face the challenge of creating structures that are both sustainable and resilient. The answer lies not only in innovative technologies but also in learning from historical wisdom. Vernacular architecture, especially in regions with extreme climates like Mosul, Iraq, provides a rich repository of sustainable principles that are increasingly relevant. By integrating traditional methods with modern advancements, we can craft buildings that are attuned to both local climates and global sustainability goals.\n\n---\n\n#### **Section 1: Understanding the Climatic Context of Mosul**\n\n**Mosul’s Climate:**  \nLocated in a region characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, mild winters, Mosul requires designs that address significant temperature fluctuations and intense sun exposure. Traditional Mosul architecture evolved in response to these climatic conditions, using materials and techniques that minimized energy consumption while maximizing comfort.\n\n**Key Climatic Challenges:**\n- **Extreme Heat:** Managing interior temperatures without heavy reliance on artificial cooling.\n- **Thermal Regulation:** Retaining warmth during cold nights and keeping interiors cool during the day.\n- **Energy Efficiency:** Reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling, and ventilation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Section 2: Key Principles of Vernacular Architecture for Modern Application**\n\n**1. The Stack Effect: Natural Ventilation Without Mechanical Systems**\n   - **What it Is:** The stack effect relies on the natural movement of air: warm air rises, creating a low-pressure zone that draws cooler air into the building. This phenomenon can be harnessed for natural ventilation, particularly effective in buildings with a central open space or \"solar chimney.\"\n   - **Benefits for Mosul’s Climate:** By using vertical shafts or courtyards, builders can encourage continuous airflow through the building, reducing indoor temperatures without fans or air conditioning.\n   - **Design Considerations:** Placement of openings at different heights, especially low entry points on the shaded side and high exits, ensures an efficient airflow cycle.\n\n**2. Courtyard-Centered Design for Thermal Comfort**\n   - **What it Is:** Central courtyards provide an internal microclimate that stays cooler than the external environment, especially when shaded.\n   - **Cooling Effect:** Courtyards create shaded areas and allow warm air to rise and escape, drawing in cooler air from surrounding spaces. This effect can be enhanced by incorporating water features or greenery.\n   - **Privacy and Community:** Courtyards also offer a private, communal area protected from the street, a cultural preference that can easily be maintained in modern designs.\n\n**3. High Thermal Mass Materials: Clay, Brick, and Stone**\n   - **What They Are:** Traditional materials like clay and stone have high thermal mass, meaning they absorb and slowly release heat. This characteristic keeps buildings cooler during the day and warmer at night.\n   - **Modern Applications:** Using similar or updated materials such as eco-friendly concrete or clay composites can replicate the thermal benefits while meeting modern building standards.\n   - **Environmental Benefits:** Local materials reduce transportation emissions and support sustainable construction practices.\n\n---\n\n#### **Section 3: Retrofit Strategies vs. New Design Principles**\n\n**Retrofit Strategies**\n   - **Goal:** Enhance existing structures with modern sustainable elements inspired by vernacular techniques.\n   - **Recommended Elements:**\n     - **Installing Solar Chimneys** to amplify the stack effect.\n     - **Adding Shading Devices** to windows and courtyards.\n     - **Upgrading with High Thermal Mass Materials** like eco-friendly concrete to improve temperature regulation.\n\n**New Design Principles**\n   - **Goal:** Create buildings that are modern yet rooted in traditional principles.\n   - **Recommended Elements:**\n     - **Designing Around Central Courtyards** that promote natural cooling and social interaction.\n     - **Integrating Solar and Wind Technology** to work with the natural airflow and sunlight.\n     - **Using Local, Sustainable Materials** such as clay composites and recycled concrete to align with the high thermal mass benefits of traditional materials.\n\n---\n\n#### **Section 4: Modern Materials Inspired by Traditional Wisdom**\n\n**1. Eco-Friendly Building Materials**\n   - **Options Include:** Recycled concrete, low-carbon cement, and local materials like clay bricks that align with the thermal mass benefits of traditional architecture.\n   - **Impact on Environment:** These materials significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to conventional options, aligning with global sustainability targets.\n\n**2. Natural Insulation Techniques**\n   - **Options Include:** Straw bale, sheep wool, and other natural fibers that mimic the insulating effects of traditional materials.\n   - **Health Benefits:** These materials contribute to better indoor air quality and have lower volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Section 5: Case Study—Adapting Vernacular Architecture in Mosul**\n\n**Traditional Mosul House Design**\n   - **Overview:** Traditional homes in Mosul often feature thick, high-thermal-mass walls, central courtyards, and minimal openings on the exterior walls.\n   - **Modern Adaptation:** By updating this structure with solar chimneys, green materials, and optimized airflow, these houses can maintain their aesthetic while meeting modern energy standards.\n\n---\n\n#### **Section 6: Practical Steps to Implement Sustainable Design Inspired by Vernacular Architecture**\n\n**1. Research and Analysis:**\n   - Understand the specific climatic and cultural needs of the target region.\n   - Study historical building techniques to identify sustainable strategies that align with modern requirements.\n\n**2. Design Planning:**\n   - Begin with a courtyard-centered layout and plan for natural ventilation systems like solar chimneys.\n   - Choose high thermal mass materials and integrate renewable energy solutions, including solar panels or solar chimneys.\n\n**3. Retrofitting Existing Buildings:**\n   - Add solar chimneys and adjust window placements to enhance the stack effect.\n   - Replace energy-intensive materials with locally-sourced, high thermal mass materials to reduce heating and cooling costs.\n\n---\n\n#### **Conclusion: Crafting a Sustainable Future with Time-Tested Wisdom**\n\nThe past offers invaluable lessons for creating buildings that respect both cultural heritage and environmental needs. By merging traditional techniques from Mosul’s vernacular architecture with modern materials and energy-efficient practices, we can construct homes and buildings that are not only sustainable but also deeply connected to their cultural roots. Through innovation grounded in history, we build a future that honors and preserves our planet and our heritage.\n\n--- \n\nThis format presents a clear, structured approach to integrating traditional wisdom with modern sustainability practices, making it accessible and actionable for those interested in building the future by learning from the past.",

For precise calculations, consider conducting an energy audit or consulting with a sustainability professional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nstack effect\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 5 seconds\n\nExplanation of the Stack Effect\nWhat is the Stack Effect?\n\nThe stack effect is a natural phenomenon that occurs in buildings due to the difference in indoor and outdoor air temperatures, causing air movement inside the structure. It relies on the basic principle that warm air rises and cool air sinks.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nWarm Air Rises:\n\nDuring the day, especially in hot climates like Mosul's, the air inside a building can become warmer than the air outside.\nWarm air is less dense than cool air, so it rises upwards within the building.\nCreating Upward Airflow:\n\nAs the warm air rises, it seeks an escape route, typically through openings at the top of the building, such as vents, skylights, or solar chimneys.\nDrawing in Cooler Air:\n\nWhen the warm air exits from the top, it creates a slight vacuum (lower pressure) inside the building.\nThis vacuum pulls in cooler air from lower openings, like windows, doors, or vents near the ground level.\nContinuous Air Movement:\n\nThis process sets up a continuous airflow: cool air enters at the bottom, warms up as it moves through the building, rises, and then exits at the top.\nThis natural ventilation helps to cool the indoor spaces without the need for mechanical fans or air conditioning.\nWhy is the Stack Effect Important in Building Design?\n\nEnhances Natural Ventilation:\nUtilizes temperature differences to circulate air, improving indoor air quality.\nReduces Energy Consumption:\nLowers reliance on mechanical cooling systems, saving energy and reducing utility bills.\nImproves Comfort:\nProvides a cooling effect, making indoor environments more comfortable during hot weather.\nApplying the Stack Effect in Mosul Homes\n\nSolar Chimneys:\nA solar chimney is a vertical shaft designed to enhance the stack effect.\nPainted black or made of heat-absorbing materials to maximize heat gain from the sun.\nAs the chimney heats up, it increases the temperature difference, enhancing the upward airflow.\nDesign Considerations:\nPlacement of Openings:\nHigh vents or openings at the top for warm air to escape.\nLow openings on the shaded side of the building to draw in cooler air.\nSize of Openings:\nProper sizing ensures sufficient airflow without causing drafts.\nUse of Courtyards:\nCentral open spaces can act as chimneys, promoting vertical air movement.\nBenefits in Mosul's Climate\n\nHot Days and Cool Nights:\nThe significant temperature difference between day and night amplifies the stack effect.\nEnergy Efficiency:\nReduces the need for air conditioning during hot days.\nSustainability:\nAligns with traditional building practices that respect the local environment.\nSimple Analogy\n\nThink of a fireplace chimney:\nWhen a fire burns, it heats the air, which rises up the chimney.\nThis rising warm air draws in cooler air from the room to feed the fire.\nSimilarly, in a building, the rising warm air exits through the top, pulling in cooler air from below.\nVisual Representation\n\nImagine a building as a box:\n\nBottom Openings: Windows or vents near the ground allow cooler air to enter.\nInterior Space: Warm air inside rises naturally.\nTop Openings: Vents or chimneys at the roof let warm air escape.\nAirflow Pattern: Cool air in from the bottom ➔ warms up inside ➔ rises ➔ exits from the top.\nBy understanding and utilizing the stack effect, architects and homeowners in Mosul can design buildings that stay cooler naturally, saving energy and improving comfort. This principle has been used in traditional architecture for centuries and remains a valuable strategy in modern sustainable design.Learning from the Past to Innovate the Future: Modernizing Vernacular Architectural Principles for Sustainable Design\nIntroduction\nIn an era where sustainability is paramount, architects and designers are increasingly looking to the past for inspiration.

It relies on the basic principle that warm air rises and cool air sinks.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nWarm Air Rises:\n\nDuring the day, especially in hot climates like Mosul's, the air inside a building can become warmer than the air outside.\nWarm air is less dense than cool air, so it rises upwards within the building.\nCreating Upward Airflow:\n\nAs the warm air rises, it seeks an escape route, typically through openings at the top of the building, such as vents, skylights, or solar chimneys.\nDrawing in Cooler Air:\n\nWhen the warm air exits from the top, it creates a slight vacuum (lower pressure) inside the building.\nThis vacuum pulls in cooler air from lower openings, like windows, doors, or vents near the ground level.\nContinuous Air Movement:\n\nThis process sets up a continuous airflow: cool air enters at the bottom, warms up as it moves through the building, rises, and then exits at the top.\nThis natural ventilation helps to cool the indoor spaces without the need for mechanical fans or air conditioning.\nWhy is the Stack Effect Important in Building Design?\n\nEnhances Natural Ventilation:\nUtilizes temperature differences to circulate air, improving indoor air quality.\nReduces Energy Consumption:\nLowers reliance on mechanical cooling systems, saving energy and reducing utility bills.\nImproves Comfort:\nProvides a cooling effect, making indoor environments more comfortable during hot weather.\nApplying the Stack Effect in Mosul Homes\n\nSolar Chimneys:\nA solar chimney is a vertical shaft designed to enhance the stack effect.\nPainted black or made of heat-absorbing materials to maximize heat gain from the sun.\nAs the chimney heats up, it increases the temperature difference, enhancing the upward airflow.\nDesign Considerations:\nPlacement of Openings:\nHigh vents or openings at the top for warm air to escape.\nLow openings on the shaded side of the building to draw in cooler air.\nSize of Openings:\nProper sizing ensures sufficient airflow without causing drafts.\nUse of Courtyards:\nCentral open spaces can act as chimneys, promoting vertical air movement.\nBenefits in Mosul's Climate\n\nHot Days and Cool Nights:\nThe significant temperature difference between day and night amplifies the stack effect.\nEnergy Efficiency:\nReduces the need for air conditioning during hot days.\nSustainability:\nAligns with traditional building practices that respect the local environment.\nSimple Analogy\n\nThink of a fireplace chimney:\nWhen a fire burns, it heats the air, which rises up the chimney.\nThis rising warm air draws in cooler air from the room to feed the fire.\nSimilarly, in a building, the rising warm air exits through the top, pulling in cooler air from below.\nVisual Representation\n\nImagine a building as a box:\n\nBottom Openings: Windows or vents near the ground allow cooler air to enter.\nInterior Space: Warm air inside rises naturally.\nTop Openings: Vents or chimneys at the roof let warm air escape.\nAirflow Pattern: Cool air in from the bottom ➔ warms up inside ➔ rises ➔ exits from the top.\nBy understanding and utilizing the stack effect, architects and homeowners in Mosul can design buildings that stay cooler naturally, saving energy and improving comfort. This principle has been used in traditional architecture for centuries and remains a valuable strategy in modern sustainable design.Learning from the Past to Innovate the Future: Modernizing Vernacular Architectural Principles for Sustainable Design\nIntroduction\nIn an era where sustainability is paramount, architects and designers are increasingly looking to the past for inspiration.
