      "content": "Great question! Let’s break down both names:\n\n### **Marietta**\n- **Origin**: Marietta is a diminutive form of **Maria** or **Mary**, with Italian and French roots.\n- **Meaning**: Since it comes from Maria, it carries the same meanings—often translated as \"beloved,\" \"drop of the sea,\" or \"bitter\" (from the Hebrew root *Miryam*). The **-etta** ending is a **diminutive suffix** in Italian, making *Marietta* mean \"little Maria\" or \"dear Maria.\"\n\n### **Alpharetta**\n- **Origin**: Alpharetta is a city in Georgia, USA. The name appears to be a **feminized version of \"Alpha\"**, likely influenced by the same kind of Italian-style diminutive suffix **-etta**.\n- **Meaning**: While there’s no official etymology, it’s often believed that Alpharetta was named after a fictional character called **Alpharetta** in a 19th-century song or poem, likely meaning **\"little Alpha\"** or \"first/little first\" (since Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet).\n\n### What’s the “**-etta**”?\nThe **-etta** suffix is often used:\n- To feminize or soften names.\n- As a **diminutive**, to make something sound smaller, sweeter, or more affectionate.\n\nLike how “Antoinette” is to “Antoine,” or “Henrietta” to “Henry.”\n\nSo both **Marietta** and **Alpharetta** carry that affectionate, feminized tone due to the **-etta**. Want to play with making some of your own “-etta” names?",
