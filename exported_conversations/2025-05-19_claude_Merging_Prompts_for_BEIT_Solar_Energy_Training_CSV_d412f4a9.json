Working in teams of 4-5, you'll assemble a complete solar system and verify its operation.\r\n\"Each team will have exactly 60 minutes to complete the assembly. You'll be evaluated on:\r\n            * Safety procedures and practices\r\n            * Correct component installation\r\n            * Proper wiring and connections\r\n            * Workmanship quality\r\n            * System functionality\r\n            * Completion time\r\n\"The assembly challenge includes:\r\n            * Mounting the panels on the training frame\r\n            * Installing the inverter and making proper connections\r\n            * Configuring the battery system\r\n            * Completing all DC and AC wiring\r\n            * Installing protection devices\r\n            * System testing and demonstration\r\n\"Remember to follow all safety protocols we've discussed throughout the course. Safety violations will result in point deductions.\r\n\"Representatives from local solar companies will be observing your work and may ask questions during the process. Consider this part of your job interview - demonstrate both your technical skills and your professionalism.\r\n\"When I call time, all teams must stop work immediately. We'll then test each system for functionality and evaluate the quality of the installation.\"\r\nSafety Emphasis to Include: \"Safety remains our top priority during this challenge:\r\n            * Always use proper PPE (gloves for battery handling, safety glasses)\r\n            * Verify zero voltage before making connections\r\n            * Follow proper lifting techniques for panels\r\n            * Maintain clear communication within your team\r\n            * Request help if you're unsure about any procedure\r\n\"A safe installation that takes slightly longer is always preferable to an unsafe rush job. Employers are watching not just for speed, but for safe, professional work habits.\"\r\nCommon Questions & Answers:\r\n            * Q: What if we encounter a component issue during assembly? A: Raise your hand to notify a trainer, who will assess the situation. Technical problems with components won't count against your score.\r\n            * Q: Can we ask questions during the assembly process? A: Yes, but consider that in real installations, you often need to problem-solve independently. Excessive questions may indirectly affect your evaluation.\r\n            * Q: What if we don't complete the entire assembly in the allotted time? A: You'll be evaluated on what you've completed. Prioritize quality and safety over rushing to finish every component.\r\nFinal Project Presentations (11:45-12:45)\r\nPurpose: Demonstrate comprehensive understanding through presentation of complete system proposals for the coffee shop scenario.\r\nMaterials:\r\n            * Presentation area with projector/screen\r\n            * Printed proposal copies\r\n            * Evaluation forms for judges\r\n            * Presentation timer\r\n            * Q&A cards for audience\r\n            * Ahmed role-play character (trainer or guest)\r\nPreparation:\r\n            * Set up presentation space\r\n            * Prepare evaluation criteria\r\n            * Brief employer representatives on judging\r\n            * Arrange presentation order\r\n            * Prepare challenging Q&A scenarios\r\nSteps:\r\n            1.

Focus on the benefits and value to Ahmed rather than technical specifications. Use clear, simple language and visual aids to explain complex concepts.\r\n\"One team member will role-play as Ahmed and may challenge you with common customer objections. Demonstrate your ability to address concerns effectively without becoming defensive.\r\n\"The evaluation criteria include:\r\n            * Technical accuracy and appropriateness of the solution\r\n            * Clarity of communication and avoidance of jargon\r\n            * Quality of financial analysis and business case\r\n            * Professionalism of presentation materials and delivery\r\n            * Effectiveness in addressing questions and objections\"\r\nProfessional Presentation Tips to Emphasize: \"As you prepare to enter the solar industry, your ability to present professionally can set you apart:\r\n            * Begin with a clear summary of the customer's needs and your solution\r\n            * Use visuals more than text in your presentation\r\n            * Make eye contact with the audience\r\n            * Speak clearly and at a moderate pace\r\n            * Use simple language and explain technical terms when necessary\r\n            * Show confidence in your solution without overselling\r\n            * Have supporting details ready but don't overwhelm with information\r\n            * End with a clear recommendation and next steps\r\n\"These presentation skills will serve you well whether you're selling to customers, presenting to employers, or training other professionals.\"\r\nCommon Questions & Answers:\r\n            * Q: Should we focus more on technical details or business benefits? A: Strike a balance, but remember that customers buy benefits, not specifications. Technical details should support your business case, not dominate it.\r\n            * Q: How technical can we get with the 'customer' during Q&A? A: Gauge their level of interest and understanding. Be prepared to explain technical concepts simply but also have detailed answers ready if the customer wants to dig deeper.\r\n            * Q: What if we're asked a question we can't answer? A: It's better to acknowledge when you don't know something than to guess. Say, \"That's an excellent question. I want to give you accurate information, so I'll verify that and get back to you tomorrow,\" then be sure to follow up.\r\nMock Job Interviews (1:45-3:00)\r\nPurpose: Provide realistic job interview experience with actual employers and receive direct feedback.\r\nMaterials:\r\n            * Interview stations with chairs\r\n            * Interview question guides for employers\r\n            * Candidate evaluation forms\r\n            * Timer for interview rotations\r\n            * Resume/CV copies (if prepared by participants)\r\n            * Note-taking materials for participants\r\nPreparation:\r\n            * Brief employer representatives on interview process\r\n            * Set up private interview spaces\r\n            * Prepare rotation schedule\r\n            * Create structured evaluation form\r\n            * Brief participants on interview expectations\r\nSteps:\r\n            1.
