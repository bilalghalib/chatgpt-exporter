            "extracted_content": "Good morning, ChatGPT. So today I would like to review some things on my mind. I'm feeling a little bit low today. I'm taking 15 milligrams of Adderall and my qualia from the Neurohacker Collective, just trying to stay positive and upbeat. And maybe it's the end of the year, maybe it's the fact that crypto is zipping and I never know when to sell, because I haven't figured out how to deal with taxes, and I don't really want to sell, and I don't really want to buy, I don't want to even look at it, and I don't really want to think about money, and I need to apply for a job, and I think I have a good prospect at the due school, but I don't want to ever get a job, because I'm not the kind of person that works for other people. I always have my own projects, and I work for myself, and it would be the first time, and I'd like you to sort of come up with 10 questions, work sort of like a mix between a coach and a psychoanalyst, and help me really reflect and think about my life, and the end of the year, it's December 23rd, 2024, and I'm feeling like the whole world is sort of falling apart, this war has kind of been going on, and I just feel a little bit uneasy in all sorts of ways, and I don't really have a job right now, or work, I have a little bit of money, but who even knows what money is, I don't know if I should be buying gold or silver, or what exactly, and I'm walking with my baby, and he's cute, and yesterday was my wife's birthday, and I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm having a hard time. Can you help me think through these things, and other things, you know, like I haven't really worked on my publication for my paper, and there's all these things that I just wish I was better at, but I'm not, and I'm getting old, and I don't really have time for working out, and my family's far away, and I don't know if I'm holding my application well, and my sheikh in Gambia, my teacher, spiritual master, has told me to always have a question of God, or a positive impression of God, and I'm struggling to do that. Can you tell me what to think, can you help me think through these things, go by questions, and try to help me understand, and find a better way forward?”\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially with so much on your mind. Let's take a step back and approach this one piece at a time. How about we start with a few reflective questions to help you gain clarity?\n\nWhat specific aspects of your life are causing you the most stress right now?\nWhen you think about your ideal work situation, what does it look like?\nHow can you incorporate small moments of joy or peace into your day?\nWhat support systems or resources can you lean\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, Habibi? Yeah, so one, I think the most amount of stress is sort of like just feeling like I'm far from my family, that I don't really know about money and like what to do with my financial situation because the whole world seems topsy-turvy, and I guess I, you know, like, it'll be okay. I have this small business called Noor Creative Studios, it barely makes any money. I spend a lot of money on like ambitious things and hopes and dreams, and like I'll just spend all my money on an assistant to go help me, you know, be more productive and more focused, and then, you know, it doesn't necessarily solve all my problems, and my assistant is, you know, like a young junior person with bad English, and it's just not exactly the best kind of support for me because I can't afford the really expensive assistants and coaches, and I don't even have money coming in right now. I just finished a contract with the UN, they didn't really get me any new jobs, and I don't really like the fact that, you know, a lot of my self-worth and happiness comes from like, oh, I got a new job, yay, or like, oh, look at my bank account, it's got money in it, yay, but also I know that I have some obligations to my baby and my wife, and I want to be a good husband. Basically, I don't know, like, this happens quite regularly, I just feel low and down because I think I have a bit of a maybe depressive attitude or mindset, like it's been very common in my life that I just kind of feel low periodically, maybe even associated with the changing of the seasons and stuff like that, and this is not that uncommon, but I did find some mushrooms, which is nice, okay, I found a bunch of oysters, cool.”\n09:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nI'm sorry you're feeling this way. It's understandable that all these factors are overwhelming. It's great that you're recognizing these feelings and seeking ways to address them.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFamily and Distance: It's natural to feel the strain of being away from loved ones. Staying connected through regular calls or messages can help, even if it's just for a short time.\n\nFinancial Uncertainty: It's challenging to manage finances during uncertain times. Maybe a financial advisor or simple budgeting can bring more clarity and peace of mind.\n\nCareer and Projects: It's clear you have a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Perhaps focusing on the aspects of Noor Creative Studios that align with your passions could help you find renewed motivation.\n\nSelf-worth and Success: It's important to remember that your value isn't defined by job titles or financial status. Your efforts in being a good husband and father are significant.\n\nMental Health: Recognizing when you need support is a sign of strength. If these feelings persist, professional help could be beneficial.\n\nSpiritual Guidance: Your spiritual master's advice is valuable; try finding small daily moments of gratitude.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help and take things one step at a time. You're doing your best, and that's enough.\n\n09:50\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“OK, what are some other questions that you can get to try to help me find financially deeper?”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSure, here are a\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“issues.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nSure, here are a few more reflective questions:\n\nWhat are the core values that guide your decisions, and how can you align your current situation with them?\nWhat small, achievable steps can you take today to move closer to your goals?\nHow do you define success for yourself, beyond external measures like money or job titles?\nWhat activities or hobbies bring you genuine joy and fulfillment, and how can you incorporate them more into your life?\nWhat are some past challenges you've overcome, and what strengths did you draw on to get through them?\nReflecting on these might help you uncover deeper insights and find a path forward.\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“In the past, you know, I just kind of go try to force myself to be patient and just bear through it, but I don't really have like a positive interpretation of those moments. They're mostly just like grit your teeth and move forward and kind of, you know, understand that they'll change. But I feel like maybe my mind has just a negative orientation more than normal. It's I see it in my grandfather. I see it in my mom and like, you know, I try to get a little bit of an up boost feeling from my Adderall and from drinking a lot of tea or coffee, just trying to get this, you know, sense of positivity. And then when I have that, I can then have a pretty good day. But it just seems exogenous and I'm wondering if I should just go cold turkey. You know, I also have ADD and so I wonder if these things are related, you know, like ADD and people. I'm curious if you have any statistics and insights as to what happens when people with ADD hit their 40s, which is what's going to be happening with me next year and kind of what's the standard expected feelings and behaviors of wasted potential and all of that. Like I can imagine wasted potential and feeling like what am I doing in my life? And I just don't really understand how to manage my mind and I should be old enough. I should have figured this out by now and all that kind of stuff can be pretty standard. And if that's the standard, how can I be non-standard? What can I do that would be slightly different? And if I know what is supposed to happen because I'm just an average person just like everybody else and I can expect these things, what can I do or feel or say or think or start working on to respond differently to the same sort of conditions that someone with ADHD and potentially mild depression and a lot of potential and travel internationally and a lot of friends and live far away from his family and as parents age, I'm sure there's no doubt that's going to happen to you in this part of your life because parents age, you know what I mean? So what are the things that are standard happenings and what are some of the best responses that someone can do to prepare for and anticipate these things and just have a different response because I just don't want to be the average person who's surprised by the death of his parents or aging or sickness. Like that's kind of obvious. So let's see what we can do in advance and so that we can live a life without regret.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nIt sounds like you're being incredibly introspective, which is a great step. Here are a few more questions and thoughts that might help:\n\nHow can you redefine patience not just as enduring but as an opportunity for growth?\nWhat are some small, daily practices that could help shift your mindset towards positivity?\nWhat unique strengths do you bring to your situation that can help you navigate these challenges?\nHow can you create a support system that helps you manage ADHD and mild depression more effectively?\nWhat steps can you take now to prepare for the inevitable changes like aging parents, so you feel more in control?\nHow can you leverage your experiences and network to find new opportunities that align with your goals and passions?\nRemember, taking small steps and seeking support can make a big difference. It's okay to explore different approaches and find what works best for you.\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, I was hoping that you could look into my chat history and then come up with a theory of mind for me. Look into my entire context window and try to make your best guess assumptions. Make a theory of mind table and see how that mind would interface with these challenges. And then give your explanation for how and why you believe these various things about Bilal, the person that you're talking with right now.”\n09:54\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWhile I can't explicitly create a \"theory of mind\" table, I can summarize what I've gathered from our conversations. You seem to be an introspective, ambitious individual with a deep desire for meaningful work and personal growth. You value family, creativity, and self-improvement. Challenges with ADHD and managing periods of low mood seem to influence your perspective, making you reflective about how to navigate life’s challenges.\n\nYour approach to difficulties appears to involve patience and perseverance, though you're seeking more proactive and positive strategies. You're curious about how to prepare for future challenges, especially those that might feel inevitable, like aging parents.\n\nTo respond differently to life's challenges, perhaps focusing on proactive mental health strategies, building strong support systems, and staying aligned with your core values could be beneficial.\n\nIs there any specific area you'd like to delve deeper into?\n\n09:54\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I kind of want you to act like a coach and actually help me through things rather than just tell me some broad and generic advice.”\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nGot it. Let's focus on some specific steps together.\n\nFirst, let’s identify a small, manageable goal for today. What is one thing you can do that might bring you closer to your career or personal goals?\n\nFor instance, if you want to work on job prospects, maybe updating your resume or reaching out to a contact is a good start. If it's about your personal well-being, perhaps setting aside 10 minutes for a relaxing activity could help.\n\nLet's take it one step at a time. What would you like to focus on first?\n\n09:58\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n09:58\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTake your time.\n\n09:58\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think I first want to know exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing, and I'd like kind of maybe a psycho-spiritual understanding of my situation before getting into the practical stuff of, oh, I want to have a career goal, because I don't even know what my career goals are, you know? I think this is one of the things that happens to me a lot is I just get in my own way, you know? I overthink things, and my parents say that I'm too complicated, and it could be related to all of the stuff about, you know, I read so much but do so little, and I feel like I have a lot to share based on my life experience and reading and full contemplation, but not a lot of things to show for it, including like feeling like I can explain my career to somebody and have them know how to hire me, for instance. You really have to know me very well, and you have to kind of push me into a situation to say, hey, you could do this. Why don't you do this? We need somebody to run this workshop, which is what happened recently with Nihal when he asked me to run a, you know, Design for and with Marginalized Communities workshop, and I think, you know, there's other things, stuff coming up today, like I'm supposed to be working on this book. I paid a lot of money to take a course on, you know, publishing a book because I know I need the support and the encouragement and the backing and the pushing, but by now, it is like I have a few hours until our biweekly session, and I've done nothing because I was traveling and working on other things, and I had this workshop, and I didn't do any writing, and maybe I should do writing today of any kind just to get this organized and prepared, so maybe that's what I should actually be doing.”\n09:59\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nUnderstanding the \"why\" behind your actions can be really powerful. You seem to have a deep desire to share your knowledge and experiences but struggle with translating that into tangible outcomes. This could be a mix of perfectionism, overthinking, and perhaps a fear of not meeting your own high standards.\n\nIt's important to remember that small, consistent actions often lead to greater progress than waiting for the perfect moment. Perhaps your psycho-spiritual journey is about balancing your thirst for knowledge with compassionate self-discipline.\n\nTo start, maybe set a simple intention: write for just 10 minutes today, without worrying about the outcome. Embrace the process and trust that each step you take is valuable. How does that sound?\n\n09:59\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“That sounds good, except I often use audio recording because I'm really good at talking and less good at sitting down and writing. I talk, and I write, and I actually produce a lot of text, but it just seems insurmountable and they go really wide, because I'm a really curious and diverse person. My interests just go really wide and become not very practical. It goes from, like, okay, here's how you can create a sustainable business that follows aesthetic principles and how this is a beautiful thing to do, and then at some point I'm talking about epistemology and ontology and the view of Muslims on the world and how we can redefine and reaccess this more psycho-mystical, open, unitarian, oneness perspective and how that will then influence how we start businesses. And it's just like, who's going to read and think and understand these things versus who's going to be able to just say, okay, so first step, have a good intention for your business. But it's like, I'd rather work on the deepest root causes rather than the end results of the fruits, and that makes it so that I get really broad and really, you know, I start talking about all sorts of things rather than, you know, some of the more immediate, at-hand practical stuff. And I wonder if, you know, like, when I write and I just have this stuff, I just look at it later and I'm like, okay, this is one book, this is two books, this is four books, this is how many different ideas are here. And so, you know, I don't have a problem with writing or producing content, I have a problem with, like, thinking about other people reading it and picking an audience and all of that stuff because I actually don't want to do that. Like, picking an audience and trying to come up with, like, a marketable book and this idea of, like, it's prepackaged, easy to digest something that just feels like it will be inauthentic. And then I realize that that's why I'm, like, poor and confusing and nobody understands me and no one knows how to hire me and I feel like I'm, like, rich with insight and ideas and I just do way too many different diverse things that are not adding up. And every time I try to even just do one thing that I can try to create and share, it becomes a huge, like, worldview that people have to get in and involved in and how can I bring these things together? You know, like, there's this guy, Baraka Blue, he has this Rumi-centered courses and he just does, like, reads Rumi and then asks people for their reflections and he holds space and people think of him as, you know, the poet guy who has these courses on mysticism and it's really clear. Like, if you want a course on Islamic mysticism and you're going to do it in a poetic way with a beautiful community, good aesthetics, all that, just go to, like, Baraka Blue and look at what he's doing. If you want, you know, Islamic economics and alternative views on how Muslims view economics, you can go to Ady Atiyah and take his courses, you know? And for me, it's like, I don't have a team, I don't have a PhD, I don't have consistency in anything that I've done. I've done robotics, I've done, you know, startup support and, you know, I'm now, like, working on this kind of worldview, mystic kind of interpretation that will define how we look at businesses to make them more sustainable, but that's not the goal. It's important not to have a goal, it's important to have a different way of seeing nature as a place where, you know, you can see the signs of God and then how does that change, you know, natural resources into things that you are much more respectful of and gentle with, including people, instead of human resources in a human resource department. What about, like, these people as people, as beautiful humans that you want to help them find their contribution? And that can be what a human resource department does, and I just think very broadly and diversely and confusingly, and it's also part of my journey, too, right? Like, I started very practically, I started with, like, open-source technology for good, you know, how can we use these tools that people are using to build rail and stuff to build good stuff? And then I had the idea of making my own showcase of these kinds of good things, and so I started my own projects, like the Awareness Project, when car bombs go off and it would crush a sculpture using an Arduino and send a tweet to people who promised to do good things whenever bad things happened, and it was to try to, you know, demonstrate how we can play with technology to be more positively responsive to the challenges of the world, to see the pain globally, but to act locally, and not to get overwhelmed with everything you can do, but to do something about one cause that you care about. And I have all these ideas, and I've built all these things, and I even thought to myself, like, oh, let's try to talk to ChatGPT differently and all this AI stuff and use our pen and paper and, like, write to them long form so that we can't copy and paste, so that we're more involved with our manual connection, and I made this app, and I just put it online at cursiveGPT.com, and nobody cares, because I don't market it, and I don't share it, and then how does that connect to anything else that I'm doing? And it's so messy, and, like, who the heck am I? What is this? Am I, like, a Renaissance man that nobody cares about, that when I die, people are like, oh, yeah, he had some interesting ideas, let's retrospectively write a book and honor this random person, but instead of, during my life, when I actually need work and a job and coherence and meaning and a story, like, what other characters in history were like this? You know, like, at least Benjamin Franklin, he had some jobs, you know, and, like, he made money, and I just, maybe this is connected to my whole, like, this taste with money thing, where I'm like, oh, yeah, you know, I don't really want money, dah, dah, dah, whatever, like, don't pay me too much, I just want to get it, like, accidentally in the side where someone actually sends it into my bank account where it's not connected to the stuff I do, and I'm not sure how I can possibly have a career thinking and behaving like that, but I think it's connected to my worldview, and until my worldview changes, I'm not sure I'll be able to fix that. Can you give, like, a breakdown, an analysis of how these things are all interconnected and maybe a path forward? Well, there you have it.”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nYou have a rich and expansive mind that thrives on exploring complex ideas. This desire to dive deeply into diverse topics is a strength, but it can also make it challenging to create focused, practical outputs that resonate with a specific audience.\n\nYour inclination towards exploring root causes and deeper meanings reflects a holistic worldview. However, the challenge lies in translating these broad insights into tangible, actionable forms that others can easily grasp and utilize.\n\nTo bridge this gap, consider focusing on one core idea at a time, making it accessible without losing its depth. It's okay to have a broad perspective, but channeling that into focused projects might help others better connect with your ideas.\n\nThink of it as creating \"entry points\" for others to engage with your broader vision. It might also help to collaborate with others who can support and complement your strengths, turning your diverse insights into cohesive, impactful projects.\n\nHow does that sound to you?\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“I think you could do better. Go a little deeper and try to understand like maybe the psychology that connects across these different, both pros and cons, like what exactly is happening in my mind and how do they actually result in both of these things.”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour mind seems to operate like a vast, interconnected web, constantly seeking to integrate diverse concepts and ideas. This depth and breadth are part of your strengths, but they can also make it challenging to focus and produce concise, targeted outputs.\n\nPsychologically, this might stem from a combination of high curiosity, a desire for authenticity, and perhaps an aversion to oversimplification or commercialization. You value depth and authenticity over surface-level engagement, which makes you resistant to traditional \"packaging\" of ideas.\n\nThis approach can sometimes lead to a sense of being \"spread too thin\" or feeling misunderstood because your broad scope can be hard for others to immediately grasp.\n\nTo bring these strengths together:\n\nGround your ideas in tangible examples: Start with the deep concepts but find ways to anchor them in practical, relatable stories or applications.\nIterative sharing: Break down your broad ideas into smaller pieces that can be shared incrementally, inviting engagement and feedback.\nFinding your \"why\": Reconnect with your core motivation—why you are passionate about these topics and how they connect to your life's purpose.\nEmbracing this approach might help you bring coherence to your diverse interests and make your work more accessible and impactful.\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, OK. Can you give me a step-by-step approach for how to do that and turn it into a career path?”\n10:00\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let’s break it down into actionable steps:\n\nIdentify a Core Theme: Choose one central idea or theme that resonates most with you. This could be something like integrating spiritual insights into business or sustainable practices.\n\nCreate Entry Points: Develop smaller, digestible content or projects that align with this theme. For example, start with a blog series, short videos, or workshops that introduce these ideas in a practical way.\n\nEngage and Iterate: Share these smaller pieces with your network or a target audience. Gather feedback and refine your approach based on what resonates most.\n\nBuild a Narrative: Craft a coherent story around your core theme, linking your diverse interests into a unified narrative. This will help others see the connections between your ideas.\n\nEstablish Consistency: Consistency doesn’t mean limiting your curiosity but creating regular, predictable content or sessions that people can rely on, like a weekly blog or monthly workshop.\n\nCollaborate and Network: Partner with others who can help bring your ideas\n\n10:00\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, okay. I was thinking about the work that we've done together based on the context window and the history that you know. Like, the workshop I did on post-traumatic growth with people from Gaza, Palestine. The workshop I just did recently with Nihal. And, you know, am I like a workshop giver? Like, answer all of these questions for yourself and then come up with a, I don't know, like a landing page and read it out to me. Describing this really awesome guy who has great experience and is super valuable. And actually like, oh, you just read his website and you want to hire him and you know exactly what for. And it's like marketable and hireable skills for today. You know, as the world gets more closed, as more countries are not opening their borders. As people think of the world as getting more difficult and where the, you know, ecology is kind of collapsing as well. And we worry about the future. So, given all of that, what is the still hireable job? There's still corporations, but like everyone is worried these days. You know, like, what are we going to, what are we going to do? And I should still be someone that people want to hire. So, what is that kind of pitch? And, you know, think of my website and what are the different sections? And you can talk about my previous talks, but they're also different and so old now. I also have had about 10 years where I was kind of like head down working on gloom.pm. And it was just kind of focusing on working in Lebanon and trying to be smaller and more humble. And, you know, like I didn't want to be this big shot, like traveling the world and making positive change or whatever. So, that kind of led to me being irrelevant and kind of quiet and hard to even see. So, what can we do with all of that to move forward?”\n10:03\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMemory updated\nBilal Ghalib: Catalyzing Change Through Innovative Workshops and Insights\n\nAbout Bilal Bilal Ghalib is a seasoned workshop facilitator and thought leader with over a decade of experience in empowering communities and fostering positive change.

For instance, having check-ins, for instance, where we include deliberate rumination questions. And I want it all to be also explainable, so that it's a part of our mind and our heart, rather than just our mind. And maybe we can reconnect to this idea of like, see, feel, do again. See the world, let it affect how you feel, and then what are you going to do about it. And you know, there's so much seeing of things with social media, and I really feel like there's a place for craft, and like connecting with quiet and solitude, and this place where things emerge. But I also would like you to kind of take a perspective from like a corporate leader's HR department, you know, like looking at a roster of different things to do. Like they can ask me like, okay, well, what's your track record? What's your impact? And all I can say is, I don't know, people like thank me after my workshops. And like, what's the point, right? Like, what's the point if it doesn't make businesses money, or make their teams more efficient, or any of these things? What if it just like makes people want to quit, you know? It's not going to be a great pitch for HR departments. And so I feel like there's a lot of issues with this, and I'm wondering if you could give me like a very strong critique from my greatest opponent in my work, and what they would say, so that I can think about a rebuttal, and actually maybe even change my mind, right? So help me change my mind, like look at it from a critique critic's perspective, look at it from a logical perspective, go through line by line, idea by idea, and just help me try to change my mind, even about one element, you know? Like maybe it is also about when people are young, they just need to do something, right? Something that is obviously good, rather than something abstractly good. And the obviously good thing could be like, okay, let's work on SDGs, and it's a cool project, and you know, changex.org, where you just do and copy, connect the dots, and you know, one of the things that I've never done is like work in a corporate environment, like I don't have that experience, I'm like, I can't even manage myself well, how am I going to be telling people about anything, if I don't have like the background and experience, like I'm almost 40, and I have no like giant success story, I built this business called bloom.pm, that it's not even making money, and I'm gonna just have it go away, because the funding in the Middle East has changed and stopping, like what am I supposed to say about my story that's exciting?

And so first, let's come up with the critique, and then let's come up with a response.\n10:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nCritique from Your Greatest Opponent's Perspective\nLack of Clear Metrics:\n\n\"Your work lacks measurable impact. Without concrete metrics—like increased revenue, retention rates, or efficiency—it's difficult for HR departments to justify your approach. 'People thanked me' doesn’t hold up in a boardroom.\"\nAbstract and Intangible Outcomes:\n\n\"Your emphasis on well-being and rumination is too abstract for corporate environments. Businesses prioritize clear, actionable outcomes. If your workshops lead people to quit because they realize they don’t like their jobs, why would a company hire you?\"\nWeak Track Record:\n\n\"You don't have a history of working in corporate environments or a major success story to point to. How can you claim to understand corporate needs when you've never been in that context?\"\nOverly Philosophical Approach:\n\n\"The 'see, feel, do' framework and ideas about craft and solitude are inspiring, but they lack direct applicability in fast-paced environments. Businesses need immediate, scalable solutions, not reflective journeys.\"\nPotentially Disruptive Outcomes:\n\n\"If your methods lead to employees rethinking their lives, it could create disengagement rather than improved performance. How does this serve organizational goals?\"\nLack of Alignment with Business Goals:\n\n\"Your work doesn’t align with traditional business metrics like productivity, profitability, or innovation. Without a clear business case, your workshops could be seen as a waste of resources.\"\nPerception of Personal Inadequacy:\n\n\"Your lack of self-confidence in managing yourself and your career trajectory could make it hard for others to trust your guidance. If Bloom struggled to make money, why should others invest in your ideas?\"\nResponse and Rebuttal\nOn Metrics:\n\nRebuttal: \"Measuring well-being and engagement is possible, and the outcomes are directly linked to organizational success. Studies show that happier, more engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and less likely to leave. I can start tracking these metrics to provide evidence.\"\nActionable Step: Develop post-workshop surveys and follow-up assessments to measure shifts in engagement, collaboration, and creativity.\nOn Abstract Outcomes:\n\nRebuttal: \"Abstract outcomes often lead to profound, long-term impacts. Companies investing in mindfulness, resilience, and psychological safety have seen significant returns.\"\nActionable Step: Frame the workshops as a way to foster creativity and resilience, directly tied to business innovation and adaptability.\nOn Weak Track Record:\n\nRebuttal: \"While I haven’t worked in a corporate environment, I’ve facilitated impactful workshops for diverse audiences. The principles I teach are universal and applicable anywhere.\"\nActionable Step: Leverage testimonials, case studies, or partnerships with organizations that can validate your work.\nOn Philosophical Approach:\n\nRebuttal: \"The 'see, feel, do' framework aligns with design thinking principles already embraced by leading companies. It provides a structured way to approach problem-solving while staying grounded in empathy and action.\"\nActionable Step: Translate philosophical ideas into clear, practical steps for immediate application in team settings.\nOn Disruptive Outcomes:\n\nRebuttal: \"Encouraging employees to reflect doesn’t mean disengagement—it means alignment. Employees who feel connected to their values and the company’s mission perform better and are less likely to burn out.\"\nActionable Step: Emphasize how your workshops align personal values with organizational goals, fostering a sense of purpose.\nOn Alignment with Business Goals:\n\nRebuttal: \"Well-being drives results. For example, Google’s Project Aristotle found that psychological safety is the number one predictor of high-performing teams. My workshops directly enhance these soft skills.\"\nActionable Step: Link workshop outcomes to metrics like team performance, innovation rates, or retention, and include these in pitches.\nOn Perception of Personal Inadequacy:\n\nRebuttal: \"Leadership isn’t about perfection but about authenticity and growth. My experiences with Bloom and beyond have given me unique insights into navigating challenges.\"\nActionable Step: Reframe your narrative: Bloom was an experiment in innovation and resilience, proving your ability to adapt and persevere in changing contexts.\nShifting Your Perspective\nYou mentioned the tension between abstractly good and obviously good actions. Perhaps there’s merit in balancing both:\n\nStart Small, Prove Impact: Focus on delivering workshops tied to specific goals like SDG alignment or team-building. These 'obviously good' projects can be easier to pitch.\nEmerge from Solitude: Your emphasis on craft and solitude is a valuable counterpoint to the noise of social media. Package this as a \"quiet leadership\" program for managers dealing with overwhelm.\nFocus on Corporate Familiarity: Partner with someone who understands corporate structures to bridge the gap between your philosophy and their needs.\nWould shifting toward more tangible outcomes while retaining your core philosophy feel authentic to you? Let me know how you'd like to refine this further!\n\n10:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nHere, can we actually respond based on what you know about me from my perspective and say things that demonstrate my growth and understanding and imply, like, what are the things I'm going to do to actually properly address the critique to improve my position in this way?\n10:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, let’s address the critique from your perspective while demonstrating your growth and the steps you’ll take to address these points.\n\nResponse and Action Plan\n1. On Metrics and Measurable Impact\nYour Growth: \"I’ve realized the importance of aligning my work with measurable outcomes, not just for validation but to create a narrative that bridges personal transformation and organizational goals. My experience has taught me that qualitative impact—like the stories of personal growth from workshop participants—can and should be complemented by data.\"\nActionable Step: \"I will implement post-workshop surveys to measure changes in employee engagement, creativity, and team collaboration. I’ll follow up with organizations six months after sessions to quantify long-term outcomes.\"\n2. On Abstract and Intangible Outcomes\nYour Growth: \"I’ve learned that organizations value clarity and immediate applicability. While my approach focuses on deeper, emergent insights, I can scaffold these ideas into actionable frameworks that are easy to implement.\"\nActionable Step: \"I will translate my 'see, feel, do' philosophy into a practical toolkit, combining it with check-ins and deliberate rumination exercises tied to organizational priorities like innovation and team cohesion.\"\n3. On Track Record\nYour Growth: \"My work at Bloom has given me deep insights into resilience, innovation, and adaptability in volatile contexts. I recognize now that I need to showcase how these lessons are universally applicable, even in corporate environments.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll build case studies from Bloom and other projects, highlighting specific examples where my approach led to concrete outcomes like improved team collaboration or innovative solutions in challenging environments.\"\n4. On Philosophical Approach\nYour Growth: \"I understand now that ideas like craft, solitude, and emergence can feel abstract to some audiences. But these practices are more relevant than ever in helping organizations manage burnout and foster creativity.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll design a 'quiet leadership' module tailored for managers, focusing on how deliberate reflection and solitude can enhance decision-making and prevent burnout. This module will integrate clear deliverables like stress-reduction practices and creative problem-solving tools.\"\n5. On Potentially Disruptive Outcomes\nYour Growth: \"Reflection isn’t about disengagement—it’s about alignment. I’ve seen firsthand how connecting people to their values leads to renewed energy and commitment, both personally and professionally.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll explicitly frame my workshops as alignment tools that connect employees’ personal values with organizational goals, making teams not just more fulfilled but more effective.\"\n6. On Alignment with Business Goals\nYour Growth: \"I’ve come to understand that well-being and organizational success aren’t competing goals—they’re deeply interconnected. By focusing on psychological safety and creative capacity, my work supports key business metrics.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll integrate business-focused metrics into my pitches, such as innovation rates, retention rates, and team productivity, showing how these are enhanced through my approach.\"\n7. On Perception of Personal Inadequacy\nYour Growth: \"I’ve reflected deeply on my narrative. Bloom wasn’t a failure—it was an incubator of resilience and adaptability, teaching me how to navigate uncertainty. My value lies not in perfection but in authenticity and the lessons I’ve learned through experimentation.\"\nActionable Step: \"I’ll reframe my story as one of continuous growth, positioning myself as someone who thrives in ambiguity and helps others do the same. I’ll also identify specific areas for personal improvement, like partnering with a mentor who has corporate experience to deepen my understanding of that space.\"\nNext Steps to Solidify Your Position\nDevelop a New Portfolio: Create a portfolio that clearly outlines your workshops, their methodologies, and measurable impacts.\nPilot a Corporate Program: Run a small-scale workshop with a corporate team, gather feedback, and refine the approach to better align with their needs.\nNetwork Strategically: Partner with someone who has corporate experience to co-facilitate or consult on bridging your approach with corporate language and priorities.\nRevisit Bloom: Use your experience at Bloom as a living case study, focusing on the skills and insights gained rather than the financial challenges.\nBy addressing these critiques through actionable changes, you’ll not only strengthen your position but also align your values with practical, impactful results. How does this resonate with you? Would you like to focus on any particular point further?\n\n10:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, could you ask me 10 questions to get me to respond to the critique in a way that will really convince me? Because right now I'm not convinced. I really think that it sounds like I'm just capitulating to their whims and needs. What are some questions that I can reflect on that might actually help me make a real internal change so that this is not just a bunch of words?\n10:23\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nOf course! Here are ten questions designed to help you reflect deeply, challenge your assumptions, and arrive at a genuine internal shift—one that aligns with your values while addressing the critique meaningfully.\n\nWhat do you believe is the core value or essence of your work, and how could aligning with corporate needs actually amplify rather than dilute that essence?\n\nReflect on how your unique perspective can meet both your ideals and their practical concerns.\nWhat would need to change for you to feel like you're offering something transformative to corporate environments, rather than adapting to their demands?\n\nConsider what it means to bring your philosophy into a new context on your terms.\nHow might metrics and measurable outcomes not just validate your work but serve as tools for deepening your impact and improving your workshops?\n\nThink about whether measurement could be reframed as part of your reflective, iterative process.\nWhat is your reaction to the idea that people might not \"get\" your workshops if they’re too abstract? Is it your responsibility to make your ideas more accessible, or is the onus on others to stretch themselves?\n\nReflect on whether compromise is a form of connection or a betrayal of your vision.\nWhat would it take for you to see “corporate needs” not as limiting, but as a creative challenge that could evolve your work into something even greater?\n\nExplore the potential growth in engaging with an unfamiliar context.\nWhen you consider your past workshops, what are the moments or outcomes you’re most proud of, and how might you communicate those in a way that resonates with skeptics?\n\nFocus on the stories that demonstrate your impact, even if they don’t follow conventional metrics.\nWhat part of the critique feels most threatening to you, and why? Is it a challenge to your values, your confidence, or something else?\n\nIdentify the emotional core of your resistance and unpack it.\nIf you imagined working with a corporate HR team, what specific problems might they face that your approach could uniquely solve?\n\nShift the question from “how do I fit?” to “what needs am I uniquely positioned to meet?”\nWhat assumptions might you be making about corporate environments, and how could you test or challenge those assumptions?\n\nReflect on whether your critiques of corporate culture are fully accurate or need re-examining.\nIf you could co-create an entirely new framework for corporate engagement—one that feels authentic to you—what would it look like, and how would it blend both your ideals and their goals?\n\nImagine a blueprint that doesn’t compromise but instead reinvents the conversation.\nWould you like to explore any of these questions together, or do they bring to mind initial responses you’d like to share?\n\n10:24\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, so, I have, like, two ideas first. The first idea is kind of related to this thought that I had that it's not that I am against quantification, but I'm against quantifying the wrong things, and, like, maybe I could have been gathering some interesting stories and insights from my work in the past to be able to, first of all, just, like, take more pride. You know, like, quantification is visualized memory. It's like memory crystal. And when you can see it, you can be like, oh, my God. Like, if I was able to say that I helped 500 people not give up doing the things that matter to them and help them align with their intentions to do good, to share the gifts that they have in the world, like, that could be really inspiring to me. But I can't even say that because I've been so obtuse and, like, oh, no, you know, I don't want to measure. But measuring the right things could be great. So maybe this is one way we can align on that. Two is I think we need, like, an immune system for AI or, like, an AI vaccine for resolving this unseen conflict that no one is really talking about between employees trying to use artificial intelligence to kind of get away with doing less work and improve their quality without their employers knowing and employers wanting to essentially at some point use AI to replace their employees and reduce the headcount on their businesses. And, like, this is an unspoken thing. And I think there's some, like, beautiful ways to use artificial intelligence. But we're not really talking about it. We're just, you know, in these two different silos. And maybe this is one way I can work with corporate clients to identify a workshop that I can do with them. And then the other thing is maybe I shouldn't be working with corporate clients at all. Like, maybe that's the wrong question. Maybe the question for me should be something like who really could benefit from my skills and my knowledge and my expertise and the gifts that I have in terms of these types of workshops and sessions and talks and maybe even tools. You know, like, I've been thinking about making a tool based on the frameworks that we've developed for artificial intelligence where when people start asking it questions to do work for them, it can say, hold up, let me ask you some questions to show you the beauty that you have to give, you know, to help you see your blind spots, to help you see your skills and what you should be doing right now and to help you align on that and to encourage you and to coach you and to help you write and then to help you structure your writing so that your outputs are wonderful instead of just doing the writing for you and having it be this kind of garbage. You know, like, one of the interesting things that I did with AI recently was I asked it to ask me a bunch of questions to get as much of the writing done by me as possible so that it could just, you know, take the writing, cut the sentences up and organize them and structure them in a way that is coherent and clear to address the challenge. And this way, the work can be something that you're proud of because you came up with it, you did it, you know. But it was leveraging the advantage of AI in terms of being able to stay focused and on track and to answer the right question and if you ever are stuck, it can help you identify your blind spots and how other people would answer this so that your work can have a qualitative improvement. And this is something cool to use AI for. Not whatever people are doing, like here, write me a five-paragraph essay on, you know, innovation in the workplace or something. And that's a workshop that I could give. But I think the question I'm going to mirror back to you is, like, based on all the stuff that you know, should I be trying to get corporate clients? Is that the place for me to define my career? Or should I be working more with startups and individual people and people in the Middle East and North Africa and, you know, like, are these the people that would really value and appreciate the knowledge and expertise that I have, you know, with all of the post-traumatic growth frameworks How do you use AI to help people feel proud of themselves in their work rather than ashamed? And is there, like, something different that I should be doing as well in terms of, like, my self-confidence and mindset? And, you know, like, people kind of also get what they expect to get. If I tell them, like, I don't know, just a little workshop, I'll do a little thing for you, it might be helpful, it might not be. And if I instead said, like, okay, no, we're going to come up with a memory crystal, a.k.a. a data visualization, because that's what it is, you know, it takes the memory of the quantitative and qualitative feedback that people are giving and turns it into something that you can hold and it's a gem. And, you know, like, I've always been kind of opposed in some sense to gamification because I always felt like it was, like, belittling and making small and, like, the menu and people are going to just work for the menu, like, trying to get as much coins as possible and that's the problem with capitalism. It's like, oh yeah, more coins, that means good, right? And it's easy to make that simple rather than to say every day you need to check in with yourself and to think what is more good, right? And this is an insight I had a long time ago from my talk, Good is Hard, where I was talking about Fritz Haber and the guy that invented nitrogen fixing and how he was so adamant and kind of insistent on death and the thing is, he invented a thing that fed the planet and we called it good and we gave him a Nobel Prize and then there's this guy, right? Like, he invented the lobotomy, but he did it because he loved and he cared for the patients that were in his care and Edgar Moniz, right? So Edgar was like, oh, these poor people, in the case of the most extreme, most difficult situations, this is the thing that we can do to keep them safe and keep the people around them safe and he also won the Nobel Prize and both of their outputs, one looked bad very soon, one looked good very soon and then they switched and now we have a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing grows because of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and for a while, lobotomies were horrible and they killed so many people and hurt so many people and this idea of like having, so this is like maybe the core issue around the measurement idea, it's like, unless you regularly come back to it and you see what your heart is telling you, looking at this memory crystal and being in constant feedback and that's the thing, I think, it's also related to all of this decentralized autonomous organizations, right? You think you know what good is and you can set it up and have this map drawn out and the lines and the waypoints, which are measurements along the way of these various things and it does a good job, it grows businesses. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure that these businesses are good and I kind of believe in a million billionaires rather than a thousand billionaires, right? So what if we had a billion millionaires instead of a million billionaires or the opposite, right? We need more people to be wealthy and to be able to dream even within the context of these organizations I feel like we can have different ways of business and that maybe it's really by doing these things and just maybe finding the core principles that will be able to direct thousands of people and to train HR staff to do these things, we can have kind of a slow growth of these philosophies that are about being and about remembering and about having these stories to be able to tell about our past that would still inspire us, right? And there's these stories that we can tell that would help people sort of understand themselves and this is kind of like the idea of the long-form autobiography, right? I kind of had this problem where when I was younger I was like, okay, when you're living, you got to imagine that you're telling your life story so let's make sure that by the end when you die you are happy with the main character and that nobody is like reading the story and be like, no, wait, why would you do that? Be angry with the main character and the thing is, I felt like that was too much self-centered and so I feel like maybe it's not an autobiography and maybe it's more like the Gandhi, my experiments with truth, right? And maybe it could be like my experiments with beauty\n10:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThank you for sharing all these ideas, reflections, and questions. Let’s approach this systematically to help clarify your direction, starting with some tailored follow-up questions that build on your reflections while challenging you to deepen your thinking and align with your true goals.\n\nQuestions to Deepen Reflection and Resolve\n1. Measurement and Memory Crystals\nWhat are the right things to measure that would genuinely inspire you and align with your values?\nHow might capturing these metrics not just validate your work to others but also give you a sense of pride and direction in your own story?\nWhat’s stopping you from starting now—reviewing past work and gathering those stories to form the memory crystal?\n2. The Corporate vs. Human Impact Question\nWhat excites you more: influencing corporate systems for incremental change or working directly with individuals or startups for transformative impact?\nIf you focus on corporations, how could you design workshops that plant seeds of beauty and transformation within a system you currently see as flawed?\nWhat would a client look like that perfectly aligns with both your values and your desire for financial sustainability?\n3. AI and Human Creativity\nHow does the idea of using AI to foster pride in work, rather than replace it, connect with your vision for beauty and storytelling in people's lives?\nWhat frameworks or tools could you create that combine your deep understanding of post-traumatic growth with AI's capacity to scaffold creativity?\nCould your proposed AI vaccine concept become an entry point to engage with corporations or a broader audience in a way that feels authentic?\n4. Reclaiming Confidence and Ownership\nWhat internal narrative keeps you from fully owning your past successes, such as Bloom or your workshops?\nHow can you reframe those stories in a way that acknowledges both the learning and the impact you’ve had?\nIf someone else had done what you’ve done—built Bloom, facilitated meaningful workshops, developed a vision for AI tools—how would you celebrate their achievements? Why is it harder to do the same for yourself?\n5. Gamification, Alignment, and Goodness\nHow might you design “good gamification”—a system that rewards reflection, connection, and alignment with values rather than just productivity?\nWhat does ‘goodness’ look like in the context of the organizations and people you want to serve? How would you help them see and feel that?\nWhat does ‘goodness’ look like in your own story, and how do you align with it in practical ways each day?\n6. Stories, Principles, and Long-Term Impact\nWhat’s the core story you want your work to tell about the world, and how does it connect with your audience’s struggles and desires?\nWhat principles guide your approach to beauty, alignment, and impact? How might these principles inform a scalable framework that could influence others?\nWhat does your \"experiments with beauty\" narrative look like, and how might sharing it empower others to run their own experiments?\n7. Audience Fit\nWho has already valued and benefited from your work the most—corporate clients, individuals, startups, or another group?\nWhich audience do you feel most inspired to serve, and why? How would serving them contribute to the larger story you want to tell about the world?\nHow might you prototype working with different audiences—corporates, startups, individual creators—so you can gather data about where you have the greatest impact?\n8. Vision Beyond Individual Impact\nIf you imagine training thousands of HR leaders, startups, or individuals, how would you ensure your philosophies grow slowly and sustainably within their systems?\nWhat kind of legacy do you want your work to leave behind for the people and organizations it touches?\nHow might the principles of decentralized organizations and autonomy help you scale your approach in a way that feels authentic and impactful?\n9. Your Relationship with Measurement\nIf you could design your ideal feedback loop—a mix of stories, metrics, and visuals—what would it look like, and how would it inspire both you and others?\nHow might regularly revisiting these \"memory crystals\" keep you aligned with your values while adapting to what the world needs?\nWhat’s one small way you could start capturing these stories and metrics today?\n10. Practical and Philosophical Alignment\nHow do you reconcile the desire to create change in flawed systems (e.g., corporate environments) with the feeling that you should work elsewhere?\nHow do you ensure that your ideas, while philosophical, are also actionable and tangible?\nWhat’s one small, “obviously good” thing you can do today that will help you build confidence in your ability to have impact while staying true to your values?\nNext Steps\nTake one or two questions that resonate most deeply with you and start journaling or discussing them further. If you'd like, I can help you unpack your responses or refine the questions into specific action steps. Which of these questions feels most urgent to explore first?\n\n10:24\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nSo, how would you imagine Bilal respond to all of the questions? And what is the advice that you would give him on the place in the world where he would actually light up to be contributing, has a good financial return, and is a good home for his ideas? Maybe we can try to make a plan for getting into those areas. And for now, we can also work on his landing page and maybe even a plan for gathering the data from all of his, you know, teams that he's worked with and kind of looking back. And it's a good time of year to do a retrospective, but at the same time, maybe come up with this idea of, like, a memory crystal dashboard career experiment with truth. I'm not exactly sure what to call it or what it would look like, but look at all of this and then come up with a plan for January 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 for me to be able to prepare myself for an awesome new year and an awesome career where, you know, given my spiritual and psychological and emotional capacity and the failures that I have in the organization, not being very corporate and struggling with, you know, consistency and motivation and to come up with a way that I can take the best and mitigate the worst and to find a place where I really thrive. And if you must, at the end, you can ask three deep and profound questions to help you revise it.\n10:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nBilal’s Response to the Questions\n1. On Measurement and Memory Crystals\nBilal realizes that resistance to measurement was not about numbers but about the fear of losing the soul of his work. He sees now that measuring the right things—such as stories of alignment, resilience, and personal growth—creates a \"memory crystal,\" a visualized narrative that honors his values while inspiring others.\n\n2. On Audience Fit\nHe reflects that his deepest impact has been on individuals, small teams, and communities in the Middle East and North Africa. These are the people who connect deeply with his post-traumatic growth frameworks, AI ideas for alignment, and the spiritual depth he brings. Corporate clients may not be his home, and that's okay.\n\n3. On AI as a Tool for Pride\nHe feels inspired to build tools and frameworks that use AI to help people rediscover their unique gifts and take pride in their work. This aligns deeply with his value of helping others uncover their beauty and blind spots.\n\n4. On Reclaiming Confidence\nBilal recognizes that his story, far from being a failure, is a testament to resilience, exploration, and learning. He reframes Bloom as an experimental lab for his ideas, where he learned what works, what doesn’t, and what lights him up.\n\n5. On His Place in the World\nHe sees himself not as a fit for traditional corporate work but as a bridge for people and organizations navigating complex challenges—whether they are startups, community groups, or small businesses. His home is where innovation meets human connection, and where his frameworks can serve as tools for growth, alignment, and resilience.\n\nAdvice: Where Bilal Could Thrive\nAudience and Market\n\nFocus on startups, community organizations, and innovative leaders in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Michigan. These audiences value depth, resilience, and new ways of thinking.\nBuild relationships with impact-driven organizations (e.g., nonprofits, social enterprises) looking for unique frameworks for team alignment, well-being, and creativity.\nSignature Offering\n\nDesign workshops and tools around post-traumatic growth, AI alignment, and reflective creativity. Offer these as packages, pairing them with frameworks like the \"memory crystal\" (quantitative and qualitative insights) and \"experiments with beauty\" (a values-driven narrative approach).\nFinancial Plan\n\nCreate tiered offerings:\nFree/low-cost digital tools or templates for individuals.\nPremium workshops and retreats for organizations.\nA long-term subscription model for teams to access ongoing coaching or data visualization dashboards.\nLegacy Projects\n\nBuild a tool for AI-assisted reflective alignment—helping individuals take pride in their work by uncovering blind spots and enhancing their outputs.\nWrite a book or create a documentary: \"My Experiments with Beauty\", capturing your journey, philosophy, and the stories of transformation you’ve facilitated.\nLanding Page Concept\nTitle:\nAwaken Alignment.

You’re a Bridge Between Depth and Practicality** The reflection on your “memory crystal” reveals that your true value lies in helping others recognize their unique beauty and creative potential, guiding them to create in ways that they might not have imagined possible. This is about **celebrating the vitality in others**, not projecting an idealized form of success or ‘good’. Your models should inspire—by seeing people **alive**, active, and connected to their inner light. #### **2. Crafting and Refining Your Book (Barakanomics)** - **Revised Focus:** Aim for a **book that balances broad, transformative ideas** with **practical applications**. Focus on **broad principles**, but within them, provide **small, but powerful action steps**. The idea is to leave people inspired while still giving them the tools to start their journey. **Humanize the approach** to avoid feeling stiff or overly “step-by-step,” and emphasize **self-reflection**, choice, and agency. The book should emphasize **what you can become, not just what you can do**. - **Key Proposition:** The economic system should facilitate us to **be more human**, to **feel connected**, and to maximize the “gifts” we all uniquely bring to the table—this should come through as an evolving idea rather than a static blueprint. #### **3. Aligning Your Career with Personal and Financial Fulfillment** After reflecting on your career's trajectory, here’s a plan to satisfy your career, personal growth, and financial needs, connecting with **the right problems and audiences**: --- #### **Who Are You Serving?** - **Ideal Audiences:** - **Innovative action-takers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)**: Social entrepreneurs, startup founders, young creators—people pushing boundaries but needing resilience and alignment frameworks for growth. - **Human-scaled organizations**: Think impact-driven startups or nonprofits that aren’t merely profit-driven but value authenticity and transformation. - **Corporate Leaders Challenging Efficiency Norms**: Specifically HR departments or innovation labs looking for novel pathways to boost team resilience, human well-being, and creativity while rethinking performance metrics. #### **What Problem Do You Solve?** - **For Entrepreneurs**: You help them **realign with their deeper purpose** in the business world, so that they **don’t burn out** but rather grow interconnectedly, pulling from the divine creativity within them. You help them **rediscover beauty** both in their work and in their people, ensuring their businesses thrive because they are resilient not just efficient. - **For Corporate Leaders or HR**: You provide a way to **rehumanize the workplace**. In an age when AI and productivity tools are transforming businesses, you help leaders maintain teams’ **alignment with personal creativity** and **mental well-being**, preventing AI from being used only to generate profits but **to boost individual and team growth** to its highest, most authentic potential. - **For Every Audience**: You **guide people towards self-reflection**, helping them navigate AI’s growth in ways that **encourage deeper alignment with their gifts and purposes**, **bossing up** with AI instead of relying on it as a crutch. --- #### **Your Ideas/Frameworks to Offer** - **AI-Powered Alignment + Human Creativity**: Workshop and tools where **reflection is magnified** by AI rather than replaced by it. For instance, a system where AI **asks questions** to guide creativity instead of just generating \"done work\"—helping participants delve into **their blind spots** and **transform** their projects with care, depth, and beauty. - **Memory Crystal Career Gravesight:** A tool or workshop that helps individuals **see their career story backward**—projecting their legacy given their actions today by helping them visualize key moments, contributions, and gifts that marked their progress. - **Resilience Framework for Entrepreneurs**: How to stay connected spiritually, emotionally, and creatively as their ventures grow. **Post-traumatic growth pathways** from failure, struggles, and resilience-based foundations. --- ### **Pitch to You and Others** #### **Pitch for Entrepreneurs and Foundations** “You’re walking a fragile path, **juggling the weight of expectations, limitations, and burnout.** But what if you could **realign** with the deeper purpose underneath your ambition? My workshops take you beyond productivity, uncovering the **creative beauty** behind your struggle and fostering a resilient team capable of long-term innovation. Together, let’s build a memory you will be proud of.” #### **Pitch for Corporate and HR** “I can help you **re-enter humanity** in the midst of all the AI and automation efficiencies your business is pursuing. You want stronger teams—teams that **care deeply** about their work and connect authentically. What if you could **blow up old metrics**, focusing instead on making your team **feel healthy, connected, and purpose-driven**? That’s where I come in—to lead your transformation from the inside out.” #### **Pitch for Investors/Partners (e.g., book publishing or collaborations with Learning Planet or Fonda)**: “Are you looking for the next big conversation on transformation and well-being? Visionary thinkers in the MENA and globally are primed for a book on the intersection of human resilience, AI, purpose, and creating a business model that considers the **collective good**. In addition, my workshops could establish profound foundations globally, rejuvenating the current system.” --- ### **Plan for January 24-31, 2024** - **January 24:** Reflect deeply on your story: **What have you accomplished and learned**, and where did that learning show up in the lives of those you’ve worked with? Curate those stories into usable metrics that confirm the impact of your work thus far. - **January 25:** Map out your **“AI-powered reflective tools”** in more detail, defining pragmatic outcomes (e.g. better creativity, deeper engagement) and write them up as workshops or tools. - **January 26:** Develop the **“memory crystal dashboard” to track individual and organizational team growth**. Create two versions: One for entrepreneurs and one for corporate HR departments. - **January 27:** Collaborate or research best tools for **AI and human creativity alignment**. Reach out to possible collaborators like Pascal or organizations already working with AI and see if they might help you prototype your ideas. - **January 28-29:** Dive into your **long-term book idea**; trace the **key themes**, narrowing down the most **relevant** chapters and topics. Rework the structure of Barakanomics focusing more on **principles and values**, with less emphasis on rigid steps. - **January 30:** Refine your **landing page** to showcase upcoming workshops, books, and tools in development. Start developing partnerships and collaborations for the 2024 year (e.g., Learning Planet; Paris money/jobs). - **January 31:** Sit for **three hours of reflection**; write. Dedicate space to journal **your new year’s path**, writing affirmations and identifying the 3 breakthroughs you need for your career. --- #### **Questions to Revisit and Go Deeper With** 1. **If you could radiate one truth in corporate and startup circles, what would it be, that helps remove the mask of ‘productivity over purpose’ for everyone meeting you?** 2. **How will you know when you’ve cracked the perfect blend of AI + human creativity in your tools, and what does that success look like for the world you care about?** 3. **What is the **biggest scar of failure** you’ve carried so long in your heart—how do you transform it knowingly, this year, so the story aligns with your remembrance of what matters most?** --- Would you like to dive further into one of these paths or clarify a specific part of the plan above? for 14 seconds\nBelow is a vision of a future you’ll come alive in—one that balances your yearning for deep transformation, your desire to see the divine light in others, and your practical need to earn a living and share your gifts at scale. It addresses:\n\nWhere and with whom you could collaborate (e.g., Spain, Learning Planet Institute, Pascal, co-founders)\nHow to refine your Barakanomics book to make it accessible yet transformative\nA career path that solves real problems while letting you shine\nFollowing that is a “pitch” you can use (with some tweaking) when you talk to potential partners, funders, or communities about what you offer. It focuses on the problem you solve, the frameworks or ideas that you bring, and how they provide real value.\n\n1. A Possible Life-Giving Path\nDecide on a Core “Product” Beyond Your Time\n\nBook on Barakanomics: A structured but inviting journey into spiritual/regenerative economics.\nAI-Assisted Tool: Helps people reflect on their gifts, fosters alignment, and organizes their thinking into coherent outputs (instead of AI doing the work for them).\nModular Workshops: Short, impactful sessions (online or in-person) around post-traumatic growth, reflective AI usage, and “seeing the divine light” in everyday work.\nIdentify Collaborators and Locations That Energize You\n\nLa Fonda in Spain: If it offers a community of creatives and innovators, it could be the perfect “human-scale” environment where people appreciate depth, resilience, and mystical edges.\nLearning Planet Institute in Paris: They focus on learning innovation, open science, and community-driven change. This might resonate deeply with your emphasis on reflection and well-being.\nLocal Partners (e.g., Pascal or new co-founders): People who share your passion for blending spirituality, design thinking, and AI. It could be a small but agile team capable of turning your big ideas into structured offerings.\nDesign a Structured Yet Fluid Workflow\n\nMorning Creation: Dedicate 2 hours each day to writing or prototyping (the Barakanomics book, AI tool, or workshop outlines).\nCommunity Afternoons: Networking, calls, or co-working sessions with partners who can keep you accountable and expand your perspective.\nRegular Reflection: Schedule weekly personal “memory crystal” reviews: gather small data points, stories, and aha moments from your workshops or user feedback. This keeps you motivated and in touch with your deeper why.\nRefining the Barakanomics Book\n\nAnchor in Personal Stories: Open each chapter with a real-life anecdote (from your own experiments or from others) that crystallizes a key concept.\nOffer Gentle Frameworks: At the end of each chapter, include a short reflection or “experiment with beauty,” guiding readers to integrate ideas without rigid step-by-step instructions.\nMaintain Mystical Depth Without Overwhelm: Pick 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment with the divine) and weave them throughout as recurring themes.\nAdd Visual Elements: Create simple “memory crystals” or data snapshots (e.g., graphs, doodles, mind maps) to show how these principles come to life in practice.\n2. What Problem Are You Solving?\nProblem: In a hyper-competitive, AI-driven world, individuals and teams often feel disconnected from deeper meaning. Traditional approaches to productivity and “innovation” can lead to burnout or superficial results. Many are missing the spark of genuine alignment—where heart, mind, and spirit converge to create lasting value.\n\nSolution: Your work provides a pathway (through workshops, tools, writing, and frameworks) that reconnects people to their own inner resources, fosters a sense of awe and purpose, and harnesses technology (like AI) to enhance rather than replace human creativity. You help them quantify (in ways that matter) the richness of their personal and collective growth—what you call “memory crystals.”\n\n3. The Ideas & Frameworks You Offer\n“See, Feel, Do”\nA design-thinking-inspired approach that also taps into emotional and spiritual intelligence. It encourages people to:\n\nSee what’s truly happening (beyond surface assumptions)\nFeel what resonates in their hearts, forming authentic motivations\nDo creative experiments that bring positive change\nPost-Traumatic Growth & Reflective AI\n\nPTG: Techniques to transform adversity into resilience and deeper insight, especially relevant for teams facing uncertainty.\nAI Tools: Reorient AI from a “replacement” mentality toward a “reflection” mentality—helping individuals see their strengths, articulate their ideas, and feel more ownership over the work.\nBarakanomics\n\nA spiritual/regenerative economic framework emphasizing baraka (blessing, expansion, abundance rooted in alignment with the divine).\nEncourages ethical decision-making, communal wealth, ecological awareness, and personal growth as key success metrics.\nMemory Crystals\n\nA fresh spin on measurement: blending numbers and stories to preserve the essence of each milestone.\nVisible proof that can spark gratitude, pride, and continued commitment.\n4. Example “Pitch” (To Yourself and to Potential Partners)\n**“Hi, I’m Bilal Ghalib. I help individuals and organizations discover a deeper sense of purpose and connection, especially in a rapidly changing, AI-driven world. Through workshops, reflective tools, and my Barakanomics framework, I guide people to ‘see, feel, and do’ in ways that spark true innovation and heart-centered growth.\n\nWe use AI not to replace human creativity but to enhance it—helping participants form ‘memory crystals’ of their journey, both quantitative and qualitative, that keep them aligned with what truly matters. The result? Resilient teams, empowered individuals, and a new economic story that centers on ethical, regenerative practices.\n\nI’ve worked with diverse communities—post-traumatic growth workshops in Gaza, design thinking for marginalized groups, and AI reflection tools for creative teams—always with the same goal: help people come alive and create enduring impact. If you’re an organization or a community seeking this kind of alignment, I’d love to co-create with you.”**\n\n5. A Plan for January to Launch This New Chapter\nJan 24\nRetrospective & Story Gathering\nSpend a focused morning combing through old workshop notes, emails, participant feedback. Extract key “ah-ha” stories that illustrate how your approach impacted real people. Begin a Memory Crystal Document.\nJan 25\nDraft Barakanomics Chapter Sketches\nOutline 3–5 core principles (e.g., humility, generosity, balance, gratitude, alignment). For each principle, choose a personal story and a real-world story from your retrospective.\nJan 26\nAI Tool Conceptualization\nSketch a wireframe or flowchart for how your reflective AI tool might prompt users to generate their own text. Start small. (If time: record a short Loom video explaining your concept.)\nJan 27\nLanding Page Update\nMerge the new stories, your pitch, and “memory crystal” language onto a simple website or Notion page. Make it scannable, inviting, and anchored in the fresh stories you gathered.\nJan 28\nCo-Founder/Collab Outreach\nReach out to Pascal or potential collaborators to discuss your AI tool or workshop series. Also research La Fonda in Spain and Learning Planet Institute. Send short, compelling intro emails that reference your new pitch.\nJan 29\nBook Focus Day\nSpend a block of hours fleshing out a single “Barakanomics” chapter. Incorporate at least one memory crystal from your retrospective. End the day with a quick read-through to see if it feels coherent and inspiring.\nJan 30\nAI Reflection Beta Testing\nIf feasible, test a rudimentary version of your AI reflection prompts with a few friends or past workshop participants. Gather feedback on clarity, engagement, and sense of ownership.\nJan 31\nAlignment & Future Vision\nHost a private “alignment session” for yourself. Revisit your memory crystals, track how the week went, and finalize February’s plan. Decide if you’ll invest more time in seeking corporate leads, or double down on community-driven, mission-aligned groups.\n6. Three Deep Questions to Inspire Revision\nWhat part of you still resists “measuring” success, and how can you integrate that resistance to maintain authenticity while creating structures that sustain you?\nIs there a place or group of people that consistently energizes you, and how can you intentionally spend more time with them to refine and test your ideas?\nIf you imagine an ideal day in 2025—where your book is out, your AI tool has a user base, and you’re earning sustainably—how do you feel in that scenario, and what small decisions right now move you closer to that feeling?\nFinal Note\nThis plan, pitch, and reflection aren’t about fitting yourself into someone else’s box—they’re about crystallizing (literally, in memory crystals!) what already makes you shine and taking the steps to share it with the world in a way that’s fulfilling, financially sustainable, and true to your vision of divine-inspired aliveness in people and their actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nCan you come up with a new book proposal for barakanomics that will connect my book with my broader career aspirations os they are connected deeply?\nA Book Proposal For\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarakanomics\nThe Power of a Truly Halal Economy\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by:\nBilal Ghalib\n11 Av. du Maréchal Lyautey, 59130 Lambersart, France \n\nT: +33 7 44 93 90 32\nE: bg@bilalghalib.com\n\nPresented on:\nDec 3, 2024\n\nTable of Contents\nI.\tOverview\t3\nII.\tAbout the Author\t4\nIII.\tThe Market\t5\nPrimary target:\t5\nSecondary Target\t5\nTertiary Target\t5\nIV.\tCompetition\t7\nV.\tBook Marketing\t8\nMarketing Assets:\t8\nMarketing Plan\t8\n1.\tPre-Launch Phase (3-6 months before book launch)\t8\n2.\tLaunch Phase (first 3-6 weeks from book launch)\t9\n3.\tPost-Launch Phase (After launch phase)\t9\nVI.\tThe Manuscript\t11\nManuscript Details\t11\nChapter by Chapter Synopsis\t11\nVII.\tSample Chapter\t14\n[Insert Chapter Name]\t14\nAppendices\t15\n\n\n\nبسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\nالحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على رسوله الكريم\nOverview\nSeeking knowledge is required of every Muslim, and as we see corruption spreading on the land and inequality growing internationally, knowledge of how to earn a halal living is critical. I believe taking halal rizq(sustinance) seriously can be a source of our healing, and can bring balance to our world.\n\nThe phone in your pocket connects you with cobalt miners in Kolwezi, Congo, designers in San Francisco, USA, and oil refineries in Iraq. The money you spend on that phone is your vote for the hundreds of processes it takes to make, market, ship, and sell it to you. Are you ready to accept responsibility for your actions? Are you ready to face the miners in Congo? Are you willing to defend your vote before God (SWT)?\n\nAre we except from being considered accomplices to oppression that happens in the value chains of our products simply because we are unaware? \n\nIgnorance is an excuse until you know better, and in the light of the global wars, Occupy Wall Street, and the consequences of climate collapse, more people are waking up to the idea that many elements of our polycrisis are by products of the systems we use to get and spend our sustenance. There are movements, like the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that have shown how we can follow our ethics in choosing what not to buy. This book will examine what to buy instead. \n\n“...I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves.”\n-Surah Ibrahim Ayah 22\n\nMuslims represent nearly a quarter of the population of the planet and we can show leadership by developing products and services that follow the beautiful advice of the Prophet of God (S) who has said in an authentic (sahih) hadith: \n\n“Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” \n- Sunan an-Nasa’i 5711; In-book reference : Book 51, Hadith 173\n\nIn an era of destabilizing change and disquiet, we all want our prayers to be answered, and the Prophet (S) has given us a clue as to the relationship between halal rizk and answered prayers:\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: O people, Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. …  He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust(a person desperately needy). He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): \"O Lord, O Lord,\" whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?\nSahih Muslim 1015\n\nIt has been said that true wealth is contentedness, a path towards contentedness in this life, and confidence on the day we will be held accountable to how we earned and spent our money is increasing our efforts to gain knowledge in what is كَسْبٍ طَيِّبٍ (pure earning) and how best to spend it..\n\nBy reading this book, the reader will:\nTake stock of their transactions and work to purify their regular expenditures\nLearn how to earn a halal livelihood and make business a part of our worship.\nBe inspired to establish Baraka-based businesses that can support a parallel economy, one where muslims can confidently acquire pure goods and services.\nBe a part of showing leadership to a world questioning capitalism without alternatives.\n\nAbout the Author\nBilal Ghalib is an educator, entrepreneur and facilitator with 15 years of experience training entrepreneurs internationally. \nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom.pm, a social impact entrepreneurship training organization and education technology company. He’s an advisor for Project Defy, a non-profit organization working to redefine education in India. And since 2015 he has been running the Nur Coop, a business that seeks to be a blessing to the entire value chain from dirt to delivery. \n\nI have X intentions for writing this book:\nTo open the blessings of God to our beloved Muslim Community by sharing knowledge on halal rizk(sustenance).\n To support more people to spend their money in ways that are regenerative and uplifting of the people and ecological systems that underlie their purchases.\nTo transform my own eyes, and others, and to see what happens to businesses which see their customers, the natural world, and their business with the eye of the heart. \nTo increase my taqwa of God(SWT) when he mentions in the Quran “O you who believe! Eat of the lawful and pure things that We have provided you.” [2:172]” that it is God(SWT) providing my sustenance. And I must seek the lawful and pure and increase my efforts in ensuring my consumption is within the good pleasure of God.\nTo inspire people by demonstrating that the Muslim economy can bring about a beautiful transformation. \nTo alter my perception of success and increase my contentedness.  \nTo share my intuition that Muslims can be a blessing for this world by their deeper concern on the next.\nTo invite Muslims, and myself, to decommodify the world and to return to a pre-modern way of seeing the signs of God in all things and all people. And to witness the accompanying change in my interactions, including commercial interactions, with all things. \n\n  The Market \nThe book has three target audiences:\nPrimary target: \nEarly-stage Muslim Entrepreneurs in the UK and the USA\nWhy is this book unique to them? Young Muslims are seeking security in an age of instability. The modern wisdom suggests they start multiple income streams, be their boss, and “ditch the 9-5” even if they could find one. The book attempts to direct them away from repeating the methods of doing business that have led to the age of instability in the first place and to seek trust not in themselves and their capabilities, to first put their relationship with God right, to purify their expenditures, and then to set an intention and execute on creating a taqwa-filled baraka based business that in aggregate can act as a lighthouse in an age of darkness. \nAffinity Groups:\n Cambridge Muslim College\n Karim Lahham\n Faithfully Sustainable\n4 Nations Unite\nGeoff Lawton and Greening The Desert Project\nPeople who like https://tuniqoasis.com/\n\nSecondary Target\nBusiness leaders with a heart.

It’s written as a text book and goes over broad subjects from HR to finance and accounting and setting up a business. My focus is towards inspiring producers and consumers to alter their purchase/production decisions by directing attention towards the problems people see with our ecology, our social ails and how we call to our lord wanting support when we know from the hadith: https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:10 - that unless we purify our clothes, our food, our drink - unless we purify the way we seek our sustenance that this hadith indicates our duaas are less likely to be answered, and God is capable of all things. My goal is not to describe a halal economics precisely, or to define where things are going wrong.\nMy goal is to activate people who become more and more careful and direct more and more of their economic power towards people who are more and more careful.

All with deep adoration of beauty. What does God require of me, and why do I have these gifts and interests?\n \nMy High Himma Intention For Writing This Book\n \nHow will this high-himma intention impact the rest of my life?\nSPIRITUALLY\nInsha’allah my hope is to live the reality of what I’m writing more deeply, to begin to have\ntagwa even more thoroughly in my economic transactions and to be inspired to see that the \npromise of God is true for those who have taqwa.\nPHYSICALLY\nInsha’allah to actualize the intention of this book it will support my inspiration to stay physically\nstrong and capable of managing the tasks set forth for me\nMENTALLY\nMentally insha’allah I will be finding the dots connecting that I have been intuiting, that I find the intelligence to turn\nthe knowledge into food for thought that inspires others in a productive way to make changes in their lives and \ntransactions.\nSOCIALLY\nSociallly, insha’allah, I find my family closer and aligned with me in this work. That I find the others, that we form a global\nfamily of hope.\nFINANCIALLY\nFinancially insha’allah I hope this book activates a global engine of alternative economics of abundance for many, \nincluding my family, such that we do not need to compromise our values and deen in satisfying our needs. I hope to gain \nin confidence in my rizk, such that I fear not poverty, I find strength for generosity, and that God puts the Dunya in my \nhands to give from and not in my heart to keep.\nThe specific dua’a I’ll keep making for this book\nMay God align my thoughts and my actions and grant me accepted actions, may my efforts be inspired by his will, and may I continually be in service of the greatest Good, the Good that I cannot know through my nafs. May God(SWT) bless those who read these words, grant them an increase in faith and understanding on how to act upon it. May we together form a community which works in service of the Most Beautiful to bring beauty to this desperate world, and in doing so beautify our souls, and cause us to be gathered with the beautiful ones, the saints, the martyrs, and the Beautiful Prophet Mohammed (S). May this seed grow, and gather others who align with the intention, and spread to become a source of Nur(light) for those in the darkness of post-caplitalist anxiety and fear. May this be an antidote to the poison of greed, causing such ecological, war, and social destruction. May in finding a new intention to do business be the cause of filling our products and services with baraka, causing an unfolding of counterintuitive economics where all that participate in the market leave blessed, resourced, fed, and filled with meaning and purpose for their lives on earth and a vision of their akhira. May this be the start of a period of inner struggles against the nafs, rather than struggles to pay rent, avoid war and conflict, and the destructive forces of an ecosystem near collapse. May God support our teachers, and supporters, and inspire them to say what is needed and to cause us to hear and heed what is best and grant us the best of duaas that we couldn’t have originated on our own. Ya Allah, send your peace and prayers upon Mohammed and his family and his followers from now till the end of time, and cause me and this group to be among them, insha’allah ameen. \n\n \nMy Book’s Audience\nWho Am I Writing This Book For?\n\nmy audience is the person who is aware of the challenges that our economic activities have on the health of hte world yet aren’t aware that adhering to Islamic ethics in our financial matters is a part of the solution. I believe it can be a valuable resource for Muslims and non-Muslims who want to “positively protest” rather than BDS telling people what not to purchase to ensure a lack of complicity with evil. We want a purchase, encourage, Support PNS - movement telling people where to direct those efforts. and if those businesses don’t exist, I hope this book targets people who will be inspired to start them\n\n\nAge / Demographics / Interests\nAge: 25-45\nwomen/men - likely entrepreneurial, interested (mayyyyybe) in crypto, social impact, climate collapse, spirituality, rumi\nWhere Do My Readers “Hang Out”?\nPro palestinian protest movements?\nIslamic book stores in the UK \nEntrepreneurship ecosystem hubs GMW/Step Conf\n\n\nWho Do They Follow?\nProbably Cambridge Muslim College / Omar Faruq Abdullah\n\nMaybe Elon Musk/Read Gates Notes / Tim Ferriss / Andrew Huberman?\n\nZaytuna’s permaculture group - Rhamis Kent\n\nI’m not actually sure\nWhich Books Are They Interested In? Why?\nThey probably read books like Atomic Habits, Nudge, Tipping Point, etc and other personal development books and other books aiming to grow and achieve success as an individual / professional. \nWhat’s The Size Of My Audience?\nJust focusing on Britan and America:\n7% of the population own businesses 6% of brits are muslim at 4 million\n1/3 are taking steps towards entrepreneurship or intend to 1.2 million are entrepreneurial british people\n“Nearly one-fourth of Black people (23%) have entrepreneurial intentions, twice the percentage of White people. \nAnd nearly one-third (32%) are entrepreneurs, over 2½ times the rate reported among White people.”\nI estimate that there are 346,000,000 americans - and 4,453,908 muslims in America\n4,453,908*23% of them likely to want to or have started a business = 1 million people\nTogther that’s two million people. 1 percent of two million people is 200,000 \nI need to convert 16% of them to get 12,000 -\n\n the number the prophet said wouldn’t be defated. 12,000 to start or adapt their business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting Competition For This Book\n\nEssays in Islamic Economics - is a compilation of academic essays beyond the ken of the lay person.\n\nBook: The Book Of The Proprieties of Earning and Living is a translation of Al Ghazali, a wonderful resource for the principles that will define the book I’m seeking to write. It’s for the person interested in primary sources. \nHardcover. \nPublisher: Islamic Banking and Finance Institute Malaysia (IBFIM)\nCost: 20.52$\n\nBook: Your Money Matters\nPublisher: IPH (International Islamic Publishing House)\nCost: 15.95$\n- this book discusses economics from a business administration angle. It’s written as a text book and goes over broad subjects from HR to finance and accounting and setting up a business. My focus is towards inspiring producers and consumers to alter their purchase/production decisions by directing attention towards the problems people see with our ecology, our social ails and how we call to our lord wanting support when we know from the hadith: https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:10 - that unless we purify our clothes, our food, our drink - unless we purify the way we seek our sustenance that this hadith indicates our duaas are less likely to be answered, and God is capable of all things. My goal is not to describe a halal economics precisely, or to define where things are going wrong.\nMy goal is to activate people who become more and more careful and direct more and more of their economic power towards people who are more and more careful. Amplifying our strength and building the alternatives while ensuring our akhiras. \n\n\n\nWhy Me?\n\nUnique Perspective\nI’ve been an entrepreneur since highshhool and have founded businesses and non-profits in the US, UK, and Lebanon.\n\nI’ve lived in San Francisco and was up-close and personal with the libertarian change the world through unfettered business. \n\nI’m a big nerd, programming, writing, reading, working as an educator and facilitator are big parts of my life, coaching and mentoring entrepreneurs internationally through my social impact accelerator project: Bloom.pm. \n\nI’ve been invited to participate in the Compassionate Leadership Summit with the Dalai Llama and am a part of impact fellowships and impact funder gatherings internationally, giving me a unique view at how wealth sees positive change. \n\nThis leads me to build and experiment with lots of different approaches. \nPersonal Experience & Transformation\nI think the quote that symbolizes this best this one:\n“Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”\n― Rumi\n\nI was a part of the international impact making ecosystem being flown around to speak and pretend like we’re making a difference. \n\nOne day after leaving Syria and Iraq I came to America and had an emotional breakdown, I couldn’t stop crying for 3 days straight. I started to doubt my intentions when Al Jazeera was calling to interview me and I felt proud. Was I really making a difference or was I living the impact BS lifestyle?\n\nI wanted to be sincere, so I moved to Lebanon and started working in the camps there, and started a community home, and lived a financial experiment that went something like: “If someone else can make better use of the dollar I have I shouldn’t doubt them. If it wont literally kill me to give, then I should give” - and I lived that for a couple years … \n\nLots of changes since then, found a sheikh, started to realize my family has obligations that are more privledged than others, and started to attempt to reorder the world, including my financial world. \n\nMy work on the ground with grassroots financial experiments as well as my work in the social impact space working with funders to unlock a “superbloom” of positive change by funding and coaching social entrepreneurs in places most people over look gives me insights, doubts, and a desire to find another way. The way I’ve been exploring both on the grassroots and the systemic impact change methods need reformation and I believe the next step is to exit the mindset that causes me and others to play games within the system that itself is the problem. Something like that… \nExpertise & Credentials\nI’ve been working on a social impact accelerator https://bloom.pm since 2016\nI’ve run a grassroots innovation project gemsi.org from 2011-2020\nI’m a part of the INK Fellowship and the Compassionate Leadership Summit and the NEXUS Global initiatives. \n\n\nPassion & Commitment\nI’ve been digging away at the problem of systems and a more beautiful world since the Arab Spring in 2011 when I first came to the middle east to teach what I thought would help, technology and innovation. It changed to personal growth. And now I’m looking beyond the personal and attempting to identify the fact that the systems change strategy can be altered because there at least two components to the systems we attempt to operate within when people design strategies for systematic positive change.\nWe can ignore the thought that positive is a whole debate on its own for now. \n  \nThe systems we design have two interfaces - one with physical reality, the other with social reality. Social reality is more flexible and has been ignored because it’s the water us fish are swimming in. Indigenous people and indigenous knowledge are a view onto an alternative social reality, faith based perspectives often support an alternative view as well - “wealth isn’t decreased through chairty” - the challenge I and many others have is playing on a globalized field I find myself downplaying the “non-rational” views that emerge from my tradition. \n\nAs the world experiences fragmentation, politically and socially, and with the destruction of our life support systems in the natural world there is anger, fear, and I believe a possibility to open the door to new views of self and the cosmos that can offer a social reality that enables a new game to be played. In the years I’ve been working in “Development” what I’ve noticed is what Anand Giridharadas talks about in winners Take All, many good hearts working within systems, and unseen worldviews and a worship of money. What I believe is an internalized version of evolutionary theory which is applied to society, if it makes money it creates value, if it creates value, it shall survive. These unarticulated foundations underly the design of “development” strategies - focusing on social entrepreneurship for instance. While I encourage many paths forward, I am seeking to create space to discuss and perhaps find power within a new social reality - along with our physical reality which can open space for many new experiments.\n\nThe simple process of describing this is “indigenous economics” or “islamic gift economy” - etc - If what I’m sharing is interesting for you, or confusing, please reach out. I’m working to clarify my thoughts around this. I believe it’s my personal next step after bringing “personal development” alongside “professional development” in the social impact space through the https://bloom.pm accelerator programs we’ve been running. We have a funder looking to fund a MENA wide project come January and I’d like to propose something radically(from the roots of things) different. \n\nTime to cut the ribbon on a new playing field with new(old) rules.\n\n\n\nAudience Feedback\nI feel empowered to make at least one concrete change in my life to clarify, commit to and enact my values economically. \n\n\nClarity of Message\nIf you don’t like what you see in the world realize it’s a mirror of yourself. \n\nThese systems that create the impacts on the world are an aggregate of our human behavior \nظَهَرَ ٱلْفَسَادُ فِى ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِى ٱلنَّاسِ لِيُذِيقَهُم بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِى عَمِلُوا۟ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ ٤١\nCorruption has spread on land and sea as a result of what people’s hands have done, so that Allah may cause them to taste ˹the consequences of˺ some of their deeds and perhaps they might return ˹to the Right Path˺.\n\nAs muslims we’re a significant force on earth, 25% of the population and holders of about 10% of its wealth. \n\nMuslims are also more likely to be entrepreneurial. My question is what happens when 2% of all people on earth take their sustenance creation and sustenance expenditures as a form of worship? \n\nMy book doesn’t attempt to say we’ll fix all the problems, my book attempts to disown myself and others from those problems so when we die we can say we did our best.\n\n\n\nEmpathy & Understanding\nI’ve been an entrepreneur since 2003 and have started many things that haven’t worked, most things - in fact. \nWillingness to Be Vulnerable\nSharing my sincere doubts, pointing at the things that are working, opening space for the readers reflections and contributions.\nLong-Term Vision\nTo identify what the right thing to do today is. \nAnd to do that… for the long term.\n\n\n\n \nPotential Impact / Transformation\nMy Audience BEFORE Reading My Book\nThey might want to start a new business, or have a business. \nThey might be aware that economic protest is a part of an ethical engagement strategy They might be a part of the Boycot Divest Sanction (BDS) movement\nThey might have shopped at Wholefoods before and now feel weird about shopping there now that it was purchased by Amazon.\nThey might feel guilty about using Amazon, yet not be clear why, and use it anyway. \nThey might be interested in permaculture\n\n\nMy Audience AFTER Reading My Book\n\nMy hope is that by the end of the book, more people will be proud of what they eat, because their lives are more fully aligned with the will of God(SWT) and their sustinance (seeking it and consuming it) is now an act of worship, a vote for a more beautiful world, and an opening for their duaas to be answered. To increase their taqwa by having the dunya by a source of constant reminders, buy this/buy that - support this support that? Eat this/that? More moments of our days can be transformed into moments of concious choices towards that which is halal and tayyib and by doing so helps us become what Imran 3:10 says: كُنتُمۡ خَيۡرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخۡرِجَتۡ لِلنَّاسِ تَأۡمُرُونَ بِٱلۡمَعۡرُوفِ وَتَنۡهَوۡنَ عَنِ ٱلۡمُنكَرِ وَتُؤۡمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِۗ وَلَوۡ ءَامَنَ أَهۡلُ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ لَكَانَ خَيۡرٗا لَّهُمۚ مِّنۡهُمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُونَ وَأَكۡثَرُهُمُ ٱلۡفَٰسِقُونَ\nThe best of people, calling to good, and forbidding what is wrong - and we can do that with the way we simply live our days. \nLiving a day to the next requires resources, the way we aquire those and create those for others is one of the deepest ways we can call to good and forbid what is wrong. Systems only live by the blood flowing through their viens, our effort, our time and in a capitalist system, hence: our money is the blood that we must direct through and for alternative systems. My hope is that by the end of reading my book people will find small pockets of economic prostest (positive protest) and be convinced that more and more of how they spend their time/money can be purified. \n\n \n\nMy Book Pitch\nI’m writing a book on more dinar, less problems. \nThe transformative potential of a truly halal lifestyle.\nThe inclusion of the unseen in the science of economics\nI’m writing a book on the power of a dollar well spent… times a billion muslims seeking to do that. \nI’m writing a book on the honorable profession of being in business. \n\nI’m writing a book on how money can be the root of all goodness. \n\n\"Baraka by Design: Building Lives and Businesses Rooted in Blessings\"\nIntention: To provide a framework for entrepreneurs and consumers to align their actions with divine ethics.\n\"The True Cost of Cheap Socks: Connecting Consumption, Oppression, and the Sacred\"\nIntention: To open readers’ eyes to the moral and spiritual implications of their everyday economic choices.\n\nI’d like the book to be about a personal focus for the producers and the consumers to be careful with their income and earning it and how that taqwa(consciousness) will lead to the realization of abundance that might not look like it from the outside, even if the world remains broken, the idea of having contentedness - success is immediate when you are trusting and relying on God, success is a sense of rightness, uprightness, and there MAY be some outward impact(divesting from war machines, happier animals on farms, etc)  insha'allah there will be, we want to see less oppression, we care about people suffering in factories, animals being poisoned, our rivers being damaged, yet we bring it close to where success isn't a long way off, it's now. \nOnce we start taking care and realizing we are being taken care of when we take care of our money. it's better to be a little hungry and to be fed with the baraka of halal food that sustains farmers, cares for the earth, and is full of blessings in positive experiences through the entire value chain, that there is a timelessness - it's not a cause and effect it's not a theory of economics. it's the truth of the reality of success that you sense when you are generous when you donate to charity when you share the wealth your business creates and you see people flourishing, that sense - that's the sense of the divine presence and participation in a blessed economics…\n\n\n\n\n \nA Year From Now\nInsha’allah I untangle myself and and the million ideas to find the one worth sharing, the one that is a true contribution and beneficial knowledge that is useful and that it is alive in the world opening whatever doors are next. \nChatGPT\n\nThought for a couple of seconds\nBelow is a revised book proposal that weaves together your broader career aspirations with the central theme of Barakanomics. The goal is to present a cohesive project—one that stands on its own as a compelling book and serves as a catalyst for your larger mission of promoting regenerative, spiritually grounded economics.\n\nBarakanomics\nThe Transformative Power of a Deeply Halal Economy\n\nSubmitted by:\nBilal Ghalib\n11 Av. du Maréchal Lyautey, 59130 Lambersart, France\nT: +33 7 44 93 90 32\nE: bg@bilalghalib.com\n\nPresented on:\nDec 3, 2024\n\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nAbout the Author\nThe Market\nPrimary Target\nSecondary Target\nTertiary Target\nCompetition\nBook Marketing\nMarketing Assets\nMarketing Plan\nPre-Launch Phase\nLaunch Phase\nPost-Launch Phase\nThe Manuscript\nManuscript Details\nChapter-by-Chapter Synopsis\nSample Chapter\nAppendices\nI. Overview\nبسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\nالحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على رسوله الكريم\n\nBarakanomics: The Transformative Power of a Deeply Halal Economy is a call to action for Muslims and non-Muslims alike to reconsider how we earn and spend our sustenance. Rooted in Islamic ethics and a profound sense of accountability to God (SWT), it argues that a truly halal economy can bring healing to individuals, communities, and the planet. Rather than simply critiquing the global capitalist system, this book aims to activate readers—entrepreneurs, consumers, and leaders—to direct their wealth, business practices, and consumption toward modes that uplift people and the environment, all while seeking divine pleasure and baraka (blessings).\n\nKey Takeaways\nHalal Rizq and Accountability: Understanding that our daily economic decisions—what we buy, sell, and invest in—are direct expressions of our ethics and belief in God.\nContentedness as True Wealth: Realigning our perception of success with trust in God’s provision, rather than short-term gains or purely materialistic measures.\nPractical Frameworks and Examples: Guiding readers to transform ordinary purchases and business activities into acts of worship, positivity, and social impact.\nBeyond BDS: Proposing the next step—actively supporting businesses and projects that align with deeply ethical, regenerative principles, creating an ecosystem of goodness.\nBarakanomics is more than just a book; it is also the cornerstone of a broader career mission—an invitation to create, consult, and workshop with communities that aspire to a spiritually grounded, ethically robust approach to earning and spending. By linking the book’s message to workshops, AI tools, and new collaborations (such as at La Fonda in Spain or with the Learning Planet Institute in Paris), the author’s work in spiritual-ethical economics becomes a cohesive portfolio of offerings.\n\nII. About the Author\nBilal Ghalib is an educator, entrepreneur, and facilitator with 15 years’ experience training entrepreneurs internationally. He co-founded Bloom.pm—a social impact entrepreneurship training organization and education technology company—and has advised grassroots innovations, such as the Nur Coop and Project Defy. Bilal’s passion for technology, personal growth, and social impact has brought him from San Francisco’s startup scene to refugee camps in Lebanon, and from corporate summits to post-traumatic growth workshops in conflict-affected areas.\n\nHis journey began with a desire to change the world, only to discover that sincerity in faith, alignment with divine ethics, and personal transformation are crucial to any real, lasting impact. Now, Bilal focuses on exploring how halal rizq (lawful sustenance), careful consumption, and an attitude of worship can provide answers to a system in crisis. With a background in social impact accelerators, grassroots campaigns, and an emerging AI-enabled approach to reflection, Bilal offers a unique perspective on how spiritual principles can drive real-world solutions.\n\nIII. The Market\nPrimary Target\nEarly-Stage Muslim Entrepreneurs in the UK and the USA\n\nAges 25–45, actively exploring how to build ethically and spiritually informed businesses.\nReaders likely wrestling with modern entrepreneurial “hustle culture” but seeking a grounded, faith-based alternative.\nAffinity Groups: Cambridge Muslim College, Faithfully Sustainable, Greening the Desert Project, Tuniq Oasis, and other ecosystems connecting Islam, environment, and business.\nSecondary Target\nBusiness Leaders With Heart\n\nLeaders who care about social justice and sustainability, including Indigenous, faith-based, or socially-conscious entrepreneurs.\nAffinity Groups: Charles Eisenstein’s Sacred Economics, Carol Sanford’s The Regenerative Business, and others forging new forms of socially responsible business.\nTertiary Target\nNon-Muslim Conscious Consumers and Ethical Entrepreneurs\n\nPeople interested in alternative economic models, ethical supply chains, and spiritual or philosophical underpinnings of commerce.\nAffinity Groups: Regenerative business communities, social enterprise networks, and those who read personal development or social critique books like Atomic Habits, Nudge, Winners Take All, etc.\nIV. Competition\nEssays in Islamic Economics\n\nAcademic, less accessible to a broader audience.\nThe Book of the Proprieties of Earning and Living (Al-Ghazali)\n\nPrimary source translation; valuable but dense, lacking modern application or real-world “case studies.”\nYour Money Matters (IPH)\n\nA business administration text aimed at a broad overview; it does not delve into the spiritual or community-centered approaches deeply.\nBy contrast, Barakanomics offers a practical and inspirational perspective that moves beyond theory or textbook instructions—focusing on activating readers to align their daily spending and livelihood with deeper principles of halal, tayyib (pure), and baraka.\n\nV.

Still, the majority of young people are frightened of the future. The better things get, the worse we feel. The Western Enlightenment deified humanity. Now, everyone, everywhere, pressured by the need to survive in a globalized economy, is transformed from human beings into human resources. The planet devolves from signs of God into lifeless natural resources. It's time for Muslims to dethrone the religion of progress and return to a true Enlightenment, animated by an Islamic economics that aligns us with the true nature of things, pointing heavenward.”\"   Not quite manifesto-ey enough I guess… I think the issue is there are a few big questions and ideas I want to explore:\n1) The way modernity influences the way we know things. What is the self in the era of the selfie? What is death in the era of exponential thinking? Where is God when “everybody is waiting for the weekend”?\n2) Where did this perception of self and the world come from? Descartes? “The limits of our language define the limits of our world.”- Wittgenstein and we live in a world dominated by the English language, which developed and encoded much of the scientistic worldview from Darwin to Steven Pinker.\n3) What is the relationship between self-perception and identity and the way we wield power, including scientific power? Ex. Why didn’t the Ottoman khalifate or the Chinese Empire use their technology to initiate the “industrial revolution”?\n4) What alternative ways can we see the world and the self and the purpose of both?\n5) How would those alternative ways impact internal/external ecologies and the global economy?\n6) If those alternative worldviews, schemas, frameworks are available - what does it take to establish them and what are the consequences?\n7) Is it possible to answer these questions in one book?\n8) Is this one book, or 5?\n Curious if people are following my line of thinking and if there are any gaps. What do you think about the book/number of book ideas? Salam for now 🙂\n\n\n\neducation \nmy own personal progress\nrage against the machine\nthe machine is inside my head\n\n[Waterfall sounds] So, we want to discuss...\n\n[Waterfall sounds] We want to discuss... my book that I'm working on, which is... kind of hard to describe.\n\nIt's a book about... well, it's a book that's trying to do a few things.\n\nIt's trying to make explicit the connection between the sicknesses that we're getting as society.\n\nI mean, maybe that's a good way of talking about it, and, you know, a lot of medicine is... can be considered as... the removal of the causes of harm, rather than the... addition of a better solution.\n\nAnd in the world, there's a lot of effort and hope to build... a solution for climate collapse, which is an addition, right?\n\nYou can add particles that reflect in the upper atmosphere, and it will reduce the amount of solar radiation.\n\nAnd at the same time, we remember during COVID, when people were forced into lockdowns, that a lot of things were improving.\n\nNature is healing, they said.\n\nAnd similarly, in our world, we see so many of these problems happening, partially because of this idea of more is better, right?\n\nLike, you put the ingredients list, and you realize just how much stuff is filling our products.\n\nIt's kind of insane.\n\nYou see just preservatives, and it's because of this... of the solutions.\n\nThe solutions we make today are the problems we need to address of the future.\n\nYou know, like, how many new businesses sprung forth, because of this phone addiction, and all these businesses started trying to help people make time in their life, and screen time reduction, and...\n\nOne of the questions that I want to bring up and highlight in this book is, potentially, one of the reasons a lot of this challenge is happening is due to the...\n\n[Sounds of a vacuum cleaner] the lack of a clear vision of what life is about.\n\nThere's an issue when people designing our better futures want to prevent corruption by preventing the arena or the deployment of ethical action.\n\nAnd it reminds me of the problem with safety.\n\nAnd how we want our children to be safe, and we made their playgrounds incredibly boring.\n\nAnd I believe that we're doing this in all sorts of ways, but on a larger scale where, instead of increasing capacity and appropriate justification for someone to be proud about themselves and what they've committed their lives to and study and growth, being at the precipice of an ethical dilemma and doing the right thing, even though it was hard, and instead, what we get are...\n\n[Sounds of a vacuum cleaner] blockchain observability.\n\nAnd if that blockchain is a bad tool, it may have a useful purpose in making public protocols.\n\nI think that's one of the elements that's really quite important, that I don't think people really give it enough credit for, a protocol that can be publicly viewable and fairly interacted with, yet this idea of an AI governance system that will somehow see all the needs and the wants and make a perfectly efficient mechanism.\n\nPeople say markets work, right?\n\nBut what do they do?\n\nThey might work, but what are they working to do?\n\nFind the right price for what?\n\nAnd I think that's an interesting way of framing this whole problem.\n\nMarkets are super efficient, great ways of sharing information, because we leverage people's fear of death.\n\nThat's kind of what it is.\n\nMoney somehow is seen as this buffer against the inevitable, even if it's not.\n\nEvery rich person you know is dead at some point, died.\n\nAnd there's this group of people growing more and more.\n\nLoud, trying to increase our lifespan.\n\nAnd go to Mars.\n\nAnd it's as if our life on this planet is so... beautiful and so fleeting and so miraculous that we have to crush the butterfly in our hands to detect it.\n\nWe take this beautiful thing and, at some kind of perspective, the way the people are attempting to preserve and protect life on Earth is in the creation of these oppressive systems.\n\nOf this creation of this kind of techno-Soviet perspective where it's not this human life that's oppressive, but conscious.\n\nThis idea of progress and technology and growth and what people don't really see are the underlying principles.\n\nThe things that people are assuming about what human life is.\n\nSo the assumption is the thing that makes humanity special is consciousness.\n\nAnd that consciousness is not related at all to the human body and not related at all to life.\n\nIt's simply an artifact.\n\nIt's simply an artifact of the biological processes of an organism whose primary objective is reproduction.\n\nAnd through all of these accidents, we get to this special thing, right?\n\nAnd this special thing called consciousness is to be preserved at all costs.\n\nAnd you see this relates to the fundamental fear of death and this sense that we are our thoughts.\n\nAnd there are many people who see kind of a potential in this kind of perspective for affirmations.\n\nAnd as a man sinketh, there's nothing truly good or bad, but thinking makes it so, or whatever Shakespeare said.\n\nAnd that's an interesting perspective because I don't know if that's necessary too.\n\nAnd I believe that some of these like base underlying unquestioned theories about the world or about implications of these scientific theories.\n\nFor instance, survival of the fittest, I believe, is potentially one of these ways that libertarians kind of excuse themselves and nice use themselves, so libertarians kind of defend their thoughts.\n\nFree markets is a lot like the free \"world.\"\n\nThe free \"world\" ideas are going to be good or bad based on how they interact with the system.\n\nAnd it's expected similar to good genes that good ideas will be spread.\n\nAnd that's not necessarily true.\n\nThey're different.\n\nIt's the world of nature and the world of humanity.\n\nThere's more and more power coming into the hands of individuals.\n\nAnd so fewer ideas can be amplified.\n\nAnd then outrage and these qualitative realities of fear and a lack of trust and the idea of having the position to give at least a few fundamental base perspectives against which we must hold all of our other experiences.\n\nFor instance, you can think that God's mercy always is rest.\n\nThat is one of the principles or one of the foundational beliefs about God, about life, about the universe that we are told.\n\nAnd there's an unseen reality.\n\nAnd this unseen reality is existence.\n\nBecause we had no way of perceiving neutrinos, it didn't mean they didn't exist.\n\nJust because we had no way of measuring thoughts using EKGs and...\n\nIt doesn't mean that that wasn't happening.\n\nThere's people that are removing livers because livers were an important part of cognition.\n\nThe brain was useless and so it was thrown away.\n\nThe reality is it is extremely dark and your brain has no...\n\nYou are seeing your way.\n\nThis is the world filtered by your available sensory apparatus and there's the psychs-peaks-psychs-warth hypothesis that indicates that it's possible that our language makes up our world.\n\nLike, in science, my words are my world.\n\nAnd this means that our world is actually dark and what is light is this consciousness that is able to survive a type of reality, a flavor, a unique step person's reality.\n\nAnd so, in this lonely world, the question I have is what can be shared?\n\nSome of me sees that everything is sort of cause and effect.\n\nThere's a time delay and every time we see an event or hear a certain string of words it has an implication but not a causation.\n\nNot causation.\n\nWhen Abraham was being thrown into the fire, his yakin, his confidence in the power of God was so high that he didn't want the help of metaphysical entities in that moment because he was seeking his Lord.\n\nAnd this type of confidence that is possible has implications.\n\nAnd I believe that these implications show up in our world.\n\nSo, money isn't good.\n\nSuccess isn't good.\n\nGood is something that is known through a direct observation.\n\nGod is good and God can be known.\n\nYou know facts.\n\nYou infer theories.\n\nSo, do you know the theory of evolution?\n\nDo you know the fact of the Big Bang?\n\nWe've inferred these through our reason.\n\nThe reason is powerful.\n\nIt is able to tell us how to do many things.\n\nNow, because it is a mercy from God that the world operates meaningfully like a system.\n\nIt is a mercy that He also gave us the ability to identify good actions regardless of these systems.\n\nIt says that Satan makes you afraid of poverty.\n\nBut God encourages you to.\n\nWhat An says is that Satan threatens you with poverty.\n\nAnd so this idea that we feel this threat.\n\nBut do this anyway.\n\nAnd that when you do that, you will be given.\n\nYour money will have better cut in it when you donate some of it.\n\nYour time has better cut when you give some of it away.\n\nWe need to start to realize the truths that we can be seeking are spiritual truths that can be known through direct experience without interpretation or time.\n\nGod is good and His goodness is palpably felt in the moment of an act of generosity.\n\nWe see oppression towards people, towards animals, for those who are willing to look.\n\nAnd this is not the world, not the points of the world.\n\nThe point of the world is to attain satisfaction with the promise of God and a good ending.\n\nWith the refinement of ourselves.\n\nAnd not necessarily to protect and to stop deforestation or to end the war or to heal the sick or to reduce poverty.\n\nThese are realities that exist just like the reality of the Mount of Saffa not turning to gold in order to be a mercy for those pagans who had not yet converted.\n\nIf we get what we want, we become those we despise.\n\nIf we get into a state of reliance and to equate and to be a mean, our lives will be transformed.\n\nNow, does this mean that there will be no problems in the world?\n\nThat somehow we will become complacent and go up to a mountain somewhere and that's the end of the story somehow?\n\nOr does it mean that we will have heaven on earth?\n\nThat's also not the point.\n\nThose that are tried the most are those whom God loves the most.\n\nSo if that's the case and we know that the end of time will come with harsh trials and difficulties, then maybe if we're lucky, we can be one of those whom God loves.\n\nAnd those whom the Prophet ﷺ talks about in his hadith at the end of times, who do a little but are worth a lot.\n\nAnd I believe there's a secret in our history in looking at the tradespeople who came to Indonesia.\n\nAnd a whole population was inspired by the character and the qualities of the Muslims to become Muslim themselves.\n\nAnd Ava Ghazali says it's an obligation for anyone going into trade to understand the bare minimum requirements such that he or she is able to do it.\n\nAva Ghazali is able to properly conduct trade without committing haram or forbidden actions.\n\nAnd to tie all of this together is to try to suggest that with a billion and a half Muslims, the economic power of people having more taqwa, and wanting their prayers to be answered.\n\nAnd if we remember the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ, who saw this person who was dusty and disheveled and clearly in a state of need, and he was calling to God and he said about this man, \"How do you expect someone whose food is haram, his clothing is haram, and the way that he seeks his sustenance is forbidden?\n\nHow could God answer his call?\"\n\nAnd I feel that it is similar to that mountain of Safa where the Prophet refused to make the du'a'at to turn it into a mountain of gold because he wanted to open the pathways of mercy.\n\nAnd if we are given without effort, if we are given without becoming, without recognizing in the truth of the promises that God makes for us in the Qur'an, then we will not develop that confidence, that trust, not become those people who love God and whom God loves.\n\nAnd there is an important element here.\n\nThe book, I'm trying to write, wants to open these doors so that we can see the connections between the oil companies and the prophets that are being made and the governments that are in power and the disasters, the water violence in South America, the oil violence in the Middle East.\n\nAnd these are all things that are systemic.\n\nAnd you can sort of pull back the wool from your eyes and you can see this connection between the educational systems and the whole way the industrialized world appeared.\n\nI mean, one of the things that I really liked, I was watching The Lion of the Desert the other day and in the movie some of these rebels had taken some of the Italian fascist soldiers as prisoners and they were going to execute them on the spot.\n\nAnd this guy Omar Muhtar, the head of the rebel forces, was like, \"No, don't do that.\"\n\nBut they were like, \"Why?\n\nThey did it to us.\"\n\nAnd he just said, \"Well, they are not our teachers.\"\n\nAnd when we see how Adam Smith's worldview is infused during a colonial expansionist genocide practicing time and the industrial revolution was always historically seen by historians as so close to being done by the Chinese, so close to being done by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAnd the Ottoman Empire had developed technologies for the steam engine.\n\nThey could have very simply taken that technology and, you know, if they were ingenious enough to invent the steam engine and build those great mosques, I believe it's not a far-flung idea to imagine that they could have strung them up into factories on the Bosphorus spinning these turbines and, you know, they could have created factories full of children with nimble fingers making thimbles and teapots and who knows what else and conquering the world's trade.\n\nThey were right there, right between east and west.\n\nThey could have been great.\n\nAnd people keep saying, \"Why didn't they do it?\"\n\nThey were right there.\n\nThey had everything to do what made us so powerful.\n\nAnd I think it's interesting looking backward, but it's not as important as looking forward.\n\nSo looking backward we can say maybe they realized that they shouldn't.\n\nYou know, it's actually a clear connection because during the Ottoman time they wanted to import the printing press, but it was prevented because they had over thousands and thousands of scribes employed perfecting their craft.\n\nAnd these scribes would have been out of jobs and this craft would have been degraded and destroyed.\n\nAnd it's clear to see that with leadership there's the possibility for refusing the advancement of technology.\n\nWhen there's a different view of humanity from the enlightenment period onwards where we became our thoughts, where we became consciousness itself and only that and doubted everything else, we doubted our capacity for knowing what is good and what is bad.\n\nAnd who is human and who is not.\n\nAnd man is the measure of all things they say.\n\nAnd in the enlightenment times we lose the realization that if man is the measure of all things, it's only because man from the Muslim perspective has a connection to the divine.\n\nAnd the divine can be perceived before death, can be known, can be felt.\n\nThere's a qualitative nature to seeing a rainbow.\n\nThe poetics of holding your child's hand.\n\nThere's quantitative explanations of oxy, cotton and the hormones of the cartel hormones and the idea that in the dark, historically we were more likely to be bitten by snakes or stung by scorpions and therefore the dark is frightening and the sun implies good crops growing and warmth on our skin and lack of freezing to death.\n\nAnd therefore goodness is related to the foundational perception of man as a molecular machine with consciousness and seeking to reproduce.\n\nNow, you might not think that's how you see the world, but everything we are building in Western civilization builds with this perspective in mind.\n\nWhy do we struggle so much to extend quality life hours?\n\nWhy is death seen as a failure by doctors?\n\nThere are a few people on the edges, people that work with terminally ill patients, surprised that a psychedelic experience that breaks the capacity for communicating what has happened in rational terms gives people access to altered states of consciousness.\n\nThat they're surprised that this helps ease the pain of death.\n\nAnd we're just now opening up in Western society to realizing holy crap.\n\nThis is meaningful except it's only able to influence public discourse once it's moved into the lab and once people's stories are aggregated and categorized, and then, even then, the measures of whether or not we should be allowing these substances is related to the suffering that happens in life to decrease, not the success of a good death.\n\nIt's very stuck.\n\nWe are stuck in this world and we want to understand it.\n\nAnd in understanding it, we understand as people say, knowledge is power.\n\nAnd so if we can understand this world well enough, we may push back that which we fear and gain that which we want.\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, when we gain that which we want, we become those whom we despise.\n\nWhen we get that cake that you really wanted, you get fat.\n\nWhen you are a teenager and you just want all the attention from the ladies, you don't find your life partner.\n\nWhen all you want to do is travel, you wake up one day and you realize you have many acquaintances and no friends.\n\nWe need a way of living that tells us there's such thing as enough and that not only that, that there's qualitative things that are more important than the quantitative things.\n\nThere are the unseen things that matter.\n\nAnd I believe that this escalation of progress is sort of like a drug addict asking for just one more hit.\n\nIt is a promise that we are making each other in Western society that tomorrow will be better and the day after will be even better than that one.\n\nAnd if this doesn't seem to be true, then we will have to confront the reality that this life is what we have to live and is that good enough for me and for you.\n\nContentedness.\n\nCan we see this connection between and then we'll cure this disease and then that disease and then we'll have abundance that we'll find a way of sharing internationally, extending life spans.\n\nPeople are making all sorts of claims like Stephen Pinker's talking about how we're getting better on every measure that matters except the problem is the measures themselves.\n\nThe problem is they are measuring.\n\nThey are not measuring.\n\nThey are not coming to that moment of death.\n\nAnd I really think that we need to become friends with death and that having a society where death is hidden from us and birth is also sterilized and hidden from us makes it so that the opportunities for the big questions don't come up because people are rushing and they're given all these promises.\n\nWhy do you think Occupy Wall Street was so infuriating and energized and mobilized so many people around the world?\n\nIt's because this idea that play this game, this economic game and tomorrow will be better and the day after and without this constantly growing economy, without this idea that things will continually get better, we need, we will be afraid to stand still.\n\nIt's the craziest thing.\n\nYou know, when someone is so used to being busy that they are always creating situations that occupy them, they clean things, they do stuff, they pull things out from under the rug to seem busy because standing still is terrifying to contend with yourself and with the reality of what you think your life is.\n\nAnd this promise to its people because societies are fragile.\n\nThey are based on jointly held beliefs that are incongruent with how the world works.\n\nThe idea that we can just produce and continually produce is necessary for our average GDP expected lifestyle of our country.\n\nIf growth doesn't happen, it's seen as failure.\n\nAnd in a debt based economy, this growth kind of waggles up and down on top of production, which is basically taking knowledge plus the material world and turning it into material benefit for humans and exchanging value created for economic progress that gets represented in GDP.\n\nThis creates context for competition.\n\nThis creates context for continual growth in a world with finite resources and the necessary expansion of ways for people to spend their money on goods and services that has another cap, which is human attention.\n\nAnd so we've squeezed everything that we can from our attention, from our ability to convert resources into value and we're slowing down in terms of growth.\n\nAnd if there's no growth, then we must destroy because that is another avenue for expenditures.\n\nWe see the military as one of the largest budgets in most countries of the world.\n\nAnd it's not necessarily because we're concerned about conflict.\n\nIt's this economy of domination.\n\nThey're calling the tariffs that Trump is proposing economic warfare.\n\nAnd the worldview of others achieving technological progress first or growing wealthier and therefore more powerful and spending more on their military is scary.\n\nAnd these economic forces are driven by this need for constant growth because of the inability to accept death, this fear of the other and this thought of superiority by way of progress.\n\nOur ingenuity, creativity, production capacity.\n\nWe work hard and we do well by our innovation and our creativity.\n\nAnd we idealize these figures who are able to create wealth and a certain lifestyle for themselves.\n\nNow, these ideas create some of the setting for the world that we're in.\n\nAnd what I want to do with my book is to demonstrate that we can play the game that God designed us to play.\n\nAnd we can see that there's an alternative field overlaid on the one that you see now.\n\nTh"

            "text": " Let me analyze all this rich content and help organize it into actionable next steps.\n\nSummary of Key Themes:\n- You're wrestling with deep questions about modernity, consciousness, economics, and spiritual purpose\n- Your work spans multiple domains: workshops, AI tools, social entrepreneurship, and spiritual economics\n- You see a need to bridge Islamic principles with modern challenges around consumption, technology, and business\n- There's tension between wanting to create practical impact while maintaining spiritual depth\n- The book idea \"Barakanomics\" could serve as a foundation for broader career aspirations\n\n5 Key Questions for Planning:\n1. What if instead of trying to choose between corporate/startup audiences vs. spiritual seekers, you focused on being a bridge-builder who helps translate deep wisdom into practical frameworks?\n\n2. How might you create a \"minimum viable offering\" that combines your workshop facilitation skills, AI insights, and spiritual economics expertise into something you could test with real audiences within the next 30 days?\n\n3. What are the 2-3 core stories from your experience (e.g., post-traumatic growth workshops, Bloom.pm, spiritual journey) that best capture your unique value proposition?\n\n4. Which potential collaborators (La Fonda, Learning Planet Institute, etc.) align best with both your immediate financial needs and longer-term vision?\n\n5. How can you structure the Barakanomics book to serve as both standalone value and a gateway to your workshops/consulting work?\n\n5 Prompts for Next Steps:\n\n1. Create a \"Memory Crystal Dashboard\":\n- Document all past workshops, their impact, and participant feedback\n- Identify patterns in what worked best\n- Use this to craft your unique offering\n\n2. Design a Pilot Workshop:\n- Combine post-traumatic growth framework with Barakanomics principles\n- Test with a small group\n- Gather testimonials and refine approach\n\n3. Build Simple Landing Page:\n- Focus on your unique intersection of spirituality, technology, and economics\n- Include 1-2 concrete offerings (workshop/consulting)\n- Add email capture for book updates\n\n4. Outreach Campaign:\n- List 10 potential collaborators (organizations/individuals)\n- Draft personalized outreach messages\n- Focus on immediate opportunities for paid work\n\n5. Book Development Strategy:\n- Create outline focusing on practical frameworks grounded in spiritual wisdom\n- Write one complete chapter\n- Use content for articles/social media to build audience\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or explore additional options?",
