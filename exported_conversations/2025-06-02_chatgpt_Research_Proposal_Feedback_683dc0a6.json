      "content": "# Values-Driven Personal Knowledge Systems: Designing AI-Enhanced Ontologies that Bridge Individual Epistemology and Collaborative Knowledge Production\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn an era of information overload, individuals struggle to manage personal knowledge in ways that reflect their unique values and epistemic perspectives. This proposal outlines a **values-driven personal knowledge system** that uses AI to help users build and maintain personal ontologies (structured knowledge representations) aligned with their values and ways of knowing, while also facilitating the translation of personal insights into collaboratively useful knowledge. We survey key concepts – knowledge graphs, ontologies, taxonomies, and topic models – clarifying their roles in personal knowledge management. Grounding our approach in value-sensitive design and library and information science (LIS) theories of knowledge organization, we formulate research questions on encoding personal values in knowledge structures, AI-assisted ontology development, and bridging personal knowledge with communal knowledge bases. We propose a mixed-method methodology encompassing the design of an AI-enhanced personal knowledge graph prototype, with pseudocode algorithms and a system architecture for processing unstructured inputs (e.g. GPT chat logs, voice notes) into a structured personal “knowledge garden.” The system will be iteratively developed and evaluated for both creative ideation support and formal knowledge artifact generation. Finally, we present a product requirements roadmap for a minimum viable product (MVP), detailing functional and non-functional requirements, a phased development timeline, evaluation metrics for knowledge quality and alignment, and ethical considerations for designing value-sensitive personal knowledge management (PKM) tools. This proposal aims to advance research at the intersection of knowledge organization, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence, while providing actionable guidance for product teams building next-generation **AI-augmented personal knowledge management systems**.\n\n## Introduction\n\nModern knowledge workers and learners increasingly rely on personal knowledge management (PKM) systems to capture and organize information from daily activities. **Personal Knowledge Management** is commonly defined as “a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities”【35†L140-L147】. Popular PKM tools – from note-taking apps and wikis to novel “second brain” systems – help individuals curate their notes, ideas, and resources. Yet, these tools often fall short in two critical aspects: (1) they rarely encode the user’s **personal values and epistemology** (i.e. the way an individual views and structures knowledge) in an explicit manner, and (2) they operate in isolation from **collaborative knowledge production**, making it non-trivial to share or integrate personal insights with community knowledge bases (for example, contributing personal research notes to a public wiki or academic repository).\n\nThe emergence of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT, presents new opportunities to address these gaps. AI can assist in organizing unstructured personal content (such as chat transcripts, voice notes, and documents) into structured, meaningful knowledge representations. For instance, AI can perform *ontology learning* – automatically generating or refining an ontology (a formal schema of concepts and relationships) from text data【11†L7-L15】 – which could bootstrap a user’s personal knowledge graph. However, naively applying AI to personal data can lead to issues of misalignment: the AI might impose generic structures or biases not aligned with the individual’s values, or might generate overly complex representations that the user cannot easily control. There is a pressing need for **values-driven design** in personal knowledge systems, ensuring that the human user’s values, context, and epistemic preferences remain central. Value-Sensitive Design (VSD) offers a guiding framework: it is “a theoretically grounded approach to the design of technology that accounts for human values in a principled and comprehensive manner throughout the design process”【36†L87-L95】. In the context of personal knowledge systems, this means the tools should adapt to *how* an individual prefers to organize knowledge (e.g. hierarchically or associatively), protect privacy and autonomy, and support the user’s goals (creative or practical) in knowledge work.\n\nThis research proposal addresses the challenge of designing **AI-enhanced personal knowledge systems** that are guided by individual values and epistemology, yet produce knowledge representations and content that can interface with broader, collaborative knowledge endeavors. The phrase *“bridging individual epistemology and collaborative knowledge production”* here refers to translating the idiosyncratic, value-laden knowledge structures of an individual into forms that can contribute to or interoperate with collective knowledge resources. A concrete example is an academic researcher who maintains a personal ontology of their field to organize literature and insights—shaped by what they find important or ethical—and then uses that to generate a wiki article or dataset that others can use. How can we design a system that helps this researcher formalize their personal knowledge (with AI assistance) and seamlessly transform it into a shareable artifact, all while preserving the nuances of their perspective?\n\nTo tackle this, our proposal integrates insights from **Library and Information Science (LIS)** — particularly knowledge organization (taxonomies, ontologies, classification) and personal information management — with **Artificial Intelligence techniques** such as natural language processing, knowledge graph construction, and conversational interfaces. We begin by clarifying key conceptual foundations (what do we mean by knowledge graphs, ontologies, taxonomies, topic models, etc., in this context). We then survey related work and theoretical underpinnings, from personal knowledge base practices (like digital gardens) to value-sensitive design principles and examples of collaborative knowledge platforms. Next, we articulate focused research questions that will guide both scholarly inquiry and system development. The methodology section outlines how we plan to answer these questions through system prototyping and evaluation: we describe the system architecture and component design (with illustrative pseudocode for critical functions), as well as how we will assess the outcomes (e.g. measuring the quality of AI-organized knowledge and its alignment with user intentions). Finally, recognizing that this project has dual significance as academic research and as a product vision, we provide a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**-style specification. This includes the MVP feature set, technical and usability requirements, a development roadmap with milestones, evaluation metrics for success, and ethical guidelines. In doing so, we intend for this document to serve both researchers interested in the epistemic and organizational aspects of personal knowledge systems, and product developers aiming to build AI-augmented PKM tools that are *human-centered and values-aligned*.\n\n## Background and Key Concepts\n\n### Personal Knowledge Management and Digital Gardens\n\nPersonal Knowledge Management has evolved as a response to information overload and the need for individuals to take charge of their own learning and knowledge organization【35†L140-L147】. Classic PKM practices include techniques like note-taking, tagging, bookmarking, and curating one’s own knowledge base or *“personal knowledge base”*. Recently, metaphors like the **“second brain”** or **“digital garden”** have gained popularity in describing personal knowledge spaces. A *digital garden* refers to a public or private collection of interconnected personal notes that is continually cultivated and revised, often published online in a nonlinear, exploratory format. *In short, a digital garden is something in between a blog and a wiki – a way to accumulate personal knowledge over time in an explorable, non-linear space, with features like bidirectional links and visual graph maps*【34†L57-L65】. Unlike a traditional blog, which presents polished articles in reverse-chronological order, a digital garden is more like a wiki or mind map that reflects the owner’s ongoing thinking process. The ethos of digital gardening emphasizes that knowledge is never final; ideas are constantly growing and being pruned, which aligns with an epistemology of personal knowledge as evolving rather than static.\n\nIn the context of this proposal, the concept of a personal knowledge **“garden”** is particularly apt. We envision the user’s knowledge base as a semantically rich graph (a garden of ideas) that the user cultivates. AI plays the role of an intelligent assistant gardener: helping identify connections between ideas, suggesting new “seed” concepts to add, and helping prune or reorganize the structure as it grows. Crucially, the gardener (AI) must work under the guidance of the head gardener (the user), who has their own philosophies about how to arrange the plants (knowledge) – that is, the user’s values and mental models dictate the shape of the knowledge garden. Our approach therefore emphasizes *user-driven ontology creation* enhanced (but not dominated) by AI. This lies in contrast to fully automated knowledge graphs like those used by search engines, which may not reflect any single person’s perspective.\n\nFurthermore, PKM is not only about personal efficiency but also about eventually sharing knowledge. Many people use personal wikis or note collections as staging areas for publishable content – for example, a researcher’s private notes may later be published as a paper, or a hobbyist’s notes might be distilled into a blog post. The concept of **knowledge federation** (bringing together individual contributions into a collective whole) is relevant here. Our system aims to make it easier to go from the personal to the public: by structuring knowledge, the system can generate well-organized outputs that others can consume. As background, it’s noteworthy that Wikipedia and similar platforms have demonstrated the power of *collaborative knowledge production*, where communities create and refine content. Wikipedia in particular is a successful example of large-scale collaborative knowledge production online【12†L7-L14】. However, contributing to Wikipedia or academic knowledge typically requires significant manual effort to transform one’s private notes into the required format and style. We see an opportunity for AI to assist users in translating their personal knowledge into such formal, collaborative contexts, effectively bridging the gap between an individual’s informal notes and the formal knowledge in public repositories.\n\n### Knowledge Graphs, Ontologies, Taxonomies, and Topic Models: Conceptual Distinctions\n\nA variety of terms need to be disentangled when discussing structured knowledge representations. In particular, this project deals with **taxonomies**, **ontologies**, **knowledge graphs**, and also leverages **topic models** – each of which has distinct meanings:\n\n- **Taxonomy:** In information science, a taxonomy is a hierarchical (or faceted) classification scheme, essentially a structured *controlled vocabulary* of concepts【5†L118-L126】. A taxonomy arranges concepts into parent–child relationships (broader and narrower terms) to facilitate consistent tagging and retrieval of information. For example, a personal knowledge taxonomy might classify notes under categories like `Health > Nutrition > Diet` or `Computer Science > Machine Learning > Neural Networks`. Taxonomies are primarily used for organization and discovery: by tagging notes with taxonomy terms, a user can later browse or filter notes by category. Taxonomies tend to be simpler structures (tree-like) without explicit relation types beyond the hierarchy. Their strength lies in **consistency and simplicity** – they ensure that similar items are grouped and labeled in a predictable way【26†L52-L61】. In our context, a user might start with a taxonomy of their interests or values to categorize their notes. For instance, a journalist might classify information by topics like “Politics”, “Environment”, “Economy”, each with subtopics. This provides an initial scaffolding for their personal knowledge garden.\n\n- **Ontology:** An ontology is a more expressive and semantically rich knowledge model. Formally, an ontology defines the types of entities (classes), the properties of those entities (attributes), and the relationships between entities (often with specified semantics), usually with the goal of representing knowledge of a domain【5†L139-L147】. Ontologies allow for multiple relationship types (beyond just hierarchical) and can support logical inference. For example, an ontology for the journalist’s knowledge might define classes like `Person`, `Organization`, `Issue`, with relationships such as `Person -> works_for -> Organization` or `Issue -> has_impact_on -> Domain`. An ontology might include rules or constraints (e.g., a `Person` has a date of birth). In essence, ontologies are *“generalized semantic data models”* that capture the structure of knowledge, whereas a **knowledge graph** is what you get when that model is populated with actual data【20†L243-L251】. In our project, the **personal ontology** is the evolving schema of the user’s knowledge domain – it can start from a simple taxonomy and progressively become richer as the user (with AI help) adds definitions of relationships or attributes that matter to them. For instance, our researcher may extend their taxonomy into an ontology by specifying that “papers” are a type of “knowledge source” and define a relation “cites” between papers.\n\n- **Knowledge Graph:** A knowledge graph (KG) is the instantiation of an ontology with actual data, represented as a graph of nodes and edges. The nodes represent specific entities or concepts, and edges represent relations between them (often labeled with the relationship type). One can think of a knowledge graph as *ontology + data = knowledge graph*【20†L243-L251】. Continuing the example, once the journalist starts entering actual notes or facts — “Alice works for Organization X”, “Organization X is involved in Issue Y” — each of those facts becomes a triple in a knowledge graph. The personal knowledge graph might have a node for “Alice (a Person)”, a node for “Organization X”, and an edge “works_for” connecting them. Knowledge graphs enable one to run complex queries and visualize the web of connections among items. They are powerful for spotting non-obvious connections (e.g., two people working on related issues in different domains). In practice, knowledge graphs in our system will be stored in a graph database or as interlinked documents, and the AI will help maintain and query this structure. It’s worth noting that in enterprise settings, knowledge graphs often combine taxonomies and ontologies: taxonomy terms become one kind of node in the graph (often as categories), and the ontology provides the schema for linking data pieces【5†L153-L161】【26†L52-L61】. We apply the same idea personally: the user’s taxonomy and ontology feed into the construction of their personal knowledge graph, which connects to their actual notes and references.\n\n- **Topic Model:** Topic modeling is distinct from the above three (which are *knowledge organization systems* designed and curated, at least partly, by humans). A **topic model** is an algorithmic, statistical technique — often unsupervised — that discovers latent themes or topics in a collection of documents【22†L169-L177】. Common approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or more recent neural embeddings can find clusters of words that frequently co-occur, thereby grouping documents by topics. For example, if the journalist’s notes cover various issues, a topic model might automatically find that certain notes are about “climate change policy” versus “economic inflation” based on term patterns. Topic models do not produce a human-understandable ontology by themselves; rather, they suggest groupings or labels that a human might interpret as topics. In our project, topic modeling (or related NLP techniques) can serve as a *discovery tool*: the AI might analyze the user’s accumulated notes or transcripts and suggest “Your notes seem to discuss these 5 main themes…”, which can prompt the user to create new categories or adjust their ontology. We treat topic models as a complement to user-defined taxonomies: they provide a bottom-up view of the data, potentially revealing emergent structure that the top-down taxonomy/ontology might have missed. For instance, an AI might notice that the journalist frequently mentions “carbon tax, emissions, Paris Agreement” and identify a latent topic “Climate Policy,” which the user could then formally add to their taxonomy or link to existing concepts. In summary, **topic models** aid in *auto-classification and pattern recognition* within the user’s personal knowledge content, helping to keep the personal ontology in sync with the actual content of notes.\n\nFor clarity, Table 1 summarizes the distinctions and roles of these concepts in our context:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Concept</th><th>Description</th><th>Role in This System</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Taxonomy</strong></td><td>Hierarchical (or faceted) classification of concepts; a controlled vocabulary arranged for consistent tagging and browsing【5†L118-L126】.</td><td>Provides an initial structure for organizing personal notes by broad categories (often reflecting user’s values or high-level interests).</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Ontology</strong></td><td>Formal semantic model defining classes, attributes, and relationships in a domain (may include rules and inference support)【5†L139-L147】.</td><td>Encodes the user’s personal conceptual model of their knowledge domain, allowing richer relationships than a simple hierarchy (e.g. linking related concepts across categories).</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Knowledge Graph</strong></td><td>Network of real-world entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges), effectively an ontology populated with instance data (ontology + data = KG)【20†L243-L251】.</td><td>Represents the user’s personal knowledge base: notes, facts, and ideas become nodes and links in a graph, enabling complex queries and visualization of personal knowledge.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Topic Model</strong></td><td>Statistical method (unsupervised) for discovering latent topics or themes in a collection of documents by analyzing word patterns【22†L169-L177】.</td><td>Helps automatically identify emerging themes or clusters in the user’s unstructured notes, suggesting new taxonomy categories or highlighting connections that the user’s ontology might incorporate.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nBy integrating these elements, our proposed system will support both **top-down knowledge organization** (via user-defined taxonomies/ontologies reflecting personal epistemology) and **bottom-up insight discovery** (via AI-driven topic modeling and entity extraction). This combination is what enables a dynamic, AI-enhanced personal knowledge graph that can grow and adapt with the user’s input.\n\n### Theoretical Framework: Values, Epistemology, and Knowledge Organization\n\nA central premise of this proposal is that **knowledge organization is not neutral** – how one structures knowledge reflects underlying values, worldviews, and purposes. Library and Information Science has long recognized that classification systems embody particular perspectives; for instance, traditional library classifications have been critiqued for biases that reflect the culture and era of their creators. On an individual level, people have personal epistemologies – beliefs about what knowledge is, how it should be organized, and what is important. One person might prioritize empirical facts and categorize notes by scientific domain, while another prioritizes experiential knowledge and organizes notes by life themes or personal projects. Neither approach is wrong; rather, they serve different values and goals.\n\n**Value-Sensitive Design (VSD)** provides a framework to account for such differences in technology design【36†L87-L95】. Applying VSD to personal knowledge systems means involving the user’s values (e.g. privacy, openness, creativity, rigor, etc.) in the design of the system’s features and behaviors. For example, if a user values privacy strongly, the system might by default keep all data local and encrypted, and provide clear controls for what (if anything) gets shared out to collaborative platforms. If a user values intellectual curiosity and serendipity, the system might enable more exploratory recommendations (surfacing tangentially related information that could spark new ideas). If a user values efficiency and clarity, the system might instead focus on streamlining information retrieval and enforcing a clean taxonomy to avoid clutter.\n\nIn our research, we specifically consider **how to encode personal values and epistemic stances into the ontology/knowledge graph itself.** One idea is to allow a layer of metadata or annotation that indicates why a piece of knowledge is important to the user (e.g. tagging a note as “reliable source” vs “speculative idea”, or marking an idea with values like “sustainability” or “social justice” if those are the user’s guiding principles). The ontology could even include classes for the user’s values or knowledge quality (imagine an ontology where `Assertion` has sub-classes `Fact` and `Opinion`, and relations that indicate evidence or trust). By making such value judgments explicit in the knowledge structure, the system can better align any AI-driven processing with the user’s framework. For instance, if generating a publishable article, the system would know to distinguish between well-evidenced facts and the user’s personal reflections, perhaps including or excluding content accordingly based on context.\n\nFrom an epistemological standpoint, this project straddles **constructivist** and **objectivist** views of knowledge. On one hand, each user constructs their own knowledge reality (constructivism: personal epistemology matters). On the other, for collaborative knowledge production we often need a degree of objectivity or at least common ground (e.g. Wikipedia strives for a “neutral point of view”). Bridging these requires careful design: the system might assist the user in *translating* or mapping their personal constructs to more widely shared ones when needed. For example, the user might have an idiosyncratic category that doesn’t exist in public ontologies; the system could suggest equivalent or related concepts from a public taxonomy (like suggesting mapping the user’s category “Green Tech Innovators” to the Wikipedia category “Environmental Technology Companies” or similar), if the user intends to publish externally.\n\nFinally, we draw on the concept of **Values in Knowledge Organization** from LIS research. Scholars have examined how classification and metadata systems can be made more inclusive and aligned with community values (for example, initiatives to update subject headings to be less biased). In a personal system, the “community” is primarily the individual, but when the output is shared, the community becomes the target audience or platform. **Ethical considerations** – such as avoiding misrepresentation of one’s sources, respecting privacy when publishing personal knowledge that involves others, and ensuring the AI does not introduce distortions – are integral. We address these in more detail under Ethical Considerations, but it’s important to note here that the theoretical framework guiding this proposal is inherently interdisciplinary: it combines technical AI considerations (accuracy, semantic alignment) with humanistic and ethical considerations (values alignment, user agency, and the social impact of knowledge sharing).\n\n### Collaborative Knowledge Production and Bridging Personal–Public Gaps\n\nCollaborative knowledge production refers to the processes by which groups of people create and refine shared knowledge resources. The quintessential example is **Wikipedia**, where volunteers jointly write and edit articles. Other examples include open-source technical documentation, Q&A forums like Stack Exchange (collectively building a knowledge base of answers), and scientific collaboration platforms (like Open Science Framework, or even datasets and ontologies curated by communities). In these environments, knowledge must be presented in ways that others can understand, critique, and build upon. Typically, this requires adherence to certain standards or formats (e.g. Wikipedia has notability and citation guidelines; academic papers have formal structures). The challenge we target is how an individual’s personally structured knowledge can be **exported or transformed** into such communal formats without losing its meaning – and without requiring the individual to do redundant re-work.\n\nCurrently, moving personal knowledge to shared knowledge is often a manual affair. One might keep private notes and then when writing a paper, manually copy over relevant parts, rewrite them formally, and add citations. Or when contributing to a wiki, one has to consciously translate their understanding into the neutral, depersonalized tone expected. If the personal system could automate some of this – for example, automatically compile a draft wiki article from a selection of one’s notes, complete with organizing the sections based on the ontology and even suggesting references – it would accelerate knowledge sharing. Additionally, by analyzing the differences between a personal ontology and a public ontology, the system could highlight where the individual’s perspective diverges from the mainstream. This can be valuable: it may reveal novel insights (the divergence could be something new the world hasn’t categorized yet) or it might warn the user of potential misalignment (if they plan to publish, they might need to explain or adjust those differences).\n\nOur approach to bridging the personal–collaborative gap will consider existing standards for knowledge representation. For instance, the system could use or map to **Linked Open Data ontologies** (like schema.org, Dublin Core, or domain-specific ontologies) when preparing outputs. If the user’s knowledge graph is kept in a standardized format (e.g. RDF triples), it becomes easier to share parts of it with others or merge it into community graphs. Some research has looked at *bridging ontologies and folksonomies*【29†L21-L29】, which is analogous to bridging structured and semi-structured vocabularies used by different people. Those studies suggest methods to relate user-generated tags to formal categories. We will leverage such insights to design mechanisms where the user’s personal tagging/ontology can be linked to external knowledge networks. For example, the system might recognize that a person mentioned in the notes is a known entity (with a Wikipedia page or an identifier in Wikidata) and link them; this effectively connects the personal knowledge graph with the global graph, enriching both.\n\nTo ground this with a scenario: imagine our earlier example of a researcher with a personal knowledge base on climate change. They have carefully organized notes, and one of their personal ontology classes is “Climate Policy Challenges” with instances like “Carbon Tax Opposition”. If they want to contribute to a collaborative report on climate policy, our system could help by generating a structured outline from their knowledge graph (e.g. it might create sections for each major challenge, using the relationships in their graph to order content). It could pull in definitions or background from external sources for completeness. Conversely, if the collaborative project has a shared ontology (say, the group decided on certain standard headings), the system can suggest how the user’s notes fit into that structure. Ultimately, this two-way exchange aims to ensure that individual knowledge, which is often *rich but siloed*, can flow more easily into collective knowledge repositories, and that when it does, it’s done in a way that remains true to the individual’s contributions (proper attribution, preservation of nuance) and to the community’s expectations (clarity, verification).\n\nIn summary, our background review underscores a few key points: (1) robust personal knowledge systems need both structure (for organization) and flexibility (for discovery), which is why we combine ontologies, taxonomies, and AI techniques; (2) integrating human values and personal epistemology is essential for user adoption and ethical design, guided by frameworks like VSD; and (3) there is significant benefit in bridging personal and collaborative knowledge spheres, something our project will attempt by design. Building on this foundation, we now formulate the specific research questions and objectives that drive our work.\n\n## Research Questions\n\nDrawing from the context and gaps identified, we have formulated several focused research questions. These questions are designed to be answerable through the proposed methodology, and together they span the conceptual, technical, and human-centered aspects of the project:\n\n1. **How can personal values and individual epistemology be explicitly represented in a personal knowledge ontology?**  \n   *Rationale:* This question investigates the mechanisms for encoding what matters to an individual in their knowledge structure. We will explore modeling techniques (such as metadata tags, custom ontology classes, or value hierarchies) that allow a user to imprint their values (e.g. what they consider credible, important, sensitive, etc.) onto their personal knowledge graph. Answering this will likely involve user studies to see how people categorize information when prompted to express their values, as well as testing ontology schemas that can capture those facets.\n\n2. **What methods can effectively leverage AI (including large language models and topic modeling) to assist users in constructing and evolving a personal ontology from unstructured inputs (like chat logs and voice notes)?**  \n   *Rationale:* The aim here is to develop and evaluate algorithms for *ontology learning* and knowledge graph population in the personal context. Sub-questions include: How accurately can an AI extract key concepts and relationships from a casual conversation or a voice memo? How should suggestions be presented to the user so that they remain in control of the ontology design (e.g. AI suggests a new category, but the user approves/edits it)? We will measure the effectiveness of AI assistance by the correctness of extracted knowledge, the reduction in time/effort for the user to organize information, and the user’s satisfaction with the suggestions.\n\n3. **In what ways can a personal knowledge system be designed to interface with collaborative knowledge bases or publication platforms, and what are the challenges in doing so while preserving the individual's perspective?**  \n   *Rationale:* This question addresses the bridge to collaborative knowledge production. We will examine how data from a personal knowledge graph can be transformed into formats suitable for public consumption (e.g. wiki articles, scholarly papers, shared databases). We’ll identify challenges such as differences in terminology (personal vs public ontology mismatches), ensuring proper citation and avoiding leakage of private context, and maintaining the integrity of the user’s original intent. The goal is to propose or prototype features like “export to Wikipedia draft” or “generate report from my notes” and evaluate their performance and fidelity.\n\n4. **What is the impact of incorporating values-driven AI curation on the quality and usefulness of both creative and formal outputs produced from the personal knowledge system?**  \n   *Rationale:* Here we are concerned with outcomes. *Creative outputs* might be things like a personal essay, a story, or a brainstorming synthesis that the system helps generate using the personal knowledge graph. *Formal outputs* could be a research report, a slide deck, or a wiki entry that requires more structure and citation. We hypothesize that a values-aligned approach (where the system has been tuned to the user’s values/criteria) will produce outputs that the user finds more acceptable and useful, compared to a generic AI writing assistant. To test this, we will have users attempt tasks with the system (like “produce a blog post about X using my notes”) and evaluate the outputs for qualities such as factual accuracy, coherence, originality, alignment with the user’s intent, and required post-editing. The question aims to quantify benefits (and identify any drawbacks) of our approach in practical usage scenarios.\n\n5. **How can we evaluate and ensure the ethical alignment of an AI-augmented personal knowledge management system, particularly regarding privacy, bias, and user agency?**  \n   *Rationale:* Although phrased as a broad question, this is a critical research component that intersects with all the above. It prompts us to define metrics or criteria for ethical alignment: for instance, does the system avoid introducing biases inconsistent with the user’s stated values? Does it protect sensitive information when generating outputs? Does it keep the user in control of decisions? We will approach this by embedding ethical checks (both technical, like bias detection, and procedural, like user consent dialogs before sharing data) into the prototype, and then evaluating their effectiveness through user feedback and possibly expert review. This question ensures that beyond functionality, the system is judged by how well it adheres to value-sensitive design principles in practice.\n\nThese research questions collectively guide the project. They will be revisited throughout the research and development process: from informing the design requirements of the system, to guiding the selection of evaluation methods, and finally to structuring the analysis of results. Next, we detail the methodology and the system design that will allow us to answer these questions.\n\n## Methodology and System Design\n\nOur approach is fundamentally **design-oriented and experimental**, combining system development with user-centered evaluation. We will build a prototype of the proposed personal knowledge system (to address RQ 1–4) and conduct studies to assess its performance and ethical alignment (addressing RQ 4–5). The methodology can be broken down into the following components:\n\n- **System Architecture Design:** We outline a modular architecture for the personal knowledge system, identifying key components and how data flows between them. This serves as a blueprint for both implementation and for understanding how different research questions map onto system functionalities.\n- **AI-Assisted Ontology and Graph Construction:** We develop algorithms (with pseudocode) for processing unstructured inputs (text or voice) into the structured knowledge graph, incorporating user feedback loops. This is the technical core addressing RQ 2 and partly RQ 1.\n- **Prototype Implementation:** Using the architecture and algorithms, we implement a functional MVP (minimum viable product). We plan to use a combination of readily available AI services (for NLP tasks) and custom code. The prototype will be used as a testbed in user evaluations.\n- **User Evaluation and Testing:** We design two types of evaluations: a formative evaluation with a small number of users to refine the system (think-aloud protocol as they use the system), and a summative evaluation where a larger user group performs specific tasks (like generating an output or organizing a set of notes) with and without the system for comparison. This yields both qualitative feedback (for RQ1, RQ3, RQ5 about values and usability) and quantitative metrics (for RQ2, RQ4 about AI effectiveness and output quality).\n- **Iteration and Refinement:** Based on evaluation results, we will iterate on the design (a key principle of design science research). We may go through multiple cycles of prototype improvement within the project timeframe.\n\n### System Architecture Overview\n\nThe system architecture follows a pipeline model, augmented with a feedback loop for continuous learning. At a high level, the system comprises the following stages and components:\n\n1. **Input Ingestion:** The system accepts various personal data inputs – primarily text-based **chat transcripts** (e.g., conversations the user had with GPT or others) and **voice notes** (which might be spontaneous ideas recorded by the user). These inputs can also include documents or web clippings in future versions. Voice notes first pass through a **Speech-to-Text Transcription** module to produce text. The output of this stage is plain text that represents the content to be added to the knowledge base.\n\n2. **Natural Language Processing & Concept Extraction:** The next stage analyzes the input text to identify meaningful units of knowledge. We employ a combination of techniques:\n   - **Segmentation:** Splitting text into semantically coherent snippets (e.g., splitting a long transcript by topic shifts).\n   - **Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Linking:** Identifying entities like people, organizations, places, etc. If an entity is recognized (say “OpenAI” or “John Doe”), the system can attempt to link it to existing nodes in the graph (or external databases for context).\n   - **Key Phrase Extraction:** Using either LLMs or statistical methods to pull out key phrases or sentences that might represent important facts or claims.\n   - **Topic Modeling/Clustering:** If the input is large or covers multiple themes, clustering it into topics (using unsupervised methods) to handle each theme separately.\n\n   The result of this NLP stage is a set of candidate knowledge elements: e.g., “Concept X is mentioned, related to Concept Y” or “This note is about Topic Z”.\n\n3. **Ontology Alignment & Update:** This is the **AI-enhanced ontology learning** step. The system takes the extracted elements and tries to place them into the user’s existing ontology/knowledge graph:\n   - **Matching:** For each extracted concept or entity, check if it already exists in the personal ontology. This can use string matching and embedding-based similarity. For instance, if the note mentions “machine learning”, and the user’s ontology has a node or category “Machine Learning”, it is matched.\n   - **Classification:** Determine if the concept fits into an existing category or requires a new category. For example, if a new person is mentioned and the ontology has a class “Person”, an instance is created under it.\n   - **Relation Identification:** If the text implies a relationship (e.g., “Alice joined Organization X in 2023” implies Alice is a Person, Organization X is an Organization, and relation is “works_for”), the system identifies this structure. We might use pre-defined relation extraction models or even prompts to an LLM to parse such relations.\n   - **Suggestion of Ontology Changes:** If the input introduces a concept not in the ontology or a relation not previously recorded, the system generates a suggestion. For example: *“I found a new concept 'Quantum Computing'. Should I add it under 'Computer Science'?”* or *“It seems 'Climate Justice' is related to your category 'Climate Policy'. Add a link?”*.\n   - **User Validation:** The user is involved here via the UI – they review suggestions and confirm or modify them. This ensures the user’s agency: AI proposes, human disposes.\n\n   The ontology alignment stage effectively **updates the personal knowledge graph**. New nodes are added, new edges created, or existing ones tagged with new occurrences (e.g., a note is linked to an existing node “Climate Change” indicating it’s about that topic).\n\n4. **Knowledge Graph Storage:** We maintain a persistent store of the personal knowledge graph. This could be implemented with a graph database (like Neo4j or an RDF triple store) or a simpler JSON-LD or networkx graph in early prototypes. The knowledge graph stores:\n   - Nodes: with types (from ontology classes), attributes (like a description or timestamps, sources of that info).\n   - Edges: labeled with ontology relations.\n   - Content links: Each note or snippet ingested is linked to the graph elements it pertains to (for traceability). For example, a note about “Project Apollo” would link to the node “Project Apollo” in the graph, and maybe the node “NASA” etc., and store the note text or a pointer to it.\n   - Provenance metadata: such as when/where the information came from (e.g., “from voice note on June 2, 2025”).\n\n5. **User Interface – Personal Knowledge Garden:** The user interacts with the system through an interface that allows browsing and editing of the knowledge graph. This interface is crucial for user experience:\n   - **Graph View:** A visual representation (nodes and connections) to let users see the structure of their knowledge. For example, a user can visually explore how their ideas connect, perhaps finding that two clusters of notes are linked by a single common concept (which could inspire insight).\n   - **Tree/Outline View:** Because ontologies/taxonomies can be hierarchical, an outline view lets users navigate categories and subcategories, much like browsing folders or a mind-map.\n   - **Note View and Editor:** Users can click on a node to see all associated notes or facts, and they can edit node properties or relationships. They can also input new notes directly via the interface (which would then trigger the NLP and alignment pipeline).\n   - **Suggestion prompts:** The UI will present the AI’s suggestions (from stage 3) in a clear way, e.g., a sidebar saying “Suggested Additions: ...” where the user can accept or reject each.\n   - **Search and Query:** A search bar allows keyword search over notes and graph, and advanced query templates (for example, find how two concepts are connected via a path in the graph).\n   - **Settings for Values/Epistemic Preferences:** Possibly a configuration where a user can set certain preferences, like “prefer simpler taxonomy” vs “allow AI to auto-classify in depth”, or flags for values (for example, marking certain topics as sensitive so the system handles them carefully).\n\n6. **Content Generation (Output Creation):** One of the innovative aspects of the system is using the curated knowledge to create outputs. We integrate a **Content Generator** component (likely powered by LLMs like GPT) that can take a selection or view of the knowledge graph and turn it into natural language text. The user might select a subset of the graph (e.g., all notes under a category) and invoke “Generate draft”. The generation process involves:\n   - **Context Assembly:** The system gathers relevant information from the graph to feed into the LLM prompt. For example, if generating an article about “Climate Policy Challenges”, it will collect key points, facts, and references from the graph nodes under that topic.\n   - **Templating:** For formal outputs, use a structure (like introduction, main points, conclusion for an essay; or specific sections for a wiki article). The ontology can inform section structure (each top-level sub-category could become a section).\n   - **Draft Generation:** The LLM produces a draft text. Importantly, we would prompt it in a way to incorporate citations or markers that tie back to the personal knowledge sources (this could be done by inlining reference IDs that the system can later map to sources in the personal knowledge base).\n   - **User Review/Edit:** The user reviews the draft, with the interface highlighting which parts came from which notes (traceable via the knowledge graph). The user can edit freely. Edits might be fed back to the knowledge base if they contain new facts (closing the loop – e.g., if the user adds a sentence, the system might ask if that should be added as a note or node).\n   - **Export/Publish:** The final reviewed content can be exported (to Word, PDF, Markdown, or even directly posted to a platform like a blog or wiki if integration is possible).\n\n7. **External Knowledge Integration (Future/Advanced):** While not a core MVP feature, the architecture allows connecting to external knowledge services:\n   - **Linking to Public Graphs:** as mentioned, linking entities to Wikidata or other open graphs to fetch additional info or provide consistent identifiers.\n   - **Collaborative Sync:** In a scenario of a team using similar systems, their knowledge graphs could selectively sync or overlap for shared projects. This raises additional complexity (version control, merge conflicts in ontologies), which is beyond MVP but an area for future research.\n   - **Feedback from Community:** If a user publishes an artifact and receives feedback (say comments on a blog, or peer review on a paper), that feedback can be ingested back as new input into their personal system, thereby continuously updating their personal knowledge.\n\nThis architecture can be summarized as a flow (from inputs to outputs) with a loop back from outputs to inputs. Each stage corresponds to technical components we will build or configure. We depict this in **Figure 1** (see below) in a simplified form:\n\n*(Figure 1: System Architecture Pipeline – from unstructured inputs (chat logs, voice notes) through AI processing (transcription, extraction, ontology alignment) to the personal knowledge graph, and then through an interface to outputs (draft articles, contributions to wiki), with user feedback at each step.)*\n\n*(Note: Figure 1 is described textually here due to medium, but a visual diagram shows inputs flowing into an AI processing box, updating a central knowledge graph database; the user interface allows the user to view/edit the graph and also trigger content generation which flows out to outputs, and any published outputs might provide new inputs later.)*\n\nThe architecture is deliberately user-in-the-loop at critical junctures (ontology update and output editing), reflecting a **human-AI collaboration** paradigm. This ensures that while the AI handles laborious tasks (extracting info, initial drafting, etc.), the human provides guidance and approval especially where subjective judgments (value decisions, final wording) are concerned.\n\n### AI-Assisted Ontology Construction: Algorithmic Workflow (Pseudocode)\n\nTo illustrate concretely how the system would integrate a new piece of knowledge, we present pseudocode for the core routine that processes a single note (text input) into the knowledge graph. This corresponds to the combination of steps 2 and 3 above (NLP extraction + ontology alignment). The pseudocode uses a high-level, explanatory style rather than a specific programming language:\n\n```pseudo\nfunction integrate_note_to_KG(note_text, knowledge_graph, ontology):\n    # Step 1: Preprocessing\n    sentences = split_into_sentences(note_text)\n    segments = semantic_segment(sentences)  # group sentences by topic if needed\n\n    new_nodes = []   # to collect new concepts for ontology\n    new_relations = []  # to collect new relations found\n    linked_nodes = []   # to collect references to existing nodes\n\n    for segment in segments:\n        # Step 2: NLP extraction\n        entities = NER(segment.text)  # find named entities in text\n        topics = topic_model.predict(segment.text)  # get topic distribution (optional)\n        key_phrases = extract_key_phrases(segment.text)\n\n        # Combine extraction results into candidate concepts\n        candidates = entities + key_phrases  # (topics might be higher-level, used for grouping)\n\n        for concept in candidates:\n            concept_name = normalize(concept)  # e.g., canonicalize capitalization, remove stopwords\n            # Step 3a: Matching with existing ontology\n            match = ontology.find_node(concept_name)\n            if match:\n                linked_nodes.append((segment, match))\n            else:\n                # If not found, propose a new node\n                new_node = propose_new_node(concept_name, ontology)\n                # (This could determine where in taxonomy it might fit, e.g., via a similarity to existing categories)\n                new_nodes.append((segment, new_node))\n        \n        # Step 3b: Relation extraction within the segment\n        relations = extract_relations(segment.text)\n        for rel in relations:\n            subj_name, relation_name, obj_name = rel.subject, rel.predicate, rel.object\n            subj_node = ontology.find_or_propose(subj_name)\n            obj_node = ontology.find_or_propose(obj_name)\n            new_relations.append((subj_node, relation_name, obj_node, segment))\n            # Note: find_or_propose will either return existing node or stage a new one as above.\n    \n    # Step 4: User validation phase (interactive, not automated here)\n    for (segment, new_node) in new_nodes:\n        # Prompt user with context around the new concept\n        prompt_user_to_confirm_new_concept(new_node.name, context=segment.text)\n        if user_confirms:\n            ontology.add_node(new_node)\n            linked_nodes.append((segment, new_node))\n        else:\n            ontology.discard_proposal(new_node)\n    \n    for (subj, rel, obj, segment) in new_relations:\n        if ontology.has_node(subj) and ontology.has_node(obj):\n            prompt = format(\"Relation suggestion: \\\"%s -- %s --> %s\\\" from note: \\\"%s\\\"\"\n                             % (subj.name, rel, obj.name, truncate(segment.text,100)))\n            prompt_user_to_confirm_relation(prompt)\n            if user_confirms:\n                ontology.add_relation(subj, rel, obj)\n    \n    # Step 5: Link note content to graph nodes (for provenance)\n    note_id = knowledge_graph.store_note(note_text)\n    for (segment, node) in linked_nodes:\n        knowledge_graph.link_note_to_node(note_id, node, relevance=segment.score)\n        # e.g., store that this note provides evidence or info about that node, maybe with a relevance score.\n\n    return knowledge_graph, ontology\n```\n\nA brief explanation of the pseudocode:\n- We split the note into smaller segments for focused processing (this helps if a long note contains multiple ideas).\n- For each segment, we perform Named Entity Recognition and key phrase extraction to get candidate concepts. We also optionally use a topic model to understand general context (though not explicitly used above beyond potential grouping).\n- We attempt to match each candidate concept with the existing ontology. If it exists (match found by name or synonym), we note the link. If not, we create a proposed new node (the `propose_new_node` function might classify what type of entity it is, guess where it might belong using word embeddings or external knowledge, etc., but leaves final decision to user).\n- We also extract relations from text (there are NLP tools for open information extraction or relation extraction which we can use, or we can leverage an LLM to parse triples). Each extracted relation yields a subject and object concept, which we also try to resolve to existing or new nodes, and record the relationship.\n- After processing, we engage the user with the **suggestions list**: all the new nodes and relations found. The user interface would show each suggestion with some context (e.g., the snippet of text that caused it) and ask for confirmation or editing. The pseudocode shows this in a simplified loop with `prompt_user_to_confirm`. The user’s choices determine whether those suggestions actually get applied to the ontology/graph.\n- Finally, we store the note itself (in a note repository, could be part of the graph or separate) and link the note to any nodes that were identified from it. This means later if we click that node, we can see this note as one piece of evidence or content for it. We might also store a “relevance” or weight if we have some confidence score from extraction (for instance, if a segment clearly is about a concept vs just a passing mention).\n\nThis algorithm ensures that *every piece of new information is either integrated into the existing structure or flagged for the user to categorize*. Over time, as the system learns the user’s ontology, the suggestions should become more accurate (we might incorporate a learning model that adapts to which suggestions users accept or reject).\n\nWe will implement this logic possibly with a mix of rule-based components and learned models. For example, for NER we could use spaCy or a transformer model; for relation extraction, we might use a pretrained OpenIE system or prompt GPT-4 with a custom instruction like “extract relationships X from this text” since LLMs are quite good at that. For ontology matching, vector embeddings of concept labels (possibly using a model like sentence-BERT) can help find similar terms (e.g., if the note says “car” and ontology has “automobile”). \n\nThroughout the development of this algorithm, we will test on example data to ensure it’s capturing things correctly. A small internal evaluation might be: feed a set of notes to the system and manually check if the suggestions make sense (precision/recall of concept extraction relative to a human’s tagging). This will help tune the NLP components before involving end-users.\n\n### Prototype Implementation Plan\n\nFor the prototype (MVP), the choice of technologies will emphasize quick development and flexibility:\n- **Backend:** Likely a Python-based backend using frameworks such as Flask/FastAPI for serving requests (if we need a server) and libraries for NLP (spaCy, transformers from HuggingFace, potentially OpenAI API for GPT if allowed, etc.). The knowledge graph can be managed with an in-memory representation (networkx or rdflib for RDF) for early versions, and possibly Neo4j or similar for scalability if needed.\n- **Frontend:** A web-based interface (HTML/JS) or a local app using a toolkit (Electron or Tauri) for ease of development. We may use a graph visualization library (like D3.js or vis.js) to implement the graph view, and a text editor component (perhaps Markdown editor) for note viewing/editing.\n- **Data storage:** For MVP, a simple file-based storage (like JSON files for notes and ontology) may suffice. As we iterate, moving to a database (SQLite for structured data and a native graph DB for relationships) will be considered for reliability and query performance. Ensuring data can be easily exported (no lock-in) is also a value consideration.\n- **Integration points:** Use of existing API services can speed up development. E.g., using a speech-to-text API (like Google’s or Whisper model) for transcription, using OpenAI’s API for complex NLP tasks (with caution regarding sending personal data to third parties – perhaps allow offline mode by using local models if possible).\n- **Iterative Development:** We plan to build the system in incremental milestones (detailed in the Product Development Plan section). The first iteration will focus on the core of adding notes and browsing the graph. Subsequent iterations will refine the AI suggestion quality and add the content generation capability.\n\nWe will also create a few **use-case scenarios** as testbeds: for example, one scenario could be an individual maintaining a knowledge base for writing a book, another could be a student using it for organizing course notes into a personal wiki, etc. These scenarios help ensure our design is not overly tailored to one idiosyncratic use.\n\nOn the research side, implementing the prototype answers RQ2 (by demonstrating methods for AI-assisted knowledge organization). It also provides a platform to explore RQ1 and RQ3 by configuring different ways to include values and by trialing the export functions.\n\n### Evaluation Strategy\n\nEvaluation will be conducted at multiple levels:\n- **Usability and Usefulness (Qualitative):** We will invite a small group of target users (e.g., grad students, knowledge workers, PKM enthusiasts) to try the system for a period (at least days or a week if possible). Through interviews and observation, we’ll gather feedback on how the system fits their workflow, whether the ontology suggestions make sense, and if the interface is intuitive. We’ll specifically ask how well they feel the system adapts to their way of thinking (addressing RQ1 qualitatively).\n- **Task-Based Performance (Quantitative/Comparative):** Design specific tasks to measure the system’s impact. For example, a task could be: “From this set of raw notes, produce a structured summary or outline.” We can have one group do it manually and another group use our system, measuring time taken, quality of output (perhaps judged by independent raters), and cognitive load (via a NASA TLX questionnaire for perceived workload). We expect the system-aided group to perform more efficiently and produce better-structured outputs – confirming the utility of AI assistance in PKM.\n- **Output Quality Metrics:** For creative outputs and formal outputs generated, we will assess:\n  - *Relevance & Accuracy:* Does the generated text correctly reflect the underlying notes? (No hallucinated facts, all important points included.) We can measure accuracy by checking if each statement can be traced to a source in the personal knowledge base or otherwise is common knowledge.\n  - *Coherence & Organization:* Perhaps using automated metrics like BLEU or ROUGE is not straightforward here, so we rely on human assessment. Test readers will rank outputs on coherence and how well structured they are.\n  - *Values Alignment:* This is tricky but we can operationalize it as follows: if a user has indicated certain preferences (e.g., they prefer a formal tone or they want certain values emphasized), we check if outputs conform. For instance, if the user’s value is “accessible language”, and the system generates an overly technical passage, that’s misaligned. We may have evaluators (or the users themselves) rate alignment on a scale.\n  - *User Edits Required:* Counting how many edits or corrections the user makes to the generated draft is a proxy for quality. Fewer edits means the system got more right.\n- **Knowledge Graph Quality:** Evaluate the state of the personal knowledge graph itself. Metrics such as:\n  - *Coverage:* After a period of use, how much of the user’s knowledge (as they perceive it) is captured? We can interview users to list key concepts they deal with and see if those are in the graph.\n  - *Consistency:* Check for contradictions or duplicate entries in the ontology that the AI may have introduced. Consistency checking is a feature of ontologies; we might run an automated reasoner to find logical issues if we formalize parts of it.\n  - *Growth and Evolution:* Track how the ontology grows over time. Does it converge to a stable state or keep changing dramatically? (Rapid, erratic changes might indicate the AI is causing thrashing vs. a stable growth which indicates learning the user’s domain well.)\n- **Ethical/Value Alignment Checks:** We will specifically test scenarios that could raise ethical flags. For example, if the user marks a note as confidential, we test that the system’s content generator does not accidentally leak it into an output meant for sharing. If the user has a bias (say they always take a certain stance in their notes), we check whether the system blindly propagates it or if it offers a balanced view when needed (depending on user’s goals; this is tricky because if the user *wants* bias, who are we to “correct” it? Value alignment here means aligning with user’s values, even if that includes their bias, as long as it’s within ethical/legal bounds. But we design transparency: e.g., the system might highlight “you have only used sources from one perspective for this topic, consider diversifying” – as a value-sensitive nudge if the user values thoroughness).\n\nThe evaluation will generate data to answer the research questions:\n- RQ1: from user feedback and analyzing their ontologies, we see how well our representation captured their values.\n- RQ2: from the task performance on adding notes, we’ll see how effective the AI extraction and alignment was (maybe measure precision/recall of concept extraction by having a gold-standard manual tagging of some transcripts).\n- RQ3: from our experiments with exporting content, we’ll identify key difficulties; plus if we do a case where someone tries to actually contribute to a wiki or something using our output, gather observations.\n- RQ4: from the output quality and user satisfaction metrics, we gauge the benefit of the values-driven approach. We could also compare with a baseline (e.g., just using a generic GPT on all notes without our structure) to see if our structured approach yields better results.\n- RQ5: from checking ethical scenarios, and overall user trust in the system, we address how well the system adheres to value-sensitive principles.\n\nIn addition to these, we will document the entire development and evaluation process, which can itself yield insights. The methodology aligns with a **Design Science Research** cycle: build, evaluate, learn, and iterate, thereby producing both an artifact (the system) and new knowledge (principles for design and usage of such systems).\n\n## Expected Contributions and Significance\n\nThis project is expected to contribute to multiple domains:\n- **Library & Information Science:** It provides a novel case study of personal knowledge organization, extending theories of knowledge organization (taxonomies, ontologies) into a personal realm with AI support. It also explores how personal and public knowledge systems can interface, a topic relevant to knowledge management and information sharing research. We will contribute to LIS literature on personal information/knowledge management by detailing how AI can enhance the construction of personal knowledge structures without overriding human values.\n- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** The user-in-the-loop design exemplifies interactive AI principles. Findings on user experience – how users accept or reject AI suggestions, how they perceive the representation of their knowledge – will inform HCI guidelines for designing AI-augmented creativity and productivity tools.\n- **Artificial Intelligence/Knowledge Engineering:** We will demonstrate methods for semi-automated ontology learning in a small-scale, user-specific setting, which is a bit different from large-scale ontology learning【11†L7-L15】. The challenges we identify (like adapting to a single user’s vocabulary, dealing with very heterogeneous personal data) can guide future AI research on personalization and incremental learning. The system can be seen as a testbed for neuro-symbolic AI: combining symbolic knowledge graphs with subsymbolic AI (LLMs).\n- **Product/Industry Impact:** For practitioners and product teams, this work offers a blueprint for the next generation of note-taking and PKM tools. As detailed in the next section, we outline a concrete roadmap for how such a product can be built and scaled. Given the current interest in tools like Notion, Roam Research, Obsidian, and extensions like Notion AI or Craft AI that integrate LLMs, our research-backed approach could influence commercial development by highlighting the importance of values and structure, not just raw AI capabilities.\n\nUltimately, the significance lies in empowering individuals to better harness their personal knowledge, with AI as a coach and collaborator rather than a black-box automaton. If successful, this project can lead to technology that helps people turn the deluge of daily information into organized knowledge aligned with their goals, and then lower the barriers to sharing that knowledge for broader benefit. We believe this aligns strongly with the ethos of LIS (democratizing knowledge, supporting lifelong learning) and addresses a timely need in the age of AI: ensuring that human values guide our intelligent systems at the personal scale.\n\n*(The academic proposal above provides the conceptual groundwork and research plan. We now transition to a section aimed at product and technical teams, translating the vision into a concrete product development context.)*\n\n## System Prototype and Product Development Plan\n\nTo translate the research vision into actionable steps for development, we outline a Product Requirements Document (PRD) style specification for the proposed system’s **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and beyond. This section is intended for product managers, developers, and other stakeholders involved in building AI-augmented personal knowledge management tools. It covers the functional scope of the MVP, quality attributes, a development timeline with milestones, evaluation metrics from a product standpoint, and key ethical considerations that must be addressed throughout the development lifecycle.\n\n### MVP Specification and Scope\n\n**Product Vision:** The product, tentatively called *ValueKnowledge Garden*, is an AI-enhanced personal knowledge management application that helps users turn raw notes (text or voice) into a structured, searchable personal knowledge graph, and allows them to effortlessly generate written outputs (blogs, reports, wiki entries) from their curated knowledge. The differentiator is its focus on user-defined values and epistemology – the system learns how the *user* wants to organize and prioritize information, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all AI categorization. The long-term vision is a personal “knowledge garden” that can partially tend itself with AI help, while always remaining under the user’s guidance, and which can produce shareable fruits (artifacts) for the benefit of communities.\n\n**Target Users:** Knowledge workers, researchers, students, writers, and PKM enthusiasts who are already gathering lots of information and want better ways to organize and use it. Early adopters may be those already using tools like Obsidian, Roam, or Notion along with AI plugins, as they will immediately see value in a system designed from ground-up for this integration. Another segment is professionals in domains with high information overload (consultants, journalists, analysts) who need to synthesize notes into outputs regularly.\n\n**MVP Scope:** The MVP will implement core features that prove the value of the system, without yet optimizing for performance at scale or supporting every edge case. The focus is on a single-user system (one person’s knowledge garden, though they can export outputs to share). Collaboration features (multi-user knowledge graphs) are out of scope for MVP. Integration with external platforms is minimal in MVP (perhaps export as markdown, but not full API integration with, say, Wikipedia yet). The MVP’s success criteria: a user can input notes (text/voice), the system suggests organizing them, the user can see and tweak their personal knowledge graph, and the user can query or generate a simple report from it. \n\n**Key MVP Features:**\n1. **Note Ingestion:** Accept text input (through a paste or typing interface). Also accept audio notes (via file upload or record button), with on-device or cloud transcription.\n2. **Basic NLP Processing:** Extract key terms and possibly summary from notes. Use this to suggest one or two tags or categories for the note.\n3. **User-Defined Taxonomy Setup:** Allow the user at first-run to input or choose some top-level categories of interest (optional, they can skip and use a default). Alternatively, generate an initial set of categories by analyzing a batch of their existing notes (if provided).\n4. **Ontology Editor (Light):** A section in the UI where the user can see a list of all current categories/concepts. They can add, remove, rename, and nest categories (creating hierarchy). They can also see simple relationships (MVP might restrict to parent-child “is a” or “part of” relations for simplicity).\n5. **Graph View:** Visualize notes and concepts as a graph. MVP might implement this as: nodes = notes and categories; an edge from note to category tag; edges between categories for hierarchy. This is simpler than a full ontology graph with arbitrary relations, which can be implemented in later versions. If possible, also show connections like “Note A and Note B are connected because they share a tag/mention” for discovery.\n6. **Search and Browse:** A search bar that finds text in notes and concept names. Clicking a concept shows all notes under it. Clicking a note shows its content and associated concepts.\n7. **AI Suggestions:** When a new note is added, the system suggests where it might fit: e.g., “This note mentions X, which looks like a new concept. Add it to your ontology?” or “This seems related to [existing concept]. Link them?”. These suggestions appear in a sidebar for the user to accept/ignore.\n8. **Content Generation (Basic):** Allow the user to select multiple notes or a category and click “Generate Summary” – the system then uses an API (OpenAI or local model) to produce a paragraph summarizing the selected content. MVP focus is summary/aggregation; more complex structured generation is later.\n9. **Export Options:** User can export their knowledge graph structure (e.g., as a JSON or CSV of relationships) and their notes (e.g., as MD files). Also, export any generated summary as a text file.\n10. **Onboarding and Guidance:** A simple tutorial or tooltips explaining how to use the system, especially how to correct AI suggestions or how to customize the taxonomy.\n\n**Non-MVP (to be deferred but kept in mind):** Advanced ontology relations, fine-grained control over AI (like setting tone for generation), integration to pull data from web or push to external services, multi-user collaboration, and mobile app (MVP could be desktop web only).\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nThe functional requirements detail what the system should do. They are grouped by feature for clarity:\n\n- **Ingestion & Transcription:**\n  - The system **shall allow** the user to input a text note (via typing or copy-paste).\n  - The system **shall allow** the user to record or upload an audio note, and it **shall transcribe** the audio to text using a speech recognition component.\n  - The transcription **shall preserve** the timestamp of the note and store the original audio (or reference) if needed for user access.\n\n- **Knowledge Extraction & Suggestion:**\n  - The system **shall automatically extract** key concepts (words or phrases) from each note upon ingestion.\n  - The system **shall match** extracted concepts to existing concepts in the personal ontology and tag the note with any matches.\n  - If an extracted concept does not match existing ones, the system **shall suggest** adding it as a new concept (highlighting it to the user).\n  - The system **shall suggest** at most a reasonable number (e.g., 5) of new concepts per note to avoid overwhelming the user.\n  - The system **may suggest** a relationship between a new concept and an existing concept (e.g., suggesting a parent category if confident).\n  - The user **shall be able to accept or reject** each suggestion individually. Upon acceptance, the system updates the ontology/graph accordingly.\n  - The system **shall allow** the user to manually tag the note with any existing concept (to correct or add beyond suggestions).\n\n- **Ontology/Taxonomy Management:**\n  - The system **shall maintain** an internal representation of the user’s concepts (ontology). In MVP, treat it akin to tags or nested tags.\n  - The user **shall be able to** create a new concept/category manually at any time.\n  - The user **shall be able to** rename or delete a concept. (Deleting a concept should prompt confirmation and possibly re-tag or orphan notes that were under it.)\n  - The user **shall be able to** define a hierarchical relationship (e.g., mark one category as a subcategory of another).\n  - (If implementing custom relations in MVP) The user **shall be able to** link two concepts with a named relationship. (This might be MVP+, could be skipped initially.)\n  - The system **shall update** in real-time the relevant notes if a category is renamed (the tag on notes updates).\n\n- **User Interface & Navigation:**\n  - The UI **shall display** a list or graphical representation of concepts and notes. Possible sub-requirements:\n    - **List view**: Left sidebar tree of all categories. Clicking a category filters the note list to those tagged with it.\n    - **Graph view**: A panel showing nodes as bubbles; user can drag to see relationships.\n  - The UI **shall display** the content of a selected note, along with its tags (concepts) and metadata (date, source).\n  - The UI **shall allow** editing a note’s text after creation (with changes saved).\n  - The UI **shall allow** adding or removing tags from a note manually.\n  - The UI **shall provide** a search bar where users can search across note contents and concept names. Results should highlight matches and allow clicking through.\n  - The UI **shall highlight** any AI-generated suggestion (maybe with a different color or icon) until the user addresses it (accepts or dismisses).\n  - The UI **shall allow** the user to mark certain concepts or notes as “favorite” or “pinned” for quick access (a minor but useful feature, maybe MVP+).\n\n- **Content Generation & Output:**\n  - The system **shall allow** the user to select multiple notes or an entire category for summary generation.\n  - The system **shall generate** a summary or synthesis text covering the selected content, using an AI model.\n  - The system **shall present** the generated text in an editable text area (so the user can correct or add to it).\n  - If the model supports it, the system **shall include** citations or references in the generated text that refer back to the source notes (e.g., “[Note 12]” which the user can click to see which note contributed that).\n  - The user **shall be able to** copy or save the generated text.\n  - Optionally, the system **could allow** export of the generated text to markdown or PDF in MVP if feasible.\n\n- **Data Management:**\n  - The system **shall save** all notes, concepts, and their relationships in a persistent manner (e.g., local storage or cloud account).\n  - The system **shall allow** the user to export their data (notes and ontology) to a standard format (JSON, CSV, or Markdown files for notes with front-matter for tags).\n  - The system **shall ensure** that user data is not sent to external services without consent (for instance, if using cloud AI APIs, clearly inform which content is being sent).\n  - The system **shall support** a basic backup mechanism (maybe manual export or autosave to a backup file directory).\n  \n- **Performance and Limits (MVP):**\n  - The system **shall handle** at least a moderate number of notes (say 1000 notes) with acceptable performance in search and navigation on a typical personal computer.\n  - The system **shall respond** to basic actions (opening note, adding a tag) within a short time (< 1 second ideally) for good UX.\n  - If resource-heavy tasks occur (like running topic model on a large set), the system **shall indicate** progress and not freeze the UI.\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\nApart from what the system does, these are qualities the system should exhibit:\n\n- **Usability:** The application should be intuitive for users familiar with note-taking apps. Even with advanced AI features, the interface should feel like a helpful note organizer rather than a complicated knowledge engineering tool. We will prioritize clean design, with progressive disclosure (advanced features accessible but not overwhelming at first). Shortcuts and drag-and-drop (e.g., dragging a note onto a category to tag it) are desirable for power use.\n\n- **Reliability:** Users must trust that their notes and knowledge will not be lost or corrupted. We should implement autosave for notes and frequent saving of the graph state. If the app is local, ensure writes are atomic (to avoid data corruption on crash). If cloud-based, ensure server uptime and data redundancy. MVP will likely be local-first to avoid complexity, which inherently avoids certain cloud failure issues.\n\n- **Privacy & Security:** Given personal notes can be sensitive, we must design with privacy in mind. If notes are stored locally, the user’s machine security applies. If any data is sent to cloud (like AI API), it should be explicitly stated. Ideally, allow the option to use a local LLM or a privacy-preserving mode where nothing leaves the device. For future multi-device sync, we’d need encryption – but for MVP, if local only, that’s simpler. Also consider at least basic encryption at rest (maybe allow the user to set a password to encrypt the knowledge base file).\n\n- **Scalability:** Though MVP might not handle huge data, the design should be such that we can extend it. Using established libraries for graphs and databases will help scaling. Our architecture separating components allows swapping in more powerful versions (e.g., using a GPU for NLP if available, or scaling to thousands of notes with an index).\n- **Extensibility:** We want the system to be able to integrate new features (like other input types or outputs) without total redesign. This means using modular code – e.g., the ingestion pipeline can accept new connectors, the ontology can support new relation types, etc. Using standards (like if we use RDF under the hood) can help interoperability.\n\n- **Performance:** Key operations (note addition, search) should be efficient. Large language model calls can be slow; we should use them judiciously (e.g., generate summary asynchronously or on user demand rather than blocking normal usage). For MVP, some latency in generation is acceptable if communicated (e.g., show loading spinner with witty message like “Summarizing with AI magic…”).\n\n- **Support & Maintainability:** The product code should be well-documented, especially as it’s research-driven (others might build on it). Logging of actions and errors is important for debugging (with user consent due to privacy). Also, from an ethical perspective, logging AI decisions (like what it suggested, what user did) helps later analysis and accountability.\n\n- **Ethical Compliance:** More on this later, but as a quality, the system’s behavior should be aligned with ethical guidelines: e.g., no hidden AI actions (transparency), respect user’s choices, incorporate bias mitigation strategies if needed (non-functional in sense it doesn’t add a feature but ensures quality of output).\n\n### Development Timeline and Milestones\n\nWe propose a phased development approach with milestones that gradually increase functionality and gather feedback. The timeline can be versioned as follows (assuming an initial team and resources are in place; exact dates will depend on project start):\n\n- **Phase 0: Research & Planning (Months 0-1)**  \n  *Activities:* Finalize requirements, architecture design, choose technologies, create wireframes for UI, and prepare a small sample dataset of notes for testing.  \n  *Deliverable:* Project plan, design specs, and sample data.\n\n- **Phase 1: Core Data Model & Ingestion (Months 2-3)**  \n  *Focus:* Build the backend data model for notes and ontology. Implement text note ingestion and manual tagging UI. Possibly skip AI in this phase to focus on base.  \n  *Milestone 1 (v0.1):* Basic note-taking app with categories. The user can create/edit notes, create categories (tags) and tag notes, see notes by category. No AI suggestions yet.  \n  *Deliverable:* Demo of adding notes and organizing them manually, with data saved to disk.\n\n- **Phase 2: Integrate NLP for Suggestion (Months 3-4)**  \n  *Focus:* Add the NLP pipeline components for extraction and initial suggestions. Implement the suggestion UI loop.  \n  *Milestone 2 (v0.5):* Intelligent tagging prototype. When a note is added, the system highlights extracted keywords and maybe auto-tags note with what it thinks. The user can adjust. Voice note transcription working (at least via a simple API call).  \n  *Deliverable:* Prototype where one can drop in a few example notes and see the system categorize them with AI help.\n\n- **Phase 3: Graphical UI and Advanced Organization (Month 4-5)**  \n  *Focus:* Improve the visualization – introduce the graph view. Allow hierarchical category nesting if not already. Optimize the UI interactions for ontology editing.  \n  *Milestone 3 (v0.7):* Visual Knowledge Garden. The user can toggle to a graph view to see concepts and note connections. The ontology editor allows drag-drop of categories to reorder hierarchy.  \n  *Deliverable:* Enhanced UI that can be tested for user experience feedback.\n\n- **Phase 4: Content Generation Integration (Month 5-6)**  \n  *Focus:* Connect an LLM for content generation (likely via API initially). Implement the summary generation feature for a selection of notes. Also implement export options.  \n  *Milestone 4 (v0.9):* Create & Share. The user selects a category and clicks “Summarize All”. The system returns a draft summary. The user can edit and export this text. Basic reference linking from summary to notes is included (maybe as footnotes listing note titles).  \n  *Deliverable:* Nearly feature-complete MVP with generation.\n\n- **Phase 5: Testing, Refinement, and UX Polish (Month 6-7)**  \n  *Focus:* Fix bugs, improve performance for larger note sets, refine suggestion accuracy (tweak NLP models thresholds, etc.), and add polish to UI (help tooltips, onboarding). Conduct a small closed beta test with real users for feedback.  \n  *Milestone 5 (v1.0 MVP Release):* Solid, usable product. All primary features work reliably: note input (text/voice), AI suggestions, graph visualization, content generation, data export. Documentation and tutorial in place.  \n  *Deliverable:* MVP launch (could be internal or limited release), ready for broader user testing or pilot deployments.\n\n- **Phase 6: Post-MVP Enhancements (Month 8 onward, future versions)**  \n  This includes features we deferred: multi-user collaboration, cloud sync, mobile app, richer ontology relations, integration with external knowledge (like pulling definitions from Wikipedia to enrich personal notes or publishing directly to a wiki), etc. These would be planned based on user feedback and success of MVP. For example:\n  - v1.1: focus on collaboration – allow sharing a subset of your knowledge graph with a friend or team, with access control.\n  - v1.2: integration – e.g., a plugin for web browsers to send content to the knowledge garden, or integration with popular note apps for import.\n  - v2.0: possibly a cloud service with account-based storage and AI models running on server for heavier tasks, etc.\n\nFor clarity, here’s a timeline summary in a table format:\n\n| Phase & Version | Timeframe    | Key Features/Milestones                       |\n|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Phase 0** – Planning    | Month 0-1   | Requirements finalized, design & tech stack decisions, sample data prepared. |\n| **Phase 1** – v0.1 Core   | Month 2-3   | Basic note & category management (CRUD notes, manual tagging, data persistence). |\n| **Phase 2** – v0.5 AI Suggestions | Month 3-4   | NLP extraction integrated, suggestion UI, voice transcription, initial intelligent tagging. |\n| **Phase 3** – v0.7 Visualization | Month 4-5   | Graph view, hierarchical ontology support, improved UI interactions. |\n| **Phase 4** – v0.9 Generation | Month 5-6   | LLM-backed summary generation, output editing and export features. |\n| **Phase 5** – v1.0 MVP Launch | Month 6-7   | Testing & bugfix, performance tuning, UI polish, onboarding guide; MVP released for wider testing. |\n| **Phase 6** – v1.x+ Future | Month 8+   | (Planned) Collaboration features, external integration, mobile app, advanced ontology and AI capabilities based on feedback. |\n\nThis timeline is ambitious but feasible with a dedicated small team. It assumes overlap between phases (e.g., UI can be developed in parallel with backend NLP integration to some extent). Agile sprints within these phases would deliver incremental capabilities regularly.\n\n### Evaluation and Testing Metrics\n\nFrom a product perspective, evaluating the system involves both user-centric metrics and system metrics:\n\n**Usability & User Satisfaction Metrics:**\n- *Onboarding Success:* Measure how easily new users can get started. For instance, track if users complete a tutorial and are able to add and organize their first 5 notes without assistance. A target could be >90% of new users can perform core actions (add note, tag it, view it later) within first 10 minutes.\n- *Time Savings:* Through user studies or surveys, estimate how much time the system saves in organizing and retrieving information versus the user’s previous method. E.g., if a user normally spends 1 hour/day managing notes, does our system reduce that or allow them to cover more ground in the same time?\n- *User Feedback Scores:* After trial, ask users to rate statements on a Likert scale (1-5): “The AI suggestions were helpful,” “The system’s outputs matched what I needed,” “I feel my knowledge is better organized,” etc. Aim for an average satisfaction of e.g. 4/5 on key dimensions (usefulness, ease of use, trust).\n- *Retention and Engagement:* In a beta, track how often users come back. If they drop off after initial try, something might be off. Engagement can be measured in number of notes added per week, or features used (did they try generation, etc.). For a successful PKM tool, we’d like regular usage (if the tool becomes part of their workflow, that indicates value).\n\n**Functional Performance Metrics:**\n- *Accuracy of AI Suggestions:* As a metric, we can calculate what fraction of AI tagging suggestions the user accepts. A higher acceptance rate (say >70%) means the suggestions match user intent well. If low, either AI is off or UI communication is poor.\n- *Coverage of Extraction:* If possible, measure how many important concepts in notes were detected by AI vs missed (this might need a ground truth, maybe from user annotation). We want high recall so that AI doesn’t miss key points (leading to user doing a lot manually).\n- *Quality of Generated Outputs:* We can use some semi-automated metrics or proxies:\n  - For summaries, maybe ROUGE/L against a user-written summary (if available) or simply have users rate them for correctness and readability as mentioned. Perhaps aim for a certain threshold like “80% of generated summary sentences are factually correct and relevant” which can be manually evaluated on sample outputs.\n  - The ratio of user edits to generated text length can be computed: e.g., if user had to change 20% of the sentences, that’s moderate; if 80%, then the generation wasn’t very useful. We strive for a lower edit ratio over time as the model is tuned or prompts improved.\n- *System Speed:* Time to add a note and see suggestions should be maybe <2 seconds for a good UX. Generation might take longer (dependent on model, maybe ~5-10 seconds), but anything beyond 15 seconds might frustrate users. These can be measured in testing and optimized (with caching or local models).\n- *Scalability Test:* Although not primary for MVP, we should test with maybe a synthetic 1000 notes to ensure the app doesn’t become sluggish. Metrics like response time for search as number of notes grows – should ideally scale sub-linearly (maybe using indexing). We might set a non-functional requirement like “Search within 1000 notes returns results in <1 second on average hardware.”\n\n**Creative vs Formal Output Evaluation:**\nThe question specifically asks for metrics for both creative and formal outputs. This distinction:\n- *Creative outputs* (like personal essays, idea brainstorms): metrics might focus on user satisfaction and inspiration:\n  - Did the output give the user new ideas? (maybe ask if they discovered something new from the AI’s reorganization of their thoughts).\n  - How much of the output did they keep vs discard? (if the user just used it as a thinking aid and wrote their own version, that’s fine but indicates it might need improvement).\n- *Formal outputs* (like reports, wiki articles): metrics focus on accuracy, completeness, and adherence to expected formats:\n  - Are all claims in the output backed by a source in the knowledge base? We could automatically check if every sentence either is directly from a note or can be traced (this could be done by embedding similarity or simply requiring the model to cite sources).\n  - Does the structure meet formal requirements (like including an introduction, conclusion, etc., if such template is used).\n  - Peer review: have another person read the output and see if it stands as a decent piece of writing on its own. Possibly assign a grade (like how one would grade an essay or report).\n\nWe might create an **evaluation rubric** for outputs with criteria: Content Accuracy, Clarity, Structure, Style/Tone appropriateness, Value Alignment. Each rated 1-5 by test users or evaluators. Use that to identify weaknesses.\n\nAdditionally, **A/B testing** can be done on certain features. For instance, test two prompting strategies for the LLM to see which yields better summaries (one might prompt strictly to use bullet points vs narrative, etc.). Or test the UI of suggestions (a pop-up vs a sidebar list) to see which leads to better user engagement/acceptance.\n\nDuring beta testing, collecting logs (with consent) of interactions will help refine metrics. For example, if we log each suggestion and whether it was accepted, we can compute precision; if we log each search query and whether user found what they needed (e.g., did they click a result or re-search?), we gauge search success rate.\n\nFinally, any critical incidents (e.g., AI suggested something offensive or completely wrong) will be noted as important qualitative metrics for risk.\n\n### Key Ethical and Values-Sensitive Considerations\n\nEthical considerations are integral to our system, given it deals with personal information and uses AI in knowledge work. We enumerate the key considerations and how we plan to address them:\n\n- **Privacy:** Personal knowledge bases can contain sensitive information (personal reflections, confidential work notes, etc.). We commit to data privacy by:\n  - Keeping data local by default in MVP. If cloud is used (for sync or AI), provide clear notices and ideally encryption. For instance, if using OpenAI API for generation, inform the user that their note content is being sent to OpenAI and let them opt-out or use a local model alternative.\n  - Not collecting user data on our servers without consent. If we have analytics or error reporting, it should be anonymized or opt-in.\n  - Eventually offering end-to-end encryption if cloud storage is provided (so even our team cannot read user data).\n  - On-device processing for as much as possible (transcription and basic NLP can use local models when feasible, especially as tech evolves).\n  - Allowing users to scrub or delete data easily. “Right to be forgotten” essentially: a user can wipe their knowledge base and any cached AI data.\n\n- **Security:** Though perhaps less of a concern as an offline app, if the app interacts with cloud, ensure secure connections (HTTPS, etc.). Also guard against threats like someone hacking the local graph store if it’s not encrypted (maybe allow a master password to lock the app). Also, since this is a new app, watch out for any injection attacks if we use user data in prompts (an interesting angle: could malicious content in a note cause the AI to behave badly? Possibly not applicable here unless the user copy-pastes something malicious, but our system should handle all text safely since it’s not executing code).\n\n- **Bias and Fairness:** The AI suggestions and outputs might reflect biases (from training data of the model or from the user’s own data). Value-sensitive design means:\n  - The system should allow the user to imprint their perspective, but what if their perspective is biased or harmful? As a personal tool, it’s not our role to judge the user’s values, but if outputs are to be shared collaboratively, we might encourage reflection. For example, if the user’s notes are one-sided on a controversial topic, and they generate a wiki article, the system could detect lack of opposing viewpoints and gently suggest adding balance (assuming the user values neutrality in the context of a wiki).\n  - We will ensure that the default behavior of AI is as neutral and factual as possible. Many LLMs have known biases; we might employ prompt engineering to mitigate (like explicitly instructing to use a neutral tone, or check multiple sources).\n  - There’s also bias in what AI suggests to include vs exclude. We could allow the user to toggle certain biases: e.g., “prefer recent information” or “prefer my own notes over external knowledge” as settings.\n  - In user research, include diverse users to see if the system works equally well for different thinking styles and backgrounds. E.g., does it favor a Western categorization scheme unconsciously? We should design it to be flexible (maybe someone wants to organize by narrative or metaphor instead of taxonomy – can our system accommodate creative structures?).\n\n- **Transparency and Control:** Users should understand what the AI is doing. We will:\n  - Provide visible indicators for AI actions (like “Suggested by AI” on tags, or highlighting auto-generated text).\n  - Possibly a log or explanation feature: e.g., user can click “Why was this suggested?” and we show “because the term X appeared 5 times and matched Y in your ontology” or “because our language model predicted this note is about Z with 90% confidence”. Even if not fully in MVP, at least document how suggestions work.\n  - Let users turn off or adjust AI assistance if they want a more manual mode. This opt-out ensures user isn’t forced into a paradigm they dislike.\n  - When generating content, mark the AI-written draft clearly, so users know what to double-check. Maybe even watermarks or comments in the text indicating source (some academic tools do like “{% from note 5 %}”).\n\n- **Avoiding Over-reliance and Cognitive Impacts:** A subtle ethical point is preventing the user from over-relying on AI to the detriment of their own cognitive skills. If the system generates everything, the user might not learn or might trust false info. To mitigate:\n  - Encourage the user’s active engagement (that’s inherent by requiring confirmation of suggestions, and by design they are curating the graph).\n  - Possibly provide an “AI confidence” indicator – if something is low confidence, flag it so the user is alerted to scrutinize that part.\n  - Offer ways to verify content: integration with sources or a quick way to search the web for a statement from generated output, to confirm.\n  - Not positioning the tool as a truth oracle – emphasize it’s a partner. In messaging and UI language, avoid authoritative tone for AI (“Your summary is ready” vs “Here’s a draft for you to review”).\n\n- **Intellectual Property and Attribution:** The user’s notes might include text from other sources; by storing and regenerating, we should be careful about plagiarism issues:\n  - If the user copies a paragraph from a book into their note, then uses our system to output an article, that text might appear. We should perhaps detect large verbatim text and either warn or automatically quote/cite it. At least, ensure the user knows that if they directly incorporate content not originally theirs, they need to attribute if they publish it. The knowledge graph could store source info (like this note came from URL X).\n  - The AI model might also bring in external knowledge not from the notes (especially if using a general LLM, it has training data). We should constrain it to primarily use user-provided info to avoid unpredictable extraneous text that might violate IP or be untraceable. If we integrate external info (like definitions from Wikipedia), we must cite those sources in outputs.\n\n- **User Autonomy:** The system is meant to augment, not replace, the user’s thinking. So:\n  - The user should always have the final say in organizing and content creation. No automatic changes to their ontology without consent. Even in future auto-merge features, get approval.\n  - If the user chooses a non-standard way to organize, the system shouldn’t fight them. E.g., if suggestions keep coming that the user rejects, perhaps adapt and suggest less of that kind, rather than nagging. This ties to making the AI personalized – learning user’s preferences.\n  - Provide easy ways to undo actions (like if they accept a suggestion and then regret it, allow deletion or reverting that change).\n\n- **Evaluation Ethics:** On our side, when we do user studies, ensure informed consent, anonymize their data for analysis, etc. Especially since their personal knowledge could be sensitive, any analysis of their usage should be privacy-preserving. Perhaps create dummy test scenarios for formal evaluation to avoid snooping actual user content.\n\nIn conclusion, by proactively embedding these ethical considerations, we aim to create a product that not only delivers powerful functionality but does so in a way that users trust and feel comfortable with. The intersection of personal data and AI is delicate – our approach will be to err on the side of the user’s control and understanding at every juncture, aligning with the **values-sensitive design** philosophy that the entire project is built upon.\n\n",

They reveal latent thematic structures but lack the semantic precision of the other approaches.\n\n**For this proposal**, I recommend positioning these as complementary layers: topic models for discovery, taxonomies for basic organization, ontologies for semantic richness, and knowledge graphs as the integrative structure connecting all elements.\n\n## 2. Missing literature and theoretical frameworks from LIS\n\nThe proposal would benefit from incorporating several key LIS perspectives:\n\n**Critical Cataloging Movement**: The work on bias in knowledge organization (Hope Olson, Emily Drabinski, Melissa Adler) directly relates to values-driven systems. Their frameworks for identifying and addressing systemic biases in classification schemes are essential.\n\n**Personal Information Management Theory**: The foundational work of William Jones and Deborah Barreau on PIM provides crucial distinctions between information and knowledge management that the proposal currently conflates.

Ranganathan's work and modern applications (Vanda Broughton, Brian Vickery) offer proven approaches for flexible, multi-dimensional organization highly relevant to personal systems.\n\n**Knowledge Organization Theory**: The ISKO community's work, particularly Birger Hjørland's domain-analytic approach and Hope Olson's work on difference and diversity, provides theoretical grounding for values-based organization.

Refined research questions\n\nThe current questions are too broad.

This task typically involves developing a supervised underlying scheme of classes and allocating publications to the most relevant class. In this article, we implement an end-to-end automated solution using embedding quantization and a Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline. Our case study starts with a dataset of 25,000 arXiv publications from Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), published before July 2024, which we organize under a novel scheme of classes.\n\nMethodology\nOur approach centers on three key tasks: (i) unsupervised clustering of the arXiv dataset into related collections, (ii) discovering the latent thematic structures within each cluster, and (iii) creating a candidate taxonomy scheme based on said thematic structures.\n\nAt its core, the clustering task requires identifying a sufficient number of similar examples within an unlabeled dataset. This is a natural task for embeddings, as they capture semantic relationships in a corpus and can be provided as input features to a clustering algorithm for establishing similarity links among examples. We begin by transforming the (title:abstract) pairs of our dataset into an embeddings representation using Jina-Embeddings-v2, a BERT-ALiBi based attention model. And applying scalar quantization using both Sentence Transformers and a custom implementation.\n\nFor clustering, we run HDBSCAN in a reduced dimensional space, comparing the results using eom and leaf clustering methods. Additionally, we examine whether applying (u)int8 embeddings quantization instead of float32 representations affects this process.\n\nTo uncover latent topics within each cluster of arXiv publications, we combine LangChain and Pydantic with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (and GPT-4o, included for comparison) into an LLM-pipeline. The output is then incorporated into a refined prompt template that guides Claude Sonnet 3.5 in generating a hierarchical taxonomy.\n\nThe results hint at 35 emerging research topics, wherein each topic comprises at least 100 publications. These are organized within 7 parent classes and 20 subclasses in the field of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). This approach may serve as a baseline for automatically generating hierarchical candidate schemes in high-level arXiv categories and efficiently completing taxonomies, addressing the challenge posed by the increasing volume of academic literature.\n\n\nTaxonomy Completion of Academic Literature with Embedding Quantization and an LLM-Pipeline\n1. Embedding Transformation\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of real-world objects like text, images, and audio that encapsulate semantic information of the data they represent. They are used by AI models to understand complex knowledge domains in downstream applications such as clustering, information retrieval, and semantic understanding tasks, among others.\n\nSupporting Large Sequences\nWe will map (title:abstract) pairs from arXiv publications to a 768-dimensional space using Jina-Embeddings-v2 [1], an open-source text embedding model capable of accommodating up to 8192 tokens. This provides a sufficiently large sequence length for titles, abstracts, and other document sections that might be relevant. To overcome the conventional 512-token limit present in other models, Jina-Embeddings-v2 incorporates bidirectional ALiBi [2] into the BERT framework. ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) enables input length extrapolation (i.e., sequences exceeding 2048 tokens) by encoding positional information directly within the self-attention layer, instead of introducing positional embeddings. In practice, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance, favoring stronger mutual attention between proximate tokens.\n\nEncoding with Sentence Transformers\nThe first step to using the Jina-Embeddings-v2 model is to load it through Sentence Transformers, a framework for accessing state-of-the-art models that is available at the Hugging Face Hub:\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en', trust_remote_code=True)\n\nWe now encode (title:abstract) pairs of our dataset using batch_size = 64. This allows for parallel computation on hardware accelerators like GPUs (albeit at the cost of requiring more memory):\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nds = load_dataset(\"dcarpintero/arxiv.cs.CL.25k\", split=\"train\")\n\ncorpus = [title + ':' + abstract for title, abstract in zip(ds['title'], ds['abstract'])]\nf32_embeddings = model.encode(corpus,\n                              batch_size=64,\n                              show_progress_bar=True)\n\nComputing Semantic Similarity\nThe semantic similarity between corpora can now be trivially computed as the inner product of embeddings. In the following heat map, each entry [x, y] is colored based on said embeddings product for exemplary 'title' sentences [x] and [y].\n\n\nSemantic Similary in cs.CL arXiv-titles using Embeddings\n2. Embedding Quantization for Memory Saving\nScaling up embeddings can be challenging. Currently, state-of-the-art models represent each embedding as float32, which requires 4 bytes of memory. Given that Jina-Embeddings-v2 maps text to a 768-dimensional space, the memory requirements for our dataset would be around 73 MB, without indexes and other metadata related to the publication records:\n\n25,000 embeddings * 768 dimensions/embedding * 4 bytes/dimension = 76,800,000 bytes\n76,800,000 bytes / (1024^2) ≈ 73.24 MB\n\nHowever, working with a larger dataset might increase significantly the memory requirements and associated costs:\n\nEmbedding\nDimension\tEmbedding\nModel\t2.5M\nArXiv Abstracts\t60.9M\nWikipedia Pages\t100M\nEmbeddings\n384\tall-MiniLM-L12-v2\t3.57 GB\t85.26 GB\t142.88 GB\n768\tall-mpnet-base-v2\t7.15 GB\t170.52 GB\t285.76 GB\n768\tjina-embeddings-v2\t7.15 GB\t170.52 GB\t285.76 GB\n1536\topenai-text-embedding-3-small\t14.31 GB\t341.04 GB\t571.53 GB\n3072\topenai-text-embedding-3-large\t28.61 GB\t682.08 GB\t1.143 TB\nA technique used to achieve memory saving is Quantization. The intuition behind this approach is that we can discretize floating-point values by mapping their range [f_max, f_min] into a smaller range of fixed-point numbers [q_max, q_min], and linearly distributing all values between these ranges. In practice, this typically reduces the precision of a 32-bit floating-point to lower bit widths like 8-bits (scalar quantization) or 1-bit values (binary quantization).\n\n\nScalar Embedding Quantization - from float32 to (u)int8\nBy plotting the frequency distribution of the Jina-generated embeddings, we observe that the values are indeed concentrated around a relatively narrow range [-2.0, +2.0]. This means we can effectively map float32 values to 256 (u)int8 buckets without significant loss of information:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.hist(f32_embeddings.flatten(), bins=250, edgecolor='C0')\nplt.xlabel('float-32 jina-embeddings-v2')\nplt.title('distribution')\nplt.show()\n\n\nOriginal float32 jina-embeddings-v2 distribution\nWe can calculate the exact [min, max] values of the distribution:\n\nnp.min(f32_embeddings), np.max(f32_embeddings)\n(-2.0162134, 2.074683)\n\nThe first step to implementing scalar quantization is to define a calibration set of embeddings. A typical starting point is a subset of 10k embeddings, which in our case would cover nearly 99.98% of the original float32 embedding values. The use of calibration is intended to obtain representative f_min and f_max values along each dimension to reduce the computational overhead and potential issues caused by outliers that might appear in larger datasets.\n\ndef calibration_accuracy(embeddings: np.ndarray, k: int = 10000) -> float:\n  calibration_embeddings = embeddings[:k]\n  f_min = np.min(calibration_embeddings, axis=0)\n  f_max = np.max(calibration_embeddings, axis=0)\n\n  # Calculate percentage in range for each dimension\n  size = embeddings.shape[0]\n  avg = []\n  for i in range(embeddings.shape[1]):\n      in_range = np.sum((embeddings[:, i] >= f_min[i]) & (embeddings[:, i] <= f_max[i]))\n      dim_percentage = (in_range / size) * 100\n      avg.append(dim_percentage)\n\n  return np.mean(avg)\n\nacc = calibration_accuracy(f32_embeddings, k=10000)\nprint(f\"Average percentage of embeddings within [f_min, f_max] calibration: {acc:.5f}%\")\nAverage percentage of embeddings within [f_min, f_max] calibration: 99.98636%\n\nThe second and third steps of scalar quantization — computing scales and zero point, and encoding — can be easily applied with Sentence Transformers, resulting in a 4x memory saving compared to the original float32 representation. Moreover, we will also benefit from faster arithmetic operations since matrix multiplication can be performed more quickly with integer arithmetic.\n\nfrom sentence_transformers.quantization import quantize_embeddings\n\n# quantization is applied in a post-processing step\nint8_embeddings = quantize_embeddings(\n    np.array(f32_embeddings),\n    precision=\"int8\",\n    calibration_embeddings=np.array(f32_embeddings[:10000]),\n)\n\nf32_embeddings.dtype, f32_embeddings.shape, f32_embeddings.nbytes\n(dtype('float32'), (25107, 768), 77128704) # 73.5 MB\n\nint8_embeddings.dtype, int8_embeddings.shape, int8_embeddings.nbytes\n(dtype('int8'), (25107, 768), 19282176)    # 18.3 MB\n\n# calculate compression\n(f32_embeddings.nbytes - int8_embeddings.nbytes) / f32_embeddings.nbytes * 100\n75.0\n\nFor completeness, we implement a scalar quantization method to illustrate those three steps:\n\ndef scalar_quantize_embeddings(embeddings: np.ndarray,\n                               calibration_embeddings: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate [f_min, f_max] per dimension from the calibration set \n    f_min = np.min(calibration_embeddings, axis=0)\n    f_max = np.max(calibration_embeddings, axis=0)\n\n    # Step 2: Map [f_min, f_max] to [q_min, q_max] => (scaling factors, zero point)\n    q_min = 0\n    q_max = 255\n    scales = (f_max - f_min) / (q_max - q_min)\n    zero_point = 0 # uint8 quantization maps inherently min_values to zero\n\n    # Step 3: encode (scale, round)\n    quantized_embeddings = ((embeddings - f_min) / scales).astype(np.uint8)\n\n    return quantized_embeddings\n\ncalibration_embeddings = f32_embeddings[:10000]\nbeta_uint8_embeddings = scalar_quantize_embeddings(f32_embeddings, calibration_embeddings)\n\nbeta_uint8_embeddings[5000][64:128].reshape(8, 8)\n\narray([[187, 111,  96, 128, 116, 129, 130, 122],\n       [132, 153,  72, 136,  94, 120, 112,  93],\n       [143, 121, 137, 143, 195, 159,  90,  93],\n       [178, 189, 143,  99,  99, 151,  93, 102],\n       [179, 104, 146, 150, 176,  94, 148, 118],\n       [161, 138,  90, 122,  93, 146, 140, 129],\n       [121, 115, 153, 118, 107,  45,  70, 171],\n       [207,  53,  67, 115, 223, 105, 124, 158]], dtype=uint8)\n\nWe will continue with the version of the embeddings that have been quantized using Sentence Transformers (our custom implementation is also included in the results analysis):\n\n# `f32_embeddings` => if you prefer to not use quantization\n# `beta_uint8_embeddings` => to check our custom implemention\nembeddings = int8_embeddings \n\n3. Projecting Embeddings for Dimensionality Reduction\nIn this section, we perform a two-stage projection of (title:abstract) embedding pairs from their original high-dimensional space (768) to lower dimensions, namely:\n\n5 dimensions for reducing computational complexity during clustering, and\n2 dimensions for enabling visual representation in (x, y) coordinates.\nFor both projections, we employ UMAP [3], a popular dimensionality reduction technique known for its effectiveness in preserving both the local and global data structures. In practice, this makes it a preferred choice for handling complex datasets with high-dimensional embeddings:\n\nimport umap\n\nembedding_5d = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=100, # consider 100 nearest neighbors for each point\n                         n_components=5,  # reduce embedding space from 768 to 5 dimensions\n                         min_dist=0.1,    # maintain local and global balance\n                         metric='cosine').fit_transform(embeddings)\n\nembedding_2d = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=100,\n                         n_components=2,\n                         min_dist=0.1,\n                         metric='cosine').fit_transform(embeddings)\n\nNote that when we apply HDBSCAN clustering in the next step, the clusters found will be influenced by how UMAP preserved the local structures. A smaller n_neighbors value means UMAP will focus more on local structures, whereas a larger value allows capturing more global representations, which might be beneficial for understanding overall patterns in the data.\n\n4. Semantic Clustering\nThe reduced (title:abstract) embeddings can now be used as input features of a clustering algorithm, enabling the identification of related categories based on embedding distances.\n\nWe have opted for HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) [4], an advanced clustering algorithm that extends DBSCAN by adapting to varying density clusters. Unlike K-Means which requires pre-specifying the number of clusters, HDBSCAN has only one important hyperparameter, n, which establishes the minimum number of examples to include in a cluster.\n\nHDBSCAN works by first transforming the data space according to the density of the data points, making denser regions (areas where data points are close together in high numbers) more attractive for cluster formation. The algorithm then builds a hierarchy of clusters based on the minimum cluster size established by the hyperparameter n. This allows it to distinguish between noise (sparse areas) and dense regions (potential clusters). Finally, HDBSCAN condenses this hierarchy to derive the most persistent clusters, identifying clusters of different densities and shapes. As a density-based method, it can also detect outliers.\n\nimport hdbscan\n\nhdbs = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=100,            # conservative clusters' size\n                       metric='euclidean',              # points distance metric\n                       cluster_selection_method='leaf') # favour fine grained clustering\nclusters = hdbs.fit_predict(embedding_5d)               # apply HDBSCAN on reduced UMAP\n\nThe cluster_selection_method determines how HDBSCAN selects flat clusters from the tree hierarchy. In our case, using eom (Excess of Mass) cluster selection method in combination with embedding quantization tended to create a few larger, less specific clusters. These clusters would have required a further reclustering process to extract meaningful latent topics. Instead, by switching to the leaf selection method, we guided the algorithm to select leaf nodes from the cluster hierarchy, which produced a more fine-grained clustering compared to the Excess of Mass method:\n\n\nHDBSCAN eom & leaf clustering method comparison using int8-embedding-quantization\n5. Uncovering Latent Topics with an LLM-Pipeline\nHaving performed the clustering step, we now illustrate how to infer the latent topic of each cluster by combining an LLM such as Mistral-7B-Instruct [5] with Pydantic and LangChain to create an LLM pipeline that generates output in a composable structured format.\n\n5.1 Pydantic Model\nPydantic Models are classes that derive from pydantic.BaseModel, defining fields as type-annotated attributes. They are similar to Python dataclasses. However, they have been designed with subtle but significant differences that optimize various operations such as validation, serialization, and JSON schema generation. Our Topic class defines a field named label. This will generate LLM output in a structured format, rather than a free-form text block, facilitating easier processing and analysis.\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass Topic(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Pydantic Model to generate an structured Topic Model\n    \"\"\"\n    label: str = Field(..., description=\"Identified topic\")\n\n5.2 Langchain Prompt Template\nLangChain Prompt Templates are pre-defined recipes for translating user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. We define here the prompt for our intended task:\n\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\ntopic_prompt = \"\"\"\n  You are a helpful research assistant. Your task is to analyze a set of research paper\n  titles related to Natural Language Processing, and determine the overarching topic. \n            \n  INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n  1. Based on the titles provided, identify the most relevant topic:\n    - Ensure the topic is concise and clear.\n            \n  2. Format Respose:\n    - Ensure the title response is in JSON as in the 'OUTPUT OUTPUT' section below.\n    - No follow up questions are needed.\n\n  OUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n  {{\"label\": \"Topic Name\"}}\n\n  TITLES:\n  {titles}\n  \"\"\"\n\n5.3 Inference Chain using LangChain Expression Language\nLet's now compose a topic modeling pipeline using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to render our prompt template into LLM input, and parse the inference output as JSON:\n\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpoint\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef TopicModeling(titles: List[str]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Infer the common topic of the given titles w/ LangChain, Pydantic, OpenAI\n    \"\"\"\n    repo_id = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\"\n    llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(\n        repo_id=repo_id,\n        temperature=0.2,\n        huggingfacehub_api_token=os.environ[\"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN\"]\n    )\n    prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(topic_prompt)\n    parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Topic)\n\n    topic_chain = prompt | llm | parser\n    return topic_chain.invoke({\"titles\": titles})\n\nTo enable the model to infer the topic of each cluster, we include a subset of 25 paper titles from each cluster as part of the LLM input:\n\ntopics = []\nfor i, cluster in df.groupby('cluster'):\n    titles = cluster['title'].sample(25).tolist()\n    topic = TopicModeling(titles)\n    topics.append(topic.label)\n\nLet's assign each arXiv publication to its corresponding cluster:\n\nn_clusters = len(df['cluster'].unique())\n\ntopic_map = dict(zip(range(n_clusters), topics))\ndf['topic'] = df['cluster'].map(topic_map)\n\n6. Generating a Taxonomy\nTo create a hierarchical taxonomy, we craft a prompt to guide Claude Sonnet 3.5 in organizing the identified research topics corresponding to each cluster into a hierarchical scheme:\n\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\ntaxonomy_prompt = \"\"\"\n    Create a comprehensive and well-structured taxonomy\n    for the ArXiv cs.CL (Computational Linguistics) category.\n    This taxonomy should organize subtopics in a logical manner.\n\n    INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n    1. Review and Refine Subtopics:\n      - Examine the provided list of subtopics in computational linguistics.\n      - Ensure each subtopic is clearly defined and distinct from others.\n\n    2. Create Definitions:\n      - For each subtopic, provide a concise definition (1-2 sentences).\n\n    3. Develop a Hierarchical Structure:\n      - Group related subtopics into broader categories.\n      - Create a multi-level hierarchy, with top-level categories and nested subcategories.\n      - Ensure that the structure is logical and intuitive for researchers in the field.\n\n    4. Validate and Refine:\n      - Review the entire taxonomy for consistency, completeness, and clarity.\n\n    OUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n    - Present the final taxonomy in a clear, hierarchical format, with:\n\n      . Main categories\n        .. Subcategories\n          ... Individual topics with their definitions\n\n    SUBTOPICS:\n    {taxonomy_subtopics}\n    \"\"\"\n\n7. Results\n7.1 Clustering Analysis\nLet's create an interactive scatter plot:\n\nchart = alt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=5).encode(\n    x='x',\n    y='y',\n    color='topic:N',\n    tooltip=['title', 'topic']\n).interactive().properties(\n    title='Clustering and Topic Modeling | 25k arXiv cs.CL publications)',\n    width=600,\n    height=400,\n)\nchart.display()\n\nAnd compare the clustering results using float32 embedding representations and int8 Sentence Transformers quantization:\n\n\nHDBSCAN leaf-clustering using float32 & quantized-int8 embeddings (sentence-transformers-quantization)\nWe now perform the same comparison with our custom quantization implementation:\n\n\nHDBSCAN leaf-clustering using float32 & quantized-uint8 embeddings (self-quantization-implementation)\nThe clustering results using float32 and (u)int8 quantized embeddings show a similar general layout of well-defined clusters, indicating that (i) the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm was effective in both cases, and (ii) the core relationships in the data were maintained after quantization (using sentence transformers and our custom implementation).\n\nNotably, it can be observed that using embedding quantization resulted in both cases in slightly more granular clustering (35 clusters versus 31) that appears to be semantically coherent. Our tentative hypothesis for this difference is that scalar quantization might paradoxically guide the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to separate points that were previously grouped together.\n\nThis could be due to (i) noise (quantization can create small noisy variations in the data, which might have a sort of regularization effect and lead to more sensitive clustering decisions), or due to (ii) the difference in numerical precision and alteration of distance calculations (this could amplify certain differences between points that were less pronounced in the float32 representation). Further investigation would be necessary to fully understand the implications of quantization on clustering.\n\n7.2 Taxonomy Scheme\nThe entire hierarchical scheme is available at cs.CL.taxonomy. This approach may serve as a baseline for automatically identifying candidate schemes of classes in high-level arXiv categories:\n\n. Foundations of Language Models\n  ..

Let’s break this down into a few key points:\\n\\nWhen we talk about extracting all the meaningful \"semantic\" elements from a conversation or body of knowledge, we’re essentially trying to capture not just the facts and explicit information, but also the underlying meanings, nuances, and intentions. This includes the use of metaphors, the context in which something is said, and the various layers of meaning that evolve over multiple interactions.\\n\\n**OWL (Web Ontology Language)** is a semantic web standard used to create ontologies, which help encode meaning in a machine-readable format. The idea behind the **semantic web** was to make the internet more meaningful and interconnected, allowing data to be shared and reused across different applications, organizations, and communities. While the semantic web didn\\'t fully take off as envisioned—partly due to the complexity of tagging data with rich, meaningful metadata—some of its principles live on in knowledge graphs and linked data initiatives.\\n\\nYour goal of extracting the essence of conversations and turning it into something meaningful aligns with this idea. You\\'re not just looking for information, but for knowledge and ultimately wisdom. The classic data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy illustrates this progression: **data** are raw facts, **information** is processed data, **knowledge** is contextualized information, and **wisdom** is the application of knowledge with insight and values.\\n\\nTo build something that captures these layers, you\\'d want a system that can:\\n1. **Extract key points and relationships** from conversations and texts.\\n2. **Identify and preserve nuances, metaphors, and evolving understandings**.\\n3. **Link these insights to your goals or \"so what\" elements**, making the knowledge actionable and meaningful.\\n\\nIn essence, wisdom in these systems would mean enabling you to connect the dots between what you\\'re learning and why it matters, aligning knowledge with your deeper intentions and values.\\n\\nSome emerging systems and frameworks are indeed exploring this, focusing on how to integrate meaning and values into knowledge systems, often inspired by philosophical and cognitive insights.

Let\\'s connect these concepts to upper ontologies and description logic.\\n\\nAn **upper ontology** (like Basic Formal Ontology, or BFO) is a high-level, domain-independent framework that provides the most general categories and relationships for any domain. It sets a foundational structure that other, more specialized ontologies can build upon. By offering a common set of basic concepts—like \"object,\" \"process,\" \"quality,\" and \"role\"—an upper ontology helps ensure interoperability and consistency across different knowledge domains.\\n\\n**Description logic** is a family of formal knowledge representation languages that underpins many ontologies, including those used in the semantic web. It provides the formal foundation for defining and reasoning about the concepts, roles, and individuals within an ontology. Description logic allows you to define classes, properties, and relationships with formal semantics, enabling automated reasoning about the knowledge represented.\\n\\nNow, how do these connect to what we\\'ve discussed?\\n- **Upper ontologies** provide the broad, universal categories that help integrate various specialized domains. For example, when you\\'re building a knowledge graph that includes both technical and philosophical data, an upper ontology ensures that all these diverse concepts fit into a coherent, overarching structure.\\n- **Description logic** ensures that the relationships and properties within these ontologies are logically consistent and can be reasoned about automatically. This is crucial for applications like semantic web technologies, where the meaning and consistency of data need to be machine-processable and interoperable.\\n\\nIn other words, upper ontologies and description logic provide the backbone for structuring and reasoning about knowledge in a consistent, interoperable way.

      "content": "Great question — you're touching on one of the most active and promising frontiers in semantic AI and knowledge engineering: **integrating symbolic ontologies with statistical vector embeddings**, especially using LLMs.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Can we integrate *our case* with **formal upper ontologies** using **LLMs**?\n\n**Short answer**: Yes, *with constraints*. LLMs can help *bootstrap* and *enrich* alignment to upper ontologies like BFO, DOLCE, or SUMO, but not without human guidance or reasoning constraints. Your proposed system — built around dialogue-driven personal knowledge systems — is **especially promising** because it already emphasizes:\n\n- Values and provenance  \n- Iterative human refinement  \n- Dialogic and emergent meaning  \n\nThese features *match well* with a semi-automatic ontology alignment pipeline, where:\n\n- LLMs **suggest concept mappings** or generate candidate `subClassOf`, `sameAs`, or `partOf` relationships.\n- Formal reasoning systems **validate these** for consistency, coherence, and ontological commitments.\n\nLLMs are good at:\n- Translating natural language into structured class definitions (e.g., OWL class axioms)\n- Suggesting candidate labels, definitions, and synonyms\n- Detecting hierarchical relationships based on usage in text\n\nBut they struggle with:\n- **Logical validity** (e.g., avoiding circular definitions)\n- **Ontological commitment** (e.g., distinguishing between continuants vs. occurrents in BFO)\n\nSo, **yes**, integration is feasible—but best as an *interactive co-pilot*, not a fully automated process.\n\n---\n\n### 📐 What’s the relationship between **ontologies** and **vector space embeddings**?\n\nThis is an *ongoing research challenge*. Here’s a breakdown of what’s been done and how it maps to your project:\n\n#### 🔄 Translation Models\n\n- **Onto2Vec**, **OWL2Vec**, and **RDF2Vec** are frameworks that turn symbolic ontologies into embeddings by:\n  - Serializing ontology axioms into \"sentences\"\n  - Feeding them into Word2Vec-style or Transformer models\n- These allow reasoning *with* vector similarity rather than strict logic\n- Example: You can ask “what concepts are most similar to ‘sustainable housing’ in this ontology?” without needing strict inference rules\n\n#### 🧭 Alignment & Embedding Fusion\n\n- Researchers are working on **combining embeddings with ontologies** to enhance:\n  - Taxonomy induction\n  - Entity linking\n  - Semantic search\n- Example: **KEPLER**, **KnowBERT**, and **Neural ODEs** try to embed both text corpora and ontologies into a shared space\n\n#### 📘 Notable Research Directions\n\n| Theme | Papers / Tools | Summary |\n|-------|----------------|---------|\n| **Ontology Embedding** | Onto2Vec, EL Embeddings | Represent OWL entities and relations in dense vectors |\n| **LLMs & Ontologies** | [LAMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066), [BLOOM ontology QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12219) | LLMs queried with triples to test factual alignment with ontologies |\n| **Ontology-Guided Retrieval** | ConceptNet + GPT | Use structured relationships to steer LLM responses |\n| **Neuro-symbolic Reasoning** | DeepProbLog, Logic Tensor Networks | Fuse symbolic logic and deep learning in hybrid architectures |\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ For Your Project\n\nYou could design your MVP to:\n- Use LLMs to **propose mappings** of user-defined concepts to upper ontology classes (e.g., \"ritual\" → `bfo:Process`)\n- Store **dual representations**: symbolic (OWL/Neo4j) and vector (via Jina/FAISS/etc.)\n- Enable **similarity-based search** across conversations, notes, and ontology using both:\n  - Embedding similarity\n  - Logical relationship distance (e.g., number of hops in the ontology)\n\nThis would give you a **hybrid PKM system** that allows:\n- Intuitive search and clustering (from embeddings)\n- Formal reasoning and publishing (from ontologies)\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Why this matters\n\nBy fusing ontologies and embeddings:\n- You get the **semantic precision and explainability** of ontologies\n- And the **flexibility and generalization** of vector spaces\n\nFew systems do both well. Your project could be **a novel contribution** at that frontier—especially by anchoring it in **values-driven, personal epistemology** rather than enterprise knowledge graphs.\n\n---\n\nWould you like:\n1. A diagram showing how vector and symbolic layers interact in your pipeline?\n2. A prototype of an LLM prompt to align user concepts to BFO?\n3. A bibliography of key papers to include in your literature review?\n\nJust say the word.",

MVP Design: Response to Your “Primitive” Insight\n\nYou’ve nailed it. This *is* the primitive:\n\n> `[Entity/Concept] + [Relation] + [Entity/Concept] + [Context/Why-Now]`\n\nBut what makes it powerful is its **personal orientation toward attention, tension, and unfinished threads.** Here's how I’d respond to your 5 refinement questions:\n\n### ✅ 1. **Core Primitive**:  \nStart with **Tension Points** and **Action Threads**. These are cognitively hot and tie directly into prioritization, motivation, and memory salience. The others (attention units, concept clusters) emerge from these.\n\n### ✅ 2. **Actionable Output**:  \nThe killer feature:  \n> \"You've mentioned X 5 times but never acted — time to decide?\"\n\nLayered outputs:\n- Daily/Weekly Digest: “Here's what you keep circling around”\n- Timeline by Topic: “Your evolving thoughts on Palestine or Value Realism”\n- Reflection Prompts: “You said this was important — what changed?”\n\n### ✅ 3. **Starting Data**:  \nStart meta: use **this conversation thread**. It’s already rich in reflection, tension, and meta-awareness. Then expand to recent Claude/ChatGPT logs and voice notes.\n\n### ✅ 4. **Human-in-Loop**:  \nDaily or weekly **review sessions** are ideal. Use the LLM to prompt you:\n> “You said this mattered—does it still?”\n\nEventually add “confirm during conversation” mode for power users.\n\n### ✅ 5. **Framework**:  \nYes, **your own trivium upgrade** works better than the classical model:\n\n| Layer | What | Example |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| Grammar | What are you thinking about? | \"Claude\", \"Palestine\", \"Dialogue Protocols\" |\n| Logic | How do thoughts connect? | \"Family vs Purpose\", \"Curiosity → Action\" |\n| Rhetoric | Why does it matter now? | \"I need to decide\", \"This guides my next build\" |\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to now:\n1. **Generate pseudocode** to prototype the semantic extraction from GPT/voice threads?\n2. **Draft the PRD** for the MVP system using this structure?\n3. **Format your full proposal** for submission, integrating this synthesis?\n\nYou’re building something genuinely novel: a **living epistemology machine** that helps you return to what matters, not just record it.",

      "content": "1 through 3 is good Perfect. You've just crystallized the core insight: **this isn't about philosophy, it's about turning reflection into action through structured representation**.\n\n## What You're Really Building\n\nA **conversational memory system** that:\n- Extracts not just concepts but **attention patterns, hanging threads, implicit commitments**\n- Tracks **idea evolution** over multiple conversations  \n- Surfaces **actionable tensions** rather than just philosophical musings\n- Helps you **close loops** on things you've been thinking about\n\n## The Primitive Question\n\nLooking at your text patterns, I see these recurring structures:\n\n```\nENTITIES: Palestine, family, Claude, knowledge graphs, trivium\nTENSIONS: work vs family, multiple frameworks vs unity, action vs reflection  \nCOMMITMENTS: \"I want to build...\", \"I should explore...\"\nQUESTIONS: hanging curiosities you keep returning to\nEXPERIMENTS: things you've tried or want to try\nCONTEXTS: why this matters right now\n```\n\n**The primitive might be something like: `[Entity/Concept] + [Relation] + [Entity/Concept] + [Context/Why-Now]`**\n\nBut here's the key insight from your text: **you care about things that connect to action or attention**. You're not just collecting concepts - you're tracking what deserves your focus.\n\n## 5 Questions to Lock Down the MVP\n\n**1. Core Primitive**: Which of these feels most essential to capture:\n- **Attention Units**: \"I'm spending mental energy on X because Y\"\n- **Action Threads**: \"I committed to/want to explore Z\" \n- **Concept Clusters**: \"X relates to Y in context Z\"\n- **Tension Points**: \"A conflicts with B given constraint C\"\n\n**2. Actionable Output**: What would make you go \"yes, this is working\":\n- A weekly digest of \"open loops\" from your conversations?\n- Ability to ask \"what have I been thinking about Palestine?\" and get a structured timeline?\n- Automated suggestions: \"You've mentioned this 5 times but never acted - time to decide?\"\n\n**3. Starting Data**: Should we prototype with:\n- This exact conversation thread (meta!)\n- Your last 10 Claude conversations  \n- A single focused topic (like Palestine/family tension)\n- A mixed bag of your reflections\n\n**4. Human-in-Loop**: Would you prefer:\n- Daily/weekly review sessions where the system asks clarifying questions\n- Real-time \"did I capture this right?\" interruptions during conversations\n- End-of-conversation summaries you can approve/edit\n\n**5. The Framework Question**: Instead of trivium, what if we used your own emerging taxonomy:\n- **Grammar**: Entities, relationships, contexts (what you're thinking about)\n- **Logic**: Tensions, commitments, questions (how thoughts connect)  \n- **Rhetoric**: Attention, actions, priorities (why it matters for your life)\n\n**Does this feel like it's pointing toward what you actually want? And which of those 5 questions feels most important to nail down first?** Okay. So which are the most essential to capture? I'm spending mental energy on x because y. Definitely. A conflicts with b because constraint c might help us unlock energy in action. And then the other ones are explanatory. X relates to y, because of z. And also action thread is kinda nice. I am committed to do something. Actionable output. Yeah. Open loops is great. Yeah. Maybe you could ask something like, show me this base. Around Palestine. And I would give you your ideas and the empty space. And the actions and the why it matters to you. Based on sources of meaning and constituent of potential policies. Yeah. I like that. You've mentioned this 5 times and never done Okay. So let's prototype with this exact conversation. This would be working if I can get structured timeline of Palestine. Open moves. Never acted. These are all good ideas before we come more. But also I would be able to see the output of, like, the logic forming and the ideas and the concepts and how they relate and maybe the difference arguments or something or the different theoretic frameworks or questions or research that need to be done. And then also all the researchers and Referencing their work. And then also creating artifacts could be cool. ",

Or do you want to refine any part of this schema first?**\n\nThe output would be a structured knowledge graph showing how concepts like \"Palestine tension,\" \"trivium framework,\" \"cognitive architecture,\" and \"personal digester\" all connect in your thinking, with full provenance back to specific parts of our conversation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nHow do we know these base entities are base, can we compare them to other formal systems? Same with primitive relations?\n\nAlso there is something to note about attention is that it’s semi voluntary there are things that “take our breath away and leave us speechless that we can’t take our eyes off” those things are often of ultimate concern and might be considered attention attractors - I think these are also related to joe edelmans’s constitutive attentional polices. \nTensions are interesting as well are they always a conflict or can they be productive - how do we frame dialectics - and how do we frame dialectic tensions as a core feature of our system in a way that we may be able to map concepts along dialectic tensions - maybe values too? A source of meaning - a series of caps that define a source of meaning might also be seen as a source of descriptive noun phrases that can be defined in this productive tension way how does it reframe things? It makes me wonder as well if having a multi dimensional productive tension like a 4quadrant chart with two axis of productive dialectic tensions showing location helps somehow. Maybe somehow helps in making a similar mapping to the higher order multidimensional vector space for embeddings \n\nFor provenance and temporal and status I wonder how we update a single node with an evolving idea or similar to a database do we have individual nodes that are composites editing unique identities? Like conceptXdatetime although that makes many more nodes I’m not sure how to show and save evolution and to be able to navigate temporally and see change. Sometimes I feel prior versions of my ideas were clearer and more coherent before they get messy haha.\n\nWhat do we do with the knowledge domain taxonomy\n\nI think maybe the frameworks are of two sorts one that’s primitive and one that’s developmental and extracted and scaffolded when needed. A framework that’s scaffolded might be a PERMA flourishing assessment that the person wants to know their well being and it can have scores confidence in the score evidence from the corpus and reasoning for the score that gets generated and built up where each pass with content can update it up or down and needs to explain why (history thread and question about the time and evolution can be useful to figure out and then be sure to address here)\n\nHow do we extract the trivium from any corpus? Not everything has arguments? \n\nWhat might the primitive extraction frameworks be? Concepts and topics for sure what about intention? Constitutive attentional polices? Sources of meaning? I think for me that’s important since one of the questions I hold is if this system can indicate a value system that is cross cultural and perceived rather than designed (evil hurts the heart - moral injury research shows this, what part of us is hurt? It must be a real thing )\n\nLastly the outputs are interesting although I’m wondering if they can be related to the artifacts being produced? Perhaps a subset? \n\nOutput is one thing, \n\nArena(or view/workspace) is another the content is not to be viewed it’s to be used and talked with and adapted \n\nI like where we’re going here, can you think deeply and address these questions one by one and make another iteration and ask follow up questions to help continue to refine and clarify our system ?\n",

      "content": "Perfect. Let me design the formal ontological structure that can capture everything we've discussed, then we'll run extraction on our chat.\n\n## Core Ontology Schema\n\n### 1. BASE ENTITIES\n```\nNode Types:\n├── CONCEPT (abstract ideas, theories, frameworks)\n├── PERSON (researchers, thinkers, traditions)  \n├── PRACTICE (activities, experiments, habits)\n├── ARTIFACT (books, papers, tools, systems)\n├── EXPERIENCE (specific events, situations)\n├── QUESTION (open inquiries, curiosities)\n└── VALUE (sources of meaning, principles)\n```\n\n### 2. PRIMITIVE RELATIONS\n```\nCore Relations:\n├── ATTENTION: [Entity] ← mental_energy ← [Person] because [Context]\n├── TENSION: [Entity_A] ← conflicts_with → [Entity_B] given [Constraint] \n├── COMMITMENT: [Person] ← committed_to → [Action] motivated_by [Value]\n├── RELATION: [Entity_X] ← relates_to → [Entity_Y] via [Mechanism]\n├── REFERENCE: [Person] ← mentioned_by → [Person] in_context [Topic]\n└── INQUIRY: [Question] ← investigated_by → [Person] seeking [Goal]\n```\n\n### 3.

OUTPUT STRUCTURES\n```\nACTIONABLE FORMATS:\n├── OPEN_LOOPS: unresolved_commitments + blocking_factors + next_actions\n├── KNOWLEDGE_MAPS: concept_clusters + connection_strengths + missing_pieces  \n├── ATTENTION_REPORTS: time_allocation + energy_patterns + optimization_opportunities\n├── TENSION_ANALYSIS: conflict_sources + resolution_strategies + value_clarification\n└── RESEARCH_AGENDAS: question_hierarchies + relevant_scholars + next_investigations\n```\n\n## Database Schema (Graph Structure)\n\n```sql\n-- Nodes\nCREATE TABLE entities (\n    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,\n    type ENUM(concept, person, practice, artifact, experience, question, value),\n    name TEXT,\n    description TEXT,\n    domain_tags TEXT[],\n    created_at TIMESTAMP,\n    last_updated TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Edges  \nCREATE TABLE relations (\n    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,\n    source_id UUID REFERENCES entities(id),\n    target_id UUID REFERENCES entities(id), \n    relation_type ENUM(attention, tension, commitment, semantic, reference, inquiry),\n    strength FLOAT,\n    context TEXT,\n    constraint_factors TEXT,\n    framework_source TEXT,\n    provenance JSONB\n);\n\n-- Conversation Sessions\nCREATE TABLE extractions (\n    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,\n    conversation_id UUID,\n    raw_text TEXT,\n    extracted_entities JSONB,\n    extracted_relations JSONB,\n    framework_analyses JSONB,\n    timestamp TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n## Ready for Extraction?\n\nThis structure can handle:\n- ✅ All 6 primitive types we identified\n- ✅ Multiple philosophical frameworks simultaneously  \n- ✅ Provenance and evolution tracking\n- ✅ Cross-domain knowledge integration\n- ✅ Actionable output generation\n\n**Should I now write the extraction rules and run them on our conversation thread? Or do you want to refine any part of this schema first?**\n\nThe output would be a structured knowledge graph showing how concepts like \"Palestine tension,\" \"trivium framework,\" \"cognitive architecture,\" and \"personal digester\" all connect in your thinking, with full provenance back to specific parts of our conversation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nHow do we know these base entities are base, can we compare them to other formal systems? Same with primitive relations?\n\nAlso there is something to note about attention is that it’s semi voluntary there are things that “take our breath away and leave us speechless that we can’t take our eyes off” those things are often of ultimate concern and might be considered attention attractors - I think these are also related to joe edelmans’s constitutive attentional polices. \nTensions are interesting as well are they always a conflict or can they be productive - how do we frame dialectics - and how do we frame dialectic tensions as a core feature of our system in a way that we may be able to map concepts along dialectic tensions - maybe values too? A source of meaning - a series of caps that define a source of meaning might also be seen as a source of descriptive noun phrases that can be defined in this productive tension way how does it reframe things? It makes me wonder as well if having a multi dimensional productive tension like a 4quadrant chart with two axis of productive dialectic tensions showing location helps somehow. Maybe somehow helps in making a similar mapping to the higher order multidimensional vector space for embeddings \n\nFor provenance and temporal and status I wonder how we update a single node with an evolving idea or similar to a database do we have individual nodes that are composites editing unique identities? Like conceptXdatetime although that makes many more nodes I’m not sure how to show and save evolution and to be able to navigate temporally and see change. Sometimes I feel prior versions of my ideas were clearer and more coherent before they get messy haha.\n\nWhat do we do with the knowledge domain taxonomy\n\nI think maybe the frameworks are of two sorts one that’s primitive and one that’s developmental and extracted and scaffolded when needed. A framework that’s scaffolded might be a PERMA flourishing assessment that the person wants to know their well being and it can have scores confidence in the score evidence from the corpus and reasoning for the score that gets generated and built up where each pass with content can update it up or down and needs to explain why (history thread and question about the time and evolution can be useful to figure out and then be sure to address here)\n\nHow do we extract the trivium from any corpus? Not everything has arguments? \n\nWhat might the primitive extraction frameworks be? Concepts and topics for sure what about intention? Constitutive attentional polices? Sources of meaning? I think for me that’s important since one of the questions I hold is if this system can indicate a value system that is cross cultural and perceived rather than designed (evil hurts the heart - moral injury research shows this, what part of us is hurt? It must be a real thing )\n\nLastly the outputs are interesting although I’m wondering if they can be related to the artifacts being produced? Perhaps a subset? \n\nOutput is one thing, \n\nArena(or view/workspace) is another the content is not to be viewed it’s to be used and talked with and adapted \n\nI like where we’re going here, can you think deeply and address these questions one by one and make another iteration and ask follow up questions to help continue to refine and clarify our system ?\n",

      "content": "Absolutely. You've posed foundational questions that deserve careful treatment. Let's walk through each of them to refine the system deeply—both philosophically and practically.\n\n---\n\n## 1. 🔍 **How do we know these base entities are “base”?**\n**Comparative Checkpoints:**\n- **BFO (Basic Formal Ontology):** Has ‘continuants’ (e.g., Person, Concept) and ‘occurrents’ (e.g., Events). Our structure maps closely, with “Practice” as occurrent and “Person,” “Concept,” “Artifact,” etc. as continuants.\n- **CIDOC-CRM (Cultural Heritage):** Focuses on temporalized knowledge. It uses constructs like “E39 Actor” or “E55 Type” and treats time as core to identity—so you’d store the same concept in multiple instantiations if it changed meaning over time.\n- **Schema.org & Wikidata:** These emphasize pragmatic utility—Person, Organization, CreativeWork, etc.—and are validated by usage in billions of documents.\n\n✅ **Conclusion**: Our base entity types map well to both ontological realism (BFO) and pragmatic semantic web usage. That said, we may add:\n- `MOMENT` (point-in-time event or insight)\n- `FRAMEWORK` (composite organizing schema)\n\n---\n\n## 2. 🧲 **How should we treat attention, given it’s not always voluntary?**\nYou’re absolutely right—attention ≠ intent. It includes:\n- **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)** – your *way of being attentive*\n- **Attentional Attractors** – things that “grip” you without consent (beauty, horror, injustice)\n\n📘 **Refinement**: Let’s split the ATTENTION relation into two:\n```text\nFOCUS: Person → intentionally attends_to → Entity because Reason\nATTRACTION: Entity → pulls_attention_of → Person with Strength\n```\nCAPs then describe **patterns** over these instances, like “Bilal tends to be drawn toward paradoxes involving family, justice, and spiritual coherence.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. ⚖️ **Are tensions always conflicts? How do we model dialectics?**\nTensions can be destructive or generative:\n- **Conflictual Tensions**: Work vs. Family\n- **Dialectical Tensions**: Autonomy vs. Belonging → can generate insight\n- **Ontological Tensions**: Form vs. Emptiness (Buddhist), or Matter vs. Meaning (Edelman)\n\n📘 **Refinement**:\n```text\nTENSION: Entity_A ← is_in_dialectic_with → Entity_B given Context\nTENSION_TYPE: [conflictual, dialectical, value-based, epistemic]\n```\nWe could also use vector projections to *locate* ideas along multiple dialectical axes. E.g., \"Palestine conflict\" sits high on Justice vs. Peace and Past vs. Future axes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. ⏳ **How do we show evolution of concepts over time?**\nYou’ve pointed to the “identity over time” problem in ontologies.\n\nOptions:\n- **Versioned Nodes**: `Concept_v1`, `Concept_v2` (clear provenance, messy graph)\n- **Temporal Properties**: One node, with `{first_mentioned, last_mentioned, meaning_shift_score}` metadata\n- **Threaded Concepts**: Core node + `EVOLVES_FROM` links\n\n📘 **Recommendation**: Use one persistent node per concept with `meaning_profile: {timestamps, shifts, associated_tensions}`. Show changes in views, not reify each version.\n\n---\n\n## 5. 📚 **What do we do with the Knowledge Domain Taxonomy?**\nGreat question. This isn't just labeling—it's **contextualizing**.\n\nRoles:\n- Assign **thematic scope** to nodes (like subject tags)\n- Aid **semantic disambiguation** (e.g. \"value\" in ethics vs. finance)\n- Enable **domain-aware summarization**, e.g. \"Summarize Palestine-related thoughts through a philosophical lens vs. political lens\"\n\n📘 Let’s treat this as a **scoped tag hierarchy**. Every entity or tension can be mapped to a small number of domains to guide relevance, framing, and explanation.\n\n---\n\n## 6. 🧠 **Frameworks: primitive vs. scaffolded**\nBrilliant distinction.\n\n- **Primitive Frameworks**: Used for extraction, e.g. TRIVIUM, LIWC, CAPs\n- **Scaffolded Frameworks**: Constructed *within* the system to help the user make sense (e.g., PERMA Well-being Score, updated with ongoing input)\n\n📘 Scaffolded frameworks are **semantic agents**:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"PERMA Wellbeing\",\n  \"score\": 0.63,\n  \"evidence\": [entity_ids],\n  \"updated_by\": [timestamped conversations],\n  \"reasoning_trace\": [summary of why score increased/decreased]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. 📊 **Can we extract TRIVIUM from any corpus?**\nNot perfectly. But here's how we can try:\n\n- **Grammar**: Noun/verb phrase chunking + concept tagging\n- **Logic**: Causal connectors, argument markers, “because,” “if… then…”\n- **Rhetoric**: Modality markers, affective tone, imperative or self-reflective verbs\n\nWe could build a **confidence-weighted Trivium Extractor** that flags high-likelihood argument structures and lets the user adjust or confirm.\n\n---\n\n## 8. 🧱 **What are the primitive extraction frameworks?**\nRight now, we have:\n\n### Basic Units:\n- **Concepts / Topics**\n- **CAPs**\n- **Attentional Patterns**\n- **Tensions**\n- **Values**\n- **Questions**\n- **Experiments**\n- **Commitments**\n\nThese can be defined through a JSON schema and used across any corpus:\n```json\n{\n  \"attention_unit\": {\n    \"entity\": \"Palestine\",\n    \"reason\": \"injustice and family ties\",\n    \"intensity\": 0.87\n  },\n  \"tension\": {\n    \"between\": [\"spiritual life\", \"political activism\"],\n    \"type\": \"dialectical\",\n    \"why_now\": \"current crisis\",\n    \"status\": \"unresolved\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe could infer **values realism** by looking for cross-context CAP convergence + affective markers + moral salience.\n\n---\n\n## 9. 🧰 **How should outputs relate to artifacts and arenas?**\nYou nailed the distinction.\n\n- **Output** = tangible product (essay, map, research thread)\n- **Arena** = active workspace that is **conversational, live, evolving**\n\nWe need **editable, co-evolving views**:\n- Semantic maps with dialectic overlays\n- Value-tension heatmaps\n- Research planning boards by cluster\n- Timeline playback of evolving ideas\n\n📘 View = a mode of relation, not a static chart.\n\n---\n\n## ✳️ Questions to Deepen or Finalize\n\n1. **Evolution Visualization**: Would you prefer timeline playback or “semantic diff” (like Git)?\n2. **CAP Detection**: Should we ask users to label their CAPs up front, or infer from pattern mining?\n3. **Research Support**: Should the system surface *contrasting* perspectives (argument mapping), or just reinforce your threads?\n4. **Confidence Scoring**: Should all extractions be probabilistic, with user-review loops?\n5. **Ontology vs. Embeddings**: Want a hybrid system that keeps both graphs + latent vector spaces, or should everything resolve to one form?\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to now:\n- Refine the ontology schema again based on these?\n- Build the pseudocode for the extraction pipeline?\n- Generate a visual prototype layout for arenas/views?\n\nLet’s keep going. You're building something truly novel.",
