      "content": "Great question—and this is a real-world example of why time zone shifts make fasting while traveling a bit tricky.\n\nHere are your **three main options**, depending on your situation and school of thought (and you can choose the one most in line with your practice and capacity):\n\n---\n\n### **1. Follow France time until you land**\n**Standard opinion**: You fast according to where you are *physically* at the time. So:\n\n- You started fasting in France, and you're still fasting until *you actually land* in Chicago and maghrib enters there.\n- If you land **after** maghrib in Chicago, you'd break your fast on the plane **when the sun sets where you are.**\n\n> **Pro:** This is the safest approach and aligns with the verse “complete the fast until nightfall.”  \n> **Con:** If your flight is long and you chase the sun, your fast might be unusually long (like 20+ hours).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Break your fast if it becomes too difficult**\nIf you're **traveling and fasting becomes a hardship**, it's completely valid to **break your fast and make it up later.**\n\n- This is supported by the Quran: *“Whoever is ill or on a journey, then [they shall fast] an equal number of days later.”* (2:185)\n\n> **Pro:** Prioritizes ease and compassion—especially if you're dehydrated, jet-lagged, or stressed.  \n> **Con:** You’ll need to make up the day later.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Begin following your **destination** time now**\nSome scholars suggest that if you're firmly on your way to your new location, you may begin following the fasting schedule of that place.\n\nSo:\n\n- You **don’t start fasting** until *suhur* in **Chicago** time.\n- That would mean **you can eat now**, since suhur in Chicago hasn't come yet.\n\n> **Pro:** Gives you a normal-length fast.  \n> **Con:** Not all scholars agree with this unless you’re already physically in the destination.\n\n---\n\n### **Practical suggestion:**\n\n- If you're already on the plane or will be soon, and you're feeling up for it: **continue fasting and break at maghrib in your location.**\n- If it becomes hard: **break it and make it up later.**\n- If you're still at home and haven’t boarded yet, and you're leaning toward following Chicago time: **you can eat and restart suhur later**—especially if it’s not burdensome to make it up.\n\n---\n\nWant me to help you decide based on your exact flight time and arrival?",

      "content": "Yes, you're on the right track—and you're asking with the right spirit.\n\n### From the **Maliki** perspective:\n\nThe dominant opinion is:\n\n> **If you're still at your home when Fajr comes in, and you start fasting, you continue fasting until Maghrib—based on where you are.**  \n> Once you travel, you are **allowed** to break your fast **if there's hardship**, but it’s **better to continue if you're able.**\n\nSo in your case:\n\n- **You were still in France at 5:17 AM**, and you started fasting properly.\n- **Now it’s 6:14 AM**, and you’re likely still at home or just about to head to the airport.\n- If you think you **can handle the long fast**, then *yes*, it’s considered **better (afdal)** to fast.\n- But **Malikis also affirm ease**—so **if during your travel it gets hard, you can break your fast, and it’s not sinful at all**.\n\n---\n\n### What you’re doing sounds right:\n- You **started your fast in France**.\n- You’re choosing to **continue it** despite the long duration.\n- That is **commendable and allowed**—and aligns with the verse:\n  \n  > *\"But to fast is better for you, if you only knew.\"* (2:184)\n\nJust stay hydrated before boarding, and don’t hesitate to break your fast if you start feeling unwell or it becomes a hardship while in transit. Islam doesn’t demand harm in the name of virtue.\n\nWant me to calculate what time you should break your fast based on your flight path (i.e. sunset while in the air)?",
