Present  ~= 3.5 years\nStarted as a three months intrentship, but after around a month I became a junior developer\nWork on maintaining and developing an old repo that has a react app written using react class component with no typescript support, it started few years before I join and have passed through few developers over the cors of that period, which made it not consistent and hard to deal with, that was my first big challenge, I had to spend a lot of time refactoring the code each time I want to do a small task to prevent bugs\nThere was few fires that needed to put down when I joined so I had to learn how to do debuggin in an relatively challenging environment so I learned how to be a good debugger.\nThat was on the Front-end side, the Back-end side, there was a repo with an express app connected to a mongoDB hosted on atlas, so I was maintaining and developing that all along\nAfter few months with the help of some very talented mentors and collages I managed to put together a plan to migrate the old Front-end repo to a new repo that we will start using typescript and modern react, and we will pay a close attention to a good set of coding standrens like DRY, KISS, consistency, good variable naming, design patterns, and everything that would help to keep the code as readable and simple as possible.\nWe used to follow a feature-branch-based git flow to mange the collaborating over our repos, we paid good attention to how to make good commits, and how to write short but informatice commit message, we want to have a clear and clean git history by following all the advance techniques that git was providing for us\nI worked on shipping many many features big and small, with the help of my mentors and collages, following an agile methodolyge and implementing a scrum sprints we managed to transform the Bloom platform to a much better version, some of these features are (ritch-text editor, notifications system, real-time updates, taskboard, comments section, assessments manger, a bunch of dashboards, and much more)\nI was also responsible for everything related to devops, we used AWS to deploy or SAAS app, I worked closely with many AWS services like EC2, S3, Cloudformation, Load-balancers, VPCs, Routers, secrets-manger, and much more\nAfter a year or so we integrated discourse into our website, so I worked on hosting discourse using docker and docker-compose on AWS, managing a PostgresQL database for it and SSO login integrated with our platform\nI worked on integrating GraphQL with mongodb atlas so we can use GQL queries from our front-end repo\nI managed to configure a testing enviroumnt from scratch using cypress, and I made a workflow for it using github actions and AWS ESR to be able to always have an updated image for the Back-end repo to be able to pull it with github actions each time we want to run a test in the CI/CD pipeline\nMe amd My collage developed an admin panel from scratch using nextJs and typescript to help Bloom admins mutate some of the platform important stuff, we used next-auth for authentictations, and modern styling libraries like tailwind and chakra-UI, and we are using react-query to mange the web traffic\nWe now have a library of activities that users with specific roles can add to it or edit the content there, and from that library you can add tasks for your team/s directly\nThere are more smaller projects that I worked on such-as some integrations with airtable, some discourse add-ons, etc\nDuring my time with Bloom I have made over 2,540 commit, I added over 450,000 lines, and deleted over 433,000\n\nUnboxed, USA\nSoftware Engineer, Sep 2023 - Present  3 months\nSoftware Development solutions company (B2B & C2B)\nThe company works on building, maintaining, debugging, and developing apps for mobile, web, and different interfaces\nJoined the team as a software engineer\nFirst task is working on a react-native mobile app to help users loggin web3 transactions on the Solana network as the time the transaction happen using webhooks from Helius and push notifications\nThe BE using nextjs serverless functions and postgress as a database, hosted that on vercel because it was cheap\nThe Front-end was the react-native app and I also build a web-page for it\nAs I was starting the app I found that I was writing a lot of boiler-plate code to kickstart things, so I decided to develop a template repo to help with boosting up the time needed when we start a new app\nThe template will have all of our preferred configurations for eslint, prettier, …etc\nThe template will have samples of code that you can copy-paste them when you want to create a new component, endpoint, file, …etc\nOne of the main reasons is I have some abstractions in my code on how to use several libraries, like for example react-table or react-querry, where I will have all the wiring in one file and I expose only a simple function/component that need only few things to get everything working smoothly for a better developer experience\nLastly I worked on shopify app, there was an old app with three very outdated repos to run the app, and I worked on revamping the app\nNow the app uses the latest Remix shopify app template (this is the recommended template by Shopify) \nOn the database side we have Mongodb\nA big part of the app is on the DevOps side, the app uses Shopify webhooks to send events to AWS eventbridge, and the last one takes these events and puts them in a number of SQS queues, depending on some logic, after there is a lambda function for each SQS queue to take the messages and do some logic to them\nAll of that setup is on AWS and it is being managed through Terraform (Infrastructure As Code tool) I put that in the same repo to make it easier to manage\nI highly value clean code principles and whenever I build everything I strive to make it as simple as possible so that when a developer comes after me he will have to spend the smallest effort possible to get onboard\n",
