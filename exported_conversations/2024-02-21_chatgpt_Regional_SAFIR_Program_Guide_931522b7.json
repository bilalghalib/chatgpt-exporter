The SAFIR program\nThe SAFIR Program is a regional initiative dedicated to promoting the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs) and the economic integration of young people in seven North African and Middle \nEastern countries: Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia. The program \nfocuses on activating young people’s civic engagement and supporting projects with a high social, \ncultural and environmental impact.\nSAFIR focuses on supporting over 1,000 young \npeople by facilitating the development of their \ninitiatives. The 45 most promising projects have \nreceived grants and access to an acceleration \nprogram.\nConstructing a network of regional players \nfor support, including 18 higher education \nand research institutions and 7 organizations \nspecialized in innovative entrepreneurship, thus \nboosting their capacity to support young people.\nProviding support to young \nentrepreneurs:\nStrengthening the regional \nsupport network:\nSafir is \nabout: \nThe program aims to create a sustainable dynamic of civic engagement, ensuring long-lasting \nbenefits beyond its initial conclusion.\n8\n7\n9\n10\n1.2. Stakeholders\nEuropean Union and project coordination: The SAFIR program is financed by the European Union \nand coordinated by the Institut Français, which is responsible for distributing the grants. Reporting \nto the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Culture, the Institut Français promotes French \nculture and international cooperation.\nCFI and media support: CFI, the French public operator for media cooperation, provides expertise \nin media development and allocates grants to media projects supported by SAFIR, promoting \ndebate and awareness of the SDGs.\nANND and advocacy: The ANND regional network, made up of civil society organizations from 12 \nArab countries, focuses on strengthening civil society and promoting democracy and sustainable \ndevelopment. ANND leads advocacy activities and raises awareness of the Agenda 2030 among \nSAFIR’s young beneficiaries.\nAUF and academic support: AUF, an association of some 1,000 French-speaking academic \ninstitutions, is in charge of supporting student-entrepreneur projects and developing innovation \nspaces within its university network.\nLab’ess and project incubation: Lab’ess, Tunisia’s first incubator for projects with a social and \nenvironmental impact, provides support for social entrepreneurship and civil society, reinforcing \nthe skills of innovative entrepreneurship support structures (SAEI) as part of SAFIR.\nPitchworthy / Bloom and business acceleration: Pitchworthy / Bloom, a Lebanese gas pedal that \nhas mentored a large number of social enterprises, is working in tandem with Lab’ess to enhance \nthe skills of SAEIs and extend the regional network of these support structures.\n1.3 Quality standard objectives\nThis guide aims to create a quality standard to support the growth of innovative social \nentrepreneurship led by young people in the MENA region. It aims to federate the knowledge and \nskills acquired by the seven innovative entrepreneurship support structures strengthened by the \nSafir program.\nThe best practices listed in this guide reflect the expertise developed within the social \nentrepreneurial ecosystem as part of the SAFIR program. Particular emphasis will be placed on \nanalyzing the specific challenges of supporting social entrepreneurs in the countries concerned, \nwith a focus on :\n• Harmonization of programs: The reference framework aims to unify the approaches and \nmethodologies of incubation and acceleration programs set up by support structures, thus \nfostering greater regional synergy.\n• The importance of  network: The guide will highlight the need for a strong regional network, \nincluding structures and young social entrepreneurs, contributing to a collaborative regional \ndynamic.\n• Capacity building: The collaborative process of developing the guide, with its focus on the \nspecific challenges of social entrepreneurship in the MENA region, will enhance the skills of \nthe various players and the capacity of stakeholders to provide effective support tailored to \nthe needs of social entrepreneurs.\n1.4. Recipients\nThis guide is intended for Structures d’Accompagnement à l’Entrepreneuriat Innovant (innovative \nentrepreneurship support structures) wishing to set up a social entrepreneurship support \nprogram on a regional scale. It is also young social entrepreneurs in the MENA region to hone \ntheir knowledge and expertise based on best practices in the social entrepreneurship ecosystem. \nFinally, it is also aimed, any actor involved in projects combining the achievement of the MDGs and \nsocial entrepreneurship in the MENA region.\nSOCIAL \nENTREPRENEURSHIP \n(SE) ECOSYSTEM IN \nTHE MIDDLE EAST \nAND NORTH AFRICA \nREGION\n12\n11\n13\n14\n2.1. The Social Solidarity Economy (SSE) and Social \nEntrepreneurship (SE)\nWhat is the social economy? What is social entrepreneurship?\nIn the MENA region, the Social Solidarity Economy (SSE) and Social Entrepreneurship (SE) have \nexperienced significant growth over the past decade. These concepts reflect a shift in economic \npractices towards greater consideration of social and environmental issues.\nEssence of ES\nSE, a concept promoted by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, is a form of \nentrepreneurship in which economic efficiency is placed at the service of the general interest. \nSocial enterprises aim to solve social or environmental problems neglected by the state \nand the market, ensuring that profits are reinvested in other social impact initiatives. SE is \ndistinguished by its focus on social innovation, and does not necessarily require participative \ngovernance, unlike SSE.\nDiverse approaches in the MENA region\nAddressing SSE and SE in the MENA region presents \nchallenges due to varying interpretations in different cultural \ncontexts. In the English-speaking countries of the region, \nthe term «social entrepreneurship» is often preferred, and \ncorresponds to a different reality from that of SSE.\nLegal frameworks and national examples\nApart from Tunisia, where a specific legal framework for \nsocial enterprises has been established, the countries of \nthe MENA region have no dedicated legislation. Social \nentrepreneurs use a variety of existing legal statuses to \noperate. Morocco, for example, in its 2010-2020 national \nstrategy for SSE, defines the sector as a set of economic \ninitiatives that aspire to production, consumption and \nsavings that are respectful of individuals, the environment \nand local communities.\nSocial entrepreneurship and the social/\nsolidarity-based economy offer a new \nvision of society that does not separate \neconomic activity from the active \nparticipation of citizens in society.\nSocial and Solidarity Economy business sectors\nIn the MENA region, the Social Solidarity Economy (SSE) and Social Entrepreneurship (SE) are \nemerging fields. The absence of established definitions and formal recognition makes it difficult \nto accurately quantify SSE in terms of size and sectoral diversity, in an environment where its \ncontribution to local economies remains limited.\nThe SSE is mainly structured around three legal forms: cooperatives, mutuals and associations. \nEach tends to focus on specific sectors. For example, data from Morocco shows:\n• Cooperatives: 12,022 registered, with a 66.4% predominance in the agricultural sector.\n• Mutuals: 50 entities, mainly in insurance and health.\n• Associations: Around 90,000, with 22% working in local development and another 22% in \nthe cultural sector.\nSocial entrepreneurship covers a wide range of sectors that can be grouped into two broad \ncategories, often including social enterprises in the field of new technologies. \nLimited profitability: the project is \nnot an end in itself, but a means to \nserve the social goal/object .\nA social or \nenvironmental \npurpose \nSSE principles\nThe SSE includes organizations that pursue social or environmental \nobjectives, but are also aligned with specific values. These organizations \nadopt a variety of legal forms, including associations, cooperatives, mutual \nsocieties and social enterprises.\nAn economically \nviable project\nDemocratic, participatory \ngovernance\nSSE represents:\nEgypt:\n- 7.7% of GDP\n- 0.6% of the working population\nTunisia:\n1% of GDP\n4% of working population\nMorocco:\n2% of GDP\n3% of working population\nSource: «Social and solidarity-based economy: a \nvector for inclusiveness and job creation in the \nMediterranean partner countries» (European \nInvestment Bank - FEMISE, 2014).\n16\nENVIRONEMENT\nSOCIAL\n• Renewable energies\n• Sustainable housing\n• Recycling\n• Waste and water management\n• Agriculture\n• Education \n• Health and social services \n• Culture and heritage \n• Finance and microfinance \nAgritech\nEnvironment and social impact\nSocial enterprise sector in Tunisia: \nArts and crafts\nLeisure and tourism\nEducation\nHealth & care\nTransport\nEmergence of the SSE in the region \nSSE and SE have been developing in the MENA region since the 1980s, expanding rapidly over the \nlast ten years. Today, they are recognized as levers for sustainable development, job creation and \nthe revitalization of local economies.\nIn Algeria, the Touiza, a traditional system of \nmutual aid and cooperation, enables people to \nlend occasional assistance to a member of the \ncommunity.\noccasional assistance to a member of the \ncommunity.\nA long tradition of mutual aid and \nsolidarity based on community or religious \nprinciples, providing fertile ground for the \ndevelopment of the social and solidarity \neconomy.\nToday: the rise of the SSE is strongly \nsupported by international cooperation \norganizations.\nThe 80s and 90s: the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund imposed structural \nadjustment plans on Arab countries, leading to \nthe disengagement of the state in certain sectors, \nbut encouraging the emergence of initiatives to \nmake up for this disengagement.\n( Ahmed-Zaid et al., 2013). \nIn Tunisia, the cradle of the Arab \nrevolutions, the number of associations \nrose from 9,500 in 2010 to 14,000 in 2012.\nThe Arab Spring (2011): Through these \nrevolutions, \npopulations \ndenounce \nthe strong social inequalities and their \nexpectations of rapid change. Thanks to \nthe liberalization of power, the number of \ninitiatives will explode.\n3%\n13%\n13%\n17%\n18%\n18%\n18%\n2.2. The entrepreneurial ecosystem in which the Safir \nprogram was implemented \nThe socio-economic and political context of the MENA region\n• Predominantly young : With 65% of its population under the age of 30, the region has \nsignificant potential for growth and economic dynamism.\n• High unemployment rates: Youth unemployment is a particular concern in the MENA \nregion, with a rate twice as high as the global average in 2019. Countries such as Tunisia and \nPalestine are experiencing alarming rates.\n• Disparities between men and women: Women’s activity rate is significantly lower than \nmen’s, revealing gender inequalities in the labor market.\n• Education-Employment Disparity: Young graduates are more affected by unemployment \nthan non-graduates, partly due to an imbalance between available jobs and levels of \neducation.\n• Predominantly public sector: With the exception of Lebanon, thehe public sector \npredominates over the private sector, which limits employment opportunities, especially in \nEgypt, Tunisia and Jordan.\nThis socio-economic framework has several implications:\n• Employment and training imbalances: A large proportion of young workers are employed \nin jobs that do not correspond to their level of education.\n• Substantial informal sector: The informal sector accounts for a significant share of the \nregion’s GDP and employment.\n• Emigration and brain drain: An increasing number of young people are leaving the region \nin search of better prospects, undermining the potential for economic and entrepreneurial \ndevelopment.\n• Political and social instability: Economic tensions contributed to the Arab Spring \nuprisings and can lead to radicalization among young people faced with unemployment \nand lack of prospects.\n15\nSource : Chiffres de 2022 issus de Entrepreneurs of Tunisia.\n17\n18\nIn this context, SSE and SE appear to be promising solutions for the economic integration of \nyoung people. Conversely, educated youth could be the driving force behind the emergence and \ndevelopment of social entrepreneurship in the region.\nA young and population motivated for Entrepreneurship\nThe MENA region has one of the highest percentages of future \nentrepreneurs in the world.\nEntrepreneurship is viewed positively by the population. According \nto a survey of Arab youth, 83.2% of young people in the MENA \nregion believe that «starting a business is considered a good career \nchoice». This compares with 70.9% in developing countries and \n62.2% in Europe.\nThe Algerian exception Algeria is perhaps the exception in the region, \nsince the social and solidarity economy was developed from above, \nby the State. In the 90s and 2000s, the State, through the creation of \nthe Social Development Agency, developed the solidarity economy in \nresponse to the problems of precariousness and poverty. The state thus \nplays an important role in supervising and supporting social and solidarity \neconomy initiatives, which can hinder the emergence of a fully-fledged \nSSE sector (Ahmed-Zaïd et al., 2013).\nPanorama of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the MENA region\nThe role of the public sector\nIn the MENA region, public sector involvement in SSE development differs from country to \ncountry, but all have recognized the contribution of SSE to achieving sustainable development. \nHere are a few examples:\n• Tunisia is the country that has taken \nthis recognition the furthest, passing a \nlaw in 2020 to create an SSE label for \nsocial enterprises. This recognition is \naccompanied by a number of measures \ndesigned to provide a regulatory and \nfiscal framework adapted to social \nenterprises. However, three years after \nits adoption, the implementing decrees \nare still pending. \nThe law of June 30, 2022 on the social and \nsolidarity economy has made it possible to :\n• Define the criteria for labeling a social economy \ncompany.\n• Created three institutions for the governance \nand development of the SSE\n• Create adapted financing mechanisms, a \npercentage of public orders, and tax and \nfinancial incentives.\nMorocco is also one of the countries most involved in the social economy:  \n• 2005: adoption of the National Initiative for Human Development strategy to strengthen SSE \ninitiatives.  \n• 2010: adoption of a National Strategy for the Social Solidarity Economy. Through this strategy, \nseveral legal frameworks were revised, notably those on cooperatives and fair trade. By 2030, \nMorocco aims to have the SSE contribute 7.4% of GDP, and has adopted a framework law on the \nsocial and solidarity economy. \nIn Lebanon, the government has introduced a scheme to encourage banks to support the SSE, \nCircular 331, which guarantees banks a 75% refund in the event of failure by the start-up to \nrepay the loan.\nSince 2011, the Orange Foundation has organized \nthe Orange Prize for Social Entrepreneurship \nin Africa and the Middle East. Orange Group \nsubsidiaries in the countries concerned select and \nelect three innovative projects, which will then \ncompete before an international jury. The finalists \nreceive personalized support and financing.\nThe aim of the prize is to identify young \ntechnology start-ups with a positive impact. In \naddition to the prize, the competition provides \nan opportunity for visibility and networking for \nimpact entrepreneurs.\nThe role of the private sector\n• Private investors: Western investors \nare increasingly interested in Arab \nstartups, stimulating the creation of \nprivate incubators and gas pedals such as \nFlat6Labs, a key venture capital player in \nthe MENA region.\n• Action by private companies, CSRs and \nfoundations: they directly support social \nentrepreneurs or entrepreneurial support \nstructures.\nOne notable example is the OCP Group \nin Morocco, which through its OCP \nEntrepreneurship Network foundation, \nfinances and provides technical support \nfor innovative social entrepreneurship \nprojects.\nThese private-sector initiatives are fundamental to the sustainable development of the SSE, providing \nfinancial resources and essential support for entrepreneurial initiatives with a social impact in the \nregion.\nThe private sector is making a significant contribution to the development of the Social Solidarity \nEconomy (SSE) in the MENA region, notably through :\nORANGE PRIZE FOR SOCIAL \nENTREPRENEURSHIP\nTUNISIAN SSE LAW, A \nBREAKTHROUGH IN THE REGION\n19\n20\nFinancing mechanisms\nThese financial mechanisms reflect the diversity of support available to the SSE. However, \nregulatory constraints and the prioritization of certain sectors make access to financing a real \nchallenge. \nPublic funds: Although there are not always funds exclusively earmarked for this sector, public \nauthorities in the MENA region are involved in providing financial support for SSE initiatives.\n• Morocco: The Moazara program, supported by the relevant ministry, awards grants to \ncooperatives and other SSE entities.\n• Egypt: The Social Fund for Development, set up with the help of the UNDP, finances \nsustainable development programs through micro-credits.\nGrants: Social entrepreneurs have access to grants through civil society support programs, often \nfunded by international donors or private foundations.\nImpact investment funds: These target specific sectors, especially those with a strong technological \ncomponent.\n• Lebanon: Insure & Match Capital, with American support, supports entrepreneurs in \nvarious sectors.\n• Egypt: Egypt Ventures Acumem invests in innovative, job-creating startups.\nSolidarity finance: This is an option for social entrepreneurs, but remains limited in the region, \nwith the notable exception of microcredit agencies that mainly support micro-entrepreneurship.\nCrowdfunding: Participatory financing platforms exist, but in the absence of a legal framework, \nentrepreneurs use foreign-based platforms. \nMorocco: Smala & Co, a crowdfunding platform for impact projects, initially set up in France \nbefore returning to Morocco following the enactment of law 15-18 regulating crowdfunding.\nAvailability of expertise\nThe number of these support structures has grown considerably, offering a variety of programs \nincluding training, mentoring, networking, and sometimes financing. The latter are often free of \ncharge, supported by international or national donors.\nFlat6Labs supports innovative entrepreneurs in the \nregion through coaching and start-up financing. It is \npresent in Lebanon, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan.\nIncubators and gas pedals\nThe number of these support structures has grown considerably, offering a variety of programs \nincluding training, mentoring, networking, and sometimes financing. The latter are often free of \ncharge, supported by international or national donors.\nFounded in 1980 in India, Ashoka aims to identify and \nsupport innovative social entrepreneurs who want to \ninitiate social change.\nSince 2003, the Ashoka Arab World platform has \nbrought together 12 countries in the region.\nContractor networks\nVarious networks facilitate exchanges, access to events and mentoring. In Palestine, for example, \ninformal online networks invite entrepreneurs to share experience and know-how.\nStudent Entrepreneur Clubs\nInitiatives such as Enactus foster an entrepreneurial spirit among young people, encouraging them \nto innovate for a sustainable future. This network is active in several MENA countries.\nThe role of universities\nThe region’s universities are showing a growing interest in entrepreneurship, with the creation of \non-campus incubators and the integration of entrepreneurship modules into their curricula.\nFLAT6LABS, THE MOST ESTABLISHED \nACCELERATOR IN THE MENA REGION.\nASHOKA, THE LEADING NETWORK OF \nINNOVATIVE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS.\n21\n22\nChallenges and obstacles to SSE development\n• Lack of a unified definition: SSE and Social Entrepreneurship (SE) are concepts that vary \naccording to the interpretation of different players, which hinders the structuring of a coherent \nsector. The diversity of entities included under the SSE umbrella - from small producers to startups \n- contributes to this confusion.\n• Lack of a specific regulatory framework: Faced with an unclear legal framework, SSE entities are \nforced to register under forms that do not always correspond to their business model. \n• Difficulty accessing financing: Access to bank and private financing is limited for SSE enterprises, \nwhich are perceived as risky, especially for young entrepreneurs. International funding is often \nsector-specific and dispersed through calls for projects, which can lead to a concentration of \nfunds in areas favored by international donors.\n• Multiplicity of players: While the number of players involved in the SSE has increased over \nthe past 10 years, a lack of coordination hinders effective support. Public initiatives lack cross-\nsectoral coherence, creating additional obstacles for social entrepreneurs seeking to navigate this \necosystem.\n2.3. Social entrepreneurship and the Safir program\nContribution to the Sustainable Development Goals\nSocial entrepreneurship is essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as it \ntackles:\n• Global social,\n• Economic and environmental issues, \n• Fostering development that is both sustainable and inclusive. \nAlthough specifically linked to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), social entrepreneurship \ncan play a key role in progress towards all the SDGs.\nThe SAFIR program aims to raise young people’s awareness of action and \nempower them to be agents of change.\nThe entrepreneurial projects supported by the SAEl responded to one or \nmore of the SDGs.\nSAEl facilitated local workshops for young people in the region to raise \nawareness of the and social entrepreneurship.\nSupporting young entrepreneurs\nSocial entrepreneurship is recognized as a lever for boosting MENA economies and tackling youth \nunemployment. The region’s governments and international organizations are encouraging youth \nentrepreneurship as a means of preventing social instability and fostering inclusive development.\n• In Morocco and Tunisia: The introduction in 2019 of a status for student entrepreneurs offers \ntraining and support services, as well as recognition of entrepreneurial projects for university \ncredits.\n• In Jordan: Nearly 73% of support structures offer programs exclusively dedicated to young social \nentrepreneurs.\n• In Lebanon and Palestine: Incubators, in partnership with UNDP and the Big Heart Foundation, \nare setting up specific incubation programs for young social entrepreneurs, to develop ecosystems \nconducive to youth-led impact businesses.\n• Universities in the MENA region: They are integrating entrepreneurship into their business \nand economics curricula, and creating more university incubators, such as UCASTI within Gaza’s \nCollege of Applied Sciences.\n• There are also specific programs designed to inculcate an entrepreneurial culture from an early \nage.\nIn Morocco, the NGO INJAZ Al-Maghrib offers an entrepreneurship training program for all ages, \nfrom primary school to university.\nSAFIR AND THE ODDS\nPromoting female entrepreneurship \nIn the MENA region, women's entrepreneurial activity is less widespread than men's, with 8% of \nwomen versus 13% of men involved in entrepreneurship. This gap is attributable to persistent cultural \nbarriers and social norms. A study by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization \nreveals that a significant proportion of women in Egypt (20%) and Lebanon (40%) perceive their \nenvironment as discriminatory, despite the absence of legislation explicitly discriminating against \nwomen entrepreneurs.\nInitiatives are therefore being implemented to reduce gender inequalities, encourage women to \nbecome entrepreneurs and fully exploit their economic potential in the MENA region:\n• Jordan: The government has drawn up a national plan for women's economic empowerment.\n• Morocco: Various government agencies, such as those promoting SMEs and social development, \nsupport women's entrepreneurship through training and funding.\nThere are also programs specifically designed to support women entrepreneurs:\n• In Tunisia: The ESSentielles program by Lab'ess.\n• In Morocco: Bidaya's Women Greepreneur program.\n• In Jordan: The Women in tech program by Oasis 500.\nSAFIR and Female Entrepreneurship\nThe Safir program pays particular attention to gender issues.\n- A quota for the number of projects carried out by women and a selection bonus for \nwomen entrepreneurs.\n- Projects integrating the socio-economic empowerment of women are taken into account.\n- Sensitization of SAEI to the barriers faced by women entrepreneurs.\nSafir and social entrepreneurship outside capital cities\nThe Safir program has placed particular emphasis on supporting \nentrepreneurial projects in the regions, in order to reach all young \npeople beyond the big cities:\n- Taking into account project leaders from areas outside the capital and \npaying particular attention to projects working to reduce territorial \ninequalities.\n- Set up mechanisms to facilitate access to support (online training and \ntravel subsidies).\nLocal online workshops to reach young people in the regions.\n- Collaboration between SAEl and regional universities.\n91 PROJECTS INCUBATED, INCLUDING 31 \nBY STUDENTS OR RECENT GRADUATES.\n65 OF 91 INCUBATED PROJECTS BASED IN \nTHE REGIONS (OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL)\nDeveloping social entrepreneurship outside capital cities \nThe development of entrepreneurship in the MENA region is unevenly distributed, with capitals \nand large cities benefiting from better access to information, expertise and financing than rural \nareas. \nAt the initiative of governments and civil society, programs are designed to overcome infrastructure \nand service deficits in rural areas, thus supporting the growth of inclusive and diversified social \nentrepreneurship throughout the MENA region:\n• In Jordan: The Hashemite Fund for Human Development aims to promote social entrepreneurship \nand economic development in rural and disadvantaged areas.\n• Lebanon: Berytech has launched a program to stimulate the rural and agricultural economy, \nsupporting farming businesses and rural tourism. A social impact fund has also been set up to \ninvest in social enterprises aimed at rural development by improving access to healthcare and \neducation outside urban areas.\nSAFIR and youth entrepreneurship\nSafir is aimed exclusively at young entrepreneurs between \nthe ages of 20 and 30.\nThrough the creation of a regional youth network, Safir \nenables young entrepreneurs to meet, exchange ideas and \nstrengthen their sense of active citizenship.\n91 PROJECTS INCUBATED, INCLUDING 31 \nBY STUDENTS OR RECENT GRADUATES.\n23\n24\nPROFESSIONALIZATION \nOF INNOVATIVE \nENTREPRENEURSHIP \nSUPPORT STRUCTURES\n26\n25\nThe Asher Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ACIE), was established in 2017, with a \nmission to support Lebanese individuals and young people:\n• to define their innovative ideas, \n• make connections with like-minded people,\n• and acquire the knowledge and skills needed to set up a business. \nLocated on the main campus of the Université Saint-Esprit de Kaslik (USEK), ACIE :\n• provides assistance to startups and entrepreneurs in various sectors and at different stages \nof their development. \n• creates a network with local communities throughout the country, thanks to its collaboration \nwith USEK’s three regional centers (Chekka, Rmeich, Zahlé) and the Faculty of Medicine \nand Medical Sciences in Byblos, \n• acts to foster an entrepreneurial spirit among young people through a variety of business \nand skills workshops, conferences, informal discussions and hackathons. \nIts main objective is to promote impactful initiatives in Lebanon through ideation processes, \nvalidation sprints, incubation and acceleration programs. \nACIE-USEK, Lebanon\n3.1. The various support structures and their service \nofferings\nThe Safir regional network brings together seven innovative entrepreneurship support structures in \nthe Middle East and North Africa. Selected on the basis of a call for applications, these structures \nare each located in a different country: Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Morocco and \nTunisia. They offer invaluable support to entrepreneurs and startups, providing them with the tools \nand resources they need to develop their ideas and businesses, while reinforcing the diversity and \ngeographical reach of the network. \n28\n27\nThe Algerian Center for Social Entrepreneurship (ACSE) was created in 2013 with the aim of \npromoting social entrepreneurship, federating, supporting and accompanying Algerian social \nentrepreneurs in the creation, development and sustainability of their businesses. Driven by ancestral \nAlgerian values of solidarity and empathy, and aware of the socio-economic challenges facing Algeria \ntoday, the center works to support innovative solutions to the country’s social and environmental \nproblems. The ACSE team believes in an Algeria in which citizens work together to find solutions to \nthe difficulties that affect them, while preserving the resources they use.\nTo this end, ACSE has launched Algeria’s first social business incubator, enabling young social \nentrepreneurs to make a positive impact on their country by bringing their impact projects to life.\nACSE, Algeria\nAl Badil is an association that works to structure the Tunisian cultural sector and weave links \nbetween citizen and creative initiatives across the country. Its aim is to contribute as much as \npossible to the democratization of art and culture, because, as its teams are convinced, «[...] more \nknowledge, more understanding, more ambition and more widely shared inventions are essential \nto progress».]\nThe association’s activities fall into four main categories:\n- Incubating cultural projects\n- Distribution of artistic creations\n- Capacity-building for artists and cultural managers\n- Cultural project engineering\nOver the years, Al Badil has developed a business supporting young people’s cultural and artistic \nprojects, which has gradually evolved into project incubation. Its expertise in cultural project \nengineering enables it to offer innovative cultural formats and to provide the best possible support \nfor new players in the cultural and creative economy. \nAl Badil, Tunisia\n30\n29\nICEALEX is a leading platform for sector incubation and community innovation, focused on social \nand environmental values.

Support structures for innovative entrepreneurship\nSkills diagnosis: tools and methodology\nIn order to plan a regional approach to sharing best practices, and to draw up a \nsolid skills enhancement plan, it is essential to put in place a homogeneous and \nduplicable diagnostic model, which can also benefit other stakeholders such as \nyoung entrepreneurs.\nACAT (Accelerators Capacity Assessment Tool):\nDiagnostic tool for support structures\nACAT (Accelerators Capacity Assessment Tool) is a diagnostic tool adapted by Safir consortium \npartner Bloom. It is based on the OCAT (Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool) developed \nby McKenzie. This tool enables support structures to identify their blind spots, offering them a \n360-degree perspective of their current situation. It also guides them in selecting the most relevant \nareas for organizational development.\nACAT is composed of 66 questions divided into 12 categories:\nEach question gives rise to four evaluation levels weighted from 1 to 4 (4 being the most advanced \nskill). This quantification makes it possible to obtain a numerical assessment for each structure \nevaluated according to categories and sub-categories.\nSafety, risk and \nresilience\nStrategy\nLearning and \ninnovation\nCommunication and \ncommunity outreach\nAdvocacy\nMonitoring and impact \nmeasurement\nProgram and project \nmanagement\nOrganizational \ninfrastructure\nLeadership, teams and \nvolunteers\nIncome generation\nFinancial management\nLegal support\nDiagnostic approach \nOnline \ndiagnosis\nSAEI\nself-diagnosis\nConsolidation of \nresults\nObjective\nConstruction of a\ncapacity-building plan\nThe diagnosis of the organizational capacities of intermediary structures takes place in four distinct \nstages, with an approach developed by Bloom to ensure the success of these diagnoses:\n1. Third-party diagnosis: This stage involves several sessions of up to 2 hours with predefined \nthemes. The approach is informal to encourage trust and information sharing.\n2. Self-diagnosis by SAEI members: To improve reliability, reduce subjectivity, and involve SAEI \nmembers, a self-diagnosis step is introduced. SAEI members complete the same set of questions \nasked during the initial diagnosis, using the Bloom platform to automate the process.\n3. Data consolidation, analysis and interpretation: This stage involves in-depth analysis of the \ndata collected during the diagnostic and self-diagnostic sessions. Relevant information is grouped \nand synthesized to provide an in-depth understanding of the situation. The data is then critically \ninterpreted to formulate a comprehensive diagnosis, highlighting strengths, weaknesses and \nspecific needs.\n4. Formulation of diagnostic results and construction of the capacity-building plan: Once the \ndiagnostic results have been obtained, they are analyzed to identify the areas requiring capacity-\nbuilding. Based on these results, a solid capacity-building plan is drawn up, defining the specific \nactions, objectives and resources required to improve the skills and performance of the parties \nconcerned.\nSeveral points need to be taken into account to ensure effective diagnostics. These include :\n• Informal communication and building trust.\n• Maintaining energy and commitment throughout the process.\n• Involvement of key stakeholders.\n• Maintaining spontaneous, informal discussion to encourage open, unrestricted exchange, \nincluding oral questions without prior access.\n• Ethical considerations, including data confidentiality, informed consent and consideration \nof stakeholders’ values and rights.\n37\n38\n3.3. Supporting project developers\nIncubation and Acceleration\nWith the aim of achieving a common understanding of the concepts of incubation and acceleration \nwithin the Middle East and North Africa ecosystem, it is essential to harmonize practices and facilitate \ncollaboration between the key players in the ecosystem: incubators, gas pedals and entrepreneurship \nexperts.\nTo achieve this goal, in-depth discussions brought together these stakeholders, clarifying the nuances \nand varied approaches in the region to startup incubation and acceleration.\nBy working together, the players have defined common visions and shared definitions for these \nconcepts, laying the foundations for harmonizing practices and processes. This facilitates collaboration \nand strengthens the Middle East and North Africa ecosystem, with a common understanding for \nentrepreneurs, investors and supporting institutions.\nProviding entrepreneurs with the \nknow-how, material resources and \nnetworking to help them launch \ntheir businesses effectively.\nINCUBATION\nValue \nproposition\nStrategic \nobjectives\nStartup \nmilestones \nTimeline\nACCELERATION\nHelping new entrepreneurs turn \ntheir start-up ideas into a successful, \nself-sufficient business.\n1 to 5 years\n3 to 6 months\nStage 1: Ideation phase\nYou want to get started and are \nlooking for/testing new ideas.\nStage 2: Initial development phase \nExplore ideas, conduct market/\ncustomer research to start developing \nideas...\nStage 3: Prototype phase\nMove from a preliminary prototype \n(low-fidelity/paper-based) \nto \na \nworking prototype (high-fidelity) with \nearly adopters.\nEnable early-stage startups to grow \nrapidly (multiplying their traction by \nat least 2 times) by offering years of \nlearning in a short space of time.\nAccelerate the start-up’s growth and \nsales.\nStage 4: Growth phase\nThis stage marks the development \nand expansion of the startup’s \nbusiness, with a focus on customer \nacquisition, revenue growth and \nmarket expansion.\nStage 5: Maturity phase\nOnce the start-up has established \nits business model and achieved a \ncertain level of success, it enters \na maturity phase where it seeks \nto consolidate its market position \nand ensure continued, sustainable \ngrowth.\nECAT (Enterprise Capacity Assessment Tool)\nDiagnostic tool for startups \nBased on the ACAT tool described above, the ECAT is an adaptation of the latter, enabling an \nassessment adapted to both established companies and start-ups.\nThe ECAT consists of 68 questions divided into 9 categories:\nStrategy\nLearning and \ninnovation\nCommunication and \ncommunity outreach\nInfrastructure, risk, safety and \nresilience\nCorporate social \nresponsibility\nLeadership, teams and \nvolunteers\nProducts and \nservices\nRevenue generation, financial \nmanagement and sustainability\nLegal support\nEach question is rated on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 representing the highest level of competence.

Outlook: regional mobility and collaboration for \ndevelopment\nThe Safir program has boosted social entrepreneurship in the MENA region, with the creation of a \nregional network linking incubators and entrepreneurship players in seven countries. \nThis network connects young entrepreneurs with resources, mentors and opportunities, supporting \ntheir development at every stage. Regional collaboration is strengthened by shared events \nwhere incubators exchange know-how and experience, contributing to the sustainability of the \nentrepreneurial ecosystem.\nThe Safir ecosystem has identified three major collaborative opportunities for the development of \nsocial entrepreneurship in the region:\na. Regional Collaboration Platform: Catalyzing Development through Synergy\nIt fosters synergy between partners to develop joint projects, with a focus on mapping data \nflows and identifying synergies. The beneficiaries targeted by this initiative include the regional \necosystem as a whole, highlighting the importance of a collective commitment to overcoming the \ncomplex challenges of our time. \nThe platform’s model activities are structured around three crucial stages. \n-  Map data flows, creating a solid basis for a shared understanding of challenges and opportunities. \nIn parallel, a glossary of specific terms will be developed, ensuring that communications remain \ntransparent and unified. Annual reports, as well as periodic improvement reports, will be produced \nfor all ecosystem partners, creating a culture of accountability and continuous progress.\n- Identify synergies by exploring convergences and complementarities between different \nstakeholders. The aim is to create strategic alliances that amplify individual efforts for a more \npowerful collective impact.\n- Implement: Partners will actively collaborate to develop and implement projects, initiatives \nand actions that address the challenges identified. The platform will provide the necessary \ncommunication channels, from web pages and social networks to an email database and a dedicated \ncollaboration form.\nThe evaluation strategy adopted translates into a «flow chart», measuring the rate of volumetric \nchange resulting from the implementation of synergies. This will make it possible to quantify results \nand monitor progress, while adjusting approaches in line with feedback.\nIn short, this regional platform embodies the fusion of regional mobility and targeted collaboration, \nproviding a space to catalyze innovative and sustainable solutions. \nb. Cultivating the Entrepreneurial Spirit in Rural Communities: An Opportunity \nfor Collaboration\nThis collaboration aims to promote entrepreneurship among young people, especially in rural \nareas, by providing them with the tools and resources they need to innovate. Primarily targeting \nyoung people under 18 and those under 35, the initiative aims to instill an entrepreneurial spirit \nfrom an early age.\nTo this end, a dedicated platform will serve as a central hub linking partners: universities, schools, \nNGOs and Safir, to carry out activities such as:\n- Enriching workshops ,interactive workshops organized in schools to encourage young people to \nembrace the entrepreneurial spirit. They will impart practical knowledge, and also raise awareness \nof the real challenges faced by entrepreneurs. \n- Sharing experiences: inspiring stories of success and failure in the world of entrepreneurship will \nhelp young people identify with and draw inspiration from the journeys of other entrepreneurs.\n- Research and academic collaboration: dedicated laboratories will be created to encourage \ncreativity and the search for new ideas.\nThe initiative will be promoted primarily via social media, and partners will ensure effective \ncoordination. Impact will be measured by monitoring participation and evaluating learning. The aim \nis to build an innovation ecosystem in rural areas and inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs.\nc.Awaken the Leader in You: An Empowerment Program for the MENA Region\nIn a fast-changing region like the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), it’s crucial to nurture \na generation of dynamic, innovative young leaders. The «Be Your Own Role Model» program is \nemerging as a beacon of opportunity for teenagers aged 12 to 19, as well as young adults aged \n20 to 26. This ambitious initiative aims to develop leadership among young people in the MENA \nregion, particularly in rural areas, regardless of gender or ability.\n- Teen Model: Nurturing the Creative Spirit:\n For teenagers, this 4-month program focuses on exploration, reflection and problem-solving. \nEach week, for two hours, beneficiaries take part in educational visits to the public sector \nand creative projects. They learn about the inner workings of organizations and gain a deeper \nunderstanding of the workings of society.\n- Young Adult Model: Becoming Leaders of Change\nYoung adults take part in a 6-month program, a blend of personal development, social \nentrepreneurship and conceptual thinking. They benefit from hands-on training, adventure \nactivities and mentoring by seasoned entrepreneurs. For six hours a week, they receive shadow \ntraining from experienced social entrepreneurs. They are introduced to the art of conceptual \nthinking through workshops, bootcamps, roundtables and targeted discussion groups.\nThe program includes rigorous evaluation to measure long-term impact, and maintains ongoing \nengagement with participants to support their development as leaders.\n57\n58\n4.2. Community outreach strategy \nSocial entrepreneurship, a driver of positive change, requires much more than a solid vision and \ninnovative solutions to succeed in solving societal challenges. Communication plays a central \nrole in catalyzing change, facilitating collaboration and propelling innovative ideas towards \nrealization. Carefully crafted communication strategies are therefore essential to connect key \nplayers, promote dialogue, foster innovative ideas and maximize social impact. This strategy \nis built around several axes, each of which plays a specific role in building and maintaining a \nsolid network, propagating innovative ideas and encouraging collaboration within social \nentrepreneurship.\nNetworking Events: These are invaluable opportunities for social entrepreneurs, investors, \nexperts and advocates to meet, share ideas and forge links. These informal gatherings transcend \norganizational barriers, creating a space for unexpected collaborations and fruitful partnerships. \nBy bringing together passionate and dedicated minds, these events fuel a collective synergy that \nstimulates creativity, encourages knowledge sharing and strengthens the social entrepreneurship \ncommunity.\nExpert debates: These are the intellectual epicenter of the social entrepreneurship ecosystem. \nThey are forums where opinion leaders, researchers and practitioners can discuss critical issues \nin social entrepreneurship, enriching the intellectual landscape and inspiring new approaches. \nExchange workshops: Through their interactive nature, these sessions provide a space to \nexplore new methods, share success stories and collectively overcome obstacles. By emphasizing \ncollaborative learning, these workshops strengthen participants’ entrepreneurial skills, enabling \nthem to adopt more effective strategies and approach challenges from an innovative angle.\nCommunication and Outreach on Social Media: Online platforms make it possible to reach a \nvast and diverse audience, inspire action and mobilize support. Using engaging content such as \ninspiring videos, powerful testimonials and informative infographics, social media communication \ntells the compelling story of social entrepreneurship, builds support and encourages participation.\nIMPACT OF THE \nSAFIR PROGRAM\n60\n59\n61\n62\nThe Safir project has had a significant impact on several levels:\nImpact on support organizations:\n• Support organizations have strengthened their skills in project management and beneficiary support.\n• Efficient coordination of activities and administrative management of projects have been improved \nthanks to the training courses.\n• Some organizations have developed specific strategies to support young people.\nImpact on young people:\n• The young people have acquired skills in advocacy and social entrepreneurship.\n• Concrete projects have been set up, creating jobs and positive impacts in their local communities.\n• Safir has fostered dialogue between public authorities.\nImpact on women:\n• Women’s civic engagement has been strengthened through social entrepreneurship and advocacy.\n• Specific measures have been taken to support the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs.\nImpact at the academic level:\n• Training courses on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have broadened knowledge in \nvarious fields and provided a global vision of their importance.\n• Teachers and academic staff showed a keen interest in social innovation.\nNetworking and events:\n• Safir has fostered national and regional networking.\n• Abderrahmane Mira University organized a variety of activities, including workshops, master classes \nand a call for innovative ideas.\nContributions to public policy:\n• Safir has helped raise awareness and influence public policy, particularly in relation to the SDGs and \nyouth.\nImpact on gender:\n• Measures have been taken to support women entrepreneurs and promote their financial \nindependence.\n• Although changes in gender-related attitudes cannot be directly attributed to the project, Safir has \nhelped raise awareness of these issues.\nImproving young people’s skills:\n• The beneficiaries of the Safir project have seen their skills improve in the field of advocacy and SSE.\n• Some have taken part in forums and have been able to influence public authorities thanks to their \nadvocacy skills.\nSummary \nThe Safir project has had a significant impact on both the supporting organizations and the young people \ninvolved. The organizations have strengthened their skills in project management and beneficiary \nsupport. The young people have seen their skills in advocacy and the Social Solidarity Economy \n(SSE) improve, deploying projects with a direct impact on employment and their communities. Safir \nhas also fostered dialogue between public authorities and strengthened women’s civic commitment. \nThe capacity of support organizations to manage projects and provide support to beneficiaries \naccording to their needs has been strengthened. \nGenerally speaking, the most significant impacts on support organizations have been in terms of \nincreased skills within their structures in the effective coordination of activities and administrative \nmanagement of projects. Training courses have prepared staff for the fields of advocacy and SSE. \nConcrete strategies for supporting young people have been developed, and the equipment provided \nhas contributed to the sustainability of the innovation spaces. \nPersonalized follow-up by the consortium has strengthened our ability to support young people and \ntarget their needs. In addition, the networking encouraged by Safir has enabled the sharing of best \npractices and given a collective voice to young people.\nBy building the framework for social entrepreneurship projects to flourish, the Safir project has \ncontributed to the development of innovative solutions to development challenges. \nThe acceleration phase received 69 applications out of 91 incubated projects, illustrating the \neffectiveness of SAEI’s mentoring and coaching. The projects created by the young people testify \nto their civic commitment and their response to social, cultural and environmental challenges. The \n40 projects funded reflect a variety of objectives, from combating global warming to improving \ndemocratic participation:  \n• 15 projects aim to combat global warming and ensure the environmental sustainability of growth \nmodels and societies in the intervention zone; \n• 9 projects aim at the social, cultural, economic and political inclusion of young people; \n• 9 projects aim to improve public debate, citizen participation and democratic procedures; \n• 5 projects deal with sports, cultural and heritage issues; \n• 5 projects focus on human rights. \nSafir has also contributed to strengthening women’s civic engagement in public dialogue, through \nsocial impact entrepreneurship and advocacy. \nDespite a lower-than-targeted female representation, due to structural factors, the gender dimension \nhas been integrated throughout the project. Priority was given to projects that empowered women, \nand particular attention was paid to women’s specific needs in the support methods used.\nCOUNTRY-SPECIFIC \nFEEDBACK ON FAST-\nTRACK PROJECTS\n64\n63\n65\n66\nRim El Khattabi, Funds Division Manager, Bidaya - Morocco\nThe Safir program fitted in very well with Bidaya’s actions, vision and targets, i.e. young social \nentrepreneurs. What was new with the Safir program was the ability to support projects in the \nCultural and Creative Industries and associations.\nThe skills enhancement offered by the Safir program has enabled us to strengthen our ability to \nmonitor results and achievements, as well as the impact of our projects. At Bidaya, we were already \ndoing this type of monitoring, but not automatically, and the Safir program enabled us to do it more \nassiduously.\nAnother interesting aspect of the Safir program is that it puts us in touch with universities, but \nunfortunately we haven’t had the opportunity to do much work with them.\nSafir was also an opportunity to become part of a network of SAEI and to be supported as a \nsupport structure. We are not simply structures that implement an action, we are supported and \nwe can exchange with other structures that resemble us, structures in the region that do things \nsimilar to what we do in Morocco. For me, that’s what the Safir program is all about!\nExchanging ideas with other incubators facing similar challenges to ours, and their entrepreneurs \nwith our entrepreneurs, because we’re in a similar socio-economic and cultural context, reassures \nus and enables us to learn from others. For example, on the university side, I tried to draw inspiration \n6.1. Testimonials from SAEI\nfrom what the Algerian incubator, ACSE, has done to work with these players. No synergy has yet \nbeen formalized, but we’d be delighted to continue exchanging and collaborating with other SAEIs. \nTasneem Bsharat, Director of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Jordan Youth \nInnovation Forum - Jordan\nOur organization’s mission is to facilitate entrepreneurial opportunities for young people, and we \nwant to encourage the active participation of young people through economic empowerment and \nsocial involvement. The Safir program is therefore of great importance to our organization and fits \nin perfectly with our objectives. The support of Bloom and Lab’ess has enabled us to strengthen our \nmethodologies. The experience has been enriching and has provided us with valuable approaches \nto better support startups in their development. The Safir program has enabled us to join a \nregional network of incubators, which is invaluable and enables us to learn from the experiences \nand practices of other SAEIs. The synergies we are discussing with other SAEIs have the potential \nto strengthen our collective impact and better support social projects in the region.\n6.2.
