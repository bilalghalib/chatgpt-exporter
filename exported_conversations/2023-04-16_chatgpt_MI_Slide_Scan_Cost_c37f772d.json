      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have real-time data on prices, and my knowledge only goes up until 2021. However, I can provide you with some general guidelines. The average cost for slide scanning services can vary depending on factors like the quality of scans, the quantity of slides, and the service provider. Prices usually range from around $0.25 to $1.00 per slide for basic scanning services, while higher-quality scans or additional services may cost more.\n\nIt's important to note that these figures are just an estimate, and actual costs may differ. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend reaching out to local photo or imaging centers in Michigan and asking for quotes. You can also search online for companies that offer slide scanning services and compare prices to find the best deal.",
