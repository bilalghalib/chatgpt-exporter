      "content": "Working on an application for VENMO they're giving 20,000 dollars to people who have small businesses that use their new business app. Here's my application and the application criteria., critique it with 5 pros and 5 cons and direct me to the weak areas. ask me 3 questions to help you assess appropriately.\nRequirements:\nMust be (a) 18+\nHave a U.S. Venmo Account and valid business profile on Venmo in good standing;\nOwn a small business that is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of 1 of the 50 U.S. or DC that: \n(i) is active and has sold at least $500 worth of goods or services within the 3 months prior to this program;\n(ii) employs 10 employees or less with less than $50k in annual sales\n\nApplications judged on: \nHow inspirational, innovative or particularly original is your business’ story? (30%); \nHow well does your application demonstrate passion for your small business and concrete plans for where you plan to take it next? (30%); \nHow well does your application demonstrate that using a Venmo business profile has and will continue to benefit your business? (20%); \nHow, if applicable, has being a member of a historically underrepresented community (Black, Women, Latinx, etc.) shaped your entrepreneurial experience? (20%).\n\nThe questions:\nWe’d love to hear about your business, your background, and how you made it to where you are today.\nNurCoop started as a project during my days as an activist working in the Middle East and Asia, I was going to many places and wanted to share a physical part of these places to help people connect with their realities and to help people see/share the beautiful parts of our world. We started with essential oils and are expanding into incense and craft hoping to uplift the entire value chain with each purchase. This is why we visit the farms, the farmers, the factories, talk to the workers, and be sure to pay a fair price directly with the producers. Our goal is to be of benefit from Dirt to Delivery. \nWhat does the future look like for your business, and how can Venmo help you achieve your goals?\nWe are working on a long term vision, to grow slowly and surely yet without compromising on our promise to keep the entire value chain free from negative impacts. We know the best way to be successful is to help others become successful and we envision ourselves becoming a platform for people to share what is most beautiful in their lives and from the world they know. We have started the process of shifting into becoming a cooperative where people who source products using the Nur methodology can offer them in our shop and share in our profits. We believe that Venmo will help us in reducing friction for sales and increase trust and transparency. The ability to take phone/card based payments in a live setting will be extremely beneficial during craft shows/festivals as someone who sells items that sell much better in person than online (smells/stories) - this is a life saver. \nIf applicable, tell us how being a member of a historically underrepresented community (Black, Women, Latinx, etc.) may have shaped your entrepreneurial experience.\nBeing a Kurdish Iraqi American growing up in Michigan during the late 1990’s and 2000’s was complex. Watching the wars against Iraq happen after so much popular resistance and after speaking in front of 3000 people at a rally I started to feel that thee world was not made for people like me, and the only way I could have a path that was mine was to make and walk it myself. This is why in 2003 I started my first business Still Pondering Studios, a design company that was supposed to take my interest in drawing and monetize it and I haven’t looked back. My goal with the Nur Coop is to help craft a new path for business that’s good for the earth, good for the workers, good for the customers, and co-owned as well as good for the coop members. Can we help a group of people feel like our path is shared, and that this path can be shared by anyone who wants a beautiful business that is regenerative for the Earth and wholesome for all that participate.\n\nWhat to do next?\nHave a complete Venmo business profile. That means your profile must include a business description, a profile photo, and a background photo.\nAfter that, we can fill the form here: Link\nSubmit the form below by May 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I had purchased this oil and left a 3-star review a few years back immediately upon receiving it; I thought it smelled faintly of compost (which is actually a smell I LIKE) but it wasn’t what I was hoping for at first. However, it grew on me in a way no other fragrance ever has. This oil reminds me of the purest, happiest, most essential times. It smells like living earth. It is almost indescribable. I was using my first order so very sparingly that I finally came back to order a larger size, and am so happy I did. I never want to be without this oil. It is truly medicine for the soul!\n\"",

      "content": "1. goals are to start growing the business and to pay out the first cooperative memeber payments by end of Q2 2025. I want to hire a social media and a communications and marketing person because I'm great at gathering stories and shooting video, also the communications person will need to be in touch with community building for the cooperative, gathering their stories and sharing them. that'll be the primary activity. I think this should be funded and half paid by the grant to get us moving on marketing, without marketing we make aboue 1.5-2k a month and we need to increase turnover. I'd like to save .25 for grants which would give us 8,000 for about 2.5 grants for 3 or 2 4k grants for sourcing trips and initial sourcing purchases \nTo measure the impcat of the nur sourcing process we can make it a Nur Plege and count how many other businesses sign on to it and how many new Coop Members we get through it. - we can also do some qualitative interviews or ask our partners if we can make them a part of the cooperative and ask them to sign and join. \nWe would also need a portion of the grant for \"verification costs\" where we would hire independant third parties to visit the sites\n\nAnything else? Also this is a lot for 20k, let's make it reasonable when you write it. \nSome reviews:\n Pleasant, fast, and knowledgeable customer service! Packaged securely and sustainably. Arrived in time. I'm glad to have the options to try samples first. A pleasant surprise, the sellers upgraded the cedar to 2.5ml! The petrichor smells different than what I expected, of clay and algae, but it makes sense because it's from a different country and place. The Indian amber smells warm and has hints of water/sap. The Cambodian Ouk contains a smaller quantity because it is hard to find and make, hence very expensive, and very potent! It smells of earth and tree, very intense and deep but steady. And has the complexity of old trees from ancient, thriving forests, which cover most of Cambodia. The cedar smells even better than what I expected. The tree's woodsy, light, refreshing scent plus a very slightly sweet scent. another review:  Arrived extremely fast, Fantastic samples! I 100% recommend the Amber and Neroli, Oud as but best to dilute it because it's VERY concentrated and therefore a small amount. Amber is this sweet chocolate tonka bean musk, long lasting and intoxicating. Neroli is FRESH and floral, dreamy and reminiscent of spring turning into summer:)",

Our business is built on the foundation of fairness, transparency, and a deep respect for the earth and its people.\n\n#### Passion and Concrete Plans (30%)\n\nOur immediate goal is to grow NurCoop and start paying out the first cooperative member payments by the end of Q2 2025. To achieve this, we need to hire a social media and a communications/marketing person to help with storytelling, community building, and sharing our message. These roles are crucial as they will drive our marketing efforts and help us increase our monthly turnover from $1.5-2k to a more sustainable level.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to establish the \"Nur Sourcing Process\" and offer grants for others to source products using our process and join the coop. This will empower people to explore the world and share their findings, fostering a community of like-minded individuals dedicated to sustainable and ethical practices.\n\nTo measure the impact of our sourcing process, we will:\n- Implement the Nur Pledge and track how many businesses sign on.\n- Monitor the increase in coop members through this initiative.\n- Conduct qualitative interviews and gather stories from our partners.\n\nWe will also allocate a portion of the grant for verification costs, hiring independent third parties to visit sourcing sites and ensure adherence to our standards.\n\n#### Benefits of Using Venmo (20%)\n\nVenmo will significantly enhance our business operations by providing seamless payment solutions. This is especially beneficial in live settings like craft shows and festivals, where our products excel in person. The ability to take phone/card-based payments will reduce friction in sales and increase trust and transparency with our customers.\n\nAlthough we haven't used Venmo extensively yet, we anticipate that it will:\n- Streamline our payment processes, making it easier for customers to purchase our products.\n- Enhance our credibility and trustworthiness by providing a reliable payment platform.\n- Allow us to manage transactions more efficiently, freeing up time to focus on growing our business.\n\n#### Impact of Underrepresented Background (20%)\n\nGrowing up as a Kurdish Iraqi American in Michigan, I faced many challenges, especially during the Iraq wars. My entrepreneurial journey began in 2003 with my first business, Still Pondering Studios. My experiences have shaped my commitment to creating a business that benefits the earth, workers, customers, and coop members.\n\nAs an underrepresented entrepreneur, I strive to create opportunities for others like me. NurCoop is designed to be a regenerative business model that fosters inclusivity and sustainability. Our goal is to help others feel a shared path and create beautiful, meaningful businesses that are good for the planet and everyone involved.\n\n#### Customer Reviews and Testimonials\n\nIncorporating customer feedback provides tangible proof of our product's impact. Here are a few testimonials that highlight the value we bring to our customers and communities:\n\n- \"Wonderful product, deeply meaningful source and excellent, kind seller... It is truly medicine for the soul!\"\n- \"Pleasant, fast, and knowledgeable customer service! Packaged securely and sustainably. Arrived in time... The cedar smells even better than what I expected.\"\n- \"Arrived extremely fast, Fantastic samples! I 100% recommend the Amber and Neroli, Oud... Neroli is FRESH and floral, dreamy and reminiscent of spring turning into summer:)\"\n\nThese reviews underscore the deep, meaningful connections our products create and the satisfaction of our customers.\n\n### Summary\n\nBy focusing on these key areas, our application demonstrates the inspirational and innovative nature of NurCoop, our passion and concrete plans for growth, the anticipated benefits of using Venmo, and the unique perspective of being an underrepresented entrepreneur.",

The beauty of each location shone through their natural environments, cultures, and traditions. I started collecting physical items I could share with people internationally so they could see Lebanon for its cedar rather than its economic collapse, and Iraq for its qazwan beads rather than its wars. What if we connected people with the world as a source of beauty?\n\nNurCoop began as a passion project with this vision in mind. Our mission is to connect people with the beauty of these regions through products like essential oils, incense, and crafts. We strive to do this in a way that builds real, mutual, regenerative, and beneficial relationships for the entire value chain. By visiting farms, talking to farmers, and ensuring fair trade, we aim to benefit every part of the value chain, from Dirt to Delivery.

      "content": "### Application for Venmo Business Grant\n\n#### Business Story and Background (30%)\n\nDuring the Arab Spring, I began working in regions where people typically hear only negative news—Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, etc. As I worked with technology, bringing makerspaces and open-source culture to these areas, I realized the need to connect people with the local beauty and craftsmanship. One vivid memory is walking through Tripoli in Lebanon, captivated by the scent of orange blossoms along the road. I wanted to share this experience with the world, showing that places like Tripoli are not just about conflict, but also about beauty and culture.\n\nNurCoop started with this vision in mind. Our mission is to connect people with the beauty of these regions through products like essential oils, incense, and crafts. We aim to build real, mutual, regenerative, and beneficial relationships across the entire value chain, from Dirt to Delivery. By visiting farms, talking to farmers, and ensuring fair trade, we ensure quality and support sustainable practices. Our unique approach helps share the positive aspects of diverse cultures and creates meaningful connections between producers and consumers. This not only enriches the lives of our customers but also uplifts the communities we work with.\n\n#### Passion and Concrete Plans (30%)\n\nOur immediate goal is to grow NurCoop and start paying out the first cooperative member payments by the end of Q2 2025. To achieve this, we plan to hire three contractors on a part-time basis through Upwork to create a social media campaign strategy over the next two months. We will then narrow down to a six-month contract using half grant money and half Bloom revenue to identify a good partner. Our milestones include:\n\n1. Launching a comprehensive social media campaign.\n2. Increasing our monthly turnover from $1.5k to $3k within two quarters.\n3. Expanding our reach and engagement on social media platforms.\n4. Participating in local craft festivals in Lille to boost in-person sales.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to establish the \"Nur Sourcing Process\" and offer grants for others to source products using our process and join the coop. This will empower people to explore the world and share their findings, fostering a community of like-minded individuals dedicated to sustainable and ethical practices.\n\nTo measure the impact of our sourcing process, we will:\n- Implement the Nur Pledge and track how many businesses sign on.\n- Monitor the increase in coop members through this initiative.\n- Conduct qualitative interviews and gather stories from our partners.\n- Allocate a portion of the grant for verification costs, hiring independent third parties to visit sourcing sites and ensure adherence to our standards.\n\n#### Benefits of Using Venmo (20%)\n\nVenmo will significantly enhance our business operations by providing seamless payment solutions.
