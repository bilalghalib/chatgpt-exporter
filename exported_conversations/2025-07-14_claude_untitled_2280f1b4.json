We ran the generator for hours—800 thousand dinars a month! Yet the heat was still unbearable. So every night my family set up mattresses downstairs under the stairwell, just to sleep.”\nKey Points\nExtreme heat makes upstairs unlivable.\nRunning a generator is costly and unsustainable.\nBasic comfort can become impossible without simple retrofit.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“I’m sure some of you know this. Maybe you or your neighbors have faced the same choice—sleep downstairs or pay even more for fuel.”\nActivity Instructions\nTell the story in your own words (1 min).\nAsk: “Has anyone else had to sleep downstairs? Raise your hand.”\nGather 2–3 quick shares (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: No hands raised →\u000b Solution: Share a second anecdote about lost sleep.\nIssue: Story drags →\u000b Solution: Stick to the three bullet points, then invite sharing.\u000b\nTransition\n“That’s why, today, we start by learning how heat actually moves in a building—and how to stop it stealing our rooms and our money.”\n4\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*QR code\nPre-Assessment Quiz\nScan QR here\nDay 1\n09 : 30 – 09 : 40 (10 min) – Pre-Assessment Quiz (QR Code)\nPurpose\u000b Provide an easy way for everyone to complete the baseline quiz via their own device.\nSetup\u000b – Participants seated, devices ready (phone/tablet).\u000b – Project the slide full-screen with a large QR code.\nMaterials needed\u000b – Slide with QR code linking to the 5 MCQs + 2 open questions form.\u000b – Internet connection.\nPre-activity checks\u000b – Confirm Wi-Fi or mobile data is on.\u000b – Test-scanned the QR code yourself.\nFacilitator Script\n“Please take out your phones and scan the QR code on screen now. It will open our short pre-assessment form. You have about 5 minutes to answer all questions.”\nKey Points\nThis helps us see what you know before we start—no judgments.\nUse your own words for the open questions.\nWe’ll revisit these same questions on Day 5.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Just like we saw with Muthanna’s story, small facts make a big difference. Your answers will guide our teaching.”\nActivity Instructions\nScan the code.\nComplete the 5 multiple-choice questions (A–D).\nWrite your 1–2 sentence responses to the open questions.\nSubmit when done.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b – Issue: QR not scanning?\u000b Solution: Manually type the short URL displayed below the code.\u000b – Issue: No device?\u000b Solution: Pair up with a neighbor for one device each.\nTransition\n“Great—thank you!

In the Apply block, you’ll practice two hands-on tasks that put those learnings into action. And finally, in the Sell block, you’ll produce one proof or pitch deliverable that captures your work. Keep these objectives in mind as we move into the Learn session.”\nKey Points\nLearn: Understand the core concepts—ask questions if anything is unclear.\nApply: Use the tools and methods immediately—capture photos or data as evidence.\nSell: Create a shareable asset that demonstrates your progress for tomorrow’s pitch.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nGlance through each bullet to internalize the day’s goals.\nNote which deliverable (video, sheet, card, etc.) you’ll produce in the Sell block.\nWhen the slide disappears, we jump straight into the Learn session.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants miss which day they’re on →\u000b Solution: Verbally point to the highlighted row and restate “Today is Day X.”\nIssue: Overwhelm from many objectives →\u000b Solution: Emphasize that Learn and Apply each have only two bullets, and Sell has one—manageable chunks.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now let’s dive into our Learn session and master today’s first concept.”\n8\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n9\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nPreview – Ghassan’s Coating Failure\n🖌️ Low-cost coating peeled in 2 weeks\n🔄 Customer paid twice to fix it\n💡 Quality matters: invest once, save long-term\nDay 1\n09 : 55 – 10 : 00 (5 min) Preview: Ghassan’s Coating Failure\nPurpose\u000b Show a real cost of choosing cheap materials—sets up why we learn correct heat-flow fixes next.\nSetup\u000b – Slide full-screen after the story segment.\u000b – No room rearrangement needed.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – The slide with photos of peeled vs. intact coating.\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Verify the image is clear and visible.\u000b – Confirm slide order (this comes right after Muthanna’s story slide).\nFacilitator Script\n“Before we dive into heat-flow, here’s another example from Ghassan: he tested a very cheap roof coating, and it peeled off completely in just two weeks.”\nKey Points\nA low upfront cost can double in rework expenses.\nInvesting in quality once avoids repeat jobs.\nWe’ll learn how heat drives these failures.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul’s summer, cheap paint can blister under intense sun, forcing homeowners to recoat—sometimes three times in one season.”\nActivity Instructions\nShow the peeling sample photo.\nAsk: “Who here has seen paint peel so fast?” (one or two quick responses)\nEmphasize: “That’s the cost we want to avoid.”\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: No one has seen peeling? →\u000b Solution: Relate to any cracked wall or faded paint they know.\nIssue: Participants expect technical detail now →\u000b Solution: Reassure: “We’ll cover material choices in Day 2—today it’s about why we care.”\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that we know the stakes, let’s see exactly how heat moves through walls and roofs—and drives these failures.”\n10\n\nHeat Moves in 3 Ways\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMode\nQuick Demo\nConduction\nHot spoon handle 🔥\nConvection\nIncense smoke rising 🌬️\nRadiation\nSun on black vs white tile ☀️\n10 : 00 – 10 : 10 (10 min) – Heat-Flow Demo\nPurpose\u000b Introduce the three modes of heat transfer with quick, memorable demos before diving deeper.\nSetup\nParticipants seated; demo table visible.\nCandle, metal spoon, incense, plastic sheet, photos ready.\u000b\nMaterials needed\nCandle + matches\nMetal spoon\nIncense stick + plastic sheet\nPhoto of black vs white tile temperatures\u000b\nPre-activity checks\nEnsure candle is stable and wick lights easily.\nTest smoke under sheet harmlessly.\nVerify slide is on screen.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Now we’ll see heat moving in three ways: conduction, convection, and radiation. I’ll demo each quickly—watch and feel.”\nKey Points\nConduction: Heat moves through solids.\nConvection: Hot air rises in currents.\nRadiation: Surfaces absorb or reflect radiant heat.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, metal window frames get scorching by midday—that’s conduction in action.”\nActivity Instructions\nConduction: Light candle, hold spoon bowl over flame for 5 s; then pass handle to participants to feel warmth instantly.\nConvection: Light incense and place under plastic sheet—watch smoke flow and hit the sheet, then spread sideways.\nRadiation: Show photo comparing black tile at 60 °C vs white tile at 54 °C under sun.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Spoon too hot →\u000b Solution: Hold just the bowl in flame, not handle.\nIssue: Smoke too light →\u000b Solution: Move plastic sheet closer to stick.\nIssue: Photo unclear →\u000b Solution: Describe the temperature difference verbally.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now that you’ve seen how heat travels, let’s learn how to slow it down with insulation methods.”\n11\n\nHow Heat Moves: Conduction, Convection, Radiation\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMode\nConduction\nHeat through solids 🔥\nConvection\nHeat with moving air 🌬️\nRadiation\nHeat by waves ☀️\n10 : 10 – 10 : 20 (10 min) Heat-Flow Slide\u000b\nPurpose\u000b Reinforce the three modes with clear visuals before moving on to safety.\nSetup\nParticipants seated, projector on.\nSlide cued immediately after demo.\u000b\nMaterials needed\nSlide deck loaded.\u000b\nPre-activity checks\nVerify inset photo is visible (not too small).\nEnsure icons are legible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s a simple summary:\u000b • Conduction: heat travels through materials (like that spoon).\u000b • Convection: hot air moves in currents (like our incense).\u000b • Radiation: energy travels in waves from hot surfaces or sun.”\nKey Points\nConduction = direct contact.\nConvection = fluids carrying heat.\nRadiation = invisible waves.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In summer, metal doors burn your hand by conduction. Open windows let hot air in by convection. Dark walls heat by radiation.”\nActivity Instructions\nPoint to each icon as you explain.\nAsk: “Which mode gave you the warm handle?” (Conduction)\nAsk: “Which demo showed convection?” (Smoke)\nAsk: “What caused the big tile temperature gap?” (Radiation)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Icons too abstract →\u000b Solution: Refer back to demo moments.\nIssue: Overlap confusion →\u000b Solution: Restate each mode’s demo link.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that we know how heat moves, let’s talk about staying safe while we work—our next slide is the Safety Toolbox-Talk.”\n12\n\nSafety First 🚧\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n😷 Mask Use\n“Keep dust & smoke out”\n🪜 Ladder Safety\n“Secure footing + 3-point grip”\n💧 Hydration\n“Drink water every 20 min”\n10 : 20 – 10 : 25 (5 min) Safety Toolbox-Talk\nPurpose\u000b Remind everyone of simple safety steps before we start hands-on work.\nSetup\u000b – Keep seats as is; everyone can see slide.\u000b – No movement required.\nMaterials needed\u000b – Slide projected.\u000b – Ladder, mask, water jug on demo table.\nPre-activity checks\u000b – Ensure a sturdy ladder is visible.\u000b – One clean mask per participant.\u000b – Water jug is filled.\nFacilitator Script\n“Before we get hands-on, let’s cover three must-do safety steps: ladder, mask, and water.”\nKey Points\n🪜 Always keep three points of contact on ladders.\n😷 Wear a mask when you see dust or smoke.\n💧 Drink water every 20 minutes, especially in heat.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Last summer, a trainee slipped because they forgot to face the ladder—easy to avoid with these steps.”\nActivity Instructions\nPoint to the ladder icon and demo a 3-point grip on the ladder beside you.\nHold up the mask and show correct fit over nose and mouth.\nPour a cup of water—invite one participant to take a sip.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Mask fogs glasses →\u000b Solution: Pinch the nose clip for a snug seal.\nIssue: Ladder wobbles →\u000b Solution: Check foot placement and ground level before climbing.\nIssue: Forgetting water →\u000b Solution: Set alarms on your phone as reminders.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—everyone’s safe and ready.

That means our biggest gains come from the top.”\nKey Points\nRoof = majority of heat gain in hot climates.\nInsulating the roof yields the biggest temperature drop.\nFocus your work where it makes the most difference.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul’s July sun, homes without roof coating see attic spaces reach 55 °C, while properly coated roofs stay below 45 °C—that 10 °C difference is huge.”\nActivity Instructions\nAsk: “Why do you think the roof contributes so much more than walls?”\nInvite one or two quick responses.\nReinforce that today’s labs will target that 60–70 % zone.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants question exact percentages →\u000b Solution: Emphasize it’s an approximate industry average.\nIssue: Diagram looks complex →\u000b Solution: Simplify by pointing to each segment in turn.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that we see why roofs matter most, let’s explore which coatings we can use—starting with our Three Common Coatings overview.”\n36\n\nThree Common Coatings\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nType\nCost (USD/L)\nCoverage m²/L\nDurability (yrs)\nNotes\nAcrylic\n3.5\n3.5\n4 – 5\nCheap, cracks under dust\nSilicone\n5.0\n3.0\n7 – 8\nUV-proof, needs primer\nElastomeric\n4.2\n3.2\n6 – 7\nFlexible, mid-price\n09 : 45 – 09 : 55 (10 min) Three Common Coatings\nPurpose\u000b Introduce participants to the cost, coverage, and durability trade-offs of the three main roof coatings they’ll test.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed full-screen showing the coating table.\u000b – Ensure the demo tiles (Acrylic, Silicone, Elastomeric) are laid out nearby and labeled.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Slide deck with table\u000b – Three coated tile samples labeled A, B, and C\nPre-Activity Checks\u000b – Confirm each tile matches the row in the table.\u000b – Verify labels are clear (e.g. colored tape or stickers).\nFacilitator Script\n“Here are three coatings you’ll work with today. Notice differences in price per liter, coverage area, and expected lifespan. Keep these in mind when you do the scratch-test next.”\nKey Points\nAcrylic is cheapest but only lasts 4–5 years and may crack under dust.\nSilicone costs more but resists UV for 7–8 years—needs a primer coat.\nElastomeric sits in-between on price and durability and offers flexibility.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul’s dusty environment, some contractors avoid acrylic because they know clients come back for recoats after just one season.”\nActivity Instructions\nLook at the table and note each coating’s strengths/weaknesses.\nTouch each tile lightly to feel surface texture.\nPrepare for the next demo where you’ll scratch each sample to see durability.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Teams confuse coverage rates →\u000b Solution: Remind: “Coverage m²/L means how many square meters one liter will coat.”\nIssue: Table seems dense →\u000b Solution: Focus on the “Cost” and “Durability” columns first.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that you know what you’re testing, let’s move to the Scratch-Test Demo slide to see how each coating actually holds up.”\n37\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nScratch-Test Demo\nDay 2\n🔍 Step 1: Use a coin to gently scratch each coated tile\n📝 Step 2: Observe & note any chipping or flaking\n⭐ Step 3: Rate durability from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)\n09 : 55 – 10 : 10 (15 min) Scratch-Test Demo\nPurpose\u000b Let participants feel firsthand how each coating resists abrasion, linking back to durability ratings.\nSetup\nDemo table in front with three labeled tiles (Acrylic, Silicone, Elastomeric).\nCoin or metal scraper ready.\nWorksheets or whiteboard to record ratings.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nThree coated tile samples\nCoin or metal scraper\nRating sheet or whiteboard\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nEnsure tiles are clearly labeled A, B, C.\nConfirm coin edge is clean and safe to use.\nProvide each team a spot at the demo table in turn.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Now we’ll scratch-test each coating. First, lightly scratch tile A with your coin—don’t press hard, just enough to test surface grip. Note any chips or flaking, then give it a 1–5 durability rating.”\nKey Points\nGentle scratch tests surface adhesion, not brute force.\nChips/flakes indicate weak binding.\nStar rating makes comparisons quick and clear.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, a coating that scores below 3 often peels within one season—clients hate repeat recoats.”\nActivity Instructions\nInvite Team 1 up to scratch tile A; Team 2 for tile B; Team 3 for tile C.\nEach team records their star rating on the whiteboard next to A, B, or C.\nRotate until all teams have tested all three.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Too much pressure →\u000b Solution: Demonstrate light pressure using just finger strength.\nIssue: Inconsistent ratings →\u000b Solution: Calibrate by asking: “How many flakes did you see?”\u000b\nTransition\n“Great data! Next, we’ll watch a quick case-study video showing what happens when a really cheap coating fails versus a premium option.”\n38\n\nCase Study Video – 5-Year Silicone Failure\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10 : 10 – 10 : 20 (10 min) Case Study Video – 5-Year Silicone Failure\nPurpose\u000b Show long-term consequences of choosing a lower-grade roof coating versus investing in a higher-quality option.\nSetup\nSlide up, projector & sound ready.\nVideo cued at the correct timestamp.\u000b\nMaterials needed\nDownloaded or streamed clip.\nRoom audio.\u000b\nPre-activity checks\nPlay a 5-second test segment to verify video/audio.\nAdjust volume for clarity.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“We’ll watch this clip showing a cheap silicone roof coating that failed after just five years—cracking, flaking, and losing adhesion. Notice the root causes and then how a premium coating stands up under the same conditions.”\nKey Points\nCheap silicone deteriorates over time—UV exposure and thermal cycling cause cracking.\nDelamination leads to water ingress and substrate damage.\nPremium coating resists UV, stays bonded, and avoids costly repairs.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, some homes recoated cheaply after year four—only to see peeling by year five. The repeat cost often exceeds the initial premium investment.”\nActivity Instructions\nPlay the 1:30 clip.\nAsk teams to note:\nOne cause of the cheap coating’s failure.\nOne benefit they see in the premium alternative.\nInvite two teams to share their observations.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Viewers miss the slow degradation →\u000b Solution: Pause at key frames to point out cracks or flaking.\nIssue: Audio commentary unclear →\u000b Solution: Summarize the narrator’s main points in your own words.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that we understand these long-term risks, let’s move into today’s Mini-Roof Tile Lab to test coatings ourselves.”\n39\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n40\n\nMini-Roof Tile Lab\nDay 2\n🧹 Station 1: Clean\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🖌️ Station 2: Coat\n🌡️ Station 3: Measure\n10 : 20 – 10 : 25 (5 min) Slide 1: Mini-Roof Tile Lab Overview\nPurpose\u000b Orient teams to the three lab stations so they know the flow before splitting up.\nSetup\nFloor cleared for three stations in a row.\nStation markers (1, 2, 3) visible on tables.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nSignage or tape labeling each station.\nBrief slide up so participants can scan stations visually.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm all three stations are stocked and labeled.\nCheck walkthrough path for teams is clear.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Welcome to the Mini-Roof Tile Lab. You’ll rotate through three stations:\u000b • Station 1 – Clean the tile surface of dust and debris.\u000b • Station 2 – Evenly apply your assigned coating.\u000b • Station 3 – Measure coverage (m²) and temperature drop (ΔT).\nKey Points\nClean before coating for accurate adhesion.\nCoat evenly to test real-world coverage.\nMeasure carefully to compare results.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul’s dusty environment, skipping the clean step cuts coating life by half—so don’t rush Station 1.”\nActivity Instructions\nForm into groups of three.\nBegin at Station 1 and rotate clockwise every 5 min.\nFollow the station-specific slide for each step.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Teams start at wrong station →\u000b Solution: Point and count “One… Two… Three…” before they move.\nIssue: Congestion at Station 1 →\u000b Solution: Stagger start times by 30 sec per team.\u000b\nTransition\n“Okay—let’s move to Station 1.

Keep these objectives in mind as we move into the Learn session.”\nKey Points\nLearn: Understand the core concepts—ask questions if anything is unclear.\nApply: Use the tools and methods immediately—capture photos or data as evidence.\nSell: Create a shareable asset that demonstrates your progress for tomorrow’s pitch.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nGlance through each bullet to internalize the day’s goals.\nNote which deliverable (video, sheet, card, etc.) you’ll produce in the Sell block.\nWhen the slide disappears, we jump straight into the Learn session.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants miss which day they’re on →\u000b Solution: Verbally point to the highlighted row and restate “Today is Day X.”\nIssue: Overwhelm from many objectives →\u000b Solution: Emphasize that Learn and Apply each have only two bullets, and Sell has one—manageable chunks.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now let’s dive into our Learn session and master today’s first concept.”\n90\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n91\n\nLeak Costs in IQD: Amp → Dinar Formula\nDay 4\nFormula: \nΔA (amps) × 220 V × Hours/day × Days/month ÷ 1 000 (to kWh) × ₨ 800/kWh\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWorked Example:\nΔA = 4 A → 4 A×220 V = 880 W\n880 W×10 h/day×30 days = 264 kWh\n264 kWh×₨ 800 = ₨ 211 200/month saved\n09 : 35 – 09 : 45 (10 min) Leak Costs in IQD: Amp → Dinar\nPurpose\u000b Show how even small amperage reductions translate into significant monthly dinar savings, reinforcing the financial impact of sealing leaks.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed full-screen.\u000b – Calculator or spreadsheet tool at hand for reference.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Slide deck only.\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Confirm voltage (220 V) and rate (₨ 800/kWh) match local standards.\u000b – Ensure example numbers are visible and legible.\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s quantify the cost of leaks. Use this formula: amps saved times voltage gives watts, multiplied by daily hours and days per month, divided by 1 000 for kWh, then multiplied by ₨ 800 per kWh. In our example, a 4 A reduction over 10 hours daily saves about ₨ 211 200 per month.”\nKey Points\nΔA (amps) converts to power (watts) when multiplied by voltage.\nUsage hours & days scale daily savings to monthly.\nkWh rate turns energy saved into local currency value.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul workshops, sealing a 2 A leak saved over ₨ 100 000 monthly—enough to cover two months of generator fuel.”\nActivity Instructions\nIdentify your team’s measured amp reduction from yesterday’s vent sizing.\nPlug your ΔA into the formula on a notepad or calculator.\nCompute and note your monthly IQD saving.\nBe ready to share your figure when we discuss findings.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Confusing watts vs kWh →\u000b Solution: Remind: “Divide watts×hours by 1 000 to get kWh.”\nIssue: Wrong rate used →\u000b Solution: Verify the ₨ 800 per kWh figure at the top of your sheet.\u000b\nTransition\n“With your cost figures ready, let’s learn how to pinpoint those leaks—on to our Blower-Door & Smoke Diagnostics slide.”\n92\n\nPinpoint Leaks\nDay 4\nSeal Room: close doors/windows; attach blower fan\nPressurize: run fan at low speed to create airflow\nSmoke Test: release smoke pencil at seams and watch flow\nMark Leaks: note spots where smoke is drawn or blown\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n09 : 45 – 09 : 55 (10 min) Pinpoint Leaks: Blower-Door & Smoke Test\nPurpose\u000b Teach teams to locate infiltration points precisely so they seal the biggest leaks first and maximize savings.\nSetup\nSlide displayed full-screen before demo.\nBlower-door fan, frame adapter, and smoke pencils pre-assembled at demo area.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nPortable blower-door fan with hose and frame seal\nSmoke pencils/incense sticks\nChalk or tape to mark leak points\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nVerify blower-door fan is functional and hose connections are airtight.\nTest one smoke pencil to ensure visible plume.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“First, seal the test room by closing all openings and fitting the blower-door fan into a doorway. Next, pressurize at low speed—this creates airflow from outside. Then perform the smoke test: hold a smoke pencil near seams and watch where the plume is drawn in or blown out. Finally, mark each leak point with chalk or tape for targeted sealing.”\nKey Points\nComplete seal ensures accurate airflow detection.\nLow speed pressurization highlights subtle leaks.\nSmoke direction shows infiltration vs exfiltration.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In one Mosul home, leaks at the attic hatch caused the biggest airflow—sealing it cut generator usage by 3 A.”\nActivity Instructions\nTeam A sets up the blower-door frame and fan.\nTeam B lights a smoke pencil and approaches seams one by one.\nRecord each leak’s location and draft strength on your chart.\nRotate between roles so everyone practices.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Smoke disperses too quickly →\u000b Solution: Move closer to the seam or slow fan speed.\nIssue: Fan seal leaks →\u000b Solution: Adjust the frame gasket or use extra tape to seal gaps.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great detection! Up next, we’ll watch a quick Smoke-Leak Clip to see this in action, then decide Where to Seal First.”\n93\n\nSmoke-Leak in Action\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n09 : 55 – 10 : 00 (5 min) Smoke-Leak Clip\nPurpose\u000b Show a real-world example of smoke diagnostics to reinforce the steps and visual cues for spotting leaks.\nSetup\nVideo queued on the projector.\nHouse or demo-room clip ready to play.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nVideo file or stream access.\nSpeakers for clear audio (if any sound).\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nPlay a 3-second preview to confirm playback.\nAdjust volume and screen focus.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s watch a quick demo of smoke diagnostics. Notice how the smoke plume moves—darts into gaps and sometimes blows out. Pay attention to those high-flow points; those are your priority sealing spots.”\nKey Points\nInfiltration spots are where smoke is sucked in.\nExfiltration spots are where smoke is pushed out.\nPriority goes to highest-flow areas.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“That clip shows windows leaking most; in Mosul homes, roof-wall joints often leak even more.”\nActivity Instructions\nObserve the smoke movement carefully.\nMentally note at least two leak locations you’d seal first.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Video too dark →\u000b Solution: Increase projector brightness or describe verbally.\nIssue: Participants distracted →\u000b Solution: Pause at key frames to emphasize.\u000b\nTransition\n“Armed with that visual, next we’ll decide Where to Seal First? on our priority chart.”\n94\n\nWhere to Seal First?\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nPriority\nLocation\nWhy\n1\nRoof‐Wall Junction\nRain ingress + 40 °C attic air leaks\n2\nWindow Frame Seams\nWind whistling & drafts\n3\nDoor Sweep & Bottom\nDust, insects & air infiltration\n4\nWall Seams & Cracks\nVisible smoke pulls → major ΔA losses\n10 : 00 – 10 : 05 (5 min) Where to Seal First?\nPurpose\u000b Help teams prioritize their sealing work by targeting the highest-impact leak locations first.\nSetup\nSlide displayed full-screen right after the smoke‐leak clip.\nMarker or pointer ready to highlight each row.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nSlide deck only.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm the priority table is legible from all seats.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Now that you’ve seen smoke tracing through cracks in the wall, here’s our priority chart.

Use expanding polyurethane foam for anything over 1 mm—its quick 10 min set time and strong fill make it ideal for those gaps. For smaller joints use acrylic caulk or silicone, and rubber gaskets on moving parts.”\nKey Points\nPU foam expands to fill irregular cracks—perfect for seam leaks.\nCaulk and silicone suit narrower gaps with clean finish.\nRubber gaskets lock down moving joints like doors.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nRefer to your marked leaks and note the gap size.\nChoose the corresponding material from the matrix.\nCollect the matching tube from the materials table.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Foam overshoots the gap →\u000b Solution: Use minimal foam and trim excess after curing.\nIssue: Confusion over silicone vs caulk →\u000b Solution: Remember silicone cures in hours and is flexible—caulk sets in minutes but is less elastic.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that you’ve got the right sealant, next we’ll look at Ventilation Options—Passive vs Active—so you can round out today’s retrofit strategy.”\n96\n\nHeritage Stack Ventilation\nDay 4\n🏰 Badgir (Wind-Catcher): rooftop tower channels breeze downward\n🌿 Courtyard Stack-Effect: warm air rises through open shaft, drawing cool air in\n🌬️ Airflow: 80–120 CFM with zero electricity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10 :10 – 10 :15 (5 min) Heritage Stack Ventilation\nPurpose\u000b Introduce traditional Iraqi ventilation methods to expand passive design options beyond modern turbine vents.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed full-screen after “Where to Seal First.”\u000b – No props needed for this conceptual overview.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Slide deck only.\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Ensure icons and airflow numbers are legible from back of room.\nFacilitator Script\n“Long before turbines, Mosul’s heritage builders used badgirs, or wind-catchers—tall rooftop towers that funnel wind down into living spaces. Similarly, courtyard stack-effect uses vertical shafts: as warm air rises, it pulls cool air in at ground level. Both achieve roughly 80–120 CFM without a watt of power.”\nKey Points\nBadgirs harness prevailing breezes through a tower.\nCourtyards create natural airflow via temperature-driven convection.\nBoth are zero-energy solutions ideal for retrofit inspiration.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“At Beit al-Turath museum in Mosul, restored badgirs maintain comfortable indoor temps even in peak summer.”\nActivity Instructions\nVisualize how a small badgir could fit your mock roof.\nNote potential placement in your sketchbook for today’s Apply station.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Unfamiliar with badgir shape →\u000b Solution: Recall Omar’s “wind-tower” image or sketch a basic rectangular shaft.\u000b\nIssue: Doubt about airflow rates →\u000b Solution: Think of 80–120 CFM as roughly two household fans at full speed.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that we’ve honored traditional designs, let’s compare these passive methods with modern solutions—up next: our Modern Passive & Active Comparison slide.”\n97\n\nVentilation Options: Passive vs Active\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nOption\nAirflow\nPower Draw\nMaintenance\nWind‐Turbine Vent\n100–150 CFM\n0 W\nAnnual inspect\nBadgir / Courtyard Stack Vent\n80–120 CFM\n0 W\nAnnual inspect\nSolar Exhaust Fan\n250–300 CFM\n25 W (day)\nMonthly filter check\n10 :15 – 10 :25 (10 min) Modern Passive & Active Comparison\nPurpose\u000b Help teams assess the pros and cons of heritage and modern ventilation options to make informed retrofit choices.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed full-screen.\u000b – Demo examples (turbine vent, badgir sketch, solar fan) within view if possible.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Slide deck only.\u000b – (Optional) Physical samples or images of each option.\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Verify the table’s text and icons are legible.\u000b – Ensure no other visuals clutter the display.\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s a side-by-side comparison of our three ventilation options:\nWind-Turbine Vent: moves 100–150 CFM, zero power, needs only an annual inspection.\nBadgir/Courtyard Stack Vent: delivers 80–120 CFM via natural convection, also zero power, annual check.\nSolar Exhaust Fan: pumps 250–300 CFM using 25 W when the sun shines, with a monthly filter check.”\u000b\nKey Points\nAirflow rates vary—solar fans lead in volume, heritage methods provide steady passive cooling.\nPower draw is zero for passive, minor for solar (daytime only).\nMaintenance frequency differs—annual for vents vs. monthly filter care.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In a Mosul café retrofit, a badgir cut indoor temps by 4 °C overnight—useful where turbines aren’t practical.”\nActivity Instructions\nReview the airflow and power specs for each option.\nDiscuss with your team which option best suits the mock roof scenario.\nNote your choice for Station 2 sizing.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Confusion over CFM →\u000b Solution: Relate 100 CFM to roughly two desktop fans at full speed.\nIssue: Uncertainty on maintenance →\u000b Solution: Emphasize simple annual or monthly checks—no complex servicing.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great!

First, prep the crack by brushing away dust and ensuring it’s dry. Next, choose your sealant—PU foam for larger gaps or silicone for smaller joints—and load it into your gun. Finally, apply by steadily filling the gap from bottom to top, then smooth the surface with a trowel or gloved finger.”\nKey Points\nPrep is critical—contaminants weaken adhesion.\nConsistent bead prevents air pockets and ensures full seal.\nSmooth finish both looks professional and avoids trapping moisture.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul homes, teams who skipped proper prep saw foam pull back from the crack; those who cleaned first achieved a complete seal lasting months.”\nActivity Instructions\nBrush and dry your marked crack thoroughly.\nLoad your PU foam or silicone into the gun.\nApply sealant steadily—don’t rush the fill.\nSmooth the bead immediately for a flush finish.\nTrim any excess foam after it sets (~10 min for PU foam).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Sealant drips or overflows →\u000b Solution: Reduce trigger pressure and fill slowly.\nIssue: Foam pulls back after curing →\u000b Solution: Reapply a thin silicone bead over the cured foam to lock it in.\nIssue: Skin irritation from foam →\u000b Solution: Wear gloves and wash exposed skin immediately.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great work sealing those leaks! Next, we’ll size and plan your vent or fan on the mock roof—on to Station 2A.”\n101\n\nStation 2A: Size Your Vent/Fan\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n📏 Measure Roof Area: length × width (m²)\n🔧 Calculate Required CFM: ΔT-driven airflow target (CFM = m² × 5)\n🛠️ Select Vent/Fan: choose passive or active unit matching CFM\n📍 Mark Placement: outline on mock roof\nDay 4\n10 : 40 – 10 : 55 (15 min) Station 2A: Vent/Fan Sizing on Mock Roof\nPurpose\u000b Guide teams through calculating their required ventilation capacity and planning precise placement for maximum performance.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed at Station 2A.\u000b – Mock roof model with grid lines labeled in meters.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Tape measure\u000b – Calculator or mobile app\u000b – Roof model & marker\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Confirm each grid square on the mock roof equals 1 m².\u000b – Ensure airflow target formula is visible on the slide.\nFacilitator Script\n“At Station 2A, first measure your mock roof’s length and width to get area. Then calculate the target airflow using a rule of thumb—5 CFM per m² of roof. Next, select the vent or fan whose rated CFM meets or exceeds your target. Finally, use a marker to outline the vent placement on your mock roof.”\nKey Points\nAccurate area measurement ensures correct airflow sizing.\nCFM target ties ΔT performance to real ventilation needs.\nPlacement should consider prevailing wind or sun exposure for passive and solar units.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“A 20 m² roof needed 100 CFM; teams chose a 120 CFM turbine vent for margin and placed it near the highest draft zone.”\nActivity Instructions\nUse the tape measure on the mock grid to calculate area.\nMultiply area by 5 to get CFM target.\nReview vent and fan CFM ratings at the materials table; choose one.\nSketch its outline on the roof model with a marker.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Misreading grid lines →\u000b Solution: Count squares carefully and confirm each is 1 m².\nIssue: Choosing under-powered vent →\u000b Solution: Always pick a unit with at least 10% higher CFM than your target.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—your vent sizing and placement are set.
