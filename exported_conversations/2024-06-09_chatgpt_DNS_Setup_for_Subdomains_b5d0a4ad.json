      "content": "Hello! Let's dive into setting up your DNS for hosting multiple subdomains on your Namecheap Wabuzo server with Plesk. We'll break this down into a few clear steps:\n\n1. **Configuring DNS with Namecheap:**\n   - **Login to Namecheap:** Access your Namecheap account and navigate to the \"Domain List.\"\n   - **Select Domain:** Choose the domain you want to configure and click on \"Manage.\"\n   - **Advanced DNS:** Go to the \"Advanced DNS\" tab to manage your DNS settings.\n   - **Add A Record:** For each subdomain, you need to add an 'A Record':\n     - Click on \"Add New Record.\"\n     - Select \"A Record\" from the dropdown.\n     - In the \"Host\" field, enter your subdomain (e.g., `subdomain1`).\n     - In the \"Value\" field, enter the IP address of your Wabuzo server.\n     - Repeat for each subdomain you wish to add.\n\n2. **Setting up Plesk for Subdomains:**\n   - **Login to Plesk:** Access your Plesk control panel.\n   - **Add a Subscription:** Create a new subscription for your main domain if you haven't already.\n     - Go to \"Websites & Domains.\"\n     - Click \"Add Domain\" and fill in the necessary details.\n   - **Create Subdomains:** For each subdomain:\n     - Go to \"Websites & Domains\" again.\n     - Click \"Add Subdomain.\"\n     - Enter the name of the subdomain and select the appropriate parent domain.\n     - Configure the document root if needed.\n   - **DNS Settings in Plesk:** Ensure that the DNS settings in Plesk match those configured in Namecheap.\n     - Go to \"DNS Settings\" under your main domain in Plesk.\n     - Add 'A Records' for each subdomain pointing to your server’s IP if they aren't already present.\n\n3. **Testing and Verification:**\n   - **Propagation Check:** Use tools like `whatsmydns.net` to ensure your DNS records have propagated.\n   - **Access Subdomains:** Try accessing your subdomains in a web browser to confirm they are resolving correctly.\n\n4. **SSL Configuration (Optional but Recommended):**\n   - **SSL Certificates:** Ensure each subdomain is covered by an SSL certificate. Plesk can manage Let’s Encrypt certificates easily.\n     - Go to the \"SSL/TLS Certificates\" section in Plesk.\n     - Request a Let’s Encrypt certificate for each subdomain.\n\n**Team Thoughts:**\n\n- **Josephine (White Hat):** It's important to ensure all DNS records are correctly pointing to your server’s IP address. This avoids any misconfigurations.\n- **Claude (Green Hat):** Consider using wildcard DNS and SSL certificates if you anticipate managing many subdomains. It simplifies the process.\n- **Prunella (Black Hat):** Double-check the DNS propagation and SSL certificate configuration to prevent potential security risks or downtime.\n- **Percy (Yellow Hat):** Once set up, this configuration allows for easy scalability and management of your subdomains.\n- **Cyril (Red Hat):** If you run into any issues, trust your instincts to recheck configurations and consult Namecheap’s support if needed.\n- **Quackers (Blue Hat):** This step-by-step plan should comprehensively cover the setup process, making your subdomain management straightforward and efficient.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any specific questions or encounter any issues during the setup!",

      "content": "How do I register personal nameservers for my domain?\nTypically you would need to create Personal DNS for appearance reasons so anyone doing a WHOIS check will see your custom nameservers instead of the hosting company ones. It also simplifies the process of updating nameservers or moving to another host in the future if you are a hosting reseller. Instead of contacting all your customer base for updates, you will just need to change an IP address on your side and the domains begin propagating.\n\nPersonal DNS for your domain name are created by means of the glue records that associate the IP address of the DNS server with a personal nameserver.\n\nYou can input the nameserver name and IP address through your account, and this information will be submitted to the Registry.\n\nNOTES:\n\nPrivate nameservers for .AI domains with complex hostnames like xx.xx.domain.ai are not supported. Only servers like xx.domain.ai can be registered\nIP addresses for .AU personal nameservers should differ at least in one number in any octet.\nPersonal nameservers for .DE domain names cannot be currently registered with us.\nOnce registered, all Private Nameservers for .EU domains are automatically associated with .EU domain name along with the current nameservers and it is not possible to use any other nameservers except for the private ones for this domain name.\nPrivate nameservers registration is not supported at the moment for .IS domains.\nFor .TO domains, it is possible to register a nameserver with an IPv4 address only as IPv6 addresses are not supported.\nOnly one IPv4 and one IPv6 address can be set to a .UK personal nameserver. On the .UK platform, a nameserver may have an IPV4 or an IPV6 IP Address recorded against it, or it can have both. A name server cannot have two different IPV4 or IPV6 IP Addresses recorded against it on the .UK platform.\nNameservers for .CA, CN, and .NL TLDs should have a unique IP address each, meaning none of the nameservers can have the same IP. Also, for .CA domains only one IPv4 address and only one IPv6 address allowed per host.\nFor .COM, .NET, .CC, .NAME TLDs: According to Verisign's unused objects policy, if no domain from Verisign zone (.com, .net, .cc, .name) are using created personal name servers, the name servers are purged by the registry after 30 days of no use.\nCurrently, it is possible to register a server with an IPv4 address only through the Namecheap interface. If you would like to register it with an IPv6 address, please contact our Support Team for assistance.\nThe unregistered nameservers do not have associated IP address and cannot work properly with some domains.\nFor other domains you can register personal (private) nameservers with an IPv4 address in the following way:\n\n1. Sign into your Namecheap account (The Sign In option is available in the header of the page).\n\n2. Mouse over the Account option in the upper right corner of the page and choose Domain List or select the Domain List menu in the left sidebar:\n\n\n\n3. Click on the Manage option in front of the domain name:\n\n\n\n4. Click on the Advanced DNS tab and find the Personal DNS Server section >>  select Standard or Custom Nameservers from a drop-down menu > click on the Add Nameserver button:\n\n\n\n\n5. Enter the desired hostname into the Nameserver field (e.g. \"ns1\" if you would like to register the \"ns1.nctest.info\" nameserver, etc.) :\n\n\n\n\nThe IP address for the Personal DNS should be provided by your hosting company if your hosting package support Personal DNS option. Usually, such IP address is listed in the email with your hosting account details, but you can also contact your hosting provider if you cannot locate it.\n\nOnce you have your IP, please enter it into the IP address field.\n\n6. Click on Done.\n\nIn order to check if a standard personal nameserver is registered at the moment (the ones with a host ns1-9 and dns1-9), you will need to select Standard Nameservers from the drop-down list on the Find Nameservers line and click on the Search button:\n\n\nIn order to check if the specific personal nameserver is registered, select Custom Nameservers on the Find Nameservers line, enter the name of the custom personal nameserver in full (e.g. dns1.test.nctest.info) into the Host field below and click on the Search button:\n\n\n7. Once you’ve registered your nameservers, please do not forget to create the corresponding A records for them in your domain name zone file. This can be done in the DNS or Zone Management menu of your hosting control panel. You might need to contact your hosting company for assistance with setting up the records.\n\n8. The nameservers registration will not automatically point your domain name to the nameservers you've created. If you need to switch your domain to these DNS, follow this guide for more details.\n\n\nNOTE: If you leave your domain pointed to Namecheap BasicDNS/PremiumDNS, you will also need to set up the A records in the Advanced DNS tab to connect the domain to your personal nameservers.\n\nThat's it!\n\n\nAfter doing this what should the a record point to for the domain checkin.cards?

For example, if you want to register `ns1.checkin.cards`, enter `ns1`.\n   - Enter the IP address provided by your hosting provider into the IP address field. This IP address should point to your server running the DNS service.\n\n6. **Repeat for additional nameservers.**\n   - For redundancy, it's common to set up at least two nameservers, such as `ns1.checkin.cards` and `ns2.checkin.cards`.\n\n### Setting Up Corresponding A Records\n\n1. **Create A Records for Nameservers.**\n   - Still in the **Advanced DNS** tab, find the **Host Records** section.\n   - Click on **Add New Record**.\n   - Select **A Record** from the dropdown.\n\n2. **Enter A Record details for `ns1`.**\n   - **Host:** Enter `ns1`.\n   - **Value:** Enter the IP address for `ns1` (provided by your hosting provider).\n\n3. **Enter A Record details for `ns2`.**\n   - **Host:** Enter `ns2`.\n   - **Value:** Enter the IP address for `ns2` (this should be different from `ns1` for redundancy).\n\n4. **Save the Records.**\n\n### Example Setup\n\nIf your hosting provider gives you the following IP addresses:\n- `ns1.checkin.cards` -> 192.0.2.1\n- `ns2.checkin.cards` -> 192.0.2.2\n\nYour A Record configuration in the Namecheap Advanced DNS tab would look like this:\n\n- **A Record:**\n  - **Host:** `ns1`\n  - **Value:** `192.0.2.1`\n\n- **A Record:**\n  - **Host:** `ns2`\n  - **Value:** `192.0.2.2`\n\n### Summary\n\n1. Register `ns1.checkin.cards` and `ns2.checkin.cards` as personal nameservers in Namecheap.\n2. Create A Records pointing `ns1` to 192.0.2.1 and `ns2` to 192.0.2.2.\n\nOnce these steps are completed, your personal nameservers should be properly registered and associated with the appropriate IP addresses. Ensure you also update the DNS settings for `checkin.cards` to use these new nameservers if you want the domain to start resolving through them.\n\nIf you follow these steps, anyone performing a WHOIS check will see your custom nameservers instead of the hosting company's nameservers, and you will have simplified the process of managing DNS updates in the future.",
