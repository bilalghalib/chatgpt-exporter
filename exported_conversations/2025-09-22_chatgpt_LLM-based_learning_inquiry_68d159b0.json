Regardless of what the future may hold, learners will need support to develop capacities to learn about, care for and take action to protect our world. How do you imagine the future for our planet and its people? What skills, attitudes, and knowledge do people need in order to design a future for our planet that leads to healthier outcomes for people and nature? What are the learning solutions that can develop knowledge, attitudes, and skills to enact that future? How might we change minds and behaviors to achieve positive impacts for the immense biodiversity of our planet and its people?\n\nBuilding the future we want for our planet and its people involves designing for that future today. What we have learned from across disciplines is likely to inform successful teaching and learning approaches to these complex, rapidly changing, and interconnected challenges.\n\nTo meet this future we will need to develop and scale models of what effective learning looks like – not just in formal education but also in informal and community education spaces, through career-connected learning, and with learners of any age from young children to adults.\n\nOur Approach to Education\nNational Geographic is where education meets exploration. A pillar of our mission since our founding, education shapes how we engage with each other and our surroundings and inspires educators and learners to illuminate and protect the wonder of our world.\n\nAt NGS we fund bold, innovative, and transformative work. We believe that while science provides us with the facts, solutions and data we need to better understand the world around us, and storytelling provides the emotional connection that inspires us to care about the world, education prepares us with the knowledge, skills and tools to take action to protect the planet.\n\nWe view education as both a discipline and a practice. We define education as the process and methods of teaching and learning where learners of any age acquire and cultivate attitudes, skills, and knowledge.\n\nWe also hold an expansive view of educators, defining an educator as any learning professional or community member who imparts knowledge in such a way as to enable conditions for change in a learner.\n\nWe believe that learners can be any age, from a young child to an adult learner, and we believe that lifelong learning matters. We also believe that learning can happen anywhere – in school or out of school, through formal or informal education, and in a variety of settings.\n\nThrough our grants program we are looking for education projects that:\nAdvance knowledge about how to spark curiosity and inspire learners of all ages to care for and protect our world\nPilot new, or scale proven, educational solutions\nEnable learners to acquire new knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes that help them care for and protect our world\nUse interdisciplinary approaches\nWhat We Aim to Fund with this Call\nThis funding opportunity supports projects or research that enacts the future today. We aim to support projects that cultivate in learners of any age the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to take action in ways that benefit the planet and its people.\n\nProposals may contain one or both elements of the following:\nProject: a pilot of a new learning solution, or scaling of a learning solution with some evidence of effectiveness, to a new geography or population of learners;\nResearch: Measurement of the effectiveness of educational innovations that develop learners of all ages’ skills, attitudes, and knowledge needed to design a future for our planet that benefits people and nature.\nCompetitive Proposals\nCompetitive proposals should describe:\n\nThe future that you are planning toward.\nEducational projects or research that leverage novel approaches, with potential for scale and impact, and ideas that span disciplinary, political, geographic, or cultural boundaries.\nThe community of learners you intend to reach.\nThe learning solution intended to develop capabilities in learners.\nThe skills, attitudes, and knowledge your project intends to cultivate in learners in order to design a future for our planet that leads to healthier outcomes for people and nature to live and thrive.\nAnticipated outcomes including the intended impact(s) on the learners in addition to any impact(s) on the environment, planet, or people. Impacts should describe the knowledge, attitudes or skills to develop solutions that mutually benefit humans, ecosystems and the planet, and contribute to the knowledge base of how we develop knowledge, attitudes, and skills in people.\nRelevant inclusive methodologies employed in project or research design\nProjects do not need to use technology in order to be competitive, but may use technology as a tool to achieve learning goals. All topics related to our focus areas – Ocean, Land, Wildlife, Human Histories and Cultures, Planetary Health, and Space – are encouraged and will be considered.\n\nWho Should Apply\nThis highly competitive opportunity is open to applicants over the age of 18. Funding may be awarded in either a Level I or Level II grant. Please note that individuals who are National Geographic Explorers must apply for Level II funding. \n\nThe lead applicant must show evidence of experience using education as part of a deliberate strategy to achieve goals, and experience implementing education programs for learners of any age (note: this may be in a classroom setting or any other formal or informal place of learning). Academic degrees and/or credentials are NOT required.\n\nFour brigade members of Fuegas, in the town of La Rinconada, north of Córdoba, light up the sky with their flashlights. This happened on their way back from first aid training, to which the firefighters of La Rinconada, a town north of Córdoba, had invited them. On the way back, they stopped to look at the constellations, searching for shapes resembling the fire.\nEligibility\nProject must align to the Education primary focus\nProject must align to at least one of National Geographic’s six focus areas: Ocean, Land, Wildlife, Human Histories and Cultures, Planetary Health, Space\nCandidate must not be a current National Geographic staff member\nCandidate must be over the age of 18\nAdditional information on eligibility is available in our online application system.\nWebinars\nThe National Geographic Society will host two one-hour informational webinars dedicated to this Request for Proposals (RfP). There is no need to attend more than one webinar as the information presented will be the same. \n\nThursday, October 9th at 12:00 UTC/8:00 AM EDT\n\nFriday, October 10th at 19:00 UTC/3:00 PM EDT\n\nDuring these webinars we will share information about the RfP and answer questions. If you are interested in participating in a webinar, please register here. \n\nIf you have questions not answered here or in the Frequently Asked Questions page, please email us at funding@ngs.org with “Future of Learning RfP” in the subject line.\n\napply now\nPhoto credits: Krystle Hickman, Natalia Roca\n\n\nGet updates about our critical work to explore and protect our planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Geographic Society\nNational Geographic Society\nis a 501 (C)(3) organization.\n\nNational Geographic Headquarters\n1145 17th Street NW\nWashington, DC 20036\n\nContact us \nConnect With Us\nFacebook-official\n Twitter\n Instagram\n Youtube\n Linkedin\nCareers  |  Newsroom  |  Ethics  |  State Disclosures |  Terms of Service |   Privacy Notice  | Your Privacy Choices\n\n© 1996 – 2025 National Geographic Society.

Specifically, I am investigating how these tools can be designed not only for content delivery, but to:  \n- strengthen learners’ **memory, reflection, and critical thinking**,  \n- support **lifelong learning practices** that expand curiosity, and  \n- foster **community-based knowledge building** that equips people to care for each other and the planet.  \n\nIn this sense, my focus is less on AI as a productivity tool and more on how it can **enable deeper, values-aligned learning experiences**—helping learners develop the skills, attitudes, and knowledge needed to design a more sustainable future.  \n\nWould a project that pilots or researches such approaches—situated within your focus areas (e.g. planetary health, human histories and cultures, etc.)—be eligible for consideration under this RfP?  \n\nThank you for your guidance and for the opportunity to contribute to this important exploration of the future of learning.  \n\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib  \n\n---\n\n👉 This wording:  \n- Puts the **future-of-learning frame first** (not the tech itself).  \n- Shows **alignment with their goals** (skills, attitudes, caring for the planet).  \n- Differentiates your approach from mainstream AI use (“not just productivity, but memory, reflection, and community”).  \n- Invites them to confirm whether LLMs are welcome in proposals.  \n\nWould you like me to also draft a **shorter version** you could paste into the Q&A chat during their October 9/10 webinars (like a 2-sentence version of this)?",
