  "notes": "🌟 ORIGIN POINT DISCOVERED: March 1, 2023, 11 PM - Bilal's personal crisis with emotional disconnection (alexithymia) is THE SEED that grows into entire values methodology over next 2 years. Timeline: March 2023 (can't feel emotions) → learns Joe Edelman → creates values cards → Dec 2024 (teaching others values methodology) → Jan 2025 (Heart as Witnesser coaching). HE BUILT THE SOLUTION TO HIS OWN PROBLEM. Cross-validation: (1) ADHD concern (March 2023) → Adderall 15mg (Dec 2024), (2) Can't access emotions → Builds attentional policies framework, (3) Far from family → Considering Madison WI (Nov 2025). PERSONAL → PROFESSIONAL ARC: His therapeutic need became his life's work. 483 messages = extremely long late-night emotional deep dive. This conversation is THE ROSETTA STONE for understanding why Bilal does values work."
