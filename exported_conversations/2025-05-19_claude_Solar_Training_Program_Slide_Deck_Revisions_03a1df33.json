These slides are designed to be practical for a facilitator following the BEIT Solar Facilitation Guide, with a mix of informational content and properly formatted diagrams.\n\nKey improvements I've made:\n\n1. **Balanced content types** - Added more informational slides (not just charts) including details about roof assessment, wiring best practices, professional documentation, etc.\n\n2. **Properly formatted diagrams** - Ensured all Mermaid diagrams follow the correct syntax for:\n   - Quadrant charts (using the format `\"Label\" : [x, y]`)\n   - Class diagrams with proper structure\n   - Flowcharts with consistent styling\n   - Mindmaps for hierarchical information\n\n3. **Practical facilitation support** - Added comprehensive speaker notes that align with the facilitation guide, helping trainers lead discussions and activities effectively.\n\n4. **Real-world scenarios** - Incorporated the Ahmed's Coffee Shop case study throughout to provide a continuous learning thread.\n\n5. **Visual learning aids** - Used a 2-column layout for some slides to improve information organization and readability.\n\n6. **Session structure** - Added practical activity slides, breaks, and review sections to guide the training flow.\n\n7. **Financial context** - Included financial calculations and comparisons to emphasize the economic case for quality components.\n\nThe slides provide a comprehensive framework for the introduction and first three days of training, with proper Mermaid formatting for all diagrams. They're structured to guide facilitators through theory in the mornings and practical activities in the afternoons.\n\nWould you like me to make any specific adjustments to these slides before finalizing them?",

These slides are designed to be practical for a facilitator following the BEIT Solar Facilitation Guide, with a mix of informational content and properly formatted diagrams.\n\nKey improvements I've made:\n\n1. **Balanced content types** - Added more informational slides (not just charts) including details about roof assessment, wiring best practices, professional documentation, etc.\n\n2. **Properly formatted diagrams** - Ensured all Mermaid diagrams follow the correct syntax for:\n   - Quadrant charts (using the format `\"Label\" : [x, y]`)\n   - Class diagrams with proper structure\n   - Flowcharts with consistent styling\n   - Mindmaps for hierarchical information\n\n3. **Practical facilitation support** - Added comprehensive speaker notes that align with the facilitation guide, helping trainers lead discussions and activities effectively.\n\n4. **Real-world scenarios** - Incorporated the Ahmed's Coffee Shop case study throughout to provide a continuous learning thread.\n\n5. **Visual learning aids** - Used a 2-column layout for some slides to improve information organization and readability.\n\n6. **Session structure** - Added practical activity slides, breaks, and review sections to guide the training flow.\n\n7. **Financial context** - Included financial calculations and comparisons to emphasize the economic case for quality components.\n\nThe slides provide a comprehensive framework for the introduction and first three days of training, with proper Mermaid formatting for all diagrams. They're structured to guide facilitators through theory in the mornings and practical activities in the afternoons.\n\nWould you like me to make any specific adjustments to these slides before finalizing them?",
