  "notes": "CRITICAL TIMELINE PIECE: This Oct 2024 conversation explains THE core tension driving Dec 2024 consulting vs small business dilemma. Bilal's ITC contract ends Dec 13, 2024, creating urgent need for income by Jan 2025. Two months later (Dec 2024 middle batch), he's still wrestling with same tension but now considering Barakanomics book as potential path. MAJOR VALIDATIONS: (1) Joséphine = French wife confirmed, (2) Wellbeing Project multi-year connection confirmed (Aaron Hurst), (3) Islamic economics + baraka is 2+ months old idea by Dec 2024, not sudden. MYSTERY: Bloom active Oct 2024, NOT mentioned Nov 2025 (Instance 2) - what happened between Oct 2024 and Nov 2025? EXTERNAL VALIDATION: Colleague's profound reflection gives us EXTERNAL theory of mind - how others perceive Bilal vs how he sees himself. BLINDSPOT IDENTIFIED: 'I don't know how to activate my network' - has valuable connections but can't leverage them for income. MISSION VS MONEY TENSION: Runs workshops for free, needs high-paying work - core undervaluation pattern."
