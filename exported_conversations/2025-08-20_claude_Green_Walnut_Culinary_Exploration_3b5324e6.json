  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user inquired about making a meal using green walnuts, specifically excluding coffee-based preparations. Claude provided several traditional savory options including Persian-style green walnut pickle, Middle Eastern green walnut stews, and stuffed green walnuts. Claude emphasized the importance of proper preparation techniques, including the need for gloves due to staining, multiple blanching steps to remove bitterness, and the critical timing window when walnuts must be soft enough for a needle to pierce through the shell.\n\nWhen the user clarified that their walnuts had green husks but hard shells, Claude explained this indicated the walnuts were past the optimal green walnut stage. At this point, traditional green walnut preparations would not work effectively since these dishes require the soft, jelly-like stage before shell hardening. Claude suggested the limited remaining options were removing the husk to check kernel development, using the hulls for natural dyeing, or composting them. The conversation demonstrated Claude's ability to adjust recommendations based on the specific condition and developmental stage of the ingredient, emphasizing how timing affects traditional preservation and cooking methods.",

You'd blanch the green walnuts to remove bitterness, then stuff them with garlic, herbs, and spices, and pickle them in vinegar. They become tender and tangy, often served alongside rice dishes or grilled meats.\n\n**Green Walnut Stew** - In some Middle Eastern cuisines, green walnuts are added to lamb or chicken stews. The nuts break down slightly during cooking, thickening the sauce and adding a unique earthy flavor.\n\n**Stuffed Green Walnuts** - You can hollow out larger green walnuts and stuff them with a mixture of rice, herbs, and ground meat, then braise them.\n\nA word of caution though - green walnuts require proper preparation since they contain tannins that make them quite bitter raw. You'll need to wear gloves (they stain badly) and usually blanch them multiple times. The window for harvesting is also narrow - they need to be soft enough that a needle can pierce through the shell easily.\n\nHave you actually sourced green walnuts, or are you still in the planning phase? They're not commonly available in most places.",
