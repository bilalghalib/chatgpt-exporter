      "content": "Turn this text into a ten slide deck with titles:\nWhy values matter: \nValues are the things that make a sense in themselves, that are worth doing just for the sake of themselves. They are your current estimations of truth. They represent your answer to the question of ‘how to live’. Values tell you how to spend your time, right here, right now. Some sets of values will fail to produce the results you want. They may leave you feeling restless and unfulfilled. Other sets of values bring you closer to a feeling of congruence. When you act with integrity to values that are themselves aligned with universal principles, such as beauty, truth and goodness, you get the best possible results. \n\nOne way to understand the importance of values is by considering the top regrets of the dying. Among the five most common regrets, two stand out: \"I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me\" and \"I wish I hadn't worked so hard.\" The top regrets of the dying highlight the importance of living true to ourselves and prioritizing our own values over external expectations. Contrary to the myth that conventional notions of success lead to happiness, true happiness comes from living in alignment with our values. When we live true to ourselves, we can experience greater fulfillment and satisfaction. This value-aligned living involves making choices that reflect our deepest convictions and gradually touching onto what is sacred in life—beauty, truth, and goodness.\n\nShould you accept the job you’ve been offered? Should you pursue a new relationship now?\n\nWhen you’re confronted with such a decision, you pull out your list and check the prioritization of values. Then ask yourself, “What would a person with these values choose to do in this situation?” It’s usually the prioritization of your values that will answer the question.\n\nExperimenting with our values and updating them can help us create the results we want. Values act as our compass to guide us in the direction that takes us closer and closer to our definition of the “best” life we could possibly live. The “best” is your own ideal, but generally as you get closer to this ideal, you’ll enjoy increasingly positive shades of “better” even if you never reach “best.”\n\nKnowing our values provides us with clarity and focus, and the ultimate goal of discovering our values is to improve the results we get in the areas that matter most to us. By reflecting on our values, we can align our lives with what truly matters and create a sense of meaning and purpose.\n",
