We aim to address key targets within this goal, promoting sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation. Our quantifiable impact metrics include: 1. Land Restoration: Through partnerships with organizations like the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative (LRI) NGO, we conducted experiments on 120 trees planted in December 2023, contributing to Target 15.3 (land degradation neutrality). Future collaborations, such as the upcoming pilot project with GreenLeb in March 2024, further this goal. 2. Biodiversity Enhancement: We seek to boost biodiversity by promoting natural fertilizers. Target 15.9, emphasizing the integration of ecosystems and biodiversity into planning, guides our efforts, with a targeted 20% increase in the diversity of flora and fauna where our pellets are applied. 3. Water Conservation: Anticipating a 25% reduction in water consumption for irrigation, our pellets, by reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and enhancing soil water retention, contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. 4. Economic Empowerment: Contributing to SDG 1 and SDG 8, our initiative creates income streams for shepherds and generates jobs. We currently empower eight families in our workshop and 15 shepherd families annually. As our business expands, we aim to uplift more families out of poverty. 5. Carbon Emission Reduction: While indirectly linked to SDG 15, our efforts reduce the burning of sheep wool and the carbon footprint in agriculture, contributing to SDG 13. Over our three working years, we have successfully reduced 200 tons of CO2 emissions.Through these quantifiable goals, we envision a holistic impact aligned with SDG 15 and intersecting with other critical sustainability objectives.\tEntrepreneurship:::Tech & Innovation\t\"4.2.

Simultaneously, Lebanese farmers, particularly in regions like Aarsal, face severe economic challenges due to high input costs. Our data, for example, shows conventional fertilizer costing $278.5 per 320m², hindering profitability. We identified this dual problem through direct observation of both the pervasive waste and the struggles of local farmers. Our data analysis, demonstrating SoilPlus's ability to significantly reduce costs and increase profits (with a 293% ROI), confirmed the viability of our upcycling solution. This provides a sustainable and economically beneficial alternative, turning a waste problem into a resource for struggling farmers.\tOur Startup: GRADE A PLUS GRADE A PLUS is a Lebanese startup dedicated to transforming environmental challenges into sustainable economic opportunities. We address the pressing issue of sheep wool waste, of which Lebanon generates 2,500 tons annually, by upcycling it into high-value agricultural and other sustainable products. Recognizing the economic hardships faced by Lebanese farmers, particularly in regions like Aarsal, we've developed innovative solutions that not only mitigate waste but also enhance agricultural productivity and profitability. Our Solution: SoilPlus and SoilPlus Pro Our flagship products, SoilPlus and SoilPlus Pro, are soil enhancers made from 100% upcycled sheep wool. They offer a sustainable alternative to conventional fertilizers, addressing both environmental and economic concerns. •\tSoilPlus: As shown in the provided data, SoilPlus demonstrates exceptional cost-effectiveness. With a total cost of $194.8 per 320m², it significantly reduces input costs for farmers compared to conventional 20-20-20 fertilizer, which costs $278.5. Moreover, despite a lower initial investment, SoilPlus delivers the highest profit ($570.7) and a remarkable 293% return on investment (ROI), primarily attributed to the higher selling price per kg ($0.8) of the produce grown with it. •\tSoilPlus Pro: While slightly more costly at $221.6 per 320m², SoilPlus Pro also offers a cost-effective solution compared to conventional fertilizers. It delivers a substantial yield (1255.25 kg) and a profit of $280.5, representing a 127% ROI. Key Benefits: •\tCost Reduction: Both SoilPlus and SoilPlus Pro significantly reduce input costs for farmers compared to conventional fertilizers. •\tIncreased Profitability: SoilPlus, in particular, demonstrates a significantly higher profit margin and ROI. •\tSustainable Agriculture: By upcycling sheep wool, we reduce waste and promote environmentally friendly farming practices. •\tImproved Soil Health: Our products enhance soil structure and water retention, leading to healthier crops. •\tLocal Economic Development: We support Lebanese farmers and contribute to the economic resilience of rural communities. Our Vision: We envision a future where waste is transformed into valuable resources, and sustainable agriculture empowers Lebanese farmers.

These challenges include:  Lack of Job Opportunities – Many skilled individuals struggle to find work that matches their expertise. Limited Global Connections – Syrian freelancers often lack direct access to international clients and businesses. Payment & Financial Restrictions – Due to banking sanctions, most international payment platforms (e.g., PayPal) are inaccessible, making it difficult for freelancers to receive payments securely. Trust & Quality Concerns – Clients hesitate to hire freelancers due to uncertainties about work quality and payment security. How I Identified the Problem: As a professional deeply involved in business and economic challenges in Syria, I noticed that many highly skilled Syrians were struggling to find work despite their talent. Conversations with freelancers, students, and professionals highlighted the same recurring issues: a lack of access to jobs, difficulty in receiving payments, and a lack of trust between service providers and clients.

Today, Syria is experiencing a new phase of hope and construction, as the Syrian people seek to restore their normal lives and build a better future for their future generations. However, with increasing hope, crime remains one of the main challenges that threaten security and stability. Our project, “The Smart System for Detecting and Preventing Crimes in Real Time,” comes not only as an advanced technological solution, but as part of these national efforts to rebuild a safe and stable Syria. This smart system enhances the ability of the authorities to respond quickly and effectively to crimes, which contributes to creating a safe environment in which citizens live in peace and security. The challenge lies in applying modern technological solutions to achieve the desired security in a country suffering from the consequences of war. The smart system for detecting and preventing crimes in real time relies on the use of artificial intelligence technologies and data analysis to provide accurate predictions and immediate notifications to the relevant authorities, enabling them to take the necessary measures quickly and effectively. This system is not limited to data analysis only, but also includes the use of smart devices and advanced monitoring to ensure the system is implemented comprehensively and effectively. The smart crime detection and analysis system includes an integrated system for collecting data from multiple sources such as surveillance cameras, smart sensors, and citizen reports. This data is analyzed using deep learning and neural network techniques to detect unusual patterns and suspicious behaviors, allowing authorities to take proactive measures to prevent crimes before they occur. In addition, the system can provide periodic analytical reports that help improve security policies and identify areas most vulnerable to crime. Achieving security and stability in Syria depends on the combined efforts of society, government, and pioneering technological initiatives. Through joint work between all parties, the smart crime detection and prevention system can achieve tangible results and enhance the ability of Syrian society to confront security challenges and achieve safety and prosperity for all. Hope and optimism for a better future should be the main motivation behind adopting such smart solutions, as they can contribute to rebuilding a Syrian society that lives in peace and harmony, capable of overcoming challenges and difficulties and building a prosperous future for future generations.\tTech & Innovation\t3.1.

Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research\"\t1\tNo\tNo sales yet\tYes\tNo\tN/A\tN/A\tSTEM education, particularly math and physics, is often too rigid, theoretical, and disengaging for high school students (Grades 10–12). Many struggle to grasp core concepts, leading to low comprehension rates and high dropout rates. Traditional teaching methods fail to cater to individual learning styles, making students lose interest or confidence in STEM subjects.   Additionally, students who need personalized attention often do not receive it due to large class sizes and limited teacher availability.  As a math and physics tutor, I observed that students have different ways of absorbing information—some learn best through visual aids, others through real-world applications or interactive problem-solving. Yet, traditional education doesn’t adapt to these differences, causing frustration, disengagement, and poor retention.\tI am launching Towers, an offline educational center that integrates AI-powered support to:  Personalize tutoring based on each student’s unique learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or logical). Implement an AI assistant to provide real-time guidance and ensure students receive instant, tailored support during lessons. Deliver accurate performance feedback  so students can track their strengths and weaknesses with precise recommendations for improvement.

Many families struggle to find comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment options that address both physical and cognitive health. Traditional therapies often lack a holistic approach, leaving children without the full range of care needed for their well-being. The need for pain management, rehabilitation, and regenerative medicine has also been increasing. We identified this issue through extensive research, direct engagement with affected families, and consultations with medical professionals who highlighted the lack of integrated solutions.\tOur startup, The Holistic and Regenerative Wellness Center, is a one-of-a-kind facility designed to provide comprehensive, multidisciplinary care for children with complex health challenges.   Key Offerings: Holistic Medicine: Integrating traditional treatments with alternative therapies such as stem cell therapy, ozone therapy, and electromagnetic (RIFE) therapy to support immune function and manage conditions like cancer and autism. Rehabilitation Services: Physical, occupational, and cognitive therapy programs that aid in motor and neurological development for conditions like ADHD and cerebral palsy. Pain and Wellness Therapies: Innovative solutions including cryotherapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for pain management and mental health conditions. Educational Programs: Cognitive development programs and speech therapy to promote social inclusion. Community Engagement: Workshops and events that educate families and healthcare professionals about emerging therapeutic approaches. By integrating state-of-the-art technology, cutting-edge regenerative medicine, and a patient-centric model, the center ensures a well-rounded, holistic approach to pediatric healthcare.\tYes\tAmerican University of Beirut, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Diploma\tPartner Organization \tWe believe this program will provide invaluable mentorship, networking, and resources to help us scale our initiative and enhance our impact.

I have witnessed firsthand the challenges waste collectors and manufacturers face in the plastic recycling value chain. Professionally, I am driven by the opportunity to leverage digital solutions to create economic opportunities for waste collectors while reducing plastic pollution. Personally, my passion for environmental conservation and social equity fuels my commitment to making coastal communities cleaner and more sustainable. The chance to bring innovation to this space excites me, as I believe technology can bridge existing gaps and create an inclusive, transparent, and profitable recycling ecosystem.\tAs a Co-Founder of Coastal Clean Up, my main role is leading strategic development, partnerships, and operational execution. I focus on ensuring that our model is both impactful and scalable by integrating innovative approaches to plastic waste management. My strengths lie in program management, business development, and stakeholder engagement. I bring experience in designing and implementing sustainability initiatives, leveraging technology for social impact, and building strategic collaborations with manufacturers, waste collectors, and policymakers. Also, my background in gender empowerment ensures inclusivity in our approach, creating opportunities for underserved communities, particularly women in waste collection and recycling. \tN/A\tFemale\t25-29\tKenya\tKenya\t254722778160\t2024-07-08\tKenya\tYes\tRenewables & Environment\tSDG GOAL 5: Gender Equality:::SDG GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:::SDG GOAL 14: Life Below Water:::SDG GOAL 13: Climate Action:::SDG GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\tThrough Coastal Clean Up, we aspire to create a measurable environmental, social, and economic impact aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—particularly SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water).

Many waste collectors lack direct access to buyers, resulting in low earnings, inefficiencies in recycling, and a disconnect between waste sources and manufacturers. During our involvement in coastal clean-up initiatives, we observed massive plastic accumulation along shorelines and waterways. Conversations with local waste pickers and community members revealed key challenges: Limited market access: Collectors struggle to find consistent buyers, often relying on middlemen who offer low prices. Lack of fair compensation: Manual collection is labor-intensive, yet collectors earn little due to pricing inefficiencies. Inefficient recycling systems: Manufacturers face difficulties sourcing high-quality, sorted recyclables. This gap between waste collection and recycling markets led us to develop a tech-enabled solution—a digital waste marketplace that connects collectors directly to buyers, ensuring fair pay, efficient transactions, and increased plastic recycling rates.\tOur startup, Coastal Clean Up, is a tech-driven circular economy venture that focuses on tackling plastic pollution in coastal regions. We empower waste collectors by providing direct access to buyers (manufacturers & recyclers) through a digital waste marketplace. Solution: We have developed a mobile app that enables: Digital Waste Tracking – Waste collectors can log their plastic collections, receive digital receipts, and track earnings. Instant Payments – Secure mobile money transactions ensure real-time payouts for waste collected. Marketplace Feature – Connects waste collectors directly with manufacturers and recyclers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair prices. Impact: By streamlining plastic collection, tracking, and sales, our solution promotes fair wages, waste reduction, and increased recycling rates, driving a sustainable, scalable, and inclusive circular economy model.\tNo\tThis is the first this year\tBloom Social Media \tLooking forward to this opportunity\tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tKenya\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nGudtolli in ACSI4\tLeila khalife\tgudtollilb@gmail.com\tGudtolli\tEmpowering Women: One of the most fulfilling aspects of my role at Gudtolli Lebanese Fresh Pasta is seeing the direct impact we have on women's lives.

How we identified it: Through extensive research, interviews with local artisans and small business owners, and direct market experience, we identified that many MSMEs face common challenges: high barriers to entry in e-commerce, lack of financial literacy, and limited access to payment and logistics solutions. Women entrepreneurs, in particular, struggle with digital visibility, making it difficult for them to compete in online marketplaces. This gap in market access and digital inclusion inspired the creation of Scout.\tScout is a digital marketplace designed to empower MSMEs—especially women-led businesses—by providing them with a seamless, accessible, and growth-oriented e-commerce platform. Our solution tackles the challenges of market access, financial inclusion, and digital transformation by offering: - A Tailored E-Commerce Platform: Scout provides an easy-to-use online marketplace where MSMEs can showcase and sell their products without the technical and financial barriers of setting up independent e-commerce stores. - Integrated Financial & Payment Solutions: We facilitate digital payments, ensuring businesses that previously relied on cash-based transactions can securely and efficiently receive payments online. - Logistics & Fulfillment Support: We partner with logistics providers to simplify shipping, making it easier for sellers to reach customers beyond their local markets. - Business Growth Tools & Training: We offer digital literacy training, marketing support, and analytics tools to help sellers optimize their sales and grow sustainably. - A Focus on Sustainable & Handmade Products: Our marketplace prioritizes ethically sourced, handmade, and eco-friendly products, aligning with sustainability goals while preserving cultural heritage.  Through this approach, Scout is not just an e-commerce platform—it is a growth engine for MSMEs, enabling them to thrive in the digital economy while fostering financial independence and market expansion.\tYes\t- Join Fincubator by JOPACC (March 2023 to March 2024) - WIn Fellowship by Atlantic Council (Nov 2024 - April 2025)\tPartner Organization \tAt Scout, we believe that digital inclusion is key to economic empowerment. Our mission goes beyond just providing an online marketplace—we are building a thriving ecosystem where MSMEs, particularly women-led businesses, can grow, compete, and sustain themselves in the digital economy.  We are actively working on expanding partnerships with financial institutions, logistics providers, and ecosystem enablers to offer more value-added services to our sellers. Additionally, we are exploring AI-driven product recommendations and data-driven insights to help businesses optimize their sales strategies.  Support from this initiative would help us accelerate our impact, enhance our platform’s capabilities, onboard more underserved businesses, and scale our reach beyond local markets. We are excited about the opportunity to collaborate, learn, and grow through this program.\tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tdara@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tnot idea/prototype\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nThe Idea Chamber in ACSI4\tZidane Sami Ahmad Mitoubssi\tzmitoubssi@gmail.com\tThe Idea Chamber\twe’re creating through our social hub.

They noticed that many homes and farms in rural areas had water leaks and contamination problems, and they spent a lot of money trying to find the leaks and/or contamination and solve them. However, this offline approach failed because there were no smart online solution systems available to quickly locate leaks, define the type of contamination, and alert users to any unusual usage.   Moreover, the same thing happened when they were staying at different buildings and hotels in urban areas in the Middle East and Africa for events and learned there was a problem with water leaks; those hotels forced them to move to another floor because they needed to perform urgent maintenance due to the damage caused by the leaks; it was noisy, and they were very unhappy about it. Also, there was a significant water loss that increased the cost of the bill. These challenges inspired us to develop long-lasting technologies.\tFounders: 1.

My job is to make sure that our platform works well for both families and workers \"Heroes\" by turning real-world housework challenges into practical tech solutions.  One of my biggest strengths is adaptability. I started my career in healthcare, providing direct patient care and helping families manage their needs. Over time, I saw how technology could make house-based services easier and more efficient, so I took the initiative to learn about product development. Even though I don’t have a technical background, I worked closely with developers to understand how features are built, how data is stored, and how to improve user experience. Now, I lead efforts in writing user stories, designing features, and testing the platform to make sure it meets the needs of users.  Another strength I bring is getting things done. I make sure our team is focused on the right priorities, breaking down big challenges into clear, actionable steps. By managing tasks, setting goals, and solving problems along the way, I help keep the project moving forward.  I also value teamwork and leadership.

Goal 5: Gender equality Home Heroes empowers female house-based workers and creates a fair balance in the worker-client relationship. Working in house-based services can often leave females feeling vulnerable, which increases the risk of exploitation, abuse, or harassment. To address this, we ensure detailed job descriptions, setting clear boundaries and preventing potential misuse or unfair treatment.

The project prioritizes creating dignified and healthy working conditions for Lebanese and refugees with little to no professional skills, empowering them to earn a livelihood in a respectful and supportive environment.  In Lebanon, families have long struggled to find reliable workers for house-based services. For decades, many turned to immigrant workers for full-time assistance or hired freelancers after intensive reference checks. However, the economic crisis of 2020, followed by subsequent hardships, including a recent war, has drastically reshaped this market. Many foreign workers have left the country, and unemployment among the local workforce has skyrocketed. Poor Lebanese families and refugees, especially those with no professional skills, are struggling to survive and are at high risk of being exploited or mistreated.\tHome Heroes lb tackles the problem by matching families in need of house-based services with workers seeking jobs. Our innovative platform will use AI algorithms to connect unskilled Lebanese citizens and refugees with families, creating job opportunities for those who would otherwise struggle to find employment.  We will ensure that workers, referred to as \"Heroes,\" are placed in fair and respectful working environments, protecting their dignity and providing them with the financial stability they need to support their families. By promoting the value of house-based services, the project also works to change societal perceptions and remove the stigma around this type of work.  For families, Home Heroes lb provides a reliable and affordable solution for their household needs. This not only alleviates the difficulty of finding trusted help but also ensures that the services are accessible to low- and middle-income households.  Through this approach, our innovation reduces unemployment, provides safe and fair working opportunities, and builds a stronger, more supportive community by fostering trust and collaboration between families and workers.\tYes\tForsa III incubation program (a collaboration between Mercy Corps and Nucleus Ventures) - 2024\tBloom Alumni\tAlthough Find A Nurse has participated in several accelerators and received multiple grants, our innovative project \"Home Heroes lb\" has been turned down multiple times for the last few years.

In addition, excessive consumption of natural resources exacerbates the environmental impact, as huge quantities of products that are still usable are disposed of, increasing waste and consuming additional resources in new production processes.  How did we identify the problem? These problems were identified through extensive market research and qualitative studies with target groups, where the data showed that there is an urgent need for a platform that brings together consumers and merchants in a sustainable way, and provides an economical and low-cost alternative to buying and selling used products. Direct interaction with users, especially low-income groups and refugees, has also revealed the obstacles they face in accessing economic opportunities through e-commerce.\tCaprs  is an innovative e-commerce platform that specializes in selling used, stock, semi-new, and reproduced products, giving individuals and merchants the opportunity to recycle products and generate additional income in a sustainable way. Launched in 2022 in Jordan, the platform is the first of its kind in the region to integrate a circular economy and digital commerce, contributing to reducing product waste and supporting responsible consumption. Caprice provides a reliable marketplace that connects sellers and buyers in a safe and easy-to-use way. We address the challenges of traditional and digital trade by enabling individuals and merchants to easily sell their unused inventory through a digital platform, helping them generate additional income and reduce waste, providing economic alternatives to consumers by making products of high quality available at low prices compared to new products, reducing environmental impact by promoting a culture of reuse and reducing waste from unused products, and supporting economically vulnerable groups, such as refugees and low-income individuals, by providing sustainable income opportunities through trade. electronic.

Quality Education (SDG 4):  Objective: Provide equitable access to quality education for underserved communities. During the past 4 years we were able to serve +11000 marginalized children; either in underserved areas or special needs children with mental disability. We are planning to enroll at least 10,000 learners from marginalized backgrounds within the next two years. We have equipped 85 educational organizations with knowledge and tools for better inclusion and communication of these children. We are planning to double the number of these rehabilitation centers and organizations within the next two years. We were nominated several times for our impact and looking forward to magnify our impact and reach.  Upon analyzing the data we collect regularly from the rehabilitation centers and other educational organization we have improve student learning outcomes by at least 30% based on pre- and post-intervention assessments.  Train and give knowledge to +4000 educators, mothers and university graduates from related specialties in modern, inclusive teaching methods to foster lifelong learning opportunities within the next two years as we have reached more than 3200 of these  care givers during our past years.  2. Reduced Inequality (SDG 10):  Objective: Bridge educational and economic disparities for marginalized communities. We worked hard to reach our achievement  of 20-25% increase in access to educational resources for low-income and households and marginalized communities and we are working to double our target beneficiaries within three years.  Equipping +1200 mothers with the needed knowledge to how to better foster an autistic child through tens of awareness workshops all around the country and we are planning to triple this number within the next two years specially we have new partners like the municipalities and NGOs working with autism and special needs community.  https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1D9BchDjsz/   3. Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17):  Objective: Foster strategic partnerships to scale our impact and share resources.  Metrics:  Establish collaborations with at least +25 organizations (NGOs, educational institutions, and government bodies) within the next year. We are already in partnership with 85 educational organization across the country, more than 15 NGOs working on developing educational programs for children in general and for special needs, 3 municipalities and 2 universities with more than 8 branches to give their students and the graduates the needed skill for educational labor market.

By bridging gaps in traditional curricula, D4C ensures that participants gain expertise in inclusive and sustainable urban development, enabling them to tackle real-world challenges and design innovative public spaces. This initiative directly supports SDG 4: Quality Education, fostering lifelong learning and professional development opportunities.  D4C also actively contributes to SDG 8: Decent Work & Economic Growth by creating employment opportunities for young professionals, particularly architects and designers affected by the war in Lebanon. These professionals apply their skills in humanitarian organizations, architectural firms, or within D4C itself, focusing on sustainable, low-tech, and community-driven solutions. By strengthening economic resilience and workforce readiness, D4C ensures that participants can contribute meaningfully to their affected communities while advancing their careers.  Aligned with SDG 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities, D4C implements at least four inclusive public space projects annually, prioritizing accessibility for people with disabilities, elderly individuals, single mothers, and marginalized groups. Each project is developed through participatory design sessions, ensuring that community voices are heard in the planning and implementation of urban spaces. To further institutionalize this approach, D4C conducts awareness sessions for municipal staff, volunteers, and designers, advocating for community engagement in urban development projects.  Additionally, D4C enhances social and economic resilience through income-generating initiatives at the Nafas Community Center, such as a community kitchen that prepares 100+ meals per month for corporate clients and events. This initiative sustains the center’s operations while supporting women from the local community through employment.  Recognizing the importance of disaster preparedness, D4C also strengthens emergency response efforts by developing and piloting collective shelter models, benefiting 500+ displaced individuals annually. During the September 2024 war, D4C successfully raised $37,000 through crowdfunding, enabling the development of essential shelter guidelines for two schools.

Many graduates struggle to find opportunities in a saturated job market, leading to a talent drain as they seek work abroad. Additionally, limited experience in community-based design—a cornerstone of sustainable development—hampers the creation of inclusive public spaces that prioritize social well-being and environmental sustainability. As a result of the war, reconstruction is imminent in Lebanon. However, unplanned construction neglects community needs, exacerbating environmental degradation and social issues due to inadequate infrastructure. With minimal state support, restricted market size, and a lack of communal projects, opportunities for young architects remain limited. Without targeted interventions to expand the market, promote local initiatives, and integrate community-centered  design into professional training, Lebanon risks losing its skilled professionals while urban planning and social cohesion issues persist.\tD4C provides capacity building and job opportunities to designers and architects through creating sustainable, innovative and tailored solutions responding to community needs and fostering sustainable social impact.   D4C bridges the gap between design education and professional practice by empowering young professionals in community-centered design. It provides knowledge, methodology, and hands-on experience through interactive workshops, coaching and mentoring. Through the design and implementation of real-life projects which respond to the needs of local communities, architects and designers develop low-tech, socially conscious solutions that enhance the well-being of vulnerable households using a participatory approach. D4C aligns with humanitarian needs and SDGs, addressing Quality Education (SDG4), Decent Work and economic growth (SDG8), Reduced Inequalities (SDG10) and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11) .

Many artisans, especially women, lack access to fair wages, sustainable income, and global reach for their handmade products. Additionally, the rise of mass production has threatened traditional crafts, leading to a decline in cultural heritage preservation.  How We Identified the Problem While working closely with artisans in my community, I noticed that many skilled women were unable to earn a living despite their craftsmanship. They faced multiple challenges, including:  Lack of access to markets beyond their local areas. Unfair compensation due to middlemen undervaluing their work. Limited business and digital skills to promote and sell their handmade products. Social and economic barriers preventing financial independence. Recognizing this gap, Nahfeh Studios was born—to empower artisans, provide them with fair wages, and connect them to the global market, all while preserving and celebrating traditional crafts.\tOur Startup: Nahfeh Studios  Nahfeh Studios is an impact-driven startup dedicated to preserving traditional craftsmanship while empowering artisans—especially women and displaced communities—in the Middle East. We specialize in handmade crochet products that blend cultural heritage with contemporary design. By uniting skilled artisans through initiatives like the “1 Square Initiative,” we create unique, high-quality items that resonate with global consumers while providing a sustainable source of income for our craft communities.  Our Solution  Our solution addresses the dual challenge of economic hardship and cultural erosion.

Farmers often rely on traditional irrigation methods that waste up to 50% of water and apply fertilizers inefficiently, harming both productivity and the environment.  We first identified this issue through direct engagement with farmers in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon’s largest agricultural region. Many farmers shared concerns about water shortages, rising costs, and unpredictable weather conditions affecting their crops. Through field visits and discussions, we observed that most irrigation systems lacked automation and real-time monitoring, leading to waste and inefficiencies. Recognizing this challenge, we developed SmartLand’s climate-smart irrigation and fertigation system to provide farmers with a data-driven, automated solution that optimizes water and fertilizer use, reducing waste and improving productivity.\tSmartLand is a climate-tech startup revolutionizing agriculture in Lebanon by providing smart irrigation and fertigation solutions that optimize water and fertilizer use.

As a Namibian woman driven by the need for societal change, I am particularly inspired by programs like the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation (ACSI4). The focus of ACSI4 on communities facing crises resonates with me personally and professionally because I understand the immense challenges these communities encounter, and I see how critical it is to foster solutions that are not only sustainable but also responsive to the trauma and hardships they have experienced.  I am fueled by the desire to create platforms that can empower and connect local voices, bringing people together to innovate, collaborate, and drive positive change. The ACSI4's emphasis on mentorship, seed funding, and trauma-informed support is especially motivating because it aligns with my passion for providing the tools that entrepreneurs need to rebuild and revitalize their communities.  I firmly believe in the power of innovation to create lasting systems change. At this stage, the ACSI4's support in helping early-stage social enterprises is an opportunity to amplify the impact of solutions in Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora, and it inspires me to keep pushing forward with my own work to help communities thrive in times of crisis.    \tAs the lead of CILA, my main role is to oversee the strategic direction, community outreach, and operational implementation of our social innovation initiatives. I ensure that the goals of fostering communication and connection within local communities are met while maintaining the integrity of our mission. My responsibilities also include managing partnerships, securing funding, and providing guidance to entrepreneurs who are at the early stages of their ventures.  The strengths I bring to the team are my deep understanding of community dynamics and the challenges faced by underserved populations. My background in social innovation equips me to address complex problems with creative solutions, drawing on my ability to think critically and empathetically. I also have strong leadership skills, which help me effectively collaborate with diverse teams and inspire others to share in the vision. My experience in navigating both the social impact space and the challenges that come with trauma-informed work enables me to provide the necessary support to teams facing adversity. I am passionate about creating sustainable change, and my adaptability and resilience help drive the team towards success even in challenging circumstances.    \t  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalinasho-trading-enterprises-cc-she-farm-22b378244\tFemale\t35-39\tNamibia\tNamibia\t264812546850\t2024-05-02\tNamibia\tYes\tTechnology; General / Other\tSDG GOAL 5: Gender Equality:::SDG GOAL 10: Reduced Inequality:::SDG GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:::SDG GOAL 9: Industry / Innovation / Infrastructure\tThrough CILA, I aspire to create significant impact in the areas of sustainable cities (SDG 11) and reducing inequalities (SDG 10) by empowering local communities with the tools to innovate, communicate, and collaborate. By fostering local innovation hubs and providing a platform for marginalized voices, we aim to reduce the digital divide and increase access to critical information, resources, and opportunities.  Our goal is to engage at least 1,000 individuals in the first year, helping them connect with local solutions and entrepreneurs. We seek to increase community-led initiatives by 25%, directly impacting urban development in underserved areas. Additionally, through our outreach, we aim to reduce barriers to access for at least 500 entrepreneurs, helping them turn ideas into sustainable ventures that promote economic growth and social inclusion.  Ultimately, we want to enable communities to reduce dependency on external support by equipping them with the skills to drive their own sustainable development. This would contribute to the broader goal of building more resilient, self-sustaining cities and reducing inequality within these communities.    \tEducation & life long learning:::Tech & Innovation\t2.2.

Many communities, especially underserved areas, struggle to connect with businesses, public services, and emergency response systems, which impacts overall safety, well-being, and access to opportunities.  I first identified this issue when observing how disconnected various sectors of communities are from one another. Residents often lack awareness of essential services such as healthcare, local businesses, or public safety measures, while businesses struggle to reach potential customers within their vicinity. Additionally, during emergencies, communication breakdowns can delay response times, heightening the risk to people’s lives and property.  CILA solves this by creating a platform where residents can communicate in real-time with others within their jurisdiction, view available services, products, and business locations, and access information on crime prevention and disaster preparedness. The platform also supports community policing efforts by enabling users to report suspicious activities and emergencies quickly. This system improves emergency response times, facilitates disaster preparedness, and helps prevent crime by fostering greater community engagement and collective responsibility, ultimately building stronger, safer, and more connected neighborhoods.    \tCILA is an innovative startup that integrates Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance the efficiency of urban management and community engagement. Our solution utilizes smart devices connected to the IoT network, optimizing local authority operations and services while improving communication between citizens and their surroundings.  CILA creates a dynamic, real-time platform where users can interact with their community via a locational feed. Every member within a designated jurisdiction can connect, communicate, and view information about services, products, and business locations within their area. This empowers city residents to easily access relevant services and resources, enhancing convenience and promoting local economic growth.  Additionally, CILA plays a crucial role in urban management by enabling authorities and citizens to respond to local issues in real time. Whether it’s a community service, a product in a shop, or information related to public safety, CILA ensures that everyone stays informed, connected, and involved. This fosters stronger, more resilient communities with optimized services and improved overall quality of life.\tNo\tN/A\tBloom Newsletter\tCILA not only improves access to essential services but also fosters a sense of community and belonging. By empowering residents to interact, share information, and stay informed in real-time, we create an environment where people are actively engaged in their neighborhoods, strengthening social cohesion.  Our solution also supports sustainable urban growth by promoting local businesses and services, allowing them to reach a wider audience without the barriers of traditional marketing or infrastructure limitations. This, in turn, boosts local economies and creates jobs.  Through the integration of IoT and ICT, CILA is future-proofing communities by enabling smart city solutions that can evolve with emerging technologies. This scalable platform can adapt to any urban or rural setting, offering endless possibilities for enhancing city living, improving public safety, and streamlining local governance.  Ultimately, CILA aims to transform cities into smarter, more connected ecosystems that foster collaboration, reduce inequalities, and improve the quality of life for all residents.    \tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tShe Farm is based in Namibia\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nReef - ريف in ACSI4\tAbdallah Alkhawaldeh\tabdallahbassam9@gmail.com\tReef - ريف\tRight now, what’s driving me personally is my passion for connecting people to the land and nature, and finding real, sustainable solutions for rural and marginalized communities.

Professionally, I’m motivated by my desire to develop environmental and agricultural projects that serve as models for sustainable local production and create job opportunities for youth and refugees. I’m also deeply driven to raise environmental awareness — whether through the content I create or the projects I work on — because I truly believe that every small step makes a difference and brings us closer to a cleaner, more sustainable future.

For example, implementing rainwater harvesting systems and renewable energy can reduce emissions and enhance water security in rural areas. \t•\tSDG 2: Zero Hunger — By supporting small-scale farmers, refugees, and vulnerable communities with training and resources to produce their own food sustainably, I aim to enhance food security. My goal is to help at least 50 families establish their own productive farms within two years. \t•\tSDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities — Through educational agro-tourism experiences and community-led agricultural initiatives, I hope to foster stronger ties between people and nature, creating more sustainable, self-sufficient communities. I aspire to host 1,000 students annually in farm-based learning experiences. \t•\tSDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth — By creating local agricultural businesses and connecting them to markets, I want to generate income opportunities for rural youth and refugees. The goal is to create at least 20 job opportunities within the first year of the project. \t•\tSDG 15: Life on Land — By restoring soil health through regenerative agriculture and promoting biodiversity, I aim to protect and restore ecosystems. The target is to convert at least 10 hectares of land to sustainable farming practices in the first three years.  Impact Aspiration: I aspire to build a resilient agricultural ecosystem that not only addresses climate change but also empowers communities to thrive independently. By combining sustainable production, environmental education, and community-driven innovation, my goal is to create a replicable model that can be scaled across rural areas, transforming both lives and landscapes \tActive citizenship & civic engagement\t1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\t3\tNo\tNo sales yet\tNo\tNo\tN\\A\tN\\A\tThe Problem: In rural areas, especially in underserved communities like my hometown Maras’a, people struggle with food insecurity, unemployment, and the worsening impacts of climate change. Farmers face depleted soil, water scarcity, and rising costs of production, making it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. Youth and refugees often have limited access to decent work opportunities, and there’s a growing disconnect between people and nature, especially among younger generations.  How I Identified It: I grew up in a rural village, witnessing firsthand how climate change and economic hardship affected my community. Through my work with refugee farmers and rural populations, I saw how a lack of resources, knowledge, and market access trapped people in cycles of poverty and environmental degradation. Conversations with farmers, parents, and local youth highlighted their need for sustainable, local solutions — from learning about climate-smart practices to finding reliable ways to generate income.  This direct connection to the land and community, combined with my work as an agricultural engineer and climate activist, made the problem impossible to ignore. I realized that by blending sustainable farming, environmental education, and community-driven innovation, we could address multiple challenges at once — creating solutions that help people, nature, and the local economy thrive together.\tMy Startup: I’m building a sustainable agricultural and eco-tourism initiative that empowers rural communities, refugees, and youth through climate-smart farming, nature-based solutions, and hands-on environmental education. The project combines regenerative agriculture, local food production, and immersive farm experiences to create a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem.  The Solution: Our initiative revolves around three core pillars: \t1.\tSustainable Agriculture & Food Security: We train local farmers, youth, and refugees in sustainable and climate-smart practices, like rainwater harvesting, composting, and crop diversification. We provide them with the tools, resources, and ongoing mentorship needed to establish their own small farms or improve existing ones — creating reliable, local food sources and enhancing livelihoods. \t2.\tEco-Tourism & Education: We offer experiential farm visits for schools and families, where participants can engage in hands-on agricultural activities, learn about sustainability, and build a deeper connection to nature. These visits generate income for the farm, while teaching the next generation about the importance of environmental stewardship. \t3.\tMarket Access & Community Resilience: We help farmers package and market their produce as premium, locally-grown products, connecting them to conscious consumers. The platform we’re building will link farms with schools, institutions, and individuals seeking educational experiences or high-quality food, fostering local economic growth.  The Impact: \t•\tImprove food security for at least 50 families within 2 years \t•\tCreate 20+ sustainable job opportunities in rural areas within the first year \t•\tConvert 10 hectares of land to sustainable farming practices within 3 years \t•\tHost 1,000+ students annually for farm-based educational experiences  This holistic approach addresses environmental, economic, and social challenges all at once — building a resilient future where communities can thrive alongside nature \tNo\tN\\A\tWord of Mouth\tNA\tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tReef - ريف is at Stage 1.1 (Want to start and looking for/testing ideas), which is earlier than ACSI4’s minimum of Stage 2.2. \tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nLoghati in ACSI4\thanin jawhari\thanin.jawhari@gmail.com\tLoghati\tWhat's motivating me is the results I am seeing with my work and it's impact on helping  people and changing their lives.

I’m dedicated to ensuring that every aspect of our operations aligns with our mission to serve our community effectively.\thttps://www.linkedin.com/in/alaa-al-zahab-59932818a\tFemale\t30-34\tLebanon\tLebanon\t96171298109\t2023-05-04\tLebanon\tYes\tEducation; General / Other\tSDG GOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being:::SDG GOAL 4: Quality Education:::SDG GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth\t Through my idea, I aspire to create a profound impact by bridging the gap between education and entrepreneurship in the community. Our unique approach, combining a coffee shop with training courses and a dedicated training room, delivers value not only through the coffee itself but more importantly in the opportunities it offers for personal and professional growth. The impact we aim to achieve aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically: 1. **SDG 4 – Quality Education:** By offering hands-on workshops, training courses, and a collaborative learning space, we create an inclusive educational environment for individuals seeking to build their skills. We aim to train at least **200 individuals per year**, providing them with professional development opportunities that directly improve their employment prospects and entrepreneurship abilities. 2. **SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth:** Through our focus on fostering entrepreneurship and skill development, we aim to have **20+ new businesses** launched annually by individuals who have completed our courses. Additionally, we are committed to providing employment to **50+ individuals**, including local baristas and instructors, creating a sustainable economic model within the community. 3. **SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production:** We are advocates for healthy living, primarily through the promotion of **organic and sustainable food options** in our coffee shop. We aim to source and introduce at least **75% of our food ingredients** from sustainable, local sources, adhering to ethical production practices. In essence, our impact is multi-dimensional: We’re not only serving coffee but nurturing a space for learning, growing, and creating new opportunities. Our goal is to make the Academy Coffee Space a vibrant hub for education, sustainable business practices, and community growth, all while contributing toward the broader global sustainability goals  Our concept is designed to be a catalyst for positive social change by integrating healthy living with quality education and economic empowerment. As the first coffee shop in the region to feature dedicated training courses and a fully-equipped training room, our goal is to achieve measurable impacts aligned with key SDGs:  SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being): We aim to serve healthy food options daily, targeting at least 100 nutritious meals per day that promote well-being and reduce reliance on less healthy alternatives.  SDG 4 (Quality Education): Through our training courses, we plan to host a minimum of 10 courses per month in our training room. This initiative is projected to reach over 1,200 participants annually, equipping them with vital skills in hospitality, healthy living, and entrepreneurship.  SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): By managing and expanding our operations, we anticipate creating 15–20 local job opportunities, from baristas to administrative roles, and fostering a culture of continuous professional development.  In summary, our coffee shop not only provides a welcoming space for healthy eating but also serves as a community hub for learning and empowerment. This integrated approach is designed to drive both immediate and long-term socioeconomic improvements, making a tangible difference in our community.\tEducation & life long learning:::Entrepreneurship:::Tech & Innovation\t\"4.1. Declining revenues, and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\"\t6\tYes\tStagnant\tNo\tNo\thttps://www.instagram.com/academy.coffeespace/\thttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12zQ3NciKreOD2vozvE88qQuI_g4JbJxS/view?usp=sharing\tOur primary problem is the lack of accessible and healthy food options, coupled with a gap in affordable, quality educational resources for local communities. Additionally, local job opportunities in the hospitality and wellness sectors remain underdeveloped in the region. I first identified this issue through firsthand experience while interacting with the community. Many people expressed frustration with the limited availability of healthy food options in local coffee outlets, often resulting in unhealthy choices that affect their well-being. Furthermore, I noticed that there was a lack of accessible educational spaces that provided practical skills for employment—particularly associated with sustainability and wellness practices. I realized that our community needed a place that both nurtured health-conscious eating habits and provided accessible training for various skills that could empower individuals economically. Combining these elements into one innovative concept— a coffee shop with an integrated training facility—felt like the right solution to address these pressing needs  The core problem we're addressing is the absence of a community space that simultaneously promotes healthy living and provides accessible education and professional development opportunities. In our region, most coffee shops focus solely on serving beverages and snacks, often lacking nutritious food options and a venue for learning. This gap means that many community members miss out on opportunities to enhance their skills, particularly in areas like hospitality, healthy lifestyle practices, and entrepreneurship.  I first identified this issue while closely following courses and events at the academy. Through interactions with community members and feedback from local participants, it became clear that there was a strong demand for a space where people could not only enjoy a healthy meal but also learn and grow professionally. This insight inspired our concept—the first coffee shop equipped with dedicated training courses and a fully functional training room. By integrating these elements, we aim to create a hub that nurtures both physical well-being and personal development, addressing critical needs in our community.\tShare   You said: ماذا نسمي الجمهور الذي يكون يحضر البرامج في الاستديو باللغة الإنكليزية؟  ChatGPT said: الجمهور الذي يحضر البرامج في الاستوديو يُطلق عليه باللغة الإنجليزية \"Studio Audience\".

I have been born and raised in a rural area, and I have experienced and witnessed firsthand inside my family and in many many other families how the financially dependent women are bound by those who are in charge of their financials. \tReef provides a grassroots solution by providing those women with access to job opportunities with the skills they already have and by professionalizing those skills so that they are able to generate income. We train women on food safety, culinary arts and basic business and computer skills so that they can turn their kitchens into income-generating stations. This solution offers women coming from remote and very conservative societies who are unable to access income-generating opportunities the chance for financial freedom that is directly linked to their personal freedom. \tYes\tREAF program by Berytech \tBloom Social Media \tNA\tApplied to ACSI4\tACSI4\tjad.azzam@bloom.pm\tNo\t#ERROR!\t\t\tReef is at Stage 4.2 (Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but not yet profitable/sustainable)\tACSI4 - Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation - Applicants\nAhla Fawda in ACSI4\tZiad Daouk\tahlafawda@gmail.com\tAhla Fawda\tI am personally and professionally motivated by the opportunity to create sustainable, community-driven impact through design, operations, and environmental initiatives.

Ahla Fawda has been at the forefront of emergency response, sustainable development, and social impact initiatives, leveraging its EcoHub as a center for recycling, upcycling, education, and green entrepreneurship. The EcoHub currently processes over 2 tons of waste per month, runs educational programs on sustainability, and empowers marginalized communities through skills training and income-generating activities. Looking ahead, we plan to expand our EcoHub facilities and programs, increasing our impact on waste reduction, job creation, and circular economy solutions while strengthening partnerships that drive sustainable change.  Our work directly contributes to several Sustainable Development Goals. Under SDG 1: No Poverty, we focus on creating income-generating opportunities for vulnerable communities, particularly among women, youth, and displaced individuals, by integrating them into sustainable economic activities. By embedding financial inclusion into our initiatives, we help build long-term resilience and reduce dependency on aid. Addressing SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, we are expanding economic opportunities for at least 30 individuals through the EcoHub’s recycling, upcycling, and sustainable production initiatives. Our expansion plans will create additional green jobs in waste collection, sorting, and processing while enhancing employability through training programs such as 360 Green Vision, which equips participants with sustainable business skills, eco-design expertise, and waste management knowledge. More than 50 people per year will receive hands-on training in circular economy practices, empowering them to become active contributors to Lebanon’s emerging green economy.  In alignment with SDG 10: Reduced Inequality, Ahla Fawda is committed to fostering an inclusive environment where marginalized groups, including displaced individuals and low-income families, can participate in and benefit from sustainable economic models. The EcoHub is designed as an accessible space that ensures equal opportunities, providing a platform for skill development and financial independence. Under SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, the EcoHub functions as more than a sustainability center—it is a community space that fosters inclusive governance, transparency, and social cohesion. By actively engaging local and displaced communities in collaborative environmental projects, we strengthen social ties and build shared ownership over sustainability efforts. Each year, we facilitate at least five new community-led initiatives focused on environmental sustainability, skill-sharing programs, and inclusive decision-making, ensuring that our work extends beyond waste reduction to promote social resilience.  Under SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, the EcoHub currently processes over 2 tons of waste per month, repurposing plastic, glass, fabric, and other materials into upcycled products such as eco-friendly bags, furniture, and home accessories. As part of our expansion plans, we aim to scale up recycling and upcycling capacity by increasing collection points and processing facilities. By developing additional product lines and promoting eco-conscious consumer habits, we encourage individuals and businesses to recognize the economic value of repurposed materials. A key aspect of our work is shifting consumer mindsets by promoting sustainable consumption through community education and awareness campaigns.  Our expansion also strengthens SDG 13: Climate Action by increasing our waste management capacity and promoting zero-waste principles across all operations. We aim to scale up recycling and waste diversion efforts, targeting a 50 percent increase in waste processing capacity while reducing reliance on single-use plastics. By integrating zero-waste principles into our production processes and educational initiatives, we empower communities to adopt sustainable lifestyles and actively contribute to climate action.  Finally, our approach is grounded in SDG 17: Partnerships to Achieve Goals, as we recognize that meaningful change requires collaboration. Ahla Fawda actively builds partnerships with local businesses, municipalities, non-profits, and international organizations to amplify impact. By working alongside diverse stakeholders, we create synergies that drive sustainable development and ensure that our solutions are scalable and adaptable to different contexts.  Beyond these quantifiable outcomes, Ahla Fawda’s EcoHub provides a replicable model for community-driven sustainability, strengthens collaboration between diverse groups, and enhances local resilience in the face of economic, social, and environmental challenges. By scaling our operations and deepening our impact, we aim to expand the reach of circular economy solutions, proving that sustainable development can drive both social transformation and economic growth.\tActive citizenship & civic engagement:::Entrepreneurship:::Education & life long learning:::Good governance:::Tech & Innovation\t\"4.2.

The country faces a severe waste crisis, with limited recycling infrastructure and excessive landfill reliance, leading to environmental degradation. At the same time, economic instability and displacement have left many individuals—particularly women, youth, and marginalized groups—without access to stable income opportunities. Additionally, social cohesion has been weakened by ongoing economic and political crises, creating divisions between host and displaced communities.  We first identified these challenges through our direct engagement with communities. As a grassroots organization, we worked closely with neighborhoods affected by Lebanon’s economic collapse and environmental decline. Through our humanitarian relief work, we saw firsthand how food insecurity, unemployment, and waste mismanagement were interlinked. Communities lacked sustainable solutions for economic empowerment and environmental sustainability. This realization led us to develop the EcoHub, a circular economy model that integrates waste management, upcycling, and income-generating activities to provide long-term, community-led solutions.  By transforming waste into economic opportunities, promoting green jobs, and fostering social cohesion through collaborative environmental initiatives, Ahla Fawda is tackling these urgent challenges at their root while empowering local communities to take ownership of sustainable solutions.\tAhla Fawda is a grassroots non-profit organization that has evolved into a community-driven social enterprise, addressing waste mismanagement, unemployment, and social fragmentation in Lebanon through sustainable, circular economy solutions. Our flagship initiative, the EcoHub, is an innovative sustainability hub that integrates recycling, upcycling, and green entrepreneurship to create economic opportunities while reducing environmental impact.  The EcoHub tackles Lebanon’s severe waste crisis by processing over 2 tons of waste per month, transforming discarded plastic, glass, metal, and fabric into marketable upcycled products such as eco-friendly furniture, bags, home accessories, and fashion items. By expanding community awareness and providing educational programs on waste reduction and sustainable consumption, we aim to shift mindsets and promote a culture of environmental responsibility.  Beyond its environmental impact, the EcoHub is an engine for economic empowerment, providing income-generating opportunities for at least 30 individuals, particularly women, youth, and displaced people. Through its expansion, the initiative is increasing green job creation in waste collection, sorting, and processing, while also offering training programs such as 360 Green Vision, which equips participants with eco-business skills and employability in the green economy. By linking sustainability with economic opportunity, we ensure that environmental solutions directly benefit vulnerable communities.  The EcoHub is also a community-building space, fostering social cohesion and inclusive governance by engaging local and displaced communities in collaborative environmental projects. It brings together volunteers, artisans, and businesses to co-create solutions that enhance both sustainability and social stability. By prioritizing transparency, grassroots leadership, and community participation, Ahla Fawda ensures that its impact extends beyond waste reduction, helping to rebuild social trust and economic resilience.

Our goal is to promote healthier beauty choices by offering 100% natural, handmade, and clean products, free from harmful chemicals. By 2026, we aim to convert at least **5,000** customers to clean beauty alternatives, reducing exposure to toxic ingredients and encouraging wellness-focused routines.    In terms of sustainability, we are committed to minimizing our environmental footprint. Our use of biodegradable accessories, such as bio loofahs and scalp massagers, supports waste reduction efforts.

Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not however profitable/sustainable\"\t4\tYes\tStagnant\tYes\tNo\twww.soglam.online\tNA\tSoGlam was born out of a clear gap in the beauty market—especially in Lebanon—for natural, clean, and affordable beauty products. I noticed that many local options were either filled with harmful chemicals or high-quality alternatives were overpriced and inaccessible to the average consumer.  The turning point for me was my personal struggle to find skincare and haircare products that were both safe and effective. I became increasingly aware of how many mainstream products contained toxic ingredients that could harm long-term health. At the same time, I noticed a growing demand among women around me—friends, family, and even strangers—seeking cleaner, more natural alternatives but feeling frustrated by the lack of options that were both trustworthy and affordable.  SoGlam was my response to that problem: a brand offering 100% natural, handmade, and clean beauty products that are effective, accessible, and crafted with care. Beyond just skincare, it’s about promoting wellness, conscious consumption, and creating products that people can trust—especially in a market that often lacks transparency\tSoGlam is a Lebanese startup that offers a range of natural, handmade, and clean beauty products. Our product line includes natural fragrances, hair and body treatments, and accessories designed to complement these treatments—like bio loofahs and biodegradable scalp massagers. What sets SoGlam apart is our commitment to using only pure, non-toxic ingredients, ensuring that each product promotes wellness and beauty without compromising health.  The solution we offer is simple yet powerful: a shift towards safer, more conscious beauty routines. Many beauty products on the market today are filled with harmful chemicals that can affect both our health and the environment. SoGlam addresses this by providing affordable, high-quality alternatives that are eco-friendly and skin-friendly. Whether it’s a nourishing body oil or a gentle exfoliating scrub, our products are designed to bring out the best in your skin while aligning with a sustainable, clean lifestyle.  Our vision is to create a brand that not only provides effective solutions but also helps empower individuals—especially women—by offering products that support both self-care and environmental responsibility. We want SoGlam to be a symbol of resilience, especially in Lebanon, where we continue to craft beauty solutions that give back to our community and encourage positive change\tYes\tHermenow 2023\tBloom Alumni\tAt SoGlam, we’re incredibly eager to join this program as it represents a key opportunity for growth and expansion.

On a professional level, I’m really driven by the idea of building something meaningful and sustainable.

Some need extra help with their studies, others just haven’t found the right way to learn, and many don’t have the guidance they need at home. Unfortunately, a lot of existing tutoring options are either too expensive or take a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn’t really work for every student. We started this tutoring center—to provide a space where students get the individual attention, engaging activities, and structured support they need to succeed. Our goal isn’t just to help with schoolwork; it’s to build confidence, encourage curiosity, and make learning something they enjoy rather than fear. We aim that students become lifelong learners.  \tOur startup is a private tutoring center that goes beyond traditional tutoring. We provide students with personalized after-school support, helping them not only improve academically but also develop essential skills that will serve them in the long run. What makes us different is our holistic approach—we tailor our support to each student’s needs, incorporate interactive weekly activities to keep learning engaging, and involve parents through regular sessions and bimonthly progress reports.  Our solution addresses the common challenges students face, such as lack of individualized attention, ineffective study methods, and limited guidance at home. We provide a structured yet flexible learning environment where students can receive one-on-one or small group tutoring, participate in workshops across different fields, and develop confidence in their abilities.  In addition to academic subjects, we aim to empower students with skills that extend beyond the classroom, offering workshops in various fields and providing an inclusive learning space where they feel supported.

Additionally, there is a major gap in pet care education, leaving owners unaware of proper grooming routines, health concerns, and best practices to keep their pets happy and healthy.  🔹 How We First Identified It: 1️⃣ First-Hand Experience – As passionate pet lovers, we noticed a lack of premium, specialized pet grooming products that cater to different fur types, skin sensitivities, and hygiene needs. 2️⃣ Market Research & Customer Feedback – Talking to pet owners, groomers, and veterinarians revealed common concerns like irritation from harsh shampoos, ineffective flea treatments, and the struggle to maintain pet hygiene between grooming sessions. 3️⃣ Pet Industry Gaps – Many existing pet care products are either low-quality, heavily chemical-based, or expensive imports that don’t suit all pets. 4️⃣ Lack of Knowledge in Pet Care – We identified that most pet owners don’t have easy access to expert advice, which inspired us to create the Whiskers Live Channel, featuring veterinarians and celebrities to educate pet owners and bridge the knowledge gap.  With Whiskers, we are solving these issues by providing scientifically formulated, pet-safe grooming solutions, educating pet owners through Whiskers Live Channel, and setting new standards in luxury pet care.\t🔹 About Whiskers: Whiskers is a premium pet care brand dedicated to revolutionizing grooming and hygiene for dogs and cats.
