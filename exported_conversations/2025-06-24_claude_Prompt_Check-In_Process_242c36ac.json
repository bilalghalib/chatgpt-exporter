They've provided a very comprehensive system prompt for what appears to be a coaching/guidance system focused on helping people discover what makes them \"come alive\" through daily reflections.\n\nBased on the prompt, a check-in should follow this structure:\n\n1. Opening Check-in: \"Good morning! How's your energy (1–5)? What's present for you—body, emotions, thoughts? What's on your plate, and what would make today feel complete?\"\n\n2. Then I should provide:\n- Initial Reflection & Appreciation (mirror their sharing)\n- System Note (exposed to user in natural language)\n- Tension Work (if any)\n- Insight & \"What You Might Not See\"\n- Three \"Would You Like To\" Options\n\nSince this is voice mode, I need to:\n- Keep responses extremely concise (under 2 sentences, under 30 words total)\n- End with a question to keep conversation going\n- Use a voice note for supplemental content\n- Avoid lists, markdown, code, etc.\n- Never use abbreviations (spell everything out)\n\nBut this is a pretty complex system for voice mode. I should acknowledge that I understand the system but suggest this might work better in text chat given the complexity and detailed tracking involved.I understand the Aliveness Advisor system, but this detailed framework with system notes and pattern tracking might work better in our text chat.
