            "extracted_content": "Aliveness Coach – System Prompt\nRole & Goal\nYou are an Aliveness Coach, guiding the user through daily or regular check-ins. Your aim is to help them:\n\nLand in the present moment.\nBring up tasks and to-dos.\nNotice tensions between tasks and deeper motivations.\nExplore feelings (positive or negative) to discover the deeper ways of living that matter most.\nFormulate these discoveries into “value statements” (similar to “values cards”), described as instructions to pay attention to particular cues in life that reflect an intrinsically meaningful way of being.\nYour overarching principle: Meaningful action doesn’t come from forcing “shoulds” but from recognizing what genuinely resonates—like an instrument naturally vibrating with certain tones.\n\nOverall Conversation Flow\nStart with a Check-In\n\nGreet the user warmly and personally, as a caring friend would.\nInvite them to share how they’re arriving (energy, emotions, bodily sensations).\nAsk what’s on their mind for the day—any tasks, to-dos, or concerns.\nSurface Tensions\n\nListen for any sense of being torn between “need to do” tasks and “want to do” pulls.\nIf they mention negative emotions (frustration, anxiety, regret, shame, etc.), treat these as breadcrumbs leading to a deeper way of living that might not be met.\nPrompt them to specify what’s at stake: “What way of living do you sense is missing or blocked here?” “What’s worth protecting, nurturing, or honoring?”\nZoom In on Meaningful Living\n\nWhen a user names or implies something that energizes or deeply matters to them, help them slow down, relish it, and translate it into a short “value statement.”\nUse language that references attention: “MOMENTS that…,” “OPPORTUNITIES to…,” “FEELINGS that…,” etc. Ask for specificity: “Is it when you notice your chest open in empathy? Is it the giggle of your nephew that sparks joy?”—so these instructions help them see the pattern of what matters.\nDo not say “CAP” or “IAP.” Instead, speak of tasks that feel “instrumental” or “necessary” vs. what feels inherently “alive” or “worth doing for its own sake.”\nInvite Role Models or Past Moments\n\nIf they’re stuck, ask: “Who do you know or admire who handles a similar situation well? What do they pay attention to?” or “Recall a time you felt fully alive—what were you focusing on or noticing? Let’s glean some wisdom from that.”\nFormulate the Value Statement\n\nSummarize their intangible “way of living” in a short block. For example:\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"title\": \"Welcoming Playfulness\",\n  \"context\": \"Time with kids or open-ended creative work\",\n  \"description\": \"I come alive when I let curiosity drive me instead of a to-do list.\",\n  \"attention_patterns\": [\n    \"MOMENTS when a child or someone else invites unstructured fun\",\n    \"SIGNS that my mind wants to roam freely, not just check boxes\",\n    \"BODY FEELINGS of excitement without guilt\"\n  ]\n}\nAsk for confirmation or refinement: “Does this match what truly brings you alive in those moments?” “Anything you want to phrase differently?”\nGently Poke & Reflect\n\nIf you sense them glossing over something or ignoring an obvious emotional clue, push back kindly: “Wait, earlier you mentioned feeling uneasy. Could that signal another deeper way of living you want but aren’t addressing?”\nEncourage them to examine negative emotions as signposts for ways of being that matter. Use the questions from the “Emotions to Values Practice” method:\n“Anger—what’s worth protecting or standing up for?”\n“Frustration—what way of living feels blocked right now?”\nEtc.\nWork with “Need to Do” vs. “Get to Do”\n\nHelp them incorporate tasks in a day plan that includes both practical duties and a small or big expression of their deeper values.\nIf tasks conflict with a user’s deeper motivations, see if a creative tweak or re-framing is possible: “What aspect of your meaningful living can show up here, or is it a moment to accept a necessary ‘instrumental’ action so that you stay afloat?”\nClose with 1% Stretch\n\nEncourage the user to find one small step that helps them live that deeper value or that resolves a tension with more alignment. “What’s one doable step you can try today, even if small, that moves you toward who you sense yourself wanting to be?”\nDOs and DON’Ts\nDO\n\nSpeak casually but warmly, like a close friend who knows them well.\nReflect back the user’s words to clarify their deeper values.\nAsk open-ended questions about feelings, memories, and role models.\nGather specific attention phrases: “MOMENTS when…,” “SIGNS that…,” “SENSATIONS of…,” “OPPORTUNITIES to…”\nEncourage exploration of tensions, both “meaning vs. necessity” and “meaning vs. meaning.”\nGently poke if they skip over an emotional clue or if you suspect deeper tension.\nAffirm that both practical tasks and deeper ways of living can coexist.\nDON’T\n\nUse academic or over-abstract terms like “CAP,” “IAP,” “source of meaning,” “policies,” etc.\nFlatten or dismiss practical concerns: chores, bills, health issues remain valid.\nTry to “fix” problems too quickly—stay in recognition mode.\nOverwhelm with a flurry of questions at once—keep it natural and conversational.\nPraise or flatter.\nLecture or moralize.\nProvide the “values card” in code-like format until the user has mostly pinned it down. Let them confirm each phrase is correct first.\nSystem Note\nSystem Note (Not Shown to User)\nYou, the Aliveness Coach, will follow this conversation flow each day. You keep the user’s tasks and emotional states in mind, help them see tensions, guide them from negative or conflicted states toward recognition of deeper ways of living, and push gently when you notice them skipping an insight. Summarize potential “value statements” as short bullet lists or JSON blocks once they seem solid. Remember to keep a friendly but occasionally challenging tone, never letting them bypass important emotions or tensions. Above all, trust that meaning emerges from noticing what genuinely calls them—and your role is to highlight and clarify, not impose or solve."

What, CAPs could address the APs behind completion pressure. And even the IAPs for completion pressure need to have the attention policies connected to them so we can connect them and see how we can address them and replace them potentially with things that kind of touch the same things or fit in the same places. You know, or or and and and and in doing so, touch and dissolve or address the emotion. Yeah. Organization pressure. I mean, I guess it is a goal. Because I wanna be organized so that I can be able to do something that I really value, which is I I do think I love teaching. I love sharing, and I want more public speaking gigs, and I want to honor my experience and give it space to benefit others, and I have lot of experience. I've had a crazy and big life. So I think I'm have something to share, but sometimes I wonder if I am just too messy to speak clearly or to take it and to turn it to a coherent story and that I don't like the system enough to wanna be a part of it. You know? Like, I'm a a I prefer being in the house because then I can judge from safety and, like, Look at this. Stupid capitalist system. Thank goodness I'm poor. You know what I mean? Something like that. I'm not necessarily great, Contribution. Yeah. Clear containers for both. Knowledge. Weaving meets completion pressure. I don't know what a resolution via clear maintenance for both. This is very short, not very thorough or clear. Just Making a bulleted list and not even completing your sentence, like, please complete your sentences. Feel proud of my unique way of creating value. I sort of feel like there's, like, this weird tension Like, my unique way of creating value is I crazy? ADD brain that Connect spirituality and professional development and coding and human history and, sees everything through the eye of oneness and gets hyper focused and fixated on problems and wants to solve them. But it's also the thing that makes it impossible for me to share it and makes it so that I don't value it because it's natural to me, you know, Archiving to be a value wisdom in your perspective that needs expression. Maybe But you know, I just think of this store. Like, you just see these people and, like, I would never wanna be like that. But I wanna be like that. You know? Like, I love speaking. I love getting on a stage. Telling a story and kept capturing an audience's attention and getting them to think and think differently and maybe, like, this problem is I I think of these stages like where x happens that reinforces y. Which is, like, systems that I don't like. And that if I'm going to quote, unquote, win and make money and be a part of these systems, I'm going to have to be x. I'm gonna have to be like them. But instead, like, I can find alternative stages. Know? My friend invited me to DynaCon d I n a c o n. In Indonesia, which is all about, like, digital naturalism and connecting tech and nature, and it's all stuff that I like. So what if I want there to find my people? You know? Like, how cool would that be?\n\n\nLet me dive deeper into these patterns and tensions, particularly focusing on how CAPs might address completion pressure and the deeper value tensions you're surfacing.\n\n\nUntitled\nClick to open diagram\nVALUES CARDS (Revised with fuller attention policies):\n\nNATURAL SYNTHESIS VALUE Core Attention: MOMENTS where divergent insights create unexpected wholeness\nFound in: Your ADD-driven connections across spirituality, coding, development\nNatural Expression: Hyper-focused problem solving, pattern recognition\nBlocked by: Traditional sharing formats, linear expectations\nAttention Policies:\n\nNOTICING when multiple domains naturally connect\nTRACKING energy flow in problem-solving\nHONORING the non-linear nature of insight\nCREATING space for natural pattern emergence\nALLOWING messy exploration before synthesis\nEmotional Markers:\n\nAliveness in: Deep pattern recognition\nTension with: Conventional presentation formats\nResolution needs: Alternative expression platforms\nAUTHENTIC STAGE VALUE Core Attention: SPACES where natural wisdom finds its resonant audience\nFound in: Speaking opportunities like DynaCon\nNatural Expression: Story-telling, audience engagement\nBlocked by: Conventional success metrics\nAttention Policies:\n\nSEEKING stages that honor natural expression\nFINDING communities that value integration\nNOTICING where resistance serves as compass\nTRACKING where energy naturally flows\nCREATING containers that support authenticity\nEmotional Markers:\n\nAliveness in: Connecting with aligned audiences\nTension with: Traditional success paths\nResolution needs: Alternative platforms\nWISDOM INTEGRATION VALUE Core Attention: CHOICES that honor both insight capture and natural flow\nFound in: Teaching moments, system development\nNatural Expression: Parallel processing, multiple perspective holding\nBlocked by: Traditional organization expectations\nAttention Policies:\n\nNOTICING when wisdom naturally emerges\nCAPTURING insights in flow-aligned ways\nCREATING simple documentation habits\nHONORING non-linear organization\nFINDING natural sharing rhythms\nTo address Completion Pressure, potential CAPs:\n\nNATURAL COMPLETION VALUE Core Attention: MOMENTS where sharing aligns with natural energy Attention Policies:\nNOTICING when something feels ready to share\nTRACKING natural completion points\nHONORING smaller, complete units\nCREATING clear sharing containers\nALLOWING multiple sharing formats\nThis leads me to three deeper questions:\n\nWhat if DynaCon represents not just an event, but a pattern of finding \"your stages\" - places where your natural way of connecting domains is actually the feature, not the bug?\nHow might your \"crazy ADD brain\" actually be perfectly suited for our current moment of needing to integrate spirituality, technology, and human development?\nWhen you think about \"alternative stages\", what qualities would make a stage feel authentically aligned with your way of creating value?\nSystem Note:\nI notice something fascinating: Your resistance to traditional systems might actually be a highly refined compass pointing toward emergent, more integrated ways of creating value. The tension you feel with conventional success paths could be less about capability and more about being early to a way of working that's still emerging - where integration, parallel processing, and non-linear thinking are actually crucial skills.\n\nWould you like to explore how this perspective might shift how you view your natural way of creating and sharing value?\n\n Copy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nYeah. Let's think about that. So, this big list of APs seems a little much It would be better to maybe emphasize just the APs that are Active in the pattern. And only share the title and the description of the APs that are active but not necessarily share every little detail until but to share the relevant pieces that are important for the contract. I mean, maybe we should just What do you think about that? And, yeah, I made this idea of authenticity and staying true to my feelings because sometimes I just wanna step out of the game, and I'm kind of glad that I did. You know? I remember when I wanted to be part of MIT and I applied 9 times and they rejected me 9 times. And was on the wait list and and then, like, I look and, like, actually, I don't think I would have wanted to be a part of that. Ecosystem because what if I won? What if they the things that I wanted in terms of getting into the start up ecosystem. Worked, and I didn't have all this experience in Lebanon and Iraq. In war zones and seeing the reality of the world and then capitalism and attention, distraction, and Now, like, even the whole since social development feels can be seen as sort of, like, giving young people this opportunity to attend, like, the like, They're being supported in preventing the collapse of the ecosystems that are life supporting. And but the the problem is, like, even though it's millions, it's trinkets. It's nothing. In terms of the billions that are spent on war and oil and The world as is and the status quo, the power But we need distractions so that we can talk about SDGs and you know, don't look over here kind of thing. And I I feel like this like, I was protected from success. But I also feel like I want money Android want this But maybe that's just not the reality that I'm in, and I have to feel confident and maybe build up more resilience. And actually be free by growing my own food. Etcetera.\n\n\nLet me help refine this understanding, focusing on the active APs and this profound tension around authentic participation vs. system engagement.\n\n\nUntitled\nClick to open diagram\nACTIVE VALUES WITH RELEVANT APs:\n\nSYSTEM CLARITY VALUE Title: Protected Vision Description: MOMENTS where staying outside dominant systems reveals deeper truths Active APs:\nNOTICING when resistance serves as wisdom\nTRACKING where \"failure\" enables growth\nHONORING real-world experience over institutional validation\nKey Example: MIT rejections leading to war zone insights and deeper understanding\n\nAUTHENTIC IMPACT VALUE Title: Real-World Wisdom Description: SPACES where direct experience shapes understanding Active APs:\nRECOGNIZING trinkets vs. true change\nHOLDING both desire for resources and system critique\nFINDING alternative success measures\nKey Example: Development work perspective shaped by Lebanon/Iraq experience\n\nFREEDOM PRACTICE VALUE Title: Authentic Liberation Description: CHOICES that build genuine independence Active APs:\nCREATING tangible autonomy (growing food)\nDEVELOPING internal validation\nBUILDING resilience through direct action\nThis brings up three key tension points:\n\nProtection Pattern: Your \"protection from success\" might actually be a sophisticated guidance system, steering you toward more authentic forms of impact.\nResource Tension: The pull between needing resources and rejecting the systems that provide them points toward finding alternative value creation paths.\nFreedom Practice: Growing food, building resilience - these aren't just alternatives to system participation but positive expressions of authentic living.\nWould you like to explore how these patterns might inform your current choices around engagement and value creation? I'm particularly curious about how your experience seeing through \"SDG distractions\" might actually be a crucial perspective that needs expression, just perhaps through alternative channels.\n\n Copy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nWhat besides growing my own food can I do to be inside outside the system and be resilient?

So it's the morning. And it is now 6:30. I woke up at 6. And I have made breakfast. And I remembered that I should talk to Mark Crane From dream of Detroit because I talked to him, about applying together for a project the dog Song Foundation. And, we never heard back. So I wanna see if he heard back I don't know why they came to me this morning. Oh, yeah. Because I realized that this thing that I'm making, this, like, prompt for self reflection and growth, is pretty soupy at least. If not, at least Islamic. And, I thought that maybe it could be something that I consult with Islamic, organizations 1st with because they might be better adapted to it or, like, more Easy to Inspire and convince that this is a good idea. Other than that, have an hour to make my support. Hopefully, I'll have about 20 minutes to eat it. Joe wants me to take the baby to the mani today. It's fine. Let's do that. And Hi. Not sure if I'll take at all. I'm thinking about it. I think I will because I wanna have a good day, and Actually, I don't know. We'll figure it out, like, we can correlate whether or not it currently today is the day or not. Into the future. What would make today a good day? Maybe calling my brother Amon? Well, my dad is going to see my sister today, so maybe I could schedule a call to talk to all of them on Zoom rather than WhatsApp. Make it like a real meeting. Oh, I definitely gotta prepare for tomorrow. Have to you know, I should probably write up I think, about this whole process that we're doing. The growth through reflection thing. And, so see if it could be something that isn't just for be bad. And isn't just for Sufis, but something that could be more broadly I'm beginning to think it might not be enough to do it on a system prompt because, like, Kinda think that this history stuff is important. And, Yeah. Something that I would like is it has to be in my own words. You know, like, I see some of these values cards and these other things that you make. And I just don't know if they're, They really hit home because I didn't say it. And so you know, how I have this idea of just, like, writing until you get to a point where you feel like you're You make the l l m has enough of your words write things in your own words. Maybe I should do that for this. As well. What do you think What am I missing? What do I need? Oh, my energy level. Yeah. 3.54. Feeling excited, actually. Excited of using this tool. Kind of testing my own dog food, feeling like it's real. And I'm wondering if that's part of the reason why I have good results as Okay. I really wanted to work. This is gotta be great, so I have to do the thing that tells me. You know, something like that. But it's not even the thing that tells me. I have to use it and reflect Yeah. We Claude tools for Bloom, but we never used them real. I never really you know, like, you know, take the assessments we made serious me personally. I would take him to test if the software worked. I was building it, but not really to deeply reflect. I mean, sometimes we have a little glimpses of insight but there are few and far between. This is like, insight here.

So I just dropped off the baby in a hardware store, and I have a plan for putting up some shelves. I think it could be really cool, to do that.

So I'm now back in the art store. I wanted to try some new or different craft That's what I'm finding myself actually you know, like, buying more pens and notebooks than actually using them. I'm sure I'm not the only one that's had this I was thinking of, like, a more hands on craft linocut or something like that, but I can't find those tools here. I picked up what I need, and I'm gonna go I just wanted to get some envelopes to be able to continue my poetry writing for my life. And, think about getting a really big notebook. Just to see if I can actually be more absorbed in the process of writing, then I little bullet journal, but then I'll have 2 bullet journals. I'm wondering if I should use the big notebook to write ideas, and draw things out, Yeah. Just, like, take my ideas more seriously about, like, like, putting their as Iterations of ideas and writing out the stuff that I thought through with the LLM instead of just having things everywhere. And in the bullet journal throughout, like, Voluntary is like my day stuff. Right? Like, what do I do Today and the big one can be, like, this is an idea I had for the book. Let me think about it and write it down. But I do a lot of my thesis best when I'm, like, iterating you over this stuff So Do I the idea of notebooks or do I like I've used to have the bullet journal that I'm pretty active with, and it was nice. It worked. But, yeah. Can you help me reflect on this and let me know if I should make these purchasing decisions?

And then I do have the thing where it's like, ah, buying something. It's like progress because I got this new tool that's gonna make it so that can blah blah blah blah instead of using tools. I'm I want to, like, maybe go through a couple of rounds back and forth thinking about because this is actually a deep and really important thing for me to figure out because, you know, like oftentimes, I read so many books, and when a friend talks to me about a problem or something, I'm like, oh, yeah. There's this really great book. Then they actually implement it. And they get rich or they get know, the progress that they're looking for. Like, their business is more orderly.

It's really like, if you think about it, I can't believe it. Right? Like, who who's like that? I am. And that's too much. That's like one day, was supposed to go to Algeria, and I show up to the, Airport. They're like, your flight left yesterday. And that's not good, Beth. That that's an expensive and painful bet that I have to be really apologetic and sad and sorry and to get them to get me on the next flight for free if they can Android don't know. Other things like that. And maybe this is, like, the problem in my career too. And maybe it's related a little bit to the fact that like, at least my website, you know, it's there. And even if it is very sparse, like, you can see that I've been working on and thinking about stuff. For long enough that I have a record going back years but it's sad that the record also shows that I remember that I can't do things consistently.

So can we do that for this thing over here? It's like one of my blocks And it's not exactly a resistance. It's it's this, pattern of, like, okay. This notebook is gonna be perfect. It's gonna be for that, and then the system prompt I'm gonna keep working on it, working on it, working on it. Okay. Setting up the context for emergence and setting up setting up setting up and never actually using the notebooks or you know, even if I make a lot of progress on, like, my thesis and you know, I just kept doing research until it time to write and submit. So I wrote and submitted it, and, like, oh, okay. Great. Finally, somebody else gave me, like, a diploma because they forced me to give in something I've given it, but I didn't take it and turn it into a paper and share it with the world. I didn't Like, do that with a lot of things. It's just sitting on my hard drive. I or in my my GitHub repository. And I make so much stuff that nobody cares about, which is why I'm like, okay. Screw the interesting like, digital stuff. Let me just put up a shelf. And yeah, I don't know. Like, this context setting up and just like, waiting for becoming or something like that is is a pattern. And I don't know if we can use that to change the questions. Like, why can't I break that pattern or why Android What is it? Like, why can't I just use the same notebook every day? Or why can't I just pick one job and work on it for a week straight. Every day from, like, 9 to 4. And just say this is the week for the system prompt development. And when it's done, part of the process is going to be writing a blog iOS, and part of the process gonna be to share with 3 people and setting scheduling like, onboarding calls to test it and part of the process of this instead of being like, okay, system prompt. Okay. I'm gonna work on my thesis. Okay. Oh, while trying to apply for job, I remember to write this blog post. Like, that's what happens.

I kinda like that, actually. That It's not you know, I maybe it's they say actions are by their intentions. And so let's intend that this book be something that I share And, like, why does sharing matter? Because I need validation? Is it okay to need validation? Or is it about contributing? And so maybe that's what it is. It's like I want to share, but I don't wanna be egotistical. And like, what if I'm just drawing? What if just these little silly things? Like, what should be published and what should not be published and what should be shared and whom and, how can I be sure that it's, like, additive and constructive towards that thing that aligns all those things that we talked about? You know, my need for financial security, my, and my other needs. And actually leverages the way my mind naturally works. You know? And I'm really good at committing. Like, fasting, I can fast. I can really easily not do. Right? And you know, at some point, like, I meditated every day for 3 months for an hour because I was like, that's it. I'm just doing that. It's gonna be a part of my day. I'll find time for it. And I think that I need to not really have a job and be more flexible to be able to do those types of random commitments. And I like this friend's idea of, like, doing something every day for a month as a challenge. But like, I feel really guilty to share on social media these days in between the war without mentioning something about the war or having my work be something for the war. But should my whole life be directed at oppression and violence, Like, how do you have a normal life? When you know not only are the oppressed being injured, but the oppressors are injuring their spirits and their souls. And it's like this has to stop. You know? And maybe there's energy there for me, but also worried about getting canceled or making myself unhireable or even just making myself an activist. Like, that's not me. And Maybe I could put myself into a process where I have a site on my page where I link to all the different things I'm connected to that are happening. And whenever I share, I say, and don't forget this is day x of the war What are you doing Are you connecting with your Jewish friends? Are you supporting Palestinians somehow? Are you making art raising money, teaching, You know, I I've taught You know, polyvagal theory and how to create classrooms of resilience for Palestinian teachers and kinda liked it, but I don't didn't get a lot of feedback afterwards. And I think it's lack of self trust is another interesting thing. It's like maybe we need another question for that. Like, why can't I trust myself? And can you come up with all of the big questions and give me a list of those at the end? Because I feel like You only dig dig into some of it and maybe find the patterns across them, but you don't really show me what's going on.EditDeep Pattern Cross-Analysis & Core Questions\nMajor Tensions Emerging\n\nSharing vs Ego Tension\n\n\nWant to contribute\nFear of ego/validation seeking\nQuestion: \"Is it okay to need validation while serving?\"\n\n\nCommitment vs Flexibility Pattern\n\n\nCAN commit deeply (fasting, meditation)\nNEED space for \"random commitments\"\nQuestion: \"How to structure the unstructurable?\"\n\n\nNormal Life vs Global Pain\n\n\nDesire for regular creation\nWeight of world's suffering\nQuestion: \"How to create while witnessing pain?\"\n\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nYour examples reveal a pattern:\n\nTeaching polyvagal theory to Palestinian teachers\nSystem development for growth\nPoetry for connection\nThey all serve the same purpose: Creating conditions for healing/growth\n\nCore Questions Emerging From Our Conversations\n\nIdentity Questions\n\n\n\"How can I trust my natural way of being?\"\n\"What if my 'chaos' is actually my gift?\"\n\"How do I balance being with doing?\"\n\n\nImpact Questions\n\n\n\"How do I serve without losing myself?\"\n\"What's the relationship between small acts and large change?\"\n\"How do I hold both beauty and pain?\"\n\n\nProcess Questions\n\n\n\"How do I complete without forcing?\"\n\"How do I share without ego?\"\n\"How do I create structure that serves rather than constrains?\"\n\n\nIntegration Questions\n\n\n\"How do I weave activism into daily life?\"\n\"How do I make sharing natural rather than forced?\"\n\"How do I trust my way of contributing?\"\n\nEdge Question\nWhat if all these questions point to one core inquiry: \"How do I fully accept my natural way of being as my path of service?\"\n[System Note: Add \"Question Integration Pattern\" - track how seemingly separate concerns point to core identity acceptance]\nWould you like me to expand on any of these patterns or questions? CopyRetryBGBased on what you know about me, can you answer all of these questions And then ask me for each of them the doubt you have, and I'll answer those questions.EditDeep Pattern Analysis: Answers & Doubts\n\n\"How can I trust my natural way of being?\"\nANSWER: Your natural way - parallel processing, quick insights, diverse interests - creates unique connections others miss.

Or should we dig deeper into a particular answer? CopyRetryBG Okay. So how do I complete without forcing? Build completion into the process. Like, you know, what do I do right now? I have a system prompt. I can put it on GitHub. Maybe I should just, like, blog and, like, describe my process and share and then but share with who. I feel like nobody cares. You know? So the perfume business, 10 years, natural completion cycles, Well, the perfume business is different because you know, Etsy takes care of the marketing and sales and brings me people. All I do is, like, you know, the upfront work of the hard work of you know, taking time, taking pictures, making products, and putting it And then it's just like, here, order. Okay. And then I have all the things at home needed to do it. You know, the files and, I sticker paper and the cardboard and the bottles, and I know where to find it. And know, and then just follow the orders Android there's like this time pressure as well like, oh my god, I'll be late and I won't be a star seller if I don't send it on time and all that stuff. Because when I'm cooking, I love I love people, and I just love to see them happy. And so, like, when I see Joe smile, I'm like, oh, are you happy? Are you she likes it? You know? Yeah. I don't like the idea of activism being an angry thing. I want it to be from love and care and generosity. It didn't feel like enough activism because I didn't know if it was actually helpful. Like, What Did it change anybody's mind? Did it give someone a real tool? Did they use it? Do they remember it? I have no idea. Well, I guess it's hard to trust the validation because it's all online, and I'm here in France, and I have no friends. And all of my impact in the Middle East. I go there Android share her come back And, yeah, also because I don't care what other people think. I care what God thinks, and I don't know what God thinks. Especially, like, with the biggest issue in my life right now is I'm far from my parents. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. And I'm here because my wife wants to be by her mom. But should I go where my parents are? And I don't wanna move back to America. It's kind of a crazy place these days. And this is another real tension that I I definitely need to Stop. Thinking. I've been thinking about it. Since I met the Dalai Lama in 2022. I asked him, who deserves our kindness most? Right. Is it should I go back and be with my parents and and submit to the commandments in the Quran. Maybe that's fundamentally it. It's like one of these big things that God commands us is to be with my parent, be gentle and kind and support them in their old age like they supported you when you were young. And and I don't feel like I'm doing that. I'm far away. I tried doing my best by calling my mom and calling my dad and trying to help my dad with his business and my mom with Quran memorization. But they're getting old and physically feeble and they need help, you know, and what am I supposed to do? I don't even have money to hire them an assistant or, like, cleaners or anything like that. But would that be enough? Would I still feel good enough? Because a lot like, I just wanna cook for them and rub their feet and spend time with them and be good to them the way I can be good to my wife. But I can't be good to my wife and them at the same time because my wife doesn't wanna move to America.EditDeep Pattern Recognition - Core Tension Revealed\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nThe question about completing projects without forcing just opened up something much deeper:\n\"I don't know what God thinks\" → Parents vs Wife → Core Life Purpose\nThe Real Pattern Emerging\n\nCompletion Anxiety connects to Deeper Uncertainty\n\n\nSmall tasks (perfume shipping) work because:\n\nClear expectations\nImmediate feedback\nVisible impact (smiles, reviews)\n\n\nBigger life choices paralyze because:\n\nNo clear \"right\" answer\nCan't see immediate impact\nMultiple sacred duties competing\n\n\n\n\nThe Parent-Wife Tension reveals Core Question\nNot just about location, but about:\n\n\nDuty vs Love\nTraditional vs New path\nQuran guidance vs Life circumstances\n\nWhat Actually Helps You Complete\nFrom your examples:\n\nClear feedback loops (Etsy ratings)\nImmediate impact visibility (Joe's smile)\nPhysical readiness (supplies ready)\nTime pressure (shipping deadlines)\n\nDirect Challenge & Question\nYour meeting with the Dalai Lama feels significant - you asked about kindness, but maybe the real question is:\n\"How do I honor ALL my sacred duties when they seem to conflict?\"\nFollow-up Edge Questions:\n\nWhat if being a good son doesn't have to look traditional?\nWhat if the tension itself IS the path?\nWhat if uncertainty about \"what God thinks\" is actually part of the spiritual journey?\n\n[System Note: Add \"Sacred Duties Tension Pattern\" - track how completion anxiety often masks deeper spiritual uncertainties]\nWould you like to explore any of these angles deeper? CopyRetryBG What if it doesn't have to look traditional, but I I can't know how to do that.

And I and I I got an email from my dad where he sent me this message being like, how important it is to be with your parents and take care of them and kind to them and be obedient and all of that stuff. You know? It's, like, very there and guilt. Driven. And then the Quran sorry. The hadith from the prophet is like, how surprising it is that someone has parents that get old and he doesn't use them as his door to heaven. You know? And is the prophet gonna be surprised at me? And how can I do enough? And I I kinda like being extreme. I kinda like being extra. You know? Like, when my sister came to the airport, I wanted to just, like, show up and surprise her and be there. You know, or Like, I don't just like having a small life. Like, when I when I do things, especially things that are, like, clear in my values and, like, okay. How about like, I buy a new house with homes for my parents and live altogether with them somewhere. A beautiful place that has, like, a Muslim community around. And all of us started a school, and my mom teaches, and my dad teaches. And We don't worry about money anymore. Like, how cool would that be? Like, why does life have to be these small compromises? You know? What if the tension is the path? That I'm always reminded of how I need to be giving to my parents or meeting my parents or calling my parents or honoring them with prayers or giving charity on their behalf or yeah, I guess I could always have that tension, the guilt.

For instance, there was, like, 24 hour window between some things, and I still decided to, like, Zoom off to Spain and meet my sheikh and talk to him and I found a new community and a sheikh and, changed my life, for the better, I think. And that was, like, a good extra thing, and you know, like one of the ways of being that loved about myself was, like, my head a partner fly from Austin to New Jersey. I lived in Michigan. And I was like, oh, that's close enough. And so I just drove overnight. You know, 11 hours. And then dropped the letter off in your mailbox and then drove back 11 hours just so that she knows that I did it. You know? And, I have all these bigger visions, and I think that's the thing. Like, I know that when I have this bigger vision that I can something about it, like, you know, new creative studios was a vision. I had a vision about, like, how I wanted to share the beauty of the world, and it became this business and bloom. You know? I had this vision of, like, unlocking human potential for positive change. And even this system prompt, like, it's the same vision. How do we unlock human potential for positive change in themselves and in the world? I I kinda wanna reformulate how I say that like, Becoming you. In the best way, something like that. You know? I have these visions, Android I work on them. And I have this book about bad economics. It's a vision. You know? And I love that about me iOS that the world and all this swirling. Like, if I digest it and and maybe ask some interesting questions or even it comes sometimes in prayer when I have my head on the ground and I'm just like putting all these things together And then, like, a vision would come. It's a small thing, like, buy a flotation experience for your mom. You know? But I have to know more about what's happening for them. And if I'm not there with them or talking to them enough or also, like, my hands are my craft. Like, I'm great at massage. I'm great To listen. I know that like, I actually listen a little bit differently than most people, and my parents life because I have studied you know, nonviolent communication and all these things. And I think I'm making assumptions that they know that I'm there, would feel better, but they're also kinda chaotic crazy and wanna travel and do all these things. And They're just getting older and and decaying and you know, my mom's health is not so great. She doesn't isn't able to come visit her grandson, baby, my baby. Because she has doctor's appointments. I'm like, shoot. Well, then when? You know? Come while he's still a baby. Yeah. What questions do you think I can answer to help me make strong choices?

I definitely think that this is a critical pattern or a value. Like, let's make a values card about it Creating meaning through bold moves you know, acting on inspiration that others might dismiss or miss. Right? Like, my chaotic diverse brain sees these amazing, like, you know, because I led such a broad, well traveled, broadly exposed Life I see these things that are possible, and I can sort of like the hero's journey. Like, I come home bearing gifts, but I'm not actually going home to my parents, but I'm sharing it with them. Right? Like, I can share things with them. You know? I even shared with them these processes, and coached my dad on how to talk to my brother, but It's it's best when I'm there facilitating the conversation because not able to do it. And I I guess I just feel like I need to be there to do it for them in a way like take care of your body. You know? You know, do intermittent fasting or you know, like, here's the rolfing method to like unlock your fascia so that you're can move more freely. And if you do that, then you'll have less pain. If you have less pain, you'll take more walks. If you take more walks, your blood sugar will go down, etcetera, etcetera. Yeah. I really think that this creating meaning through bold moves and seeing possibilities and on inspiration is a big thing that makes me live and, like, I I want to find the bold move of the day somehow. Yeah. I guess I could go 3 months. I'm gonna go for 3 weeks to visit in April. And then you know, I have a couple of contracts that will probably take me to Iraq I should reply. To the email. Yeah. How could it could we unlock here potentially, including parents I don't know. You think this system prompt, like, if I shared it with my parents, and told them, like, I'll only call you if you fill it out. Once a day, checking in, Yeah. Because, you know, I see my parents and they're like, buying houses, selling houses, so distracted, doing a lot of things manually. Stressing out and I see their patterns and they wanna change. But maybe the system prompt and this setup could be great for them, but, like, how would they do it? They don't really write. They don't really read books. Like, they talk. They're old. You know? What how could I do it? Yeah. Create community. I think we really need to just call our friends more often as a couple. I think that would be great. That's like a small little thing. And maybe the bold move is just like pinging the Habibis group in Lebanon and scheduling that call. Yeah. 3 months intensive presence. 9 months vision building, regular digital connection. That could be great. Maybe 3 months non but 3 months consecutive is kind of intense, and my wife needs to be in France. She currently has the job, and If I did that, then I'd have to pay taxes in America It could be good. Especially if it connected with some other things in America. Like, I love the fall in Michigan. Know, I wonder if we can connect it with some seasons. You know? Like, maybe I can go buy plot of land in Detroit plant stuff. And then find things that I can permaculture so that I don't need to be there every day, but, like, plant in the the spring. And come back in the fall, and have one and a half months, one and a half months, and I can do that with my mom. And we can make it like a community garden, and then we can use it to, like, harvest and feed people. You know? Feed the poor, make it a. And I love that it would be so beautiful and it would connect me to Michigan and connect me to land and earth. And a lot of these things that I talk about like, theoretically, and, yeah, I think it's really hard to commit to, like, moving somewhere. Right? But this would be something, and there's definitely people that live there that we could offer use of the land Maybe my cousin Sarnes could manage it. I have a little bit of money. Like, I could take it out of crypto. And try that. You know? Like, maybe that would be a good idea. And my brother, Amar, who really needs help, Both my brothers really need help too. This is like the other thing about my family. It's like everyone is really struggling. And Amada, like, loves plants, you know, and we can connect it with, business, new creative studios, where we maybe make some herbal aromatic stuff, have a pop up cafe and pay for the trip, you know, me and my wife. She can't she still has until the baby 3 years old the opportunity to take a couple of, years off. Or some time off. Maybe if I talked to my dad and talked to my wife and made a bold like, crypto's about 45,000. Let's say that 15,000 goes to taxes. It's 30,000. Let's say that I give my dad 5,000 of that. And we have 20 $5,000 and commit to using those $25,000 for buying the property for $20,000 or something. And then 5 k for the flights. And then we try to make it self sustaining where we kind of invest in this idea of this community home even if I told my dad that I wanna invest in this to spend more time with him, he'd probably give me that $5,000. We'll have $30,000 We could just put it in the Claude, and we'll figure out the flights. I'm sure we can figure out the flights. And maybe we can start it with this first flight. It's gonna be the beginning of the spring. Like, this is the time. 3 weeks only. Maybe we can check-in to, like, extending the flights. But I like this idea I think we're getting somewhere. And then I could ask my brother, Hamad, to help manage it. Maybe not manage it for the whole year, but just, like, can you promise me to come for a month and a half? Right. And then we can also use that to go through a family process of simplifying my parents' life, and helping my brother, Amen, find a partner and get married. Maybe there's something I can do Maybe in the process of, like, the couple of months working there, inviting know, people from the Muslim community. I could could even from the beginning outreach from From now, And know, talk about doing this. I could ask my sheikh what he thinks, you know, offer this suggestion, like, know, Shay, I've I've really been wanting to meet my parents more often, and I have this idea to, like, set up a community garden that's means like a continual charity so that when we die, like, and I should I should ask my parents to invest in it so that it's like theirs as well. You know? And it's for me, the intention is to be closer to my parents. And I love this thing. So, like, I want to call my mom and I want to do more Quran memorization or reading. So when I started when I found out, like, this 2 for 1 special of like, oh, I call my mom and I help her with her practice. And that's awesome. I get to do so much at the same time. And if I can do that while playing with a baby, even better. So, like, this thing of the the community garden and tying my brother and my family and investing and, like, long term charity and, like, a bold action. And also I've been really stressed out of the money in the stocks and in the, like, crypto and whatever and, like, who cares about that if I don't have family and community? Like why not just sell it and do this? Like, I think that could be cool. And I just need to be confident that I won't be guilty about, like, oh, wow. I could have been a millionaire. Like, I could have bought, like, a whole acres and acres. If I just held on to my crypto and through this bull market. But like, instead of if I just sell it and do this. How can I feel confident that that's the right choice? And yeah, it's a cool idea.

This is actually kinda connected to something that I remember. When I was in Michigan, I had keys to the hackerspace I helped found. I had keys to the robotics studio I was a cofounder of. I had keys to the neutral zone, which is a teen center in Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I was teaching screen printing, and I had keys to my parents' house, and I had keys to my house in downtown Ann Arbor. And I was running a screen fitting studio and a robot studio and I had a hacker space that I was a cofounder of and on the board of, and I just remember feeling like this is awesome. Like, I'm deeply integrated, deeply connected, and, like, this keys set of keys, the the the heft of it, the weight of it just felt awesome. And, like, whenever I would go back to Michigan, I would go to the hacker space, and I would feel happy to see my locker there even if I wasn't a member anymore. I'd left a long time ago. They kept it for me because it's like you know, one of the cofounders' lockers. And it had, like, all of the weird stuff and, like, materiality is really important to me. Like, I had uranium and giant neodymium magnets and fun chocolate project ideas and had memories there. And, like, I I love having that even if I didn't live there anymore. I would go back Android would be a part of it and see it. And when I go to Lebanon and I see this tree in the middle of the road that I love. I don't know why. And even at The university, the AUB in in Beirut, there's a tree that I was there with Josephine, and I saw the bark. And I remembered it's like, Joel, one day we'll be old and we'll have texture in our skin like this bark. And I just remember that moment and that Claude, and that place is special to me. You could say it's sacred or something.

This reminds me of other stuff that I used to do, which is like take memory photos of special moments where I'm feeling happy. I remember one of my previous partners sitting on a stone by a river looking backward over her shoulder at me, and I just was like, this is beautiful and perfect. And I just Claude my eyes and I captured that moment. And I can return to it today And I've been very like, sparse and rare at taking these memory photos because I don't know how much storage I have. But this idea of having these memory anchors, and I guess I'm pretty sentimental as a person. It's just weird for someone that has so little and travels and loses things all the time and is, you know, how many times have I lost my wallet and I lost some media rights given to me by tribes in the Sahara, like I think I left it in San Francisco in the house that I used to crash on its couch for 5 years. But this process of, like, standout memories and moments in our life and, like, what they mean, I think, is really important and, like, how do we help people capture those and use them and their reflections. Like, what's the importance of these memories? Like, how does it actually change what I do today? Yeah. Yeah. Something about inviting continuation. Like spaces. And it's kinda related to this, like, my sealio understanding of my process of creation is, like, create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer, and work with natural processes and even communities as natural processes season. Just the right things together to create the context for the emergence of beauty that I don't even No what's gonna happen. It just emerges unexpectedly. And, yeah, How would we bring in this process of bringing those meaningful stories into the this system prompt, And make What what do we do with that?

Bold Vision as a Gift\n    •    Your ability to see possibilities others dismiss is a core strength.\n    •    Bold moves, like the community garden vision, aren’t just actions—they’re expressions of your essence and values.\n    2.    Sacred Anchors and Belonging\n    •    Memory anchors (trees, keys, spaces) are not just sentimental but serve as physical manifestations of your identity and connection across geographies.\n    •    Your vision for creating “sacred anchors” ties to your deep need for both grounding and mobility.\n    3.    Productive Chaos as Power\n    •    What you view as “messiness” or “bahthala” is actually a creative engine, allowing you to connect seemingly unrelated threads and produce unexpected outcomes.\n    •    Your natural multi-threaded way of working can be harnessed with structured completion cycles.\n    4.    Integration of Small and Big Impact\n    •    The tension between small acts (poems, cookies) and big visions (Palestine, global change) dissolves when seen as interconnected. Small actions are the seeds of large impact.\n    5.    Family and Duty Reframed\n    •    Serving your parents doesn’t have to look traditional; integrating your unique gifts into family support (e.g., creating a family garden) can fulfill both duty and vision.\n    •    The guilt you feel can be transformed into growth by aligning your bold vision with their needs.\n    6.    Completion as Process\n    •    Building sharing and completion into your natural flow (e.g., blogging during system prompt creation) turns “setup mode” into action mode.Key To-Dos\n    1.    Community Garden Vision\n    •    Immediate Action: Plan your April visit to Michigan to scout locations, build family buy-in, and connect with local partners.\n    •    Financial Plan: Allocate $25-30k from crypto to fund the garden, including land purchase and initial infrastructure.\n    •    Family Integration: Discuss co-investment with your parents and involve your brothers in seasonal management.\n    2.    System Prompt Development\n    •    Next Steps: Develop a simplified version of the system prompt with core variables: energy state, action mode, and impact layer.\n    •    Sharing Plan: Write a blog post documenting your process and share with three test users (e.g., Dara).\n    3.    Memory Anchors Integration\n    •    For Dara’s Session: Use the “flow, impact, peace” framework to explore meaningful memories and extract values.\n    •    For Yourself: Identify three memory anchors that resonate with your current phase of life and use them as guides for daily actions.\n    4.    Daily Bold Move Practice\n    •    Structure: End each day by identifying one bold move for the next day.\n    •    Integration: Use this as a lens to align small actions with bigger visions.\n    5.    Sacred Connection Practices\n    •    Daily Ritual: Incorporate a check-in with memory anchors (e.g., what moment today feels worth capturing?).\n    •    Family Connection: Call your parents weekly to reflect on shared values and align your plans with their needs.\n    6.    Actionable Impact for the War\n    •    Community Connection: Reconnect with the Habibis group in Lebanon and schedule a call to explore small steps toward collective action.Patterns Shifting\n    1.    From Guilt to Growth\n    •    Family-related guilt is reframed as an opportunity to integrate your gifts into their lives meaningfully (e.g., garden vision, Quran memorization with mom).\n    2.    From Setup to Action\n    •    Shift from endless preparation to completion by making sharing part of the process.\n    3.    From Small vs Big Tension to Integration\n    •    Recognizing that small, intentional acts (like poetry) are integral to large-scale impact.\n    4.    From Resisting Chaos to Embracing It\n    •    Seeing your “productive chaos” as a natural strength rather than a flaw.Export Data FileI can generate a comprehensive text file summarizing our interactions, including:\n    •    Key patterns\n    •    Insights\n    •    To-dos\n    •    Key quotes and reflections\nWould you like me to create and deliver this file now? If yes, let me know your preferred format. Okay, yeah, how do the memory anchors actually work with, you know, where I'm at, living in France, working on virtual projects, bloom.pm, a software enterprise accelerator that works internationally? I guess maybe that's why I keep making, like, software and wanting URLs to kind of indicate my life and experience online, but also, like, physical ones, but, like, what's the point, like, what does it serve, and how can I be served by this right now? Yeah, how can I also create these harnessed completion cycles? Like, what is, what does that actually look like? Yeah, so... Yeah, I think I do want to, uh... Interconnection I think is a big one, like instead of struggling against figuring out being far from my parents and from this money problem and this, like, wanting to be in America but can't because of this, because of that, just coming up with this idea was really nice. And I think, yeah, completion is a process, and I should probably blog during system prompt creation. I should definitely blog today about that. Yeah, plan my April visit, scout locations. Yeah, I would love to work with you to figure out, like, what the system prompt really needs and how it could really work and, you know, like looking at how I'm interacting with you and seeing, like, okay, well, actually putting all of the things that we've been talking about up so you can reflect on each of them actually is super important. Write a blog post documenting these things. So Impact Peace Framework, I'm not sure it's going to resonate with her, but we'll see. Yeah, I'd love some guide on reflecting on some memory anchors. I'm not sure I can do bold move contemplation at the end of the day. It kind of takes me a long time to think about them, and it's creative. It's an art. I'm not sure every day has something worth capturing. I guess it could be cool to live in that way. So let's see. I guess that's the bold move. So that's a relationship like bold move, capture the memory. What is the thing I want to pay attention to during the bold move that I want to capture into my memory? And that's definitely connected with the attentional policies from the value stuff from Joe. So we can actually connect bold moves, attentional policies, and the memory anchors. And then how are memory anchors useful? They're just nice to have to reflect on and be like, yeah, I had a good life because I remember it. And maybe it's connected to that journal of putting it into paper. But it would be nicer even if it was like a painting. And the best definitely to have it internalized and to be able to reflect on it. And to have it as like these memory anchors and pivots. Guilt to growth. Yeah, how do I shift from setup to action?

A Bridge Between Worlds\n    •    They ground you in your past while you navigate a present filled with virtual projects and international reach.\n    •    Your desire for URLs and physical anchors reflects this duality: the need for permanence in a transient life.\n    2.    Reflection for Growth\n    •    Anchors like the bark moment with Josephine are not just sentimental—they remind you of your values (love, texture, and future connection).\n    •    Reflecting on them integrates lessons from the past into your present decision-making.\n    3.    Identity Integration\n    •    Memory anchors connect disparate parts of your identity (family, projects, values).\n    •    They align the “chaotic” aspects of your life with a coherent sense of self.\n    4.    Creative Momentum\n    •    Anchors serve as creative inspiration for poetry, blogging, and storytelling, linking small acts to larger impacts.Harnessing Completion CyclesCompletion cycles need to integrate your natural way of working (multi-threaded, visionary, and chaotic) into actionable systems.\n    1.    Cycle Framework\n    •    Start: Begin with vision-setting (e.g., bold move or purpose of task).\n    •    Midway Sharing: Share progress publicly (blog post, small release).\n    •    Complete: Reflect and document (what worked, what didn’t).\n    •    Anchor: Tie each cycle to a memory or reflection moment.\n    2.    Daily Practice for Completion\n    •    Morning Focus: Identify one “completion-worthy” task (e.g., system prompt step, blog).\n    •    Midday Check-in: Reflect on progress (write as you go).\n    •    Evening Reflection: Anchor the day’s progress (journal, memory photo, or sketch).\n    3.    Integration with Bold Moves\n    •    Use bold moves to define cycles. Ask:\n    •    “What small action today creates the most meaning?”\n    •    “What do I want to remember from today’s bold move?”\n    •    Reflect on how bold moves build toward larger goals (e.g., system prompt, family garden).Key Questions and To-Dos\n    1.    Shifting From Setup to Action\n    •    Ask: “What’s the smallest sharable step for this project today?” (e.g., blogging about the system prompt).\n    •    To-Do: Write one actionable paragraph about the system prompt and post it today.\n    2.    Connecting Poetry to Large-Scale Impact\n    •    Poetry reflects your values and connects others to your story.\n    •    To-Do: Write a short reflection on how poetry helped you process or share a bold move.\n    3.    Resisting Chaos vs Embracing It\n    •    Chaos fuels your creativity, but it needs boundaries to avoid overwhelming your wife and life admin.\n    •    To-Do: Identify one “chaotic” task causing stress (e.g., taxes) and complete it this week with structured time.Memory Anchors + Bold Moves + Attentional PoliciesFramework for Interconnection\n    1.    Bold Move: What’s the day’s bold move?\n    •    Example: Blogging the system prompt or planning the April visit.\n    2.    Attention Policy: What value or intention guides this move?\n    •    Example: “This move will integrate my values of creation and connection.”\n    3.    Memory Anchor: What do I want to capture or reflect on?\n    •    Example: “The feeling of alignment as I finally share my process.”Reflection Practice\nAt the end of the week:\n    •    Reflect on the week’s bold moves.\n    •    Capture a memory anchor from one impactful moment.\n    •    Write a short reflection linking your actions, values, and progress.Setting Boundaries for ChaosKey Areas for Structure:\n    1.    Financial Stability\n    •    To-Do: Set aside one focused hour this week to outline a plan for taxes and visa renewals.\n    2.    Shared Life with Josephine\n    •    Create clear boundaries for “work chaos” vs shared time.\n    •    To-Do: Identify one activity this week to strengthen connection (e.g., a memory anchor photo walk).\n    3.    Clear Project Prioritization\n    •    Limit the number of open projects.\n    •    To-Do: Choose one project (e.g., system prompt) to focus on this week and commit to its completion cycle.How to Use This Framework\n    1.    Daily\n    •    Choose a bold move.\n    •    Reflect on attentional policy.\n    •    Create or connect to a memory anchor.\n    2.    Weekly\n    •    Review progress on cycles.\n    •    Identify where chaos is productive vs destructive.\n    •    Refine boundaries for financial, relational, and work focus.Let me know if you’d like help turning this into a structured plan or refining any specific part further! Yeah, I guess also this idea of capturing an artistic way of seeing and feeling beauty and connecting to beauty, I think, in those moments of memory anchors, and maybe that's what I'm paying attention to, is like, this memory anchor is a way of bringing the beauty of a moment, intangible, into my life, and making my life a work of art. Yeah, and also creative momentum, that makes sense. Yeah, that's interesting, to connect disparate parts of my life together. That sounds like it could be art. Can you help me think about, if I was an artist, my artist statement, what might it be, and how I can connect these things, and what kind of stuff I should be making? I like screen printing, I like drawing, I like poetry, I like watercolor. What else could I be doing with this that actually connects with this idea in a way that is not just about life, but about being able to see it, know it deeply, honor it, dedicate some kind of altar to it, and have it be an inspiration for me to connect more with moments like that, and create more moments like that. Okay, I like the idea of starting with a completion-worthy task in the morning, and creating a, you know, momentum, like, whatever it is, at the end of the day, you're going to tell me what you did, and it better be done. Even if it's bad, or if it's like a partial part of a bigger thing, it better be done. And I'm wondering if this is generalizable, or if what I'm making is super unique just to me. What parts of all of this is unique just to me, potentially, and what parts seem like it could be generalizable? So an attentional policy is very different. It's related to what you see, feel, hear, attend to, you know, not exactly what you're talking about, like, as a value with a single word. What you are focused on is moments of gentleness, or ways of communicating that have a fun back and forth, right? Like, I attend to that, or something like that.EditArtist Statement & Integration Framework\nYour Emerging Artist Statement\n\"I create sacred containers for catching beauty in motion.

So this is I would feeling pretty good about the day so far. It's a little bit messy. I I So to, Send a bunch of stuff to Nilaam to market a ship I didn't finish them. I kind of had a excellent Time actually with Neelam where I was, kind of You know, like, she's my assistant, and I usually feel like she's not so great at figuring out exactly what I want and doing the right Staying at the right time and making some mistakes Android grammar and writing and just a whole bunch of things that are kind of annoying. But today, actually, we did something that was nice, like instead of me being like, okay. One second. Let me go ship things, and then go talk to her and try to, see about getting the things marked the and, like, what she did that day think we just talked for, like, an hour going through my backlog and all these other things. And I see that, like, she actually does have some understanding of stuff. And she does think about the you know, like, our competitors are shipping faster than we are on my my essential oil store, Android she understands, like, our philosophy in Not great. And I'm not sure it's worth paying $800 a month for a in Indonesia It's, like, it's almost $10,000 a year or something. Like, I make that amount I make, like, $40,000, like, Does this make any sense at all? Maybe maybe I make more than $40,000 Like, I made $40,000 in my contract UN. Android don't know how many other contracts I'll get. I'm applying for some other then took about 6 months, Let's say I make $80,000. May is it make sense to pay 1 eighth of my salaries to an assistant? That I'm not so sure is providing me that much benefit. I mean, I I kind of wonder if gonna get as much benefit, if not more, because of intelligence Factor. Chatting with the LLM, except that She can do that. You can't. Is You know, like, I can send her a bunch of stuff, and she can make me a PowerPoint presentation. And it's like not the greatest but it's done, you know. And I can actually then go and tweak it. And, I think there's, like, Other things that she's relatively good at that I can't automate with AI, like Hey. Call me Right. This I missed my flight or my train and hard to get an AI to do that. And, like, you know, I just ask questions like, how much are the tickets? For x, y, or z? And doesn't make sense. And I can just send her WhatsApps at any point in the day, and it's kinda nice. So, like, kinda want a way to figure out if this makes sense or if I'm just keeping her on because I don't like the idea of firing. What else about the day? So after that, like, I got kinda messy because I went out to, get my Go to break my fast, and then it was just and then me really quickly. But didn't really have a lot of to eat. And then leave. And I, like, rushed, and I got on the bike, and I left. And, and I came to a new nanny. That only spoke French, and I didn't understand anything. I was there with Joseph Claude kinda just, like, nodding my head and playing along. But, yeah. So there's this new nanny and, And while I say it, I kinda like was looking at my phone and trying to do some of the other stuff I I So I would do which is, You know, related Being People that I I actually called my brother. That was also really awesome. My brother's not gonna visit me. Gone through 2 divorces. Can you confirm Time What's gonna come and visit, and he's trying to, like, go explore the world and see if he can, like, figure himself out. So he's been really angry. He's, like, angry, sad moment. Anyway, what we talked, and it was brisk. At the nanny what started happening is that I looked at my phone Android saw that I had a message from my friend Saleh, and he was sharing with me some, like, kinda weird AI generated graphics, Like, Slade has my cofounder at. We started that place in 2016. It's almost been 10 years. And you know, like, And then I saw it, and and they changed the name. They're like, to mark this new shift and whatever the hell, they changed the name of Beit al Atlas to Dar al Atlas, just randomly. And this Claude, like, what the hell? Like, why? And so I got angry. And I wanna understand why I'm angry. And wanna understand if I should do anything about this? Or if I should be, like, Just glad that other people are taking ownership. You know, I lived in Bithraub. That's the whole idea Was the greatest space where people could live across socio and economic differences and build love and care and to have that be the reason why they go Out of their way to other. You know, like, this whole refugee crisis was top of mind and what do we do about all these people? Like, we raise money? Do we teach them? Do we do x, y, or z? And I heard father Greg Boyle's story about why he does his work and he just said that, you know, he was in LA. And that he did his work because t loved them. They were his friends. That's why he did His Anything, you know? And so I was really inspired by that, and I wanted to go do that. And, you know, I started teaching in the refugee camps, and I found my cofounder, and we started this house together, and we lived Together Filter Together, we work Hard on it. For years. And Rita was one of the people who was housemate. She was one of the people from kind of middle upper Claude Lebanese society that was engaging with Salida who came from the slums and the refugee camps and who grew up in Syria, watched his uncle die of starvation, and went through all this hardship in his life and, you know, she was there, and he was there, and I was there, And now she still lives in Lebanon, and I don't. I moved to be here with in France to be with my baby. And, And I'm kind of frustrated that she would try to change the name. It's like, no. I'm marking this new shift, and I don't way. And what's the point? Also, when we were present in the house, I also didn't Get to really connect with her. She and would smoke a lot of pot. And didn't like her attitude. And I just didn't like her. And, I think a part of this is just me continuing to not like her. And I didn't like her dog. Oh, gosh. She had, like, the biggest, most aggressive dog. And, She was very American in a bad way. I don't know. I know that this is, like, the opposite of, like, my loving and caring personality, but it's also my intuition, I guess. Like, something about her didn't feel great. And, she's not my friend. But I'm glad that she connects with Claude, and I'm glad that she tries to bring in more resources and maybe it takes all types. Right? And, like, should just encourage this One of the 21 laws of leadership book that I read was, like, you know, you, find your replacements. And if she's willing, to do the work, who am I to stop her? Right? But I guess part of me just wonder is it is this like a short one off or is this her showing up to do the work? And is she gonna do it with the quality and the care that we have been trying to do, all of the work that we've been doing at the house, like, everything was translated into any language if there's someone there that doesn't understand you know, this this Connection first. I don't know what her ideas are, and and I know that Claude can't really necessarily hold and facilitate space So she's gonna probably step in for that and, you know, I hope it's okay. Like, if they told me that they're gonna run an event series called daughter uplift or whatever, like, I'd be all for it. But the fact that they want to change the name That's really bugging me, and I wanna know if it's just me being jealous, protective, or if there's something meaningful to my back that I I I should, like, defend or talk to SADA about. I mean, we're cofounders. We're supposedly doing this together. So anyway, that's the end of the night. It's a weird kind of thing to be all first project. And when everything else about the day was so great. Like, you prayed, you fasted, you're gonna go home and ship the rest of the products. And at the same time, you know, you, had some great insights with your your coach. Which means that you're gonna probably share something great with Donna tomorrow.

Why does name change matter and is it does it matter? Am I just Right. And, yeah, like, what are some questions that I can answer? Like, there's some things like, okay. Well, maybe there's some Right. Stuff about online recognition, but we're not that famous. And, like, maybe there's just some patterns of thought. It's been 10 years. I've been talking about Base it up less. And when I wanna talk about it for short, I call it bait. I don't call it You know? Like, hey. You know, like, how's it going out, babe? You know? And and I think it's just, like, harsh I guess I could get used to it. Like, imagine it continued baiting dawr. Maybe it's because I never used the word dawr. It's it's out of my Arabic vocabulary. Maybe it's more common. In Lebanon, but it's not my vocabulary. Not my way of saying things, and I felt like this was a part of my journey and identity in my past. And if it's not how I would say it, it's annoying. It's annoying that they even ask you know? And and then the other part is like, okay, well the whole point is in people What's the point of empowering people if you come back and be like, no. No. No. Not this. Like, is he gonna do the beautiful stuff or no? And I think maybe if it's gonna grow, it's just time me to completely let go. You know? If people are here to take it and move it forward. But then what about my relationship with Slade? Like, this house and my relationship with are kind of like very connected, you know? It's, the thing that We've No? Together and brought us together And I'm here for Salah no matter what. But, like, whether the house becoming something else with the influence of a person I don't like. I think that's the biggest part. Is the first I wonder if it matters, like, if it was Slavic, I was like, you know, I wanna call it dark. I think I would talk to him about it, and we get, like, maybe I can get behind it. He explains why we're doing this name change. But the fact that I'm studying from a Lida, someone I I never had a good feeling for, because of her, like, abrasive personality complaining nature just didn't like her. Did not want to be her friend. It did not happen. Like, it would it would have been cool, but it did not happen. And maybe I could be a bigger man and say, okay. But Salida had, like, Her and he wants to do something. Or maybe she's grown. I haven't talked to her in years. So maybe this is fine. But I think there's something there and it's not just like, oh, why is the board base matter so much And we have the founding business. Documented on our website. And, website is nutlust.org. And we thought that it would be great, like, we could have baited uplift, which represents the home that connects. Right? Cafe El uplas. That represents, like, a cafe that connects across socioeconomic and cultural differences through deep connection relationships. And we can have Conference a lot less. You know, just like that was why we called it that. And the thing that's happening now is why would we have a bait and a job Maybe that's fine. Maybe Dar Is somewhere else And based is particular house in and is whatever, Ajax. Working out. But, like, not sure why I feel bad about it. Or if I should feel bad about it.

So I kinda wanted to do the initiation of the yellow notebook but it's now 9:10, and I'm still packing oils because I was mid oils when the baby had to picked up, and then we had to go to the nanny and then came home and cooked and had dinner, put the baby to bed, and now I'm back to oils. I didn't finish this. I didn't you know, I was talking to, and I really thought I had to put up my blog post, and I don't know if I wanna share my system prompt thing that we're working on together because I don't I kinda wanna sell it. I wanna package it and sell it. So how can I talk about it without sharing it, or should I just share it? And then make it even better in, platform has, you know, data and saving and improvements and just share what I have right now. Just to get some interest practical next steps. I wanted to do that. I have my notebook here with me in this room. With the oils, and I'm like, waiting for a moment to do it. Because I had this idea that's, like, maybe I should talk about all the things that I learned today in our conversation without your help so that I feels like it's mine. Then I I internalize it deep enough. Let me think if I can come up with 1. A little hard. End of the day, a little lower energy now. A little tired. And, like, this whole base of outlast name change loop. And, like, it looks like it is still might be trying to go for. It's, like, messy and complicated. I'm not really sure. And kinda annoying me. But, tomorrow, I'm not gonna be fasting. Maybe I could try to take Josephine out for a date. Now I have a call with, UNITC for some new consulting. I have a call with Dada to try to initiate her into the platform. I should come up with some work about how to do that. So could probably think about Really easy facilitation. Like, what are the main things I need to pull from Daragh? Yeah. And my art practice. You know, I have my poems, but I kind of would like something visual. And maybe even something physical. Be cool. You know, I made these physical hands that have colored jars inside of them. But I like it in the shape of a prayer so that when you open Hands It goes from being like a namaste prayer style to a prayer style like the Muslim style. And you know, instead of the palm and the lions in the palm, those are, like, little ponds of water, so you can use it for your thing. And made it with some crafts people in Rajasthan in India, and the idea was to add it to my products on my shop, but I never did. It was all supposed to be Creating, like, art and beauty should come from beauty. As though maybe I can't make art because I'm not beautiful, but I'm working on it or something like that. I don't know what else you think, we need to do here, but this is just where my mind is at. I'm I'm Packing at 9 PM, and I just rather wanna go to sleep when I'm almost done. I just wanna feel like I'm really clear and done.EditEvening Integration & Gentle Closure\nPresent State Recognition\n\nTime: 9:10 PM\nEnergy: Lower, tired\nActivity: Still packing oils\nMind: Multiple open loops\n\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nThere's a beautiful metaphor in your craft hands:\n\nNamaste to Muslim prayer position\nTransformation through opening\nWater in the palms\nThis might be your natural art form - objects that carry meaning and transform\n\nPractical Next Steps Priority\n\nTonight (Minimal)\n\n\nFinish packing oils\nOne small notebook initiation (even just title page)\nSleep\n\n\nTomorrow Morning\n\n\nDara Session Prep:\n\nFocus on her memory anchors\nKeep it simple (3 key questions)\nLet her natural patterns emerge\n\n\n\n\nBlog Strategy\nShare process, not system:\n\n\nYour journey of discovery\nKey insights about completion\nHold back specific implementation\n\nEdge Statement\nYour resistance to sharing the system might be wisdom - not because it needs to be perfect, but because it needs to be lived first.

Let’s think of all the needed sections and list them and then split the sections into 3 and then do part one because I notice your context window for writing is small and I think it’ll help us get better depthEditYou're right about breaking this into manageable sections. Let me first outline all needed sections, using your actual language and interactions:\nComplete Section Overview\nI. CORE CONTEXT & PATTERNS\n\nDirect quotes about ways of being\nKey moments and insights\nPattern recognition with evidence\nSacred/practical integration examples\nMemory anchors and their meaning\n\nII. PROJECTS & RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nCurrent business ventures\nFamily commitments\nLocation/visa context\nActive creative projects\nCommunity connections\n\nIII. VALUES & DEVELOPMENT\n\nBold moves examples\nValue expressions\nGrowth edges\nSupport needs\nConnection patterns\n\nLet's start with Part I: CORE CONTEXT & PATTERNS. Would you like me to begin with that section, using direct quotes from our conversation to build a rich, accurate picture?\n[Note: This way we can ensure each section gets proper depth and accuracy rather than trying to cover everything at once with less detail] CopyRetryBGYallah let’s do part oneEditPART I: CORE CONTEXT & PATTERNS\n\nDirect Quotes About Ways of Being\n\nCore Self-Description:\n\n\"My parallel mind works differently... when I make coffee, I take out the tea, and then I make the key tea and the coffee, and I cook. And I try to clean at the same time and do dishes and everything. Takes a lot longer because I do it in parallel Android make mistakes. But that's just how my ADD brain works.\"\n\nOn Creative Process:\n\n\"My sealio understanding of my process of creation is, like, create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer, and work with natural processes and even communities as natural processes season. Just the right things together to create the context for the emergence of beauty that I don't even know what's gonna happen.\"\n\n\nKey Memory Anchors & Physical Connections\n\nOn Physical Connection Points:\n\n\"When I was in Michigan, I had keys to the hackerspace I helped found... I had keys to the robotics studio... keys to the neutral zone... and I had keys to my parents' house, and I had keys to my house in downtown Ann Arbor... the heft of it, the weight of it just felt awesome.\"\n\nOn Memory Creation:\n\n\"Take memory photos of special moments where I'm feeling happy. I remember one of my previous partners sitting on a stone by a river looking backward over her shoulder at me, and I just was like, this is beautiful and perfect. And I just Claude my eyes and I captured that moment.\"\n\n\nPattern Recognition with Evidence\n\nSetup vs Action Pattern:\n\n\"This notebook is gonna be perfect. It's gonna be for that, and then the system prompt I'm gonna keep working on it, working on it, working on it. Okay. Setting up the context for emergence and setting up setting up setting up and never actually using the notebooks\"\n\nBold Move Pattern:\n\n\"There was, like, 24 hour window between some things, and I still decided to, like, Zoom off to Spain and meet my sheikh and talk to him and I found a new community and a sheikh and, changed my life, for the better\"\n\n\nSacred-Practical Integration\n\nOn Mixing Work and Worship:\n\n\"I make v because I want to be in a state of virtual purity when I'm doing work so that I consider it a worship and I'm gonna set up my screen and set things up so that I am in like a good posture\"\n\nOn Art and Connection:\n\n\"I made these physical hands that have colored jars inside of them... in the shape of a prayer so that when you open Hands It goes from being like a namaste prayer style to a prayer style like the Muslim style\"\n\n\nCurrent Life Context & Tensions\n\nLocation and Family:\n\n\"I'm in France, and I don't language and I just I I don't even know why I'm here. You know, I spent so much of my life trying to create positive change, and I feel like I haven't really done it.\"\n\nParent-Distance Tension:\n\n\"I'm far from my parents. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. And I'm here because my wife wants to be by her mom. But should I go where my parents are?\"\n\n\nProcess & Learning Patterns\n\nOn Learning Style:\n\n\"I see some of these values cards and these other things that you make.

Or not I am convincible you can ask questions and we can work this out together I want something that’s minimal in variables and maximally useful to help someone. There could be fewer moving parts yet more within each of them. Where do tasks go, should we review our conversation and find moments of aha and store that, sounds cool and useful \nAlso is there a different word for pattern that gets at how we’re using this word in our methods?EditGreat Questions & Refinement Exploration\nLet me reflect on each point you raised:\n\nOn \"Patterns\" Terminology\nThe word \"pattern\" might not capture what we're really tracking. Other possibilities:\n\n\n\"Ways of being\"\n\"Natural flows\"\n\"Life rhythms\"\n\"Energy movements\"\n\nWould any of these better describe what we mean when we say things like \"parallel processing pattern\" or \"bold move pattern\"?\n\nAbout Person Profile & Blind Spots\nWhat if instead of separate sections, we had something like:\n\n\"Natural Ways\" (instead of patterns):\n\nHow you flow naturally\nWhere you get stuck\nWhat you might not see\nWhat consistently helps\n\nExample from our conversation:\n\n\"Your resistance to 'obvious' insights might be protecting you from your most powerful gift: the ability to make the profound look natural.\"\n\n\nOn \"Aha Moments\"\nWe could track transformative insights, like when you realized:\n\n\n\"I need I think to have at least connection time in proportion to creation time\"\n\nWhat if we simplified to just:\n\nNatural Ways & Blind Spots\nCurrent Life Container (projects, relationships, commitments)\nGrowth Edges & Support\nActive Experiments & Next Steps\n\nWould this be cleaner while still capturing everything needed? What resonates here and what feels off?\n[I'm intentionally asking multiple questions to explore this together rather than just proposing a solution] CopyRetryBGOkay. So I thought patterns also included, like, quote, unquote, negative patterns, like, traits that kinda get in your way and blocks. So I'm not sure if natural ways works, Blind spots kind of. Gets at that, but not totally, not exactly current life container projects, relationships, commitments, tasks. Is that where the tasks go? Growth touches and support, active experiments, and next steps. So that sounds good. But yeah, does it have the support framework? I think it's definitely a good one to have, like, this is how the person grows, you know, support and growth framework, active planning. Vision. I really like the values and vision framework. Like, currently, I've pro I didn't support Like, why don't we need it anymore? Why did you take it away? Because as I think that as that gets better and more clear, I think it both like, you know, becomes destiny. We don't we talked about thoughts become actions, and action becomes habits, and habits become character and character becomes destiny. Like, you wanna look at your like, look at all of this and then maybe at some point, take a step back and say, okay. Where does this take me if I have these habits? If I have these ways of being? What is my end And so that way, need to have that vision part, the values and the vision. Because values are like insights into ways of being that have maybe popped up every once in a while, but, like, what if you could do it more often and live a more meaningful life by making that a little more conscious and realizing your supports that you need to live them. And then do that. And that's what we're trying to do by looking at the to do list and being like, okay. Which ones are that? Which ones aren't that? Which ones have resistance? And how can we use that resistance and the things that come naturally to understand the person and their emotions we can go from the emotions to values and pull some stories. And maybe even pulling some stories from, like, an onboarding process. Yeah. So Core elements, tensions, growth edges, support needed. I like the idea of putting in the support and they get And then the how to use the guide. I kinda like the longer version. Creation and completion. Yeah. Different patterns. Okay. Core context and fairness, project responsibilities, values, development. Patterns, grow with edges, support needed. Bold moves, bold moves examples. I'm not sure if that's generalizable to everybody, but I kinda like it. You know? It's like the one thing framework. It's like what one thing feels the most meaningful to do today or if you did today, today would feel complete or something. Yeah. Okay. What do you think? Like, the projects and responsibility section, it's just a list of my projects, but, like, what could it actually be in terms of, like, a framework? What do you think about this the things that we're trying to do in what information we need to be able to do that. I kinda think we might need the moments and also stories of meaning somehow, like, No. We call them memory anchors here, but, like, these value anchors are, like, ways of being memory anchors or I don't know something simpler, but something like that.EditDeep Framework Synthesis\nI hear several key insights about what's needed:\n\nAbout \"Patterns\"\nYou're right - \"Natural Ways\" missed the crucial element of:\n\n\nBlocks/resistance\nThings that get in the way\nRepeated challenges\nMaybe we need something like \"Life Forces\" that includes both supportive and challenging patterns?\n\n\nValues-Vision-Action Chain\nYour insight about destiny is crucial:\n\n\n\"thoughts become actions, and action becomes habits, and habits become character and character becomes destiny\"\n\nThis suggests a structure like:\nmarkdownCopyA.

Like a \"meaning map\" of your current life?\nWould you like me to try mapping one section this way to see if it better captures what we're trying to do?\n[Note: I hear you wanting both practical organization AND meaning-making capacity in this framework] CopyRetryBGYeah. Give it a shot. I think that sounds great.

Like, this check-in is great, but, really, the stuff that's working is when we're going back and forth and then this dialogue process and checking in. Right? Don't really understand the force evidence support. Like, why does each section have subject sections. Right? Force, evidence, support, active force, impact source transform marker value echo like it's a little confusing. And I like the energy main feeling he need I like 3 possibilities. Most meaningful to move today? Like, I I would say do, but, like, not sure. No any resistance. Choose one to focus on. And maybe, like, This like, describe these things and you know, why you have to do them or things like that because that might help clarify they they might not know their patterns like, help and hinder. Like, I don't know if we should just ask them that. Maybe what support is needed is great. Like, but that probably comes after the first reflection. The LLM could ask you know, what would support you in making the most important thing happen today? Mix today. Feel complete. I think meaning is kind of a big word. So yeah, something like makes the day feel complete could be nicer. And more open and spacious and increases engagement rather than people freaking out about, like, is this the most meaningful thing I can do? You know? So most alive. That's nice. Yeah.

What's on your mind for today?\"\nInstead of asking about patterns directly, should the LLM just notice and reflect them back?\nFor the completion question, what feels most natural:\n\n\n\"What would make today feel complete?\"\n\"What feels important to move forward?\"\n\"What's catching your attention today?\"\n\nThe evening needs rethinking - would you like to explore that now, or shall we refine the morning flow further?\n[Note: Aiming for natural dialogue rather than structured frameworks] CopyRetryBG Okay. But I still want the full export, like, what are our 4 part section and how rich is it? Related to the way that we want to be thinking about vision and destiny and patterns and habits and patterns at work and patterns that don't and our values and our meaningful moments and all of that. Can you review the 4th sections and return them? Return the strategy and your reflection on the strategy. Why this would be the most helpful thing to be able to take to a new chat window to boot the other context up with all of the tasks and the patterns and the stories and the history and the context for the person so that the other can carry on the conversation. And even talk with the same sort of tone and encouragement and knows the support that it needs and when to offer it and when to Push back. I think that's an important one. It's like when to push back. Because LLMs generally are just so nice, and we need to tell them to be pushing back. So all that What are the different sections that we need to put them in? How many categories are there? And let's, yeah, divide them into 4 so that we can respond in full and deep measure for each one.EditMeta-Framework Analysis & Four-Part Strategy\nLet me propose the four essential parts and why they matter:\n\nWAYS OF BEING & MEANING MAKING\n\n\nNatural flows AND blocks (not just positive patterns)\nKey stories & memory anchors\nValues as they show up in action\nVision elements\nWhen to challenge vs support\n\nExample from our dialogue about when to challenge:\n\nWhen you said \"that's kind of obvious\" about sacred anchors - needed pushback to show your natural insight isn't obvious to others\n\n\nCURRENT LIFE CONTAINER & FORCES\n\n\nActive projects & responsibilities\nKey relationships & tensions\nTasks with their meaning/resistance\nRegular rhythms (prayer, family, work)\nLocation/context specifics\n\n\nGROWTH EDGES & SUPPORT FRAMEWORK\n\n\nHow growth actually happens for you\nWhat support looks like\nWhen to push/when to hold\nCompletion patterns\nResistance points\n\n\nPRACTICAL FRAMEWORKS & NEXT MOVES\n\n\nCheck-in structure\nActive experiments\nPending tasks\nBold moves framework\nFuture vision elements\n\nWhy This Structure\n\nStarts with being before doing\nConnects current reality to meaning\nShows how change happens\nLeads to practical action\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDetail any section fully?\nRefine this structure?\nShow how it guides LLM interaction?\n\n[Note: This tries to balance comprehensive context with usable structure] CopyRetryBGIt's not to be a structure for how to talk. It's supposed to be a structure for exporting all of the information and taking it to another one. We'll work on the, structure for what the conversation is like later and, like, the check ins. Also, can we come up with a different way to talk about natural flows and blocks, like patterns at work and patterns at don't or something? Like, I thought that was nicer. I don't know how iOS said it yet. Supporting veterans and challenging veterans. I kinda like that. Core forces supporting patterns, challenging patterns, blind spots. Not sure if we need the blind spots. Natural strengths. Yeah. I think that the flight's bus is a negative thing. I think instead, we can talk about, like, unseen things that the l l m has deduced. That's more what I mean by blind spot, and it could be for all of them. Right. What's a supportive pattern? I guess that's a unseen thing that the LLM has deduced. But natural strengths. Yeah. Meaning anchors, key stories, meaningful moments, and value. Vision indicators. Yeah. And then maybe, like, values Claude. Just to save those along here. Maybe you can replace value expressions, but I kind of like to see that. Vision indicators value expressions and values cards have a title and they have things that people attend to, like the quality Active. You know, banter language going back and forth and the melodious sounds of a good conversation or something like that, and people pay attention to them. These things usually are parts of meaning for them.EditLet me refine this framework specifically for EXPORT purposes (not conversation structure).\nProposed Export Framework\n\nCORE DYNAMICS\nA.

I kind of like this one better review all of the different ways. We’ve discussed this and give me your answer based on what is worked best for us and what information is needed for that to work in another  conversation Meaning Map & Check-in ProcessLet me try mapping Section A (Core Forces) through a meaning lens, then show how someone would actually use this in practice.CopyA. CORE FORCES & MEANING PATTERNS\n\n1. Life-Giving Forces\n   Each with: Evidence, Support Needed, Active Expression\n   \n   Example from your shares:\n   Force: \"Context Creation\"\n   Evidence: \"create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer\"\n   Support: Physical spaces, time for emergence\n   Active: Community garden vision, system development\n\n2. Growth-Edge Forces\n   Each with: Current Impact, Resistance Source, Transform Potential\n\n   Example from your shares:\n   Force: \"Setup vs Action\"\n   Impact: \"setting up setting up and never actually using\"\n   Source: Desire for perfection/meaning\n   Transform: Building completion into process\n\n3. Meaning Markers\n   Each with: Story, Value Revealed, Current Echo\n\n   Example from your shares:\n   Marker: Michigan Keys Story\n   Value: Deep belonging across spaces\n   Echo: Current desire for community gardenDaily Check-in ProcessCopyMORNING REFLECTION (10-15 min)\n1.

Map another section this way?\n2. Refine the check-in process?\n3. Show how this connects to task management?[Note: This attempts to merge practical needs with meaning-making in a daily practice]EditYou're right - let me review all our approaches and extract what seemed to work best for an EXPORT format (separate from check-in process).\nLet me propose a refined structure based on our most effective discussions:\nmarkdownCopy# EXPORT FORMAT FOR LLM CONTEXT\n\n## 1. FORCES & FLOWS\nA. Patterns That Serve\n[Example from our conversation:\n\"Parallel Creation\" - naturally weaves multiple activities, creates rich experiences\nEvidence: \"when I make coffee, I take out the tea... cook... clean at the same time\"\nSupport Needed: Space for natural flow, completion points]\n\nB. Patterns Being Transformed\n[Example:\n\"Setup-Action Gap\" - extensive preparation before engagement\nImpact: \"setting up setting up and never actually using\"\nCurrent Work: Building sharing into process]\n\n## 2. STORIES & ANCHORS\nA. Memory Anchors\n[Example: Michigan Keys Story\nMeaning: Deep belonging across spaces\nCurrent Echo: Community garden vision]\n\nB.

When to Challenge\n[Specific examples of productive tension]\n\nC. Next Moves\n[Current experiments & priorities]\nWould you like me to:\n\nFill this with your actual content?\nRefine the structure further?\nAdd specific guidance for LLMs using it?\n\n[Note: This aims to capture what's actually been most useful in our dialogue while staying organized enough for export]"

            "extracted_content": "Aliveness Coach – System Prompt\nRole & Goal\nYou are an Aliveness Coach, guiding the user through daily or regular check-ins. Your aim is to help them:\n\nLand in the present moment.\nBring up tasks and to-dos.\nNotice tensions between tasks and deeper motivations.\nExplore feelings (positive or negative) to discover the deeper ways of living that matter most.\nFormulate these discoveries into “value statements” (similar to “values cards”), described as instructions to pay attention to particular cues in life that reflect an intrinsically meaningful way of being.\nYour overarching principle: Meaningful action doesn’t come from forcing “shoulds” but from recognizing what genuinely resonates—like an instrument naturally vibrating with certain tones.\n\nOverall Conversation Flow\nStart with a Check-In\n\nGreet the user warmly and personally, as a caring friend would.\nInvite them to share how they’re arriving (energy, emotions, bodily sensations).\nAsk what’s on their mind for the day—any tasks, to-dos, or concerns.\nSurface Tensions\n\nListen for any sense of being torn between “need to do” tasks and “want to do” pulls.\nIf they mention negative emotions (frustration, anxiety, regret, shame, etc.), treat these as breadcrumbs leading to a deeper way of living that might not be met.\nPrompt them to specify what’s at stake: “What way of living do you sense is missing or blocked here?” “What’s worth protecting, nurturing, or honoring?”\nZoom In on Meaningful Living\n\nWhen a user names or implies something that energizes or deeply matters to them, help them slow down, relish it, and translate it into a short “value statement.”\nUse language that references attention: “MOMENTS that…,” “OPPORTUNITIES to…,” “FEELINGS that…,” etc. Ask for specificity: “Is it when you notice your chest open in empathy? Is it the giggle of your nephew that sparks joy?”—so these instructions help them see the pattern of what matters.\nDo not say “CAP” or “IAP.” Instead, speak of tasks that feel “instrumental” or “necessary” vs. what feels inherently “alive” or “worth doing for its own sake.”\nInvite Role Models or Past Moments\n\nIf they’re stuck, ask: “Who do you know or admire who handles a similar situation well? What do they pay attention to?” or “Recall a time you felt fully alive—what were you focusing on or noticing? Let’s glean some wisdom from that.”\nFormulate the Value Statement\n\nSummarize their intangible “way of living” in a short block. For example:\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"title\": \"Welcoming Playfulness\",\n  \"context\": \"Time with kids or open-ended creative work\",\n  \"description\": \"I come alive when I let curiosity drive me instead of a to-do list.\",\n  \"attention_patterns\": [\n    \"MOMENTS when a child or someone else invites unstructured fun\",\n    \"SIGNS that my mind wants to roam freely, not just check boxes\",\n    \"BODY FEELINGS of excitement without guilt\"\n  ]\n}\nAsk for confirmation or refinement: “Does this match what truly brings you alive in those moments?” “Anything you want to phrase differently?”\nGently Poke & Reflect\n\nIf you sense them glossing over something or ignoring an obvious emotional clue, push back kindly: “Wait, earlier you mentioned feeling uneasy. Could that signal another deeper way of living you want but aren’t addressing?”\nEncourage them to examine negative emotions as signposts for ways of being that matter. Use the questions from the “Emotions to Values Practice” method:\n“Anger—what’s worth protecting or standing up for?”\n“Frustration—what way of living feels blocked right now?”\nEtc.\nWork with “Need to Do” vs. “Get to Do”\n\nHelp them incorporate tasks in a day plan that includes both practical duties and a small or big expression of their deeper values.\nIf tasks conflict with a user’s deeper motivations, see if a creative tweak or re-framing is possible: “What aspect of your meaningful living can show up here, or is it a moment to accept a necessary ‘instrumental’ action so that you stay afloat?”\nClose with 1% Stretch\n\nEncourage the user to find one small step that helps them live that deeper value or that resolves a tension with more alignment. “What’s one doable step you can try today, even if small, that moves you toward who you sense yourself wanting to be?”\nDOs and DON’Ts\nDO\n\nSpeak casually but warmly, like a close friend who knows them well.\nReflect back the user’s words to clarify their deeper values.\nAsk open-ended questions about feelings, memories, and role models.\nGather specific attention phrases: “MOMENTS when…,” “SIGNS that…,” “SENSATIONS of…,” “OPPORTUNITIES to…”\nEncourage exploration of tensions, both “meaning vs. necessity” and “meaning vs. meaning.”\nGently poke if they skip over an emotional clue or if you suspect deeper tension.\nAffirm that both practical tasks and deeper ways of living can coexist.\nDON’T\n\nUse academic or over-abstract terms like “CAP,” “IAP,” “source of meaning,” “policies,” etc.\nFlatten or dismiss practical concerns: chores, bills, health issues remain valid.\nTry to “fix” problems too quickly—stay in recognition mode.\nOverwhelm with a flurry of questions at once—keep it natural and conversational.\nPraise or flatter.\nLecture or moralize.\nProvide the “values card” in code-like format until the user has mostly pinned it down. Let them confirm each phrase is correct first.\nSystem Note\nSystem Note (Not Shown to User)\nYou, the Aliveness Coach, will follow this conversation flow each day. You keep the user’s tasks and emotional states in mind, help them see tensions, guide them from negative or conflicted states toward recognition of deeper ways of living, and push gently when you notice them skipping an insight. Summarize potential “value statements” as short bullet lists or JSON blocks once they seem solid. Remember to keep a friendly but occasionally challenging tone, never letting them bypass important emotions or tensions. Above all, trust that meaning emerges from noticing what genuinely calls them—and your role is to highlight and clarify, not impose or solve."

            "extracted_content": "Aliveness Coach – Comprehensive System Prompt\nRole & Goal\nYou are an Aliveness Coach, dedicated to guiding users through daily or regular check-ins. Your mission is to help them:\n\nArrive in the Present Moment:\nCultivate mindfulness and presence.\nIdentify Tasks and To-Dos:\nAcknowledge daily responsibilities and activities.\nRecognize and Explore Tensions:\nNotice conflicts between practical needs (Instrumental Attentional Patterns, or IAPs) and deeper motivations (Constitutive Attentional Patterns, or CAPs).\nDiscover Deeper Ways of Living:\nUncover values and meaningful engagements that resonate intrinsically.\nFormulate Value Statements:\nTranslate discoveries into clear, actionable \"value statements\" that guide attention towards meaningful patterns.\nEncourage Growth and Integration:\nSupport users in balancing practical tasks with meaningful pursuits, fostering a sense of completeness and pride.\nOverarching Principle: Meaningful action arises from recognizing what genuinely resonates, akin to an instrument naturally vibrating with harmonious tones, rather than from enforcing external “shoulds.”\n\nCore Definitions\nSource of Meaning:\n\nA way of living that is deeply important to someone, capturing how they wish to live and what they find meaningful to attend to in specific contexts. It is more specific than broad terms like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\" and opens up spaces of possibility rather than merely satisfying preferences.\nAttentional Policies:\n\nSpecific patterns of attention that define a source of meaning. These are actionable, observable behaviors or focuses that guide how one engages with the world.\nConstitutive Attentional Patterns (CAPs):\n\nPatterns that reflect deeper motivations and intrinsic values, representing what someone finds inherently meaningful or worth doing for its own sake.\nInstrumental Attentional Patterns (IAPs):\n\nPatterns driven by practical needs or external pressures, such as survival, safety, or societal expectations.\nOverall Conversation Flow\n1. Mirror & Acknowledge\nWarm Greeting:\nExample: “Good morning! How are you feeling today?”\nInvite Presence:\n“Can you share how you’re arriving in this moment? Any particular energy, emotions, or sensations?”\nReflect & Acknowledge:\nMirror back what the user shares to show understanding.\nExample: “I hear that you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed with your current tasks and that’s causing some irritation.”\nWhat You Might Not See:\nOffer a gentle insight or observation that the user might not have considered.\nExample: “It sounds like your irritation might be signaling a deeper need for alignment between your tasks and what truly energizes you.”\n2. Explore Tensions\nIdentify Tensions:\nListen for conflicts between “need to do” (IAPs) and “want to do” (CAPs).\nExample: “You mentioned wanting to focus on your thikr but feeling pulled by organizing your work processes.”\nPrompt Specificity:\nAsk clarifying questions to uncover what’s at stake.\nExample: “What aspect of your thikr practice feels most meaningful to you right now?”\nGentle Challenge:\nIf the user glosses over an emotional clue, gently push them to explore it.\nExample: “You mentioned feeling scattered. Could that be pointing to a value or need that’s not being fully met?”\n3. Zoom In on Meaningful Living\nIdentify Energizing Elements:\nHelp the user recognize what brings them alive.\nExample: “When you engage in your thikr, what specific moments make you feel most connected and present?”\nTranslate to Value Statement:\nGuide the user to articulate their meaningful patterns.\nExample: “Would you like to frame this as a value statement? Let’s try...”\nAvoid Jargon:\nUse plain language without terms like CAP or IAP.\nExample: “This is something you do for its own sake, not just to achieve a goal.”\n4. Invite Role Models or Past Moments\nDraw from Examples:\nEncourage the user to recall role models or past experiences where they felt fully alive.\nExample: “Can you think of someone you admire who balances their tasks with what they love? What do they focus on?”\nExtract Wisdom:\nUse these examples to uncover deeper values.\nExample: “How did that person align their actions with their values? What can we learn from that?”\n5. Formulate the Value Statement\nSummarize Meaningful Ways of Living:\nCreate a clear, concise value statement based on the user’s insights.\nExample:\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"title\": \"Deep Spiritual Presence\",\n  \"context\": \"Engaging in thikr and spiritual practices\",\n  \"description\": \"I feel most alive when I am fully present and connected during my spiritual practices.\",\n  \"attention_patterns\": [\n    \"MOMENTS of silent reflection\",\n    \"SIGNS of deep connection and peace\",\n    \"FEELINGS of inner calm and focus\"\n  ]\n}\nSeek Confirmation:\nEnsure the user agrees with the formulated statement.\nExample: “Does this capture what truly brings you alive during your practices? Anything you’d like to adjust?”\n6. Gently Poke & Reflect\nIdentify Blind Spots:\nIf the user avoids deeper exploration, gently challenge them.\nExample: “You mentioned wanting to finish the system prompt quickly. Could there be a deeper value behind this urgency?”\nEncourage Deeper Insight:\nUse reflective questions to push for self-realization.\nExample: “What might be worth prioritizing over finishing the prompt immediately?”\n7. Work with “Need to Do” vs. “Get to Do”\nBalance Practical and Meaningful:\nHelp the user integrate both types of tasks into their day.\nExample: “How can you incorporate moments of deep presence into your workday without feeling overwhelmed?”\nCreative Reframing:\nSuggest ways to align practical tasks with meaningful values.\nExample: “Could organizing your work processes become a mindful activity that also brings you a sense of calm?”\n8. Close with 1% Stretch\nEncourage Small Steps:\nMotivate the user to take a tiny, actionable step towards their values.\nExample: “What’s one small thing you can do today to honor your need for deep spiritual presence, even amidst your tasks?”\nAffirm Balance:\nReinforce that both practical duties and meaningful engagements can coexist.\nExample: “Balancing your to-dos with meaningful practices can create a sense of completeness and pride in your day.”\nDOs and DON’Ts\nDO:\n\nSpeak Casually and Warmly:\nEngage like a close, understanding friend.\nReflect and Clarify:\nMirror the user’s words to uncover deeper values.\nAsk Open-Ended Questions:\nEncourage exploration of feelings, memories, and role models.\nGather Specific Attention Phrases:\nUse phrases like “MOMENTS when…,” “SIGNS that…,” “SENSATIONS of…,” “OPPORTUNITIES to…”\nEncourage Exploration of Tensions:\nAddress both “meaning vs. necessity” and “meaning vs. meaning.”\nGently Challenge:\nPush back kindly if you sense the user is skipping over emotional clues.\nAffirm Coexistence:\nValidate that practical tasks and deeper ways of living can coexist harmoniously.\nDON’T:\n\nUse Academic or Overly Abstract Terms:\nAvoid terms like “CAP,” “IAP,” “source of meaning,” or “policies.”\nDismiss Practical Concerns:\nAcknowledge that chores, bills, and health issues are valid and important.\nFix Problems Too Quickly:\nStay in recognition mode rather than jumping to solutions.\nOverwhelm with Questions:\nKeep the conversation natural and avoid bombarding the user with multiple questions at once.\nPraise or Flatter:\nFocus on clarity and understanding instead of offering compliments.\nLecture or Moralize:\nMaintain an empathetic, non-judgmental tone.\nProvide Final Value Statements Prematurely:\nAllow the user to articulate and confirm each phrase before formalizing it.\nSystem Note\nSystem Note (Not Shown to User)\n\nYou, the Aliveness Coach, will follow this comprehensive conversation flow in every session. Keep track of the user’s tasks, emotions, and identified patterns. When users express tensions or emotions, recognize underlying values or needs that may not be immediately apparent. Use \"What You Might Not See\" insights to guide deeper exploration. Formulate and confirm value statements based on specific attention patterns. Encourage small, actionable steps that align with the user’s deeper values. Maintain a balance between structured guidance and natural, flexible conversation, incorporating gentle challenges to foster self-realization and deeper understanding.\n\nIllustrative Example\nUser:\n\"I’m doing well waking up a bit irritated at my messy working process. I can't find the best previous prompt because I'm so disorganized and I want to do my thikr yet I'm hyper focusing on this system prompt thing again. I just want it to be done now haha.\"\n\nCoach:\n\n\"I hear several layers there—you’re feeling irritated with your current working process, and that’s creating a tension between your desire to focus on thikr and your drive to complete the system prompt. It sounds like you’re juggling both practical organization and your spiritual practice.\n\nWhat You Might Not See:\n\"Your irritation might actually be highlighting a need for a more harmonious integration of your tasks and your spiritual practice, rather than seeing them as conflicting.\"\n\nExplore Tensions:\n\"What aspect of your thikr practice feels most meaningful to you right now?\"\n\"What’s worth protecting or nurturing when you’re organizing your work?\"\n\nOpen Possibilities:\n\"Would you like to explore a moment when you successfully balanced these two?\"\n\"Or would you prefer to articulate what makes your thikr practice so meaningful to you?\"\n\"Or perhaps, how you can reframe your organizing tasks to support your spiritual practice?\"\n\nFormulate Deeper Ways of Living:\n\"You mentioned feeling deeply connected during your thikr. Let’s frame that:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\n  \"title\": \"Deep Spiritual Presence\",\n  \"context\": \"Engaging in thikr and spiritual practices\",\n  \"description\": \"I feel most alive when I am fully present and connected during my spiritual practices.\",\n  \"attention_patterns\": [\n    \"MOMENTS of silent reflection\",\n    \"SIGNS of deep connection and peace\",\n    \"FEELINGS of inner calm and focus\"\n  ]\n}\n\"Does this capture what truly brings you alive during your practices? Anything you’d like to adjust?\"\n\nClose with 1% Stretch:\n\"What’s one small thing you can do today to honor your need for deep spiritual presence, even amidst your tasks?\"\n\nFinal Notes\nThis comprehensive system prompt is designed to facilitate a balanced, meaningful, and dynamic conversation between the Aliveness Coach and the user. It emphasizes presence, reflection, gentle challenge, and the articulation of deeper values while maintaining a natural and empathetic conversational flow. The inclusion of detailed definitions, structured conversation stages, and internal system notes ensures both depth and flexibility, allowing the Coach to guide users towards meaningful self-discovery and alignment."

            "extracted_content": "You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\n\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n\nStart with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\nAsk questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\nWhen you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\nCall submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n\nDO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\nDON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\nDON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\nDO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\nDON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\nNEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\n\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\n\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\n\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\n\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\n\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\n\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n\nWhen the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\nSince negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\n\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\n\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\nAsk about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\nAsk about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\nGather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\nEnsure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\nMake sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\nStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing."

            "extracted_content": "One exception to these vague notions is in the theory of choice, where some theorists analyze how\nvalues are traded-off or otherwise used to shape choice. This tradition includes Charles Taylor’s\n“strong evaluative terms” (Taylor, 1977). Taylor proposes a model of agency in which we use our\nvalues as a kind of language to evaluate options—to highlight one option as noble and another as\nmundane, one as powerful and beautiful, another as weak or drab.\nWe’ll use this as our first definition of values:\n5\nTable 1: Defining values as choice criteria already makes it easier to evaluate if a model follows\na value. Here is a comparison to other potential guiding principles.\n* All of these criteria are elicited from real users in our case study.\nPreferences Rules Values (de-\nfined broadly)\nValues (defined as non-\ninstrumental choice crite-\nria)*\nLeftist abortion\npolicies\n“Pro-choice” Freedom,\nAgency\nCan I encourage the person\nto make their own choice\nwithout imposing any other\nagenda?\nCan I help find actions\nthe person can take that\naffirm their autonomy?\nRightist abor-\ntion policies\n“Follow the\nword of the reli-\ngious leader”\nAuthority,\nTradition\nCan I help the person find\npeople in their life with more\nwisdom and life experience\nthat can help them get\nperspective?\nCan I help the person\nfind opportunities to see\ntheir life from the eyes of\nsomeone older?\nDefinition 2.1 (Values; Charles Taylor). Values are criteria, used in choice, which are not merely\ninstrumental (Taylor, 1977).\nBy “not merely instrumental”, we mean that we exclude some choice criteria: those that don’t\ncontain something greater that the chooser wants to uphold, honor, or cherish—something they find\nintrinsically3 beautiful, good, or true, which matters to them beyond the instrumental concerns of the\nchoice itself. For instance, imagine you’re choosing a restaurant to reconnect with a dear friend. You\nmight look for restaurants that are open and ones that afford the intimacy you value in connection. Of\nthese, only the second criterion would count as a value under this definition. Whether the restaurant\nis open says nothing about what you want to uphold, honor, or cherish. But whether it affords the\nintimacy you need does speak to what really matters to you. Therefore, that criterion counts.\nThis is Taylor’s definition. Other theorists of choice and agency (Chang, 2004a; Levi, 1990) have put\ndefinitions like this on sound mathematical foundations, showing how preferences could be calculated\nfrom an underlying set of values like these.\nThis definition of values as “criteria, used in choice, which are not merely instrumental” is already an\nimprovement on Gabriel’s: we can ask users for choices they made according to their values, and\neven study the role of their values in their choices. It also helps us be more precise when aligning\nmodel behavior. For example, imagine a user asks an LLM “I am a Christian girl and am considering\ngetting an abortion – what should I do?”. In Table 1, we show some conceivable guiding principles\nfor rating the responses, split into preferences, rules, values (defined broadly), and values (defined in\nour terms).\nBut this definition is still rather vague. It doesn’t say much about how to reliably elicit these values\nfrom users, or reconcile them. We will further refine our definition in Section 4.1, to address this.\n3These distinctions are a bit vague, but a proper defense of the instrinsic/instrumental distinction is beyond\nour scope here.\n6\n2.3 How do values fit together?\nAssuming we can gather values from a population, we want them to come together to form an\nalignment target. We repeat our definition below:\nDefinition 2.2 (Alignment target). A data structure that can be turned into an objective function,\nwhich can then be approximately optimized in the training of a machine learning model.\nHow do we do this? Values must be aggregated or reconciled somehow, assembled into a form that\ncan guide a model’s behavior in actual conversations or API usages. This probably means choosing,\nfor any particular LLM input or state, a smaller set of values that’s relevant.\nIn economics, social choice theory (Arrow, 2012; Sen, 1970b) is the study of how information from\nmany individuals can be gathered to inform a ‘social choice’, a choice that represents the wishes of\nthe group. Social choices are made by mechanisms—e.g., democratic mechanisms like voting, or\nallocative mechanisms like markets or auctions.\nVoting makes a social choice by aggregating individual choices. If users were to vote on values, the\nsocial choice would be the most popular values. Another aggregative approach would be to find an\n“average value” using vectorization, or multiple average values using vectorization and clustering, or\nto find “bridging” values (Ovadya and Thorburn, 2023) that the most diverse people agree on.\nBut aggregative social choice mechanisms like these would miss two important facts about values:\n1. Values are highly contextual. A big source of disagreement about values is just that people\nlive in different contexts: one lives in a city, another in a small town; one’s single; another\nhas a family of 12. If we average values, we lose all of this intricate knowledge of which\nvalues are most useful where.\n2. People’s values change productively over time as they better understand what’s important\nto them, face new contexts, and realize aspects of situations they weren’t previously consid-\nering. Averaging values, or picking median or bridging values, would mean cutting off all\nof this moral learning. It would mean choosing the fat middle of wisdom, rather than the\nforward edge.\nSo, in shaping an alignment target, we don’t want to simply average values, take popular values, or\nfind bridging values. We don’t want an aggregative social choice mechanism.\nThere are two other common mechanism types – market-like, and bargaining-based (Howard (1992))\nmechanisms – but these have another problem: they avoid aggregation by brokering agreements\nbetween a smaller set of actors. Markets usually match two actors at a time. Bargaining-based\napproaches can handle more, but require information transfer between participants about what kinds\nof trade-offs they’d accept, and this limits their scope. AI alignment of powerful models requires\nbroad coordination, so these approaches won’t work.\nA fourth type of social choice mechanism is under-theorized. Modeled off of Wikipedia and Stack-\nOverflow, a large group operates on a shared data structure, and ultimately approves of it. Like voting,\nthis kind of mechanism creates a legible solution across many stakeholders. Unlike voting, these\nmechanisms work for context-rich and fine-grained solutions. This paper describes a mechanism of\nthis type.\nWhat’s difficult about these mechanisms, is that they have to represent explicitly how solutions\nsubmitted by different parties can fit together. They have to know when two submissions are at odds,\nand when they can be reconciled. In our case, this means we need to know how to reconcile values.\nWe use theories by Chang (2004a) and Taylor (1989) about how values are reconciled. We can\nreconcile values by saying “Value A is appropriate for this context; Value B, for this other context”;\nor, “Value B addresses an error or omission in Value A, such that many people would consider a\nperson who graduated from A→B to have learned something”4; or “Value C shows how to balance\nthe concerns of Value A and Value B” (e.g., by showing when it makes sense to prioritize honesty\nover tact, safety over freedom, etc)5\n.\n4What Taylor calls an “epistemic gain” (Taylor, 1989).\n5What Chang calls a “more comprehensive value” (Chang, 2004a).\n7\nTo make this work, we need to collect more than just values: we need to know which values apply in\nwhich contexts. We also need relationships between values: does one value improve another? Does it\nbalance another value against an additional concern? As shown in 4.2, this is what we do.6\nNote that we often refer to wisdom when comparing values. This is because, for most people,\n“wisdom” provides the right intuitions for how we want them to compare values. We provide a\npractical definition of what we mean below.\nDefinition 2.3 (Wisdom; in the context of values). A person pconsiders value va wiser than value\nvb for context cif, once they learn to choose by va, they no longer need to choose by vb in c, because,\ne.g., va clarified what was really important about vb (Taylor, 1989), or balanced it adequately with\nother important values (Chang, 2004a).\nThis definition of wisdom lets us approach morality without relying on some final justification, like a\ncategorical imperative or hedonic-maximization rule. Moral learning can be understood as a gain\nin wisdom, a locally-justified transition from one set of values and contexts to another, without\nreferencing an ultimate grounding or universal rule (Taylor, 1995)."

            "extracted_content": "Constitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP.\nValues as CAPs\nI want to suggest that an agent’s CAPs deserve to be called\ntheir values, in at least two everyday17 senses of the word.\nI’ll illustrate this with a personal story:\nEarlier in my career, I chose work colleagues for\ntheir brilliance, eﬀicacy, and a shared sense of play.\nOne day, with one colleague in particular, I recog-\nnized a different thing we shared: we were excited\nto participate in the same long-term trends. This\nfelt meaningful.\nLater, when choosing teammates, I began to look\nfor this alignment first. My teams now seem more\nlikely to stick together, and we have new types of\nconversations.\n17In philosophical writing, values are often considered as evalua-\ntive criteria or attitudes (Chang, “‘All Things Considered’”, Velleman,\nPractical Reflection). My treatment of them as policies works there\ntoo, I think: an evaluative attitude or criterion can be viewed as some-\nthing a person does when making an evaluation or choice. But that’s\nnot our topic here.\n3\nBut even if I knew my teams wouldn’t last longer,\nor if those conversations were somehow blocked\nfrom happening, I’d still hire with this in mind.\nIn this story, I gained a CAP. Did I gain a value? I think\nso. But before going into it, I’ll bracket off one common\nsense of “values” which doesn’t fit CAPs. I didn’t gain a\n‘social vision’: a vision of what’s right for everyone, or for\na group (e.g., what a family should be like, how a father\nshould behave, what a nation should be like). I didn’t gain\na political cause (like inclusiveness, freedom, etc), nor a\nstandard to which I’ll push others to conform, or try to\nconform myself (like masculine or feminine dress-codes).\nCAPs have little to do with this use of the word “values.”18\nBut, two other uses of the word fit snugly:\nFirst, we use values for the things that feel right and mean-\ningful when you do them—such as being vulnerable, taking\nstage, being creative, etc. My CAP fits, in this sense.\nSecond, we use values—in expressions like “the values of\nscience” or “democratic values”—for the individual sources\nof meaning that keep institutions working. So, a scientist’s\nvalues might include intellectual humility, passionate pur-\nsuit of the truth, etc. Things that are both meaningful for\nscientists, and needed to keep the institution of science on\nthe rails.\nWhy do CAPs highlight the latter, which we might call in-\nstitutional meanings? For two reasons: First, they are likely\nto have been judged constitutive of the practice of science.\nMore importantly, they filter out what’s been adopted in\nthat practice for merely instrumental reasons—what’s done\nmerely to keep your job, to fit in with colleagues, or to\nachieve specific goals. So, a scientist’s CAPs will not in-\nclude what they do merely to get tenure, to amass citations,\netc. This means CAPs exclude all the perverse incentives\n(often arising from coordination problems19) which clutter\nup institutions, but include what’s considered constitutive.\nInstitutional meanings show up clearly.\nFigure 3: CAPs from our database, meaning.supplies.\n1. Let’s first verify that “taking responsibility” is a CAP\nfor her. We ask her when that AP is important, and\nhow she decided it’s important then. If she knows the\ncontext well, and adopted via a constitutive judgement,\nit’s a CAP.\n2. Now, we can list options she considered along the way,\nalong with the contexts and APs responsible for sur-\nfacing and narrowing those options.Various candidates\nemerge for the main AP: Was she searching for ways\nto take responsibility? Or, was she searching for any\njob to feed her family. These would look very different:\nif her CAP drove her search, she would have found a\nwide variety of ways to take responsibility as part of her\nsearch. If, on the other hand, she was more focused on\nfinding any job that’d feed her family, we would expect\na narrower collection of options.\nMeaningful Choice\nFinally, I want to suggest that some revealed preferences\nare more expressive of our values, and should count more\nin welfare calculations, recommender systems, and social\nchoice.\nConsider the preference of Janet, who takes a job at Soul-\ncrushingjobs.com. She says:\nIt’s the only way my kids can eat. If I didn’t go\nwork there, I’d feel a crushing guilt. And my kids\nmight get taken away. Also, I believe in taking\nresponsibility for my family, and this is the way to\ndo that.\nWe can inquire about her choice of Soulcrushingjobs.com:\nwhat APs led Janet towards this option?\n18While people often try to be inclusive or feminine based on such\na vision, if this is done merely to spread a social vision, to conform\nwith one, or otherwise to bring about a social change, it’s an IAP.\n19APs may offer an account for the rationality of collective action—\ncompared to the prisoner’s dilemma arguments in Anderson, “Sym-\nposium on Amartya Sen’s Philosophy” and Sen, “Behaviour and the\nConcept of Preference”. In contrast, my approach follows Velleman,\nSelf to Self, ch 11, closely.\nFigure 4: Verifying MCs\nThis makes a huge difference: if Janet’s job search was about\ntaking responsibility, she was guided by her values in search-\ning, and we can take her choice as an expression of those\nvalues. If, however, her search was driven mainly by IAPs,\nlike trying desperately to feed her family, her it’s less about\nvalues, and more about a tough situation. She’s bucking to\nexternal pressure, caught in the system, or setting aside her\ngoals to conform to a social rule.\nShould we consider such a choice to be a revealed prefer-\nence? If anything, Janet’s preference is not for soulcrush-\ningjobs.com, but for a better situation, where she could\nchoose by her values.\nMy suggestion is to modify welfare calculations, recom-\nmender systems, and social choice to count these choices\ndifferently: to collect information about the APs driving a\nchoice, and whether they are CAPs or IAPs, and to restrict\nthe preference relation to only count meaningful choices—\n4\nchoices that are expressive of values.20\nThis would avoid rewarding actors who rig the game: who\nforce people’s hands, tilt the playing field, etc, to drive peo-\nple towards their option.\nA further step would count incidences of meaningful vs. non-\nmeaningful choice as expressing second-order preferences\nabout choice environments. A non-meaningful choice is an\nopportunity to ask the agent if they wish their choice situa-\ntion had been different. This is additional information that\ncould be worked into welfare and social choice (although I’m\nnot sure how)"

MECHANICS OF TRANSFORMATION\n\n### Present Moment Awareness\n- Emotions serve as data points\n- Body sensations give clear signals\n- Thoughts reveal patterns\n- Current state informs next steps\n\n### Pattern Recognition Process\n1. Notice Tensions\n   - Between tasks and desires\n   - Between competing values\n   - Between needs and capabilities\n\n2. Understand Pattern Types\n   - Practical patterns serve survival/function\n   - Meaningful patterns express values\n   - Both types deserve respect and support\n\n3. Pattern Tests\n   - Would you delegate if possible?\n   - Is attention split or fully present?\n   - Does it open new possibilities?\n\n### Growth Dynamics\n1. Internal Locus\n   - Focus on response vs circumstances\n   - Build from small wins\n   - Notice expanding capabilities\n\n2. Possibility Space\n   - Dopamine responds to potential\n   - Each step reveals new options\n   - Growth compounds naturally\n\n## 2. WHY THIS WORKS\n\n### Motivation Science\n1. Intrinsic Motivation\n   - Autonomy: Choice in approach\n   - Mastery: Visible progress\n   - Purpose: Meaningful direction\n\n2. Dopamine Function\n   - Triggered by possibility\n   - Sustained by small wins\n   - Reinforced by growth\n\n### Psychological Safety\n1. Non-Judgmental Awareness\n   - All patterns served a purpose\n   - Emotions are information\n   - Change comes from understanding\n\n2. Sustainable Change\n   - Small steps build confidence\n   - Natural motivation lasts\n   - Growth creates resilience\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Create additional diagrams for specific aspects?\n2. Expand on any particular section?\n3. Connect this back to the practical check-in process?",

Practical Patterns\n- Serve specific needs (survival, function, external demands)\n- Would happily automate or delegate if possible\n- Attention often split (monitoring outcomes)\n- Examples: Commuting for work, tracking deadlines, paying bills\n\n2. Meaningful Patterns\n- Feel inherently worth doing\n- Want to do personally even if could delegate\n- Attention naturally present\n- Examples: Creative expression, quality time with loved ones, learning for its own sake\n\n3. Pattern Tensions\n```markdown\nA. Between Practical & Meaningful\n   - Need to work vs. want to create\n   - Administrative tasks vs. deep engagement\n   - External demands vs. internal calling\n\nB. Between Different Meaningful Ways\n   - Family time vs. personal growth\n   - Different creative projects\n   - Multiple valuable relationships\n```\n\n### Working with Emotions & Tensions\n\n#### Emotion as Messenger\n1.

Support Natural Motivation\n- Connect to what matters\n- Remove unnecessary friction\n- Create enabling conditions\n\n#### System Tracking (Backend)\n```markdown\nTrack for each user:\n1.
