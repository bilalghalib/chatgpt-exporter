The plane has to fly and look good. The price will reflect its design, functionality, and how efficiently it is produced. Based on the trainers' thoughts on your plane, they will give your plane a selling price.\nBreak the group into small teams (about 3 people per team).\nThe trainer should have prototyping materials ready, including paper, markers, stickers, etc. These items are available to the entrepreneurs to continue using as they want throughout the entire game. They can use whatever they want.\nEntrepreneurs are free to continue asking the trainers (the people buying the planes) questions about the activity/type of plane to design (they can do user research to find out more about how to design their plane based on customers' needs/wants).\nEntrepreneurs should feel free to work with their groups wherever they are comfortable.\n55 Minutes: Activity\n10 minutes: The team will have 10 minutes to design a new product (paper airplane). Encourage them to consider how to make an effective design while using materials efficiently.\n10 minutes: Each group will pitch their plane to the trainer.\nThe trainer will evaluate functionality, design, and the overall pitch to determine a price for each plane.\nThe trainer can also consider the amount of work that went into the plane design. Did the team create a design that maximized performance while minimizing wasted materials?\nThe trainer should set prices like $2, $5, $10, $15, $20 depending on detail and flying capabilities. Try to have a variety of prices.\nTell them that each plane costs $5 to make (make it all the same to keep it simple). When we price the plane, some people will get better margins or worse margins.\nAnd some people would be able to produce a lot or a little, causing different levels of profitability. Some designs might be more efficient, allowing for faster production or lower costs. It depends on how the game goes, but interesting conversations come up.\n15 Minutes: Scaling Up the Production\nAnnounce to the groups that you like all of the planes they pitched and you would like to purchase them for your store.\nThey will have 10 minutes to produce 15 of the planes they pitched.\nHalfway through this time (after about 7 minutes), announce a change in demand:\nYou are expecting high demand for these planes after a focus group, and you would like to order 25 planes instead.\nAnnounce that you will extend the delivery time by 5 additional minutes (13 minutes left for production).\n15 Minutes: Evaluation & Discussion\nBring everyone back and tell people production has stopped—they must now deliver their products.\nThe trainer will now pay each group for their product.\nCount each plane that matches the one they pitched. Reject planes that do not work or do not match what they pitched to you.\nMultiply the number of accepted planes by the price that was set before mass production.\nSubtract $5 for each plane they made (even if the plane was rejected because they produced it).\nCalculate who made the most money!\nTrainer Tip: Make it more fun by offering a small piece of candy for each $ of profit they made.

The goal is to make a plane that **flies well, looks good, and is made efficiently** with minimal waste. The trainer (buyer) will set a price based on these factors.\n\nEach team gets **limited materials** (e.g., 2 sheets of paper per team). They can **use creative folding, reuse scraps, or share materials** to maximize output. \n\nEncourage teams to ask the buyer about preferences before designing their plane.\n\n#### **45 Minutes: Activity**\n##### **10 minutes: Design Phase**\n- Teams have **10 minutes to design their plane** while minimizing waste.\n- **Bonus challenge:** Can they make two planes from one sheet?\n- Cutting paper **increases risk**—if done poorly, it may ruin the material.\n\n##### **10 minutes: Pitch Phase**\n- Each team presents their plane.\n- The trainer evaluates:\n  1. **Flight performance**\n  2. **Design appeal**\n  3. **Material efficiency** (planes per sheet, minimal waste)\n- Planes receive a price based on these factors.\n\n##### **15 minutes: Production Challenge**\n- Teams **produce as many planes as they can** in 10 minutes.\n- **Surprise twist**: After 5 minutes, demand changes! More planes are needed, but teams have **only their remaining materials**.\n- Encourage **collaboration and adaptation** (e.g., using scraps, folding smarter).\n\n##### **10 Minutes: Evaluation & Discussion**\n- Count planes and calculate earnings (price per plane minus material costs).\n- Highlight teams that **reduced waste, made multiple planes per sheet, or adapted well**.\n- Discuss: How do real businesses balance quality, efficiency, and risk?\n\n### **Key Takeaways:**\n✅ **Less waste = more profit**\n✅ **Smart design reduces risk and increases output**\n✅ **Adaptability is key in business**\n",
