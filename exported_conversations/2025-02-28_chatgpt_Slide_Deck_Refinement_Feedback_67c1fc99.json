(Beliefs and Values Update)\nBefore:\n\"You can talk about your values all you want. Until it’s present in your habits, it won't be present in your actions, words, or thoughts.\"\n\nImproved Version:\n\"Values are not just what we say—we express them through our actions, decisions, and habits. The more we consciously align our daily behaviors with our deeper beliefs, the more naturally our values shape our work and relationships.\"\n\nBefore:\n\"Start with your beliefs and work forwards, designing your thoughts, your words, your actions, your habits to demonstrate your values.\"\n\nImproved Version:\n\"Your values stem from your beliefs. To make them tangible, start by shaping your thoughts, refining your words, reinforcing them through consistent actions, and eventually embedding them into your habits. This process ensures that your values become a lived reality rather than just aspirational statements.\"\n\nSlide: BUILD YOUR LINKEDIN (Activity Improvement)\nBefore:\n\"[[[Let's add an activity here to build our LinkedIn around a need our business has, leveraging people who know people directly in the program]]]\"\n\nImproved Activity:\n📌 Activity: Leveraging LinkedIn for Strategic Connections\n1️⃣ Write down one key professional challenge or opportunity your business is facing (e.g., finding a supplier, getting media coverage, connecting with investors).\n2️⃣ Browse LinkedIn and identify 3 people who might be able to help (directly or through their connections).\n3️⃣ Draft a message using this template:\n\n\"Hi [Name], I admire your work in [industry/field]. I'm currently working on [your project/goal] and looking to connect with people who have experience in [specific area]. I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on [specific ask]. Would you be open to a quick call or message exchange?\"\n\n4️⃣ Share your drafts in small groups, refine based on feedback, and send at least one message before the end of the session.\n\nSlide: FEAR GAME (Revised \"Ask\" Exercise)\nBefore:\n\"[[[improve the text here: Let’s play a fear game, find one person online in your field that you respect greatly, work to come up with a clear ask and follow this template:\nx y z a b c :\nFor a short message they will be bound to ask. often you can ask what you can do for people first, especially if it shows you’ve really done your homework. ]]]\"\n\nImproved Version:\n📌 Fear Game: Making The Ask\n🔹 Step 1: Identify Someone—Find an expert, entrepreneur, or professional you admire. It could be someone whose work aligns with your field or whose insights could help your business.\n🔹 Step 2: Research—Check their recent work, interviews, posts, or projects. Look for a connection or mutual interest.\n🔹 Step 3: Craft Your Ask Using the \"XYZ Formula\":\n\"Hi [Name], I came across your work in [specific area] and really appreciated [mention something specific]. I’m currently working on [your project] and looking for insights on [specific need]. Would you be open to a quick chat or message exchange? Also, I’d love to support your work by [mention something you can offer in return, even if it’s just sharing their content].\"\n🔹 Step 4: Send It!—No overthinking. The worst outcome? They don’t reply. The best? A valuable connection.\n\nSlide: FOLLOW UP (Networking Integration)\nBefore:\n\"Follow up! Reach out over email, phone, social media, or LinkedIn (depending on how your initial meeting went you might want to be more or less professional).\"\n\nImproved Version:\n📌 Follow-Up Best Practices\n✔ Timing Matters: Follow up within 48 hours of meeting someone while the conversation is fresh.\n✔ Be Specific: Reference something you discussed.\n✔ Offer Value: Instead of just asking for help, share something useful (an article, event, or connection).\n✔ Keep it Short & Actionable: Don’t overcomplicate—1-2 sentences plus a clear next step.\n\n💬 Example Follow-Up Message:\n\"Hi [Name], great meeting you at [event]. I really enjoyed our conversation about [topic]. I came across this article and thought you might find it interesting. Looking forward to staying in touch!\"\n\nSlide: FIND YOUR PEOPLE (Replacing Sustainability-Focused Content)\n🔹 Before:\nSustainability networks were the core focus.\n\n🔹 New Framing: \"Find Your People\"\n\"Building your brand is not just about visibility—it’s about finding the right people who inspire, challenge, and grow with you.\"\n\n📌 Where to Start:\n1️⃣ Entrepreneurial Networks—Join startup communities (e.g., Flat6Labs, Wamda, Startup Without Borders).\n2️⃣ Industry Groups—Find LinkedIn or WhatsApp groups where people in your field connect.\n3️⃣ Mentorship & Peer Support—Engage with accelerators, fellow entrepreneurs, and industry mentors.\n4️⃣ Collaborations & Learning—Attend workshops, contribute to discussions, and actively share your insights.\n\n💡 Action Step: Find and join one new online or offline community that aligns with your business goals before the end of this session.\n\nThese updates should refine the flow, make the session more interactive, and better integrate personal branding with practical networking strategies. Let me know if you’d like further refinements! 🚀\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nlet's update the values text to show how it connects to their business, the idea is that they are going to have to live with themselves, and ESG and other values based businesses have shown statistically that they do better. what's the research about values based entrepreneurship. it's clear steve jobs lived his values and used it to differentiate his business \nChatGPT said:\nIntegrating your personal values into your business isn't just about personal fulfillment; it's a strategic advantage that can drive success and sustainability.

This authenticity builds customer loyalty and increases sales.\nTesla: Elon Musk’s vision for sustainable energy drives its innovation and market leadership.\nTOMS Shoes: “One for One” giving model built a socially responsible brand that resonates with customers.\nValues are not just words; they are the DNA of a great company.\nAction: Define your business values. Ask yourself:\nWhat will you never compromise on?\nWhat do you want your customers and employees to feel when they engage with your brand?\nHow will your values guide daily decisions and long-term growth?\nSlide Title: Your Values in Action\nText:\n\nIntegrity & Trust → Leads to strong partnerships and repeat customers.\nInnovation & Creativity → Helps differentiate and stay ahead of the competition.\nSustainability & Responsibility → Attracts investors and customers who care about impact.\nCommunity & Connection → Builds lasting networks and support systems.\nExercise:\nTake 2 minutes to write down:\n\nOne personal value that deeply matters to you.\nOne way that value will influence how you run your business.\nThen, share with the person next to you.\n\nSlide Title: Business Success is Personal\nText:\n\nEntrepreneurs must live with their business choices every day.\nWhen you align your company with your values:\nYou avoid burnout and stay motivated.\nYou attract like-minded customers, employees, and investors.\nYour brand becomes authentic and memorable.\nFinal Thought: Your values are not just “nice to have” – they are your competitive advantage.\nThese slides ensure that values-based entrepreneurship isn’t just about ethics—it’s a proven business strategy.

How are you doing today? \nToday we will be talking about building a personal brand. We have already talked about building a brand for your business, but now we will focus on creating a personal, professional brand of your own. Having a strong personal brand will be important as you begin networking with others.\n1\n\nUnderstand the importance of having a strong personal brand.\nDefine how you create value for others in your life.\nCreate or improve your LinkedIn account and build your network.\n\nFIVE ONE LABS\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nUnderstand the importance of having a strong professional brand.\nDefine how you create value for others in your life.\nCreate a LinkedIn account and begin to build your network.\n\n2\n\nWHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?\nWhat are your values and mission?\nWhat value can you create?\nWhat are you trying to achieve in life?\n\n\n15 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nWhen we talk about personal branding, it covers many of the same things as branding for your business. All of you know yourselves and have a vision for the future. You all add value and create something special in this world. While creating your personal brand, your job is to share your mission and communicate that value with others. Personal branding allows you to show what matters to YOU. As founders, your personal brand should be somewhat tied into your business brand. For example, maybe you personally care so much about the environment and you are on a mission to make the world a safer and more healthy place for people. You can work towards accomplishing that mission in so many ways (start a business that has a positive impact on the environment, start a blog tackling environmental issues, buy eco-friendly products, etc….) \nSo before we get into ways that you can get yourself out there and start building a strong personal brand, you need to take some time to understand who you are and what you stand for. \n\nActivity: 15 Minutes\n10 minutes: Individual work\nAsk the entrepreneurs to take out a pen and paper and answer the following questions:\nWhat value can you create?\nWhat are your values and mission? \nWhat are you trying to achieve in life?\n5 minutes: Share\nGo around the room and have a few people share their answers\n\nRecap: The first step to crafting your personal brand is to lay a foundation that you can confidently and authentically build upon. The key principle here is authenticity. There is a misconception that building a personal brand means crafting a persona. But a persona, by definition, is a facade. It’s not a true reflection of who you are, and therefore, it’s inauthentic. Your personal brand should not be an inauthentic persona. You are the face of your business and you need to show up loud and proud about all of the amazing things that you are doing. \n\n3\n\nWHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?\nWe are what we repeatedly do.\nexcellence, therefore, isn't just\nan act, but a habit and life isn't\njust a series of events, but an\nongoing process of\nself-definition.\n\n[[[5 minutes: Lecture\nOur business will become one of the primary places where we spend time, how we meet people, and the context through which we interact with many people. \nLet’s be sure it’s the place we want to be. \nWe’ve discussed values as a way to find aligned customers, find a niche, and design a user experience that supports people meeting their wants and needs while upholding their values. Now another important element to realize is that our values are going to become more visible through our business and decisions. ]]]\n4\n\nWHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?\nYour beliefs become your thoughts,\nyour thoughts become your words,\nyour words become your actions,\nyour actions become your habits,\nyour habits become your values,\nyour values become your destiny.\n5 minutes: Lecture \nValues are not just what we say—we express them through our actions, decisions, and habits. The more we consciously align our daily behaviors with our deeper beliefs, the more naturally our values shape our work and relationships\nYour values stem from your beliefs. To make them tangible, start by reviewing your beliefs, shaping your thoughts, refining your words, reinforcing them through consistent actions, and embedding them into your habits. This process ensures that your values become a lived reality in your life, and through your life in your business.\n5\n\nYOUR PERSONAL BRAND\n10-15 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What are ways that you can begin building this brand now? What can you do to get your name (and your business) out there? \n[[[Note: Remember, everything you do “speaks” - For example, if you don’t print your business cards in order to use less paper and use QR codes instead, this is an expression of your care for the environment.]]]\nPotential answers:\nCreate a LinkedIn\nParticipate in events, panel discussions, and pitch competitions to build a better network and let other people know you and what you are trying to accomplish\nGetting featured in the media, having a personal brand makes it easier for you to pitch and be found by the media (online publications, magazines, television, radio, podcasts, social media posts, articles, post by influencers, etc.). The media is in constant search of experts that can share their insights with their audience.\nCreate valuable content, and share it with others. Portray yourself as an expert in something. Create something valuable that others will want to share. As they share your brand, they also will be sharing your business that you represent. \nStart to introduce yourself to more people, follow up with them, and get in contact with each other to find ways to mutually support each other (begin networking!)\nBrand recognition is one of the biggest obstacles for startups, and many never achieve it. Online marketing campaigns may not work if you do not make the effort to spread the word and show the world what you are capable of. To increase visibility. If you want to build a famous brand, there is often a person pushing that behind the scenes. You want to build awareness and show what you are doing  (which is running your business).\n\nAsk: Why is it important that you actually work to implement these things and develop this brand? Who is involved and how does that impact your business?\nContacts: Having good contacts in today’s business world is so important. \nPartners: Having a strong professional brand shows that you are professional and have passion to be able to run your business. Show others that you are an expert in your field and that you are the right person to be running your business. This is a must have when approaching partners and potential collaborators. \nCustomers: You may also find new customers for your business. With so many small businesses popping up, a brand that connects to a customer is much easier to trust faster. People will trust your business more if they know who is running it. It builds trust to see a face of someone doing good things behind the scenes and see all the experience they have. \nInvestors: The best way to gain the attention of an investor is by speaking to him/her directly. Face to face conversations build trust and are the foundation of a future relationship. People can only invest in your business when they know you exist, and see that you are professional. \nYou need to convince people around you that you are professional, and you have the grit, passion, and ethics to lead a business. People look at the individual's capability of carrying out a business idea. Increase the chance of investment. \nGood ideas are a dime a dozen. If the person isn’t there to implement the project and lead the organization, the good idea will fail. Investors tend to invest in the founders ability to bring an idea to life. Not the idea.\nTeam: When the founders stand for something and build a strong brand identity around a mission, this will trickle down to the business itself. Based on your values, you will create your policies and company culture. A strong founder is a part of a strong team which will make an even stronger company.\n\nRecap: Your personal brand will be defined by your actions and how people view those actions. If you DON'T want to work to build a personal brand, you should realize that everything you do reflects on your business. If your reputation is as a cheat and liar, then it's going to be a poor reflection on your business. There is so much you can be doing right now to start developing a positive brand image and deliver your message to the world. Over the next few slides, we will talk about some of these ideas in more detail and brainstorm ways to actually implement them.\n\n6\n\nNETWORK\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nOne great way to get yourself out there is through networking. Face to face networking is all about exchanging ideas and information with the people you meet in order to create relationships that could help you grow your business. Already, you have had so many opportunities to network with people. Whether it is the judges that come for competitions, CEO Talks, business breakfasts, or people in the co-working space, Five One Labs holds events all the time, and you should take advantage of it! Make sure that you are taking the opportunity to talk to them and start that long-term relationship. \n\nIf it was not mentioned on the previous slide, ask: How might your network be able to help you or your business?\nPotential answers:\nFind new customers, \nFind partners, \nFind suppliers\nProvide information, advice or mentorship\nProvide technical support,\nHelp find investment or other needed resources\nFind team members or co-founders\nEtc…\n\nAsk: When you meet people face to face, what are some best practices? Note: Keep in mind that a lot of this is cultural and you should be able to recognize that one style doesn’t fit every situation. Be aware of who you are talking too so that you don’t come off too cocky and turn people off.\nPotential answers:\nUse stories to evoke emotions. You want to listen to them as well. Learn about what they are doing to try to find ways to collaborate in the future. Being a good listener is one of the best ways to be a good communicator.\nShow actual evidence of what you are doing. Show them your website or product if it is available.\nSmile when you speak. Look engaged and happy to be there.\nBe memorable especially when you are meeting high profile people\nCreate a link between the two of you.\nHave good body language.\nBe confident! Even though it can be uncomfortable to talk to new people, just pretend you are confident for the time being. Confidence is key!\nBe empathetic about the other person and their work .\nBe open minded. You never know who you will meet and how they might be able to help you. \nAsk for their business card or a way to reach out again\nSet up a reason why you might reach out again in the near future\nAlways be respectful\nAsk: Networking can be hard and really intimidating especially for shy people. What are some best practices for networking when you are more introverted? \nPotential answers:\nNetwork in groups\nLook for other people standing alone. They might be a bit shy as well and easy to talk to\nSee if you can find out who is at the event ahead of time so you can mentally prepare yourself\nDo your best to put yourself out there. Try not to stand in the corner alone by the snacks! Or you can use that as a really easy starting point for conversations.\nCommit yourself to a goal before the event. \nSpeak to 5 people \nGet 5 business cards. \nFind 1 person who could be a customer in the future\nEtc… \n7\n\nHOLD AND ATTEND EVENTS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nA great way to get your name out there is by holding events. \nAsk: Why is holding events so important to do (especially as an early stage startup)?  What kind of events can you start to hold right now?\nPotential answers:\nGet your name out there\nMake partnerships and connections with different players in the ecosystem\nFind potential customers\nFind employees\nYou can have product testing events\nYou can have a launch party\nYou can have an event related to your mission and invite other organizations and people interested in your mission\n\nShare an example of how holding events is really important.\nThe picture above shows the founder of Fix-It (an application that connects repair men to people who need something repaired in their home) meeting with a group of repair men. In this meeting, she gave an overview of the application and how it worked. She allowed them to test her product and give feedback on it. She was able to use this as an opportunity to sign repair men onto her platform which was essential for her product to work.\n\nIf you don’t hold your own events, you can at least attend events. If you want to network, go to as many events as you can. The more you talk to people about your mission and business, the more people will know about it. You can’t spend all your time at events, so be strategic about what you attend. It is a great idea to go to events that will have the people you are looking to meet. \nAsk: If you are interested in meeting potential customers, where might you go? \nAnswer: Go to events/places where customers will be such as public events, universities, etc… (you have to know your customers to answer this)\nAsk: If you are interested in meeting people who could partner or invest in your business, where might you go? \nAnswer: Go to events/places where they are such as business seminars and workshops.\n8\n\nGET FEATURED IN MEDIA\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nGetting featured in the media is a great way to build a strong reputation. These media outlets usually have a strong following and will give you a lot of visibility.\nGive 1-2 examples of entrepreneurs who have been successful at this: \nRandi from our FFF was highlighted on Babylon FM. Randi is the founder of Shopyobrand. She is really active and tries to get visibility for her business.\nLaylan from Dada was highlighted on NRT. From this press (among other things she was doing publically), she was able to build a buzz around her business. She even got invited to Baghdad to pitch and came in 3rd place. She made it to the next level and was able to go to Lebanon where she pitched again.\n\nAsk: How could you get yourself featured in the media? \nPotential answers:\nNetwork with people! The more you talk to people and put yourself out there, the more of a chance there will be of someone who might be in the industry or know someone who can help you get featured somewhere. \nAt Five One Labs, we have journalists and reporters come for all different reasons (Demo Day, events, sometimes they just ask to do a story). If we see that you are active with your business and are making great progress, we will suggest your name to them. Alternatively, don’t be afraid to just approach these people and talk to them. They might offer to include you in a piece, but sometimes you might have to have to ask. \nIf you are active and in the spotlight, people might reach out to you to learn more about what you are doing. \nMedia outlets usually want to tell a good story so inspire others with your mission and vision.\nEtc…\n9\n\nWORK WITH INFLUENCERS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nInfluencers are usually trusted in the market because they are popular or have great knowledge and experience in a particular field. People really trust them and they have the ability to influence the purchasing of their audience. Even if they don’t influence purchases, they can influence their followers to also follow you or to spread the word about what you are doing. \nAsk: If you wanted to work with an influencer, how would you approach this?\nPotential answers:\nYou can DM them\nUse someone in your network to connect you\nYou can reach out to super famous people (you probably won’t get an answer), or you can reach out to smaller less known influencers\nEtc…\n\nIn general, you can follow these 5 steps to find influencers to work with on social media: \nMonitor conversations online to see who is popular in the space\nIdentify influential people who you might be able to work with\nPinpoint what factors/values you share with these influencers so that you can approach them in a good way\nLocate and recruit the influencers to work with you or partner on a project/campaign\nIncentivize them to work with you. Sometimes you have to pay really popular influencers, but not always. If you are smart about who you approach and how you do it, you might be able to do this for free and benefit from sharing each other’s followers. You usually have to have a clearly aligned and mutually beneficial mission for this to work well. \n\nAsk: Who are people that you already know that you could potentially work with? Who are well known and influential people who are working towards a similar mission?\nMaybe people have answers to this already, but maybe they don’t\nSuggest that they begin to look into this and create a list of some people to partner with in this way. \n10\n\nCREATE A LINKEDIN\n1 hour and 10 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\nFinally, the last thing we will talk about as a way to build your personal brand is LinkedIn.\nAsk: Who here has a LinkedIn? What do you use it for? How can you use LinkedIn to share your message and build your network?\nPotential answers:\nPeople who have (or have had) LinkedIn profiles should share. \nLinkedIn is a social media platform for professionals. \nIt is a great platform to get visibility and put your face on the map.\nYou can use it to share skills, knowledge, resources, ideas, and more.\nYou can search for a job or post job offerings here.\nIt is a platform to tell your story or the story of your business.\nYou can have a business profile to create more brand awareness.\nYou are on a platform full of people who are interested in business, making partnerships, and more. \nYou can find founders, students, employees, investors, subject matter experts, and more all in one place.\nConversation topics can be about a variety of industries, sectors, and locations.\nYou can learn about other businesses and opportunities.\nFind supporters, advisors, or mentors.\nYou can stay up to date on trends and news in your industry.\nIt is a great platform for creating and building your network. You can add people that you meet from other networking events to your Linked in to help stay in touch. You can also use your LinkedIn to grow your network by posting content, engaging in conversations, and more. \nPotential partners and collaborators are there. If you are looking to make a connection to a particular business or looking for someone with a particular skill, you can easily search and find people on LinkedIn. If you have mutual friends, sometimes you can request an introduction to someone in the organization.  For instance, I have a project that I think UNHCR would be a great partner for, but I don’t know anyone from the organization, I can ask my friend who works there to connect me with one of her connections. Keep in mind that not everyone is willing to put out their connections for you, you have to prove to be highly professional, otherwise it would look bad for your friend (and the brand they are building for themselves). \nAttract more clients by participating in events and sharing your experience with your network, building a personal brand that positions you as the go-to expert in a specific industry or niche helps you to attract more of your ideal clients. When you’re positioned as an expert, it’s also easier for people to refer clients to you.\n\nAsk: What does Ameen’s LinkedIn profile say about him?\nYou can see from his picture that he is professional, but possibly fun and approachable. He looks very friendly.\nHe is showcasing his business Pharx and the value that it creates “Affordable Medicine in your Hands” in a very simple and clear way.\n“Entrepreneur in Residence” is showing that he is an entrepreneur and lives in Mosul\nHis “About” section shows that he is a founder. It talks about his passion for entrepreneurship and innovation. His passion is directly tied into his business.\n\n1 hour: Activity\nEntrepreneurs will now work on their LinkedIn (either starting from scratch or updating their current profile)\nUse the Personal Branding Checklist handout to guide you on what to do. \nA trainer will go around helping entrepreneurs get the right wording of their headlines and about me section. Make sure that it highlights their passion and it is also tied into their business. \nAs entrepreneurs build their LinkedIn page, make sure they highlight the following points: \nCreate your profile: Sign up and create your profile.\nMake good connections: You can begin by adding your family, friends, past or current classmates, coworkers, judges, visitors from CEO Talks and other events to your network. \u000b[[Let's add an activity here to build our linkedin around a need our business has, leveraging people who know people directly in the program]]]\nHighlight experience and expertise: Your professional bio is an important piece of personal information that will help you catch the interest of the viewer. It can be awkward writing about yourself, but it is important to highlight your past experience and successes. What skills have you acquired throughout your life? What training, credentials, certifications, or awards have you received? It is ok if your background doesn’t tie in perfectly with your business, but try to find links and similarities wherever you can (remember that a brand is consistent and telling a good story). \nHighlight your personality: What are some of your most important core values? What do you believe in? What do you stand for? What do you stand against? What industries and topics are you most interested in? What are you passionate about?\n\nTrainer note: On a rare occasion, an entrepreneur might not want to do this. Encourage that they create one, but don’t force them. The entrepreneur can use the time to help other people in the cohort with this activity or work individually to come up with a personal branding plan. \n11\n\nFOLLOW UP\n3 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: After you begin meeting new people and growing your network face to face, what should you do?\nPotential answers: \nFollow up! \nReach out over email, phone, social media, or LinkedIn (depending on how your initial meeting went you might want to be more or less professional). \nSome people might say to ask for something (which is fine), but make sure that they know when it is an appropriate time to ask for things (this point will be covered on slide 13).\n12\n\nFEAR GAME\n[[[3 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsking can be scary. Especially if there’s someone you really respect or admire.\n[[[improve the text here: Let’s play a fear game, find one person online in your field that you respect greatly, work to come up with a clear ask and follow this template: \u000bx y z a b c :\u000bFor a short message they will be bound to ask. often you can ask what you can do for people first, especially if it shows you’ve really done your homework. ]]]]]]\n13\n\nENGAGE MEANINGFULLY\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nThe follow up element of this is really important. You will never meet someone and then instantly they will provide you with all you need. You need to follow up with them and build a relationship with them over time. It would be good to learn about their needs so that you can help them too. \n\nAsk: What are ways that you can engage with the people you have met? How can you continue the conversation and build relationships?\nPotential answers:\nEmail them to follow up on your conversation from when you met. Maybe give them resources based on what you talked about. Did they offer to provide you with something? If so, remind them. – During the follow up, make sure that you are polite and not demanding. Send an email and a follow up, but if there is no answer, back off and give the person some space. You shouldn’t assume that anything is guaranteed. \nDistinguish how professional the contact is. If they are more friendly, consider reaching out over Whatsapp or text message\nFollow up on LinkedIn:\nPost content: Post about the event you were at where you met the person. \nTag people. This will encourage the people who were tagged to like, comment, and share which will help spread awareness about you and your business. \nUse the right hashtags to help you show up in the right conversations\nShare pictures\nLet people know what you are up to!\n\nParticipate in conversations: You can also contribute your knowledge and skills in conversations that are happening on the platform. You can easily participate in conversations on LinkedIn. Participating in conversations can allow you to share your perspective on relevant issues, things happening in your industry, and topics with others. You can like and comment on posts and articles on LinkedIn. You can create or join groups to connect and grow with members who share your interests, experiences, or aspirations.\n14\n\nASK!\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nDon’t forget, as you build your network, you are building opportunities for collaboration. You should feel comfortable reaching out to people in your network when you need something. Benefit from the relations you made and start asking and growing.  \n\nAsk: What can you use your network for? How might they be able to help you?\nPotential answers:\nProvide expertise or mentorship\nSupport in a variety of areas or make a connection to someone else who can. Areas might include:\nCustomers\nPartners\nSupplier\nMentor\nInvestor\nEtc…\n\nAsk: Although a lot of this changes culture to culture, what are things you should do and not do when reaching out to your network for something?\nDo:\nBuild a relationship with the person first. Spend time with them and learn about their needs.\nBe polite\nOffer something in return (time, support, resources, money, etc…)\nFind things you have in common or common things that you are working on \nIn emails, write a meaningful subject line and keep the message focused. \nIdentify yourself clearly and remind the person of how you met and what you talked about.\nAsking for advice is a good first step to start a conversation.\nProofread.\n\nDon’t:\nDon’t be too direct. Don’t just randomly email someone you are not close to and ask for something\nDon’t expect them to just say “yes”. Be aware of the fact that the person might not be interested\nDon’t be rude or too demanding\nDon’t ask things from strangers\nDon’t be too formal/informal. Distinguish between formal and informal situations and know when it is appropriate/inappropriate to ask for things. \n\nRecap: Once you build a relationship of mutual trust, then you can benefit from the relationship by asking for something. This can be anything from sharing their network, to advice, to resources. Be careful with your ask. Always be respectful and don’t demand anything.\n\n15\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nDefine how you will develop your personal brand and work towards achieving your personal mission.\n\nCreate your LinkedIn and apply the personal branding checklist to your profile.\n\nStart taking professional photos!\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\n16\n\n\nTHANK YOU\nANY QUESTIONS?\n17]]]\nChatGPT said:\nIntegrating personal values into your entrepreneurial journey not only fosters authenticity but also correlates with enhanced business performance.

All of you know yourselves and have a vision for the future. You all add value and create something special in this world. While creating your personal brand, your job is to share your mission and communicate that value with others. Personal branding allows you to show what matters to YOU. As founders, your personal brand should be somewhat tied into your business brand. For example, maybe you personally care so much about the environment and you are on a mission to make the world a safer and more healthy place for people. You can work towards accomplishing that mission in so many ways (start a business that has a positive impact on the environment, start a blog tackling environmental issues, buy eco-friendly products, etc….) \nSo before we get into ways that you can get yourself out there and start building a strong personal brand, you need to take some time to understand who you are and what you stand for. \n\nActivity: 15 Minutes\n10 minutes: Individual work\nAsk the entrepreneurs to take out a pen and paper and answer the following questions:\nWhat value can you create?\nWhat are your values and mission? \nWhat are you trying to achieve in life?\n5 minutes: Share\nGo around the room and have a few people share their answers\n\nRecap: The first step to crafting your personal brand is to lay a foundation that you can confidently and authentically build upon. The key principle here is authenticity. There is a misconception that building a personal brand means crafting a persona. But a persona, by definition, is a facade. It’s not a true reflection of who you are, and therefore, it’s inauthentic. Your personal brand should not be an inauthentic persona. You are the face of your business and you need to show up loud and proud about all of the amazing things that you are doing. \n\n3\n\nWHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?\nWhat are your values and mission?\nWhat value can you create?\nWhat are you trying to achieve in life?\n\n\n15 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nWhen we talk about personal branding, it covers many of the same things as branding for your business.

Now another important element to realize is that our values are going to become more visible through our business and decisions. ]]]\n5\n\nWHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?\nYour beliefs become your thoughts,\nyour thoughts become your words,\nyour words become your actions,\nyour actions become your habits,\nyour habits become your values,\nyour values become your destiny.\n5 minutes: Lecture \nValues are not just what we say—we express them through our actions, decisions, and habits. The more we consciously align our daily behaviors with our deeper beliefs, the more naturally our values shape our work and relationships\nYour values stem from your beliefs. To make them tangible, start by reviewing your beliefs, shaping your thoughts, refining your words, reinforcing them through consistent actions, and embedding them into your habits. This process ensures that your values become a lived reality in your life, and through your life in your business.\n6\n\nYOUR PERSONAL BRAND\n10-15 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What are ways that you can begin building this brand now? What can you do to get your name (and your business) out there? \n[[[Note: Remember, everything you do “speaks” - For example, if you don’t print your business cards in order to use less paper and use QR codes instead, this is an expression of your care for the environment.]]]\nPotential answers:\nCreate a LinkedIn\nParticipate in events, panel discussions, and pitch competitions to build a better network and let other people know you and what you are trying to accomplish\nGetting featured in the media, having a personal brand makes it easier for you to pitch and be found by the media (online publications, magazines, television, radio, podcasts, social media posts, articles, post by influencers, etc.). The media is in constant search of experts that can share their insights with their audience.\nCreate valuable content, and share it with others. Portray yourself as an expert in something. Create something valuable that others will want to share. As they share your brand, they also will be sharing your business that you represent. \nStart to introduce yourself to more people, follow up with them, and get in contact with each other to find ways to mutually support each other (begin networking!)\nBrand recognition is one of the biggest obstacles for startups, and many never achieve it. Online marketing campaigns may not work if you do not make the effort to spread the word and show the world what you are capable of. To increase visibility. If you want to build a famous brand, there is often a person pushing that behind the scenes. You want to build awareness and show what you are doing  (which is running your business).\n\nAsk: Why is it important that you actually work to implement these things and develop this brand? Who is involved and how does that impact your business?\nContacts: Having good contacts in today’s business world is so important. \nPartners: Having a strong professional brand shows that you are professional and have passion to be able to run your business. Show others that you are an expert in your field and that you are the right person to be running your business. This is a must have when approaching partners and potential collaborators. \nCustomers: You may also find new customers for your business. With so many small businesses popping up, a brand that connects to a customer is much easier to trust faster. People will trust your business more if they know who is running it. It builds trust to see a face of someone doing good things behind the scenes and see all the experience they have. \nInvestors: The best way to gain the attention of an investor is by speaking to him/her directly. Face to face conversations build trust and are the foundation of a future relationship. People can only invest in your business when they know you exist, and see that you are professional. \nYou need to convince people around you that you are professional, and you have the grit, passion, and ethics to lead a business. People look at the individual's capability of carrying out a business idea. Increase the chance of investment. \nGood ideas are a dime a dozen. If the person isn’t there to implement the project and lead the organization, the good idea will fail. Investors tend to invest in the founders ability to bring an idea to life. Not the idea.\nTeam: When the founders stand for something and build a strong brand identity around a mission, this will trickle down to the business itself. Based on your values, you will create your policies and company culture. A strong founder is a part of a strong team which will make an even stronger company.\n\nRecap: Your personal brand will be defined by your actions and how people view those actions. If you DON'T want to work to build a personal brand, you should realize that everything you do reflects on your business. If your reputation is as a cheat and liar, then it's going to be a poor reflection on your business. There is so much you can be doing right now to start developing a positive brand image and deliver your message to the world. Over the next few slides, we will talk about some of these ideas in more detail and brainstorm ways to actually implement them.\n\n7\n\nNETWORK\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nOne great way to get yourself out there is through networking. Face to face networking is all about exchanging ideas and information with the people you meet in order to create relationships that could help you grow your business. Already, you have had so many opportunities to network with people. Whether it is the judges that come for competitions, CEO Talks, business breakfasts, or people in the co-working space, Five One Labs holds events all the time, and you should take advantage of it! Make sure that you are taking the opportunity to talk to them and start that long-term relationship. \n\nIf it was not mentioned on the previous slide, ask: How might your network be able to help you or your business?\nPotential answers:\nFind new customers, \nFind partners, \nFind suppliers\nProvide information, advice or mentorship\nProvide technical support,\nHelp find investment or other needed resources\nFind team members or co-founders\nEtc…\n\nAsk: When you meet people face to face, what are some best practices? Note: Keep in mind that a lot of this is cultural and you should be able to recognize that one style doesn’t fit every situation. Be aware of who you are talking too so that you don’t come off too cocky and turn people off.\nPotential answers:\nUse stories to evoke emotions. You want to listen to them as well. Learn about what they are doing to try to find ways to collaborate in the future. Being a good listener is one of the best ways to be a good communicator.\nShow actual evidence of what you are doing. Show them your website or product if it is available.\nSmile when you speak. Look engaged and happy to be there.\nBe memorable especially when you are meeting high profile people\nCreate a link between the two of you.\nHave good body language.\nBe confident! Even though it can be uncomfortable to talk to new people, just pretend you are confident for the time being. Confidence is key!\nBe empathetic about the other person and their work .\nBe open minded. You never know who you will meet and how they might be able to help you. \nAsk for their business card or a way to reach out again\nSet up a reason why you might reach out again in the near future\nAlways be respectful\nAsk: Networking can be hard and really intimidating especially for shy people. What are some best practices for networking when you are more introverted? \nPotential answers:\nNetwork in groups\nLook for other people standing alone. They might be a bit shy as well and easy to talk to\nSee if you can find out who is at the event ahead of time so you can mentally prepare yourself\nDo your best to put yourself out there. Try not to stand in the corner alone by the snacks! Or you can use that as a really easy starting point for conversations.\nCommit yourself to a goal before the event. \nSpeak to 5 people \nGet 5 business cards. \nFind 1 person who could be a customer in the future\nEtc… \n8\n\nHOLD AND ATTEND EVENTS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nA great way to get your name out there is by holding events. \nAsk: Why is holding events so important to do (especially as an early stage startup)?  What kind of events can you start to hold right now?\nPotential answers:\nGet your name out there\nMake partnerships and connections with different players in the ecosystem\nFind potential customers\nFind employees\nYou can have product testing events\nYou can have a launch party\nYou can have an event related to your mission and invite other organizations and people interested in your mission\n\nShare an example of how holding events is really important.\nThe picture above shows the founder of Fix-It (an application that connects repair men to people who need something repaired in their home) meeting with a group of repair men. In this meeting, she gave an overview of the application and how it worked. She allowed them to test her product and give feedback on it. She was able to use this as an opportunity to sign repair men onto her platform which was essential for her product to work.\n\nIf you don’t hold your own events, you can at least attend events. If you want to network, go to as many events as you can. The more you talk to people about your mission and business, the more people will know about it. You can’t spend all your time at events, so be strategic about what you attend. It is a great idea to go to events that will have the people you are looking to meet. \nAsk: If you are interested in meeting potential customers, where might you go? \nAnswer: Go to events/places where customers will be such as public events, universities, etc… (you have to know your customers to answer this)\nAsk: If you are interested in meeting people who could partner or invest in your business, where might you go? \nAnswer: Go to events/places where they are such as business seminars and workshops.\n9\n\nGET FEATURED IN MEDIA\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nGetting featured in the media is a great way to build a strong reputation. These media outlets usually have a strong following and will give you a lot of visibility.\nGive 1-2 examples of entrepreneurs who have been successful at this: \nRandi from our FFF was highlighted on Babylon FM. Randi is the founder of Shopyobrand. She is really active and tries to get visibility for her business.\nLaylan from Dada was highlighted on NRT. From this press (among other things she was doing publically), she was able to build a buzz around her business. She even got invited to Baghdad to pitch and came in 3rd place. She made it to the next level and was able to go to Lebanon where she pitched again.\n\nAsk: How could you get yourself featured in the media? \nPotential answers:\nNetwork with people! The more you talk to people and put yourself out there, the more of a chance there will be of someone who might be in the industry or know someone who can help you get featured somewhere. \nAt Five One Labs, we have journalists and reporters come for all different reasons (Demo Day, events, sometimes they just ask to do a story). If we see that you are active with your business and are making great progress, we will suggest your name to them. Alternatively, don’t be afraid to just approach these people and talk to them. They might offer to include you in a piece, but sometimes you might have to have to ask. \nIf you are active and in the spotlight, people might reach out to you to learn more about what you are doing. \nMedia outlets usually want to tell a good story so inspire others with your mission and vision.\nEtc…\n10\n\nWORK WITH INFLUENCERS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nInfluencers are usually trusted in the market because they are popular or have great knowledge and experience in a particular field. People really trust them and they have the ability to influence the purchasing of their audience. Even if they don’t influence purchases, they can influence their followers to also follow you or to spread the word about what you are doing. \nAsk: If you wanted to work with an influencer, how would you approach this?\nPotential answers:\nYou can DM them\nUse someone in your network to connect you\nYou can reach out to super famous people (you probably won’t get an answer), or you can reach out to smaller less known influencers\nEtc…\n\nIn general, you can follow these 5 steps to find influencers to work with on social media: \nMonitor conversations online to see who is popular in the space\nIdentify influential people who you might be able to work with\nPinpoint what factors/values you share with these influencers so that you can approach them in a good way\nLocate and recruit the influencers to work with you or partner on a project/campaign\nIncentivize them to work with you. Sometimes you have to pay really popular influencers, but not always. If you are smart about who you approach and how you do it, you might be able to do this for free and benefit from sharing each other’s followers. You usually have to have a clearly aligned and mutually beneficial mission for this to work well. \n\nAsk: Who are people that you already know that you could potentially work with? Who are well known and influential people who are working towards a similar mission?\nMaybe people have answers to this already, but maybe they don’t\nSuggest that they begin to look into this and create a list of some people to partner with in this way. \n11\n\nCREATE A LINKEDIN\n1 hour and 10 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\nFinally, the last thing we will talk about as a way to build your personal brand is LinkedIn.\nAsk: Who here has a LinkedIn? What do you use it for? How can you use LinkedIn to share your message and build your network?\nPotential answers:\nPeople who have (or have had) LinkedIn profiles should share. \nLinkedIn is a social media platform for professionals. \nIt is a great platform to get visibility and put your face on the map.\nYou can use it to share skills, knowledge, resources, ideas, and more.\nYou can search for a job or post job offerings here.\nIt is a platform to tell your story or the story of your business.\nYou can have a business profile to create more brand awareness.\nYou are on a platform full of people who are interested in business, making partnerships, and more. \nYou can find founders, students, employees, investors, subject matter experts, and more all in one place.\nConversation topics can be about a variety of industries, sectors, and locations.\nYou can learn about other businesses and opportunities.\nFind supporters, advisors, or mentors.\nYou can stay up to date on trends and news in your industry.\nIt is a great platform for creating and building your network. You can add people that you meet from other networking events to your Linked in to help stay in touch. You can also use your LinkedIn to grow your network by posting content, engaging in conversations, and more. \nPotential partners and collaborators are there. If you are looking to make a connection to a particular business or looking for someone with a particular skill, you can easily search and find people on LinkedIn. If you have mutual friends, sometimes you can request an introduction to someone in the organization.  For instance, I have a project that I think UNHCR would be a great partner for, but I don’t know anyone from the organization, I can ask my friend who works there to connect me with one of her connections. Keep in mind that not everyone is willing to put out their connections for you, you have to prove to be highly professional, otherwise it would look bad for your friend (and the brand they are building for themselves). \nAttract more clients by participating in events and sharing your experience with your network, building a personal brand that positions you as the go-to expert in a specific industry or niche helps you to attract more of your ideal clients. When you’re positioned as an expert, it’s also easier for people to refer clients to you.\n\nAsk: What does Ameen’s LinkedIn profile say about him?\nYou can see from his picture that he is professional, but possibly fun and approachable. He looks very friendly.\nHe is showcasing his business Pharx and the value that it creates “Affordable Medicine in your Hands” in a very simple and clear way.\n“Entrepreneur in Residence” is showing that he is an entrepreneur and lives in Mosul\nHis “About” section shows that he is a founder. It talks about his passion for entrepreneurship and innovation. His passion is directly tied into his business.\n\n1 hour: Activity\nEntrepreneurs will now work on their LinkedIn (either starting from scratch or updating their current profile)\nUse the Personal Branding Checklist handout to guide you on what to do. \nA trainer will go around helping entrepreneurs get the right wording of their headlines and about me section. Make sure that it highlights their passion and it is also tied into their business. \nAs entrepreneurs build their LinkedIn page, make sure they highlight the following points: \nCreate your profile: Sign up and create your profile.\nProfile Authenticity: Ensure your LinkedIn profile reflects your personal values and mission, attracting like-minded professionals and opportunities.\nMake good connections: You can begin by adding your family, friends, past or current classmates, coworkers, judges, visitors from CEO Talks and other events to your network. \u000b[[Let's add an activity here to build our linkedin around a need our business has, leveraging people who know people directly in the program]]]\nHighlight experience and expertise: Your professional bio is an important piece of personal information that will help you catch the interest of the viewer. It can be awkward writing about yourself, but it is important to highlight your past experience and successes. What skills have you acquired throughout your life? What training, credentials, certifications, or awards have you received? It is ok if your background doesn’t tie in perfectly with your business, but try to find links and similarities wherever you can (remember that a brand is consistent and telling a good story). \nHighlight your personality: What are some of your most important core values? What do you believe in? What do you stand for? What do you stand against? What industries and topics are you most interested in? What are you passionate about?\n\nTrainer note: On a rare occasion, an entrepreneur might not want to do this. Encourage that they create one, but don’t force them. The entrepreneur can use the time to help other people in the cohort with this activity or work individually to come up with a personal branding plan. \n12\n\nFOLLOW UP\n3 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: After you begin meeting new people and growing your network face to face, what should you do?\nPotential answers: \nFollow up! \nReach out over email, phone, social media, or LinkedIn (depending on how your initial meeting went you might want to be more or less professional). \nSome people might say to ask for something (which is fine), but make sure that they know when it is an appropriate time to ask for things (this point will be covered on slide 13).\n13\n\nFEAR GAME\n[[[3 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsking can be scary. Especially if there’s someone you really respect or admire.\n[[[improve the text here: Let’s play a fear game, find one person online in your field that you respect greatly, work to come up with a clear ask and follow this template: \u000bx y z a b c :\u000bFor a short message they will be bound to ask. often you can ask what you can do for people first, especially if it shows you’ve really done your homework. ]]]]]]\n14\n\nENGAGE MEANINGFULLY\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nThe follow up element of this is really important. You will never meet someone and then instantly they will provide you with all you need. You need to follow up with them and build a relationship with them over time. It would be good to learn about their needs so that you can help them too. \n\nAsk: What are ways that you can engage with the people you have met? How can you continue the conversation and build relationships?\nPotential answers:\nEmail them to follow up on your conversation from when you met. Maybe give them resources based on what you talked about. Did they offer to provide you with something? If so, remind them. – During the follow up, make sure that you are polite and not demanding. Send an email and a follow up, but if there is no answer, back off and give the person some space. You shouldn’t assume that anything is guaranteed. \nDistinguish how professional the contact is. If they are more friendly, consider reaching out over Whatsapp or text message\nFollow up on LinkedIn:\nPost content: Post about the event you were at where you met the person. \nTag people. This will encourage the people who were tagged to like, comment, and share which will help spread awareness about you and your business. \nUse the right hashtags to help you show up in the right conversations\nShare pictures\nLet people know what you are up to!\n\nParticipate in conversations: You can also contribute your knowledge and skills in conversations that are happening on the platform. You can easily participate in conversations on LinkedIn. Participating in conversations can allow you to share your perspective on relevant issues, things happening in your industry, and topics with others. You can like and comment on posts and articles on LinkedIn. You can create or join groups to connect and grow with members who share your interests, experiences, or aspirations.\nEngage Authentically: Consider when following up, reference shared values to strengthen professional relationships.\nBuild Long-Term Relationships: Building connections based on mutual values leads to more meaningful and productive collaborations.\n15\n\nASK!\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nDon’t forget, as you build your network, you are building opportunities for collaboration. You should feel comfortable reaching out to people in your network when you need something. Benefit from the relations you made and start asking and growing.  \n\nAsk: What can you use your network for? How might they be able to help you?\nPotential answers:\nProvide expertise or mentorship\nSupport in a variety of areas or make a connection to someone else who can. Areas might include:\nCustomers\nPartners\nSupplier\nMentor\nInvestor\nEtc…\n\nAsk: Although a lot of this changes culture to culture, what are things you should do and not do when reaching out to your network for something?\nDo:\nBuild a relationship with the person first. Spend time with them and learn about their needs.\nBe polite\nOffer something in return (time, support, resources, money, etc…)\nFind things you have in common or common things that you are working on \nIn emails, write a meaningful subject line and keep the message focused. \nIdentify yourself clearly and remind the person of how you met and what you talked about.\nAsking for advice is a good first step to start a conversation.\nProofread.\n\nDon’t:\nDon’t be too direct. Don’t just randomly email someone you are not close to and ask for something\nDon’t expect them to just say “yes”. Be aware of the fact that the person might not be interested\nDon’t be rude or too demanding\nDon’t ask things from strangers\nDon’t be too formal/informal. Distinguish between formal and informal situations and know when it is appropriate/inappropriate to ask for things. \n\nRecap: Once you build a relationship of mutual trust, then you can benefit from the relationship by asking for something. This can be anything from sharing their network, to advice, to resources. Be careful with your ask. Always be respectful and don’t demand anything.\n\n16\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nDefine how you will develop your personal brand and work towards achieving your personal mission.\n\nCreate your LinkedIn and apply the personal branding checklist to your profile.\n\nStart taking professional photos!\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\n17\n\n\nTHANK YOU\nANY QUESTIONS?\n18]]] can you tell me how i'm doing, what slides are still needing editing, what text could be better, show me exactly what to cut and paste and if any slides need to be edited and why and how or if any slides need to be created. any place there are. three brackets I thik the text can be updated or improved, for instance the fear game part and the networking happening in session between the participants of the accelerator program five one labs are organizing ",

      "content": "Below you’ll find:\n\n1. **General Feedback** on your overall slide deck structure.  \n2. **Slide-by-Slide Recommendations** (including where to add or remove slides, what text to refine, and how to incorporate stronger data/statistics).  \n3. **Copy-and-Paste Text Blocks** for your triple-bracket sections (e.g., the Fear Game) and any newly suggested slides.\n\n---\n\n## 1. General Feedback\n\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: Slides 2 and 3 repeat some introductory text about personal branding. Consider consolidating these points so each slide has a unique focus.  \n- **Strengthen Statistics**: Where you mention “Statistical Insight,” insert concrete figures and credible studies. For example, reference Harvard Business School research on “High Sustainability” companies and Nielsen data on consumer preferences.  \n- **Flow and Agenda**: Overall, your slide deck is well-structured by starting with mission/vision/values, then building a personal brand, then moving into concrete networking tactics. Keep that linear flow.  \n- **Fear Game Slide**: The instructions need more clarity and a simple “ask template.”  \n- **In-Session Networking**: Because you’re running this for an accelerator (Five One Labs), consider adding a short practical activity slide that explicitly encourages participants to network with each other *during* the session.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Slide-by-Slide Recommendations\n\nBelow, I’ll note only *key* slides needing edits or new slides to be added. Slides not listed are fine as-is or only need minor proofreading.\n\n---\n\n### Slide 2: “The Power of Values in Entrepreneurship”\n\n**What to Change:**  \n- Integrate stronger data on how values-driven businesses perform better.  \n- Remove repetitive text about personal branding (since Slide 3 also covers it).  \n- You could rename the bullet “Statistical Insight” to something more direct like “Data on Values-Driven Success” or “Research Findings.”\n\n**Recommended Text (Copy & Paste):**\n\n> **The Power of Values in Entrepreneurship**  \n> - **Authenticity Builds Trust:** Aligning your business practices with your personal values fosters trust among customers and partners.  \n> - **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Values-driven entrepreneurs often exhibit improved decision-making capabilities, leading to more resilient and sustainable business practices.  \n> - **Research Findings:**  \n>   - A Harvard Business School study found that “high sustainability” companies outperformed “low sustainability” ones by **4.8%** annually over an 18-year period.  \n>   - A Nielsen survey reports **66% of consumers** are willing to pay more for products from brands committed to positive social and environmental impact.  \n>   - B Lab data shows that **82%** of B Corp-certified organizations remain more resilient during economic downturns.  \n\n*(15 minutes: Lecture + activity follows…)*\n\n---\n\n### Slide 3: “WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?” (Possible Consolidation)\n\n**What to Change:**  \n- You have repeated text from the previous slide about personal branding. Consider trimming the duplication.  \n- Keep the personal reflection/activity questions (“What value can you create?” etc.) because that’s essential.  \n- If you keep the mini-lecture, be sure it doesn’t repeat the same content from Slide 2 word-for-word.\n\n**Recommended Approach:**  \n- Merge or shorten the text in the top half.  \n- Retain the 15-minute activity instructions.  \n- Possibly rename the slide “Who Do You Want to Be? (Self-Reflection)” to differentiate from “The Power of Values.”\n\n---\n\n### Slide 4 & 5: “WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE?” (Aristotle quote & Beliefs → Values)\n\n**What to Change:**  \n- These slides look good thematically. Just ensure the bullet about “Our business will become one of the primary places…” (in triple brackets) is concise.\n\n**Sample Improved Text for Slide 4** (Replace the triple-bracket section):\n\n> **5 minutes: Lecture**  \n> Our business will be one of our primary life arenas—where we spend time, meet people, and make decisions. When your business is infused with your values, it becomes a place you *want* to be. The values you champion attract like-minded customers and partners.  \n\n---\n\n### Slide 6: “YOUR PERSONAL BRAND”\n\nLooks good. Just ensure consistency in language. Possibly rename “10-15 minutes: Discussion” to match how you labeled other slides (some say “5 minutes: Lecture,” etc.). This is optional.\n\n---\n\n### Slide 11: “CREATE A LINKEDIN”\n\nYou’ve already made additions about “Profile Authenticity” and a new bullet about building LinkedIn around a business need. That’s great. Make sure the triple-bracket text about an activity (where participants leverage each other’s connections) is clear.\n\n**Suggested Replacement for Triple-Bracket Text** (the activity under “Make good connections”):\n\n> **Activity: Build Your LinkedIn for a Business Need**  \n> 1. **Identify a Current Challenge**: Write down one key challenge or opportunity your startup faces (e.g., finding a supplier, connecting with an investor, or locating a mentor).  \n> 2. **Map Your Network**: Ask your fellow cohort members if they know anyone who could help. If so, request a warm introduction through LinkedIn.  \n> 3. **Draft a Personalized Message**:  \n>    > *Hi [Name], I’m expanding my network to tackle [challenge]. I noticed your expertise/connection in [field/company]. I’d love to connect and learn about [specific ask]. Happy to offer any help or resources in return.*  \n> 4. **Send It!**: Before the session ends, send at least one message to a prospective contact.\n\n---\n\n### Slide 13: “FEAR GAME” (Triple-Bracket Improvement)\n\nCurrently, you wrote:\n\n> [[[improve the text here: Let’s play a fear game, find one person online in your field that you respect greatly, come up with a clear ask…]]]\n\n**Suggested Replacement Text (Copy & Paste):**\n\n> **FEAR GAME: Overcoming the Anxiety of Asking**  \n> **3 minutes: Discussion + 7 minutes: Activity**  \n> \n> - **Overview:** Identify one person in your industry you truly admire—maybe a mentor, a seasoned founder, or an influencer.  \n> - **Research:** Spend a few minutes exploring their background, recent projects, or interviews.  \n> - **Craft Your Ask (XYZ Formula):**  \n>   > *Hi [Name], I admire your work on [specific project/achievement]. I’m working on [your project] and would love your thoughts on [specific question]. If there’s anything I can do to support your work—like sharing a resource, article, or making a relevant introduction—please let me know. Thank you for your time!*  \n> - **Send It Today:** The biggest barrier is fear. By hitting “send,” you practice bold outreach. The worst they can say is “no”—the best is a new connection.  \n> \n> *Tip:* If you show genuine interest in *their* work (demonstrating you’ve done your homework), people are more open to helping.\n\nThis clarifies the steps, emphasizes a short, direct ask, and highlights reciprocity (“offer something in return”).\n\n---\n\n### Potential New Slide (Between Slide 11 & 12 or Right After “Create a LinkedIn”)\n\n**Title: In-Session Networking: Connect with Each Other**\n\nIf you want participants to practice networking *right now* in the session, consider adding a short slide encouraging them to stand up and talk to each other about a specific prompt. For example:\n\n> **In-Session Networking: Connect with Each Other**  \n> 1. **Pair Up**: Find someone in this room you don’t know well.  \n> 2. **Ask & Offer**: Share one challenge you face and one skill/resource you can offer in return.  \n> 3. **Swap LinkedIn Info**: Immediately connect or exchange details so you can follow up.  \n> 4. **Share Back**: After 10 minutes, we’ll regroup to see if any new connections or solutions emerged.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final Copy-and-Paste Updates\n\nBelow are the main text blocks you requested for easy insertion:\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 2 Text (Replace Entire Slide 2 Text):**\n\n```\nThe Power of Values in Entrepreneurship\n\n• Authenticity Builds Trust: Aligning your business practices with your personal values \n  fosters trust among customers and partners.\n\n• Enhanced Decision-Making: Values-driven entrepreneurs often make more resilient \n  decisions, leading to sustainable business practices.\n\n• Research Findings:\n  - Harvard Business School (Eccles, Ioannou, and Serafeim) found that “high \n    sustainability” companies outperformed “low sustainability” ones by 4.8% \n    annually over 18 years.\n  - Nielsen data shows 66% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable \n    products or services.\n  - B Lab reports that 82% of B Corp-certified companies remain more resilient \n    during downturns.\n```\n\n*(Follow with your 15-minute lecture/activity as is.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 4 Triple-Bracket Section (Replace Text):**\n\n```\nOur business will be one of the primary places we spend our time—where we meet people \nand make decisions that affect our community. If we embed our values into daily \noperations, we'll attract like-minded customers, partners, and team members. \n\nWe’ve discussed using values to find aligned customers, define a niche, and create \na user experience that supports people’s wants and needs responsibly. Now, recognize \nthat our values become more visible through our business choices. Embracing this \nvisibility helps us stay authentic and consistent.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Slide 13 “FEAR GAME” (Replace Entire Slide Text):**\n\n```\nFEAR GAME: Overcoming the Anxiety of Asking\n3 minutes: Discussion + 7 minutes: Activity\n\n• Identify Someone You Admire:\n  - Choose an entrepreneur, influencer, or expert you respect in your field.\n\n• Do Quick Research:\n  - Look at their recent posts, articles, or achievements to find common ground.\n\n• Craft Your Ask (XYZ Formula):\n  \"Hi [Name], I admire your work on [specific project/achievement]. \n   I’m working on [your project] and would love your insight on [specific question or \n   request]. If there’s anything I can do to support your work—like sharing a relevant \n   resource—please let me know. Thank you for your time!\"\n\n• Send It:\n  - The biggest barrier is fear, so send your message during this session. \n    The worst they can do is ignore it; the best is a valuable connection.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Optional New Slide: “In-Session Networking: Connect with Each Other”**\n\n```\nIn-Session Networking: Connect with Each Other\n(10 minutes: Activity)\n\n1. Pair Up: \n   - Find someone in this room you don’t know well.\n\n2. Ask & Offer:\n   - Each share one challenge you face in your startup and one skill/resource \n     you can offer in return.\n\n3. Swap LinkedIn or Contact Info:\n   - Immediately connect or exchange details so you can follow up after the session.\n\n4. Share Back:\n   - After 10 minutes, we’ll regroup to see if any new collaborations emerged.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Which Slides *Need* Editing?\n\n1. **Slide 2**: Needs the added performance statistics and a more concise bullet structure (see provided text).  \n2. **Slide 4**: Triple-bracket text about business values → replaced for clarity.  \n3. **Slide 13 (“FEAR GAME”)**: The triple-bracket text is replaced with a clearer “fear game” explanation.  \n\nEverything else is optional fine-tuning. You might add the optional **“In-Session Networking”** slide if you want participants to practice networking right away.\n\n---\n\n### How You’re Doing Overall\n\n- **Strengths**: Your content flow is logical, and you’re hitting all major personal-branding topics (values, authenticity, networking, LinkedIn). You’ve also included practical exercises (individual reflection, LinkedIn building, fear game).  \n- **Areas to Improve**:  \n  - Continue weaving in *specific* stats or short studies (like we did on Slide 2) to show that values-based branding and ESG-driven approaches aren’t just “nice ideas”—they correlate with better performance.  \n  - Trim any repetitive sections to keep slides concise.  \n\nWith these copy-and-paste text blocks and recommendations, your deck will have stronger data, clearer instructions, and more cohesive flow—while making sure those triple-bracket sections are updated and engaging. \n\n---\n\n**Feel free to let me know if you need more tweaks or additional references!**",

How are you doing today? \nThe session today will be a bit lighter than the others. We want to make sure that we are not giving you too much work or overwhelming you before the pitch. Although this wont be a heavy session, we will cover very important points that all entrepreneurs should know about in this context we are operating in. \n\n\nUnderstand how having the proper mindset can increase the odds of entrepreneurial success.\n\nPractice fixed vs growth mindsets.\n\nLearn how to develop a growth mindset.\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE MINDSETS?\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nA mindset is a way of thinking – a belief that influences how you think about yourself, others and the world in general. Your beliefs determine your behavior and drive your attitude towards people and situations every day.\nOur goal for this session is to discuss a few that we believe in and want to work on. Entrepreneurs generally have these mindsets as they look to overcome obstacles.\n\nAsk: Why do mindsets matter?\nPotential answers:\nHaving a good mindset can keep you going when times are rough\nA good mindset can have a positive affect on others around you including employees and customers\nMindsets play a role in determining your future. \nWhen you limit yourself in your mind, you will put up barriers for yourself. \nWhen you think you can do something and embrace possibilities, it is easier for you to push yourself, try new things, and conquer barriers.\nEtc…\n\nRecap: Your mindset plays a critical role in how you cope with life's challenges. In school, a growth mindset can contribute to greater achievement and increased effort. When facing a problem such as trying to find a new job, people with growth mindsets show greater resilience. They are more likely to persevere in the face of setbacks while those with fixed mindsets are more liable to give up.\n\n \n\n\n\nHOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF?\nDo I believe in myself? \nDo I accept and welcome myself?\nDo I appreciate who I am?\nDo I respect, love, and support myself?\n\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nA good starting point to improve your interpersonal communication is to reflect on how you actually see and communicate with yourself. \n\nBe aware of what you’re saying to yourself. You might be surprised at just how often you put yourself down. The important piece of this step is to be non-judgmental. If you’re already calling yourself dumb, or saying you’ll never be able to accomplish a certain thing, or you aren’t the right person, how will anyone else believe that you are/can?! Judging yourself is the farthest thing from helpful.\nDo you believe in the product and your company?\nYou should! Why would you all be working so hard?!\nFacts are facts. You went to the market did research to find out what problems your customers were actually facing, and you designed and tested it for them! If this is true, the product isn’t the problem.\nIf you don’t believe in the product, that’s your first problem and you should work on that. \nDo you think that your company is good? Is there a place for it in this world?\nThink about all the good stuff you are planning and how you intend to expand! You should believe in the vision.\n\nThe number one thing that’s stops people from achieving their goals is themselves! So, the next big question is: \nDo you believe in yourself?\nThis is the one that stops people!\nYou can have the best product in the world, but we sabotage ourselves!\nWe are often focused on the challenges\n4\n\n“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.” \n\n-Christopher Robin, \nPooh’s Grand Adventure\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nYou are the only one putting limits on your capabilities. You are the only one who will stop yourself from succeeding. Five One Labs has accepted you into this incubator because WE BELIEVE in your product and your business and in YOU! You just have to believe in yourself. \n\n5\n\nWHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY  FOR ENTREPRENEURS?\nDecisiveness\nConfidence\nResilience\nHumility\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What mindsets are necessary for entrepreneurs? Why?\nPotential answers:\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts freely, but make sure to touch on some of the points below as well!\nDecisiveness: To succeed as an entrepreneur, you must gain the ability to look at a problem or situation, digest all available data (at that point in time), and make a confident decision to move forward. Your ability as a decision-maker will make or break your future successes. In fact, at the opposite end, indecision is one of the greatest causes of business failure. When you can’t decide what to do, you delay taking action. In other words, you do nothing. Think about how many dreams (and businesses) failing to take action has killed.\nConfidence: It is essential that you get used to the uncomfortable feeling of knowing that you don't know what you’re doing, but you should act like you do! Whether it's getting on stage to speak, launching your product, or learning how to start a blog and publishing your ideas to the world, we tend to see others doing it and incorrectly assume they've always been good at it. They weren't born knowing how to speak confidently, launch successful products, or write excellent books. They also weren't born knowing how to become entrepreneurs. \nAccountability: The entrepreneurial mindset comes from taking responsibility for your actions and outcomes. From this moment forward, you must accept responsibility for everything in your life and hold yourself accountable to it. Sorry to tell you, but nobody cares how little time, money, or external support you have to accomplish your goals. Your circumstances may not be your fault, but they are your responsibility. All that matters is what you are doing RIGHT NOW to find your success. There are no more excuses. Accountability is required of entrepreneurs as well as successful employees. Stop passing the buck and blaming others. Hold yourself accountable – even when you aren’t to blame – and take action to fix the problem.\nResilience: As an entrepreneur, you will need to learn to deal with making mistakes and failing. They are inevitable and a part of your growth. If every misstep plummets you into self-doubt, you have to change the way you look at being wrong. This mindset shift takes resilience and is foundational to the entrepreneurial mindset. Success rarely happens in a straight line. Taking wrong turns and making mistakes is something that happens to everyone. Resilience isn’t only helpful when dealing with catastrophic mistakes. It’s a way to handle the small, simple decisions you’ve made that didn’t turn out right. “The only people who don’t make mistakes are the ones who don’t do anything.” \nHumility: Humility is freedom from pride or arrogance, and it ties all of the characteristics of entrepreneurship. Humility will keep you focused and centered (especially while being confident and decisive). Along with humility comes coachability — the ability to be coached. If you want to accomplish big things in life, you need to be willing to learn from others and nourish a growth mindset. To do big things, you need to grow. To grow, you need to learn. Thinking like an entrepreneur means seeking out mentors and coaches who have been where you are trying to go — and having the humility to accept their guidance.\nhttps://hacktheentrepreneur.com/entrepreneurial-mindset/\n\nRecap: An entrepreneurial mindset is a way of thinking that enables you to overcome challenges, be decisive, and accept responsibility for your outcomes. It is a constant need to improve your skills, learn from your mistakes, and take continuous action on your ideas. Anyone willing to do the work can develop an entrepreneurial mindset. \n\n6\n\nFIXED MINDSET\nGROWTH MINDSET\n“Failure is the limit of my abilities”\n“I give up easily”\n“My potential is predetermined”\n“My intelligence is static”\n“I avoid challenges”\n“I will never improve”\n“Failures offer opportunity”\n“I like to try new things”\n“I can learn to do what I want”\n“My intelligence can be develped”\n“I keep trying”\n“my mistakes will help me grow”\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe are going to go deeper in this session from the perspective of 2 main type of mindsets.\nThis is something we have noticed in various people that we’ve worked with and those in our friendship group. That some people have a fixed mindset and others have a growth mindset.\n\nA fixed mindset is a belief that your intelligence, talent and personality are inherently fixed and unchanging. In other words, you have a certain amount and nothing can change it. The ultimate desire in an individual with a fixed mindset is to be the best and to be seen as talented and perfect. This leads them to need constant validation and they seek to prove themselves over and over. Failure is simply not an option and they are extremely sensitive about making mistakes and being wrong. In the event that they do fail, they instantly become discouraged, give up and label themselves a ‘failure’. They avoid new challenges and will not risk doing anything that might expose their weaknesses and flaws.\n\nA growth mindset is the belief that your intelligence, talent and personality can be developed and cultivated through your actions. They believe that by learning and through constant practice, anyone can do anything. Their desire to become a better person fuels their passion to grow, take risks and do new things and they thrive on being challenged. For them, feedback is essential and provides them with constructive evidence to improve their performance and develop their abilities. In the event of failure, they see the setback.\n\n\n\nMINDSET MAP\nMap Practice and discussion: 10 minutes  \n\nPractice the mindset map with the entrepreneurs and show them the differences between the fixed and growth mindsets. Create a discussion among each one with them to better understand \n\nHOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nHave a discussion with the entrepreneurs on how to develop a growth mindset. Try to write down all the answers on the white board.\nAsk: How can you develop your growth mindset? What are actions you can take right now? \nPotential answers:\nBe aware of limiting behaviors and mindsets:\nYou believe life is permanent. The scarcity mentality sees life as fixed and unchangeable. It’s not seeing things as they truly are – temporary – and instead believing “that’s just the way it is and always will be.” An abundance mentality sees life as dynamic, malleable and in constant flux. Money comes and goes. Opportunities continually present themselves. Good and bad times will pass.\nYou use the language of lack. Do you find yourself using the following phrases often? “I can’t, I don’t have enough, I’ll just go without, I don’t need much.” Instead, experiment with the language of prosperity. “I always have more than enough, I can always find/earn more, there’s plenty.” \nYou hold on to things. Keeping items well past their useful point, food, clothes, shoes, trinkets, tools, gadgets…who knows what else. Get rid of things you don’t need – this creates the mindset that you can have more! \nYou have difficulty receiving. You have trouble accepting compliments or gifts, you’re uncomfortable with someone paying your way, and you feel like you have to even the score immediately.  If you cannot graciously receive then you mistakenly believe that when someone gives you something, they must have “lost” something in return. This is NOT how giving and receiving works. It’s scarcity mentality. \nYou make small gestures of lack. Under tipping, underestimating, shortchanging yourself or others. When you make small demonstrations of lack, you are keeping yourself from receiving more in life. If you believe in lack, not matter how small your actions may be, your life will mirror those same beliefs back to you.\nhttps://justwaybetter.com/2014/07/08/scarcity-vs-abundance-mindset/\nMake a conscious decision to shift from a limited mindset. Here are some ideas: \n1. Say ‘both’. When faced with a situation that you’d normally look at as ‘either-or’, try saying ‘both’. Should you get the new shed, or the new lawnmower? Both! Can you afford the new bag or just the new shoes. Both! Just saying ‘both’ makes it possible, and gets the creativity flowing (see #5 below).\n2. Say thank you when you receive a compliment. Don’t dismiss, deflect or try to quickly reciprocate – just accept a compliment as the gift that it is. Giving is a win-win. When you won’t accept a compliment, you make it lose-lose.\n3. Give or throw your old stuff away. Clothes are an easy one. Fill a trash bag with clothes you never wear and drop them at a clothing bin.\n4. Catch yourself when you say “I don’t have the time/money”. Be mindful that you always find the time and money for the things that are important – it’s a matter of priorities. Don’t delude yourself in small ways in speech and thought. Start to speak differently, and you’ll see your thinking start to change.\n5. Think of in terms of more. Instead of spending time figuring out how to save, skimp, or otherwise ‘afford’ the things you want, you could try spending that creative energy coming up with a way to make more money. Assuming you have a fixed income assumes you have maxed out your value to the world, and that you have no further ability to contribute or improve your skills. That’s literally a poor approach. Ask for that well overdue raise, sell some of your many things, try a small side business, optimize your investments, cut out wasteful spending (different than skimping), or all of the above. You might surprise yourself. It’s amazing what arises just by thinking differently.\n\nRecap: Practice thinking in abundance. Abundance applies to a lot more than money or material things, it applies to the really important things like time, opportunity, experiences, happiness and love. If you find that you have a scarcity mentality, it’s okay!  Most of us do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nPROCESS-FOCUSED\n“Success is a journey, not a destination”\n- Arthur Ashe\nLecture: 3 minutes  \n\nWe’ve all heard the saying, ‘Success is a journey, not a destination.’ This means that the process is more important than the outcome. Of course we all want to achieve success, but a fixation on the end-result, can lead to stress and fear of failure. It is most important for fixed mindset individuals to look good and be the best, so they often avoid taking action in case they fail. Tony Robbins calls this the ‘pain-pleasure’ syndrome. They will do more to avoid the pain of failure than they will to achieve the pleasure of success.\nHowever, the opposite is true of people with a growth mindset. They also want to achieve their desired outcome, but they understand that it is a process, which requires practice, effort and motivation. Their success is often a by-product of their dedication to the craft, whether it be a sport, business or a relationship.\nEncourage your entrepreneurs to celebrate the small wins along the way to achieving the end goal. Teach them the process behind the skill and provide them with the opportunity to practice, get feedback and ask questions.\n\n10\n\nPRAISE EFFORT\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nDweck’s research showed that ability can be developed through sheer effort and hard work, as opposed to natural talent. This is the key principle behind the concept of the growth mindset. However, most children are praised for their achievements by parents and educators, and rewards are given for attainment not effort.\nIn a growth mindset culture, praise and feedback is given for hard work and effort, not just for talent and ability. This means that in the training room, entrepreneurs should be praised for their willingness to try and for giving their best effort in every task, not purely on the outcome they achieve.\n\n11\n\nEMBRACE THE CHALLENGE\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nJ.K. Rowling’s first Harry Potter book was rejected by 12 publishers before it was eventually accepted and published. But she never gave up and the book went on the sell over 4oo million copies.\nSo create a safe learning environment which is conducive to the entrepreneurs trying new things, taking risks and pushing beyond their comfort zone. Encourage them to learn from their mistakes and use failure and setbacks as an opportunity to grow. Teach them the difference between ‘I am a failure’ and ‘I failed’, and instill the need to manage their motivation and keep moving forwards.\n\n12\n\nBE INSPIRED\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nPeople with a fixed mindset feel threatened by the success of others. However, in growth mindset individuals, the success of others is a massive source of inspiration for them personally, and they love to see others being successful.\nWho inspires you? It might be a person (famous or not, alive or dead), or it could be an organization. Think about why they inspire you. How can you use them as a key source of inspiration in your own life? For example, one of my hero’s in the context of creativity is Walt Disney. So whenever I am working on a creative project, I ask, ‘What would Walt do?’\n\n13\n\nPRACTICE, PRACTICE AND PRACTICE\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nIt takes consistent practice, patience and persistence to reach the level of mastery in anything – there are no quick fixes. Remember the 10,000 hours principle? The process of learning does not stop at the end of the training day. In fact, that’s when the real learning begins as entrepreneurs begin to apply their skills in their everyday work. Therefore, it is important that the entrepreneurs understand the need for consistent practice in order to embed the learning and to develop their proficiency. Create a mechanism to provide post-training support in the form of follow-up emails, webinars, online courses etc. Proactively encourage your entrepreneurs to feedback their progress, successes and failures in order that you can provide them with continuous development and inspiration into the future.\n\n14\n\nKEEP MOVING FORWARD!\nFailure is often inevitable, but if we learn to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn, improve, and then get back up again, we're more likely to succeed in future attempts.\n\nLearn that it's alright to fail as long as you don't give up or quit.\n \n15\n\nHOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE!\nBerries.com\n40 minutes : Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nLet's not make a list of what we want to do, but rather, who we want to be! These are ways to be, not things to do. A goal is a destination; we can arrive there and yet be unsatisfied, feeling unsure where to go next. Values are like directions on the compass; we always know which way to travel. They define \"how: we want to live our lives. Of course our goals and reactions matter very much, but they are always more powerful when they are driven by our values. Our values express the states we essentially want to be in.

GreenComp\nidentifies a set of sustainability competences to feed into\neducation programmes to help learners develop knowledge,\nskills and attitudes that promote ways to think, plan and act\nwith empathy, responsibility, and care for our planet and for\npublic health.\nThis work began with a literature review and drew on several\nconsultations with experts and stakeholders working in the\nfield of sustainability education and lifelong learning. The re-\nsults presented in this report form a framework for learning\nfor environmental sustainability that can be applied in any\nlearning context. The report shares working definitions of\nsustainability and learning for environmental sustainability\nthat forms the basis for the framework to build consensus\nand bridge the gap between experts and other stakeholders.\nGreenComp comprises four interrelated competence areas:\n‘embodying sustainability values’, ‘embracing complexity in\nsustainability’, ‘envisioning sustainable futures’ and ‘acting\nfor sustainability’. Each area comprises three competenc-\nes that are interlinked and equally important. GreenComp\nis designed to be a non-prescriptive reference for learning\nschemes fostering sustainability as a competence.\nContents\nForeword. ..........................................................................1\nExecutive summary. .................................................2\nAcknowledgements. ..................................................4\n1.

Education and\ntraining enable learners to develop competenc-\nes and acquire the knowledge, skills and attitudes\nneeded to truly value our planet and take action\nto protect it. This will help achieve the transition to\na fairer, greener economy and society. To this end,\nand among other priorities, the European Commis-\nsion has made learning for environmental sustain-\nability a priority for the upcoming years.\nFollowing successful initiatives to foster compe-\ntence-based education for lifelong learning in the\npast years, the Commission has developed this\nEuropean Sustainability Competence Framework,\nGreenComp, as announced in the European Green\nDeal. The Member States of the European Union\nhave already begun incorporating sustainability\nconcepts into academic and vocational curricula.\nBuilding on this work, GreenComp can support all\neducators and learners in embedding environmen-\ntal sustainability topics into all educational systems\nand curricula in Member States.\nOur aim is to provide a shared competence frame-\nwork on sustainability at European level as a com-\nmon basis to guide both educators and learners.\nBuilding a common understanding on sustainability\ncan act as a catalyst for action. GreenComp draws\non the advice and consensus of numerous experts\nand stakeholders. The Commission encourages\nMember States to use it as a reference when rolling\nout educational initiatives on sustainability.\nGreenComp builds on the method developed, test-\ned, and validated by the JRC to create the Digital\nCompetence Framework for Citizens (DigComp), the\nEntrepreneurship Competence Framework (Entre-\nComp), and the European Framework for Personal,\nSocial and Learning to Learn Key Competence (Life-\nComp).\nThe Council Recommendation on learning for envi-\nronmental sustainability and GreenComp are part\nof EU’s strategic action to promote learning for en-\nvironmental sustainability.\nIoannis Maghiros, Head of Unit\nHuman Capital and Employment\nJoint Research Centre\nEuropean Commission\nMichael Teutsch, Head of Unit\nSchools and Multilingualism\nDG Education, Youth, Sport and Culture\nEuropean Commission\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n1\nExecutive summary\nGreenComp responds to the growing need\nfor people to improve and develop the\nknowledge, skills and attitudes to live, work\nand act in a sustainable manner.\nGreenComp is a reference framework for sustain-\nability competences. It provides a common ground\nto learners and guidance to educators, providing a\nconsensual definition of what sustainability as a\ncompetence entails. It is designed to support edu-\ncation and training programmes for lifelong learn-\ning. It is written for all learners, irrespective of their\nage and their education level and in any learning\nsetting – formal, non-formal and informali. Sustain-\nability competences can help learners become sys-\ntemic and critical thinkers, as well as develop agen-\ncy, and form a knowledge basis for everyone who\ncares about our planet’s present and future state.\nThe aim of GreenComp is to foster a sustainability\nmindset by helping users develop the knowledge,\nskills and attitudes to think, plan and act with em-\npathy, responsibility, and care for our planet. Green-\nComp is the result of a robust research methodol-\nogy that has involved a large and diverse group of\nexperts and stakeholders, to build a consensus on\nan agreed proposal. It provides a general reference\nmodel that everyone involved in lifelong learning\ncan use to design learning opportunities aimed at\ndeveloping sustainability competences and to as-\nsess progress in supporting education and training\nfor sustainability.\nGreenComp consists of 12 competences (in bold)\norganised into the four areas (in italics) below:\n-\nEmbodying sustainability values, including the\ncompetences\n•\nvaluing sustainability\n•\nsupporting fairness\n•\npromoting nature\n- Embracing complexity in sustainability, includ-\ning the competences\n•\nsystems thinking\n•\ncritical thinking\n•\nproblem framing\n- Envisioning sustainable futures, including the\ncompetences\n•\nfutures literacy\n•\nadaptability\n•\nexploratory thinking\n- Acting for sustainability, including the compe-\ntences\n•\n•\npolitical agency\ncollective action\n•\nindividual initiative\ni Definitions for key terms used throughout the document\ncan be found at the end of this report.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n2\nVisual representation of GreenComp.\nGreenComp responds to the ambitions set out in\nthe European Green Deal. Following this political\ndirection, the Commission has published policy pa-\npers entitled European Skills Agenda for Sustain-\nable Competitiveness, Social Fairness and Resil-\nience (2020) and the European Education Area by\n2025 (2020) underscoring the need to develop a\nEuropean competence framework on sustainabili-\nty. In these policy papers, the Commission explicitly\nrecommends activating education and training by\ndeveloping skills, including upskilling and reskilling,\nand by investing in learning for environmental sus-\ntainability. The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030:\n‘Bringing Nature Back into our Lives’ (2020) also\nhighlights the important role education and training\nhave in enabling the EU to reach its goal to become\na climate-neutral continent by 2050.\nAs a reference tool, GreenComp can serve a wide\nrange of purposes, including curricula review; design\nof teacher education programmes; (self-) assess-\nment/reflection, policy development, certification,\nassessment, monitoring and evaluation.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n3\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude\nto everyone involved in the participatory process\nthat contributed to bringing GreenComp to life.\nTheir dedication, enthusiasm and passion for\nsustainability and lifelong learning are greatly\nappreciated.\nThanks to all stakeholders who participated and\ncontributed to our series of workshops held from\nApril to October 2021: Carlos Alvarez Pereira,\nClub of Rome; Helena Alves, European University\nFoundation; Albena Azmanova, University\nof Kent; Meg Baker, Students Organising for\nSustainability UK; Matthias Barth, Eberswalde\nUniversity for Sustainable Development; Olena\nBekh, European Training Foundation; Pauline\nBoivin, Lifelong Learning Platform; Erica Bol, JRC;\nPauline Bonino, European Network for Social\nIntegration Enterprises; Katja Brundiers, Arizona\nState University; Alessandro Caforio, Università\nTelematica Internazionale UNINETTUNO; Ignacio\nCalleja, EIT Raw Materials; Paolo Canfora, JRC;\nNoelia Cantero, EARLALL; Gisela Cebrián Bernat,\nUniversitat Rovira i Virgili; Valentina Chanina,\nEfVET; Martina Comparelli, Fridays for Future;\nFrançois Dessart, JRC; Paola Di Marzo, Erasmus\nStudent Network; Anastasia Fetsi, European\nTraining Foundation; Daniel Fischer, Wageningen\nUniversity & Research; Emma Fromberg, University\nof Cambridge; Ann Finlayson, Sustainability\nand Environmental Education; Conor Galvin,\nUniversity College Dublin; Marie Goiset, Ministry\nof national education, youth and sports, France;\nAgueda Gras-Velazquez, European Schoolnet;\nDirk Hastedt, International Association for the\nEvaluation of Educational Achievement; Rayka\nHauser, DG Environment; Simon Herteleer, UNECE\n– Education for Sustainable Development; Elisabeth\nHofmann, Université Bordeaux Montaigne; Gohar\nHovhannisyan, European University Association;\nTom Janssen, Flemish Department of Environment;\nJonas Husum Johannesen, Ministry of Higher\nEducation and Science, Denmark; Panagiotis\nKampylis, National Research Council of Italy;\nSimon Kemp, University of Southampton; Arja\nKrauchenberg, European Parents’ Association;\nWim Lambrechts, Open Universiteit; Elizabeth\nLange, University of Technology Sydney; Yolanda\nLechón, CIEMAT; Alexander Leicht, UNESCO;\nRodrigo Lozano, University of Gävle; Davide\nMagagna, Ministry of Ecological Transition, Italy;\nHanna Malhonen, Federal Ministry for Education,\nScience and Research, Austria; Michela Mayer,\nItalian Association for Sustainability Science;\nMiriam Molina Ascanio, European Schoolnet; Petra\nMolthan-Hill, Nottingham Trent University; Monica\nMoso Díez, Dualiza; Joanna Napierala, CEDEFOP;\nMari Nishimura, UNEP; Terhi Nokkala, University of\nJyväskylä; Teresa Oberhauser, AEGEE - European\nStudent Forum; Violeta Orlovic Lovren, University\nof Belgrade; David Osimo, Lisbon Council; Ana\nPrades, CIEMAT; Giuseppe Pellegrino, DG RTD;\nMónika Réti, Ministry of Human Capacities of\nHungary; Marco Rieckmann, University of Vechta;\nMonika Rybova, Ministry of Education, Science,\nResearch and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Alfredo\nSoeiro, AECEF - Association of European Civil\nEngineering Faculties; Stephen Sterling, Plymouth\nUniversity; Daniella Tilbury, HM Government of\nGibraltar and Cambridge University; Paul Vare,\nUniversity of Gloucestershire; Lyubov Vasylchuk,\nEuropean Schoolnet; Silvia Velázquez Rodríguez,\nMinistry of Education and Vocational Training of\nSpain; Oliver Wolf, JRC; Brikena Xhomaqi, Lifelong\nLearning Platform; Aravella Zachariou, Cyprus\nMinistry of Education, Culture, Youth and Sports; and\nJakub Zaludko, Bridge 47.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n4\nThanks to our European Commission colleagues\nwho invested their time and energy.

Introduction\nEnsuring a fair and decent livelihood for all people,\nregenerating nature and enabling biodiversity to\nthrive, have never been more important. It is one of\nthe most pressing duties that humanity faces. This\nrequires shifting away from unsustainable practices\nand placing value on the environment on which our\nfuture as a species and our planet’s future depend.\nThis systemic change cannot be achieved only\nthrough political agreements, financial incentives or\ntechnological innovations, important and necessary\nthough they are. Long-lasting change requires life-\nlong learning1\n.\nCreating opportunities to enable learning for envi-\nronmental sustainability has therefore become cru-\ncial for the present and the future of our planet. The\necological crisis affects everyone and all aspects of\nsociety. Having a common understanding can be\na catalyst for action and for a shared strategy on\nlearning for environmental sustainability so that we\ncan understand, act on and resolve this crisis to-\ngether. Timely strategic action is necessary to help\nEuropeans participate fully in the green transition\nof our economy and society, rather than simply re-\nacting to it. Learning for environmental sustainabil-\nity is part of this strategic action.\nA competence-based education that helps learners\ndevelop sustainability skills based on knowledge\nand attitudes can help promote responsible action\nand stimulate willingness to take or demand action\nat local, national and global level. Becoming com-\npetent in sustainability issues will enable learners\novercome the cognitive dissonance that comes\nfrom knowing about an issue but lacking the agen-\ncy to act.\nThe European Commission is committed to meeting\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)ii, and\nquality education (SDG 4) is key to achieve all SDGs.\nIn line with the critical role of lifelong learning2, de-\nveloping sustainability competences through edu-\ncation and training has become a policy objective\nfor the EU and its Member States. Sustainability is\none of the European Commission’s key priorities in\neducation and training for 2019 – 20243\n.\nThe European Green Deal (2019)4, the European\nSkills Agenda for Sustainable Competitiveness, So-\ncial Fairness and Resilience (2020)5, and Achieving\nthe European Education Area by 2025 (2020)6 have\nunderscored the need to develop a European com-\npetence framework on sustainability. The EU bio-\ndiversity strategy for 2030: ‘Bringing Nature Back\ninto our Lives’ (2020)7 also highlights the important\nrole education and training have for Europe to be-\ncome a climate-neutral continent by 2050.\nThe European Commission has developed Green-\nComp as a reference framework on sustainability\ncompetences at EU level. It provides a common\nground to learners and guidance to educators, pro-\nviding an agreed definition of what sustainability as\na competence entails. Such a shared understanding\ncan act as a catalyst for learning for environmental\nsustainability by supporting education and training\ninstitutions to develop, review and adapt their vision\nand practices with regard to teaching and learning\nfor sustainability.\nii https://sdgs.un.org/goals.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n6\n1.1 Aims\n1.2 Methodology\nGreenComp can support education and training sys-\ntems in shaping systemic and critical thinkers who\ncare about our planet’s present and its future. All 12\ncompetences of the framework are applicable to all\nlearners, irrespective of their age and their educa-\ntion level and in any education settings – formal,\nnon-formal and informal. The proposed model can\ncomplement and strengthen existing international,\nnational, regional and local efforts to capture sus-\ntainability competences. Its added value is that it\nprovides:\n-\na model of sustainability competence ar-\neas and competences;\n-\na common reference that everyone working\nin education and training for environmental sustain-\nability can use, share and refer to;\n-\nan initial list of competence components,\nnamely knowledge, skills and attitudesiii, as exam-\nples of how to put the competences into practice;\n-\na common reference basis for dialogue, ex-\nchange of practices and peer learning among edu-\ncators involved in lifelong learning across the EU;\n-\na contribution to help make the compe-\ntences portable and promote mobility in the EU for\na full participation in European society.\nThe European sustainability competence framework\nis the result of consensus building based on a mixed\nmethod research processiv. This process has led to\nthe gradual and progressive refinement of Green-\nComp and, ultimately, the consolidated framework\nset out in this report. To achieve this, a diverse\ngroup of approximately 75 experts and stakehold-\ners was consulted at different stages to obtain their\nfeedback and progressively reach a consensus. The\ngroup included experts on sustainability education\nand lifelong learning from academia and research\ninstitutions, youth representatives, educators, policy\nrepresentatives from EU Member States and NGOs.\nThe steps taken to develop the GreenComp frame-\nwork are shown in Figure 1.\niii We adopt the definition of competence following the 2018\nCouncil Recommendation on Key Competences for lifelong learning,\nwhereby a competence is “a dynamic combination of the knowledge,\nskills and attitudes” (p.12). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/\nEN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2018.189.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=O-\nJ:C:2018:189:TOC\niv A similar method was used successfully in adopting other\nEuropean competence frameworks developed by the Commission,\nsuch as DigComp; the European framework for digital competence\nEntreComp , the European framework for entrepreneurship compe-\ntence; and LifeComp , the European framework for ‘Personal, social\nand learning to learn’. They form part of the eight competences of the\n2018 Council Recommendation on lifelong learning.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n7\nFigure 1. Main steps to develop GreenComp.\nThe framework was developed through the follow-\ning steps.\n-\nScoping studies were conducted, which in-\ncluded a literature review by Guia Bianchi (2020)8\nand a complementary study by Chiara Scalabrino\n(2021, forthcoming).\n-\nFour competence areas including a list of\ncompetences and their components were identified\nand put forward, constituting a draft proposal for\nthe framework.\n-\nAn expert workshop was held, where the\npreliminary material was presented and discussed\nby experts on sustainability education and lifelong\nlearningv\n.\nKey takeaways from the first expert work-\nshop: Experts endorsed the initiative of building a\nsustainability competence framework for lifelong\nlearning to complement existing sustainability\nframeworks which mainly target higher education.\nIt was argued that this framework should focus\non specific competences for sustainability, while it\nshould be left to other frameworks (including those\nalready developed by the Commission) to describe\ncross-cutting or generic competences which may be\nrelevant, but not exclusive, to sustainability.\nRegarding competence areas, experts highlight-\ned the importance of sustainability values in re-\nlation to other competences. They highlighted the\nneed to change vocabulary for the area focused on\nproblem solving and finding solutions, in favour of\naction-based competences and the acknowledge-\nment that ‘wicked’ sustainability problems, i.e. high-\nly complex and ill-structured problems9, cannot,\nstrictly speaking, be solved.\nFurthermore, experts suggested using the word\n‘sustainability’ rather than ‘environmental sustain-\nability’ to acknowledge the multidimensionality of\nthis concept.\nv A background document was sent to experts ahead of that\nworkshop and a debrief was drafted as a result.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n8\n-\nThe framework was consolidated in a re-\nvised draft proposal, comprising four competence\nareas and 12 competences. Its consolidation was\nbased on feedback collected during the workshop\nand afterwards by engaging in an ongoing dialogue\nwith experts.\n-\nAn update of the proposal was enabled\nthanks to a set of knowledge-skill-attitude (KSA)\nstatements being developed for each competence,\nwhich helped refine their scope and update the\ncompetence framework. These statements can be\nfound in Appendix 1.\n-\nA second expert workshop was held to re-\nfine the frameworkvi\n.\nname GreenComp, on its phonetics and simplicity in\nterms of the alternatives proposed earlier. Green-\nComp was accepted in its current version.\nAll stakeholders agreed that individual competence\nframeworks needed to be presented as part of a\ncomprehensive vision, where learner outcomes are\ndeveloped across the board. In addition, follow-up\nactivities were discussed.\n-\nGreenComp is published together with the\nCommission’s proposal for a Council recommen-\ndation on learning for environmental sustainability\nand the accompanying staff working document.\nKey takeaways from the second expert\nworkshop: Experts endorsed the framework pre-\nsented in September 2021, with the possibility to\nadopt minor revisions suggested before its finalisa-\ntion.\nMost experts felt that the scope of some KSA state-\nments needed refining, while the language used in\nthese statements needed simplifying. These state-\nments should be all-encompassing but at the same\ntime user-friendly and applicable to different edu-\ncation levels.\nExperts advised that competences should be re-\nfined by better aligning their descriptions to their\nareas. In addition, they encouraged a metaphor and\nnarrative to be developed around the framework.\n1.3 Limitations\n-\nThe conceptual framework was refined\nbased on comments received during or shortly after\nthe second workshop.\n-\nA third workshop was held with stakehold-\ners from Member States to validate the conceptual\nframeworkvii\n.\nKey takeaways from the third workshop\nheld with stakeholders: Stakeholders broadly\nendorsed GreenComp in its current version as well\nas its accompanying metaphor. They agreed on the\nvi A background document was sent to experts together with\na spreadsheet for feedback.\nvii A background document was sent to invited stakeholders\nand a debrief was drafted as a result.\nAlthough widely endorsed by subject-matter ex-\nperts and representative of different stakeholder\ngroups, the framework has not yet been tested in\na real setting. Putting GreenComp into practice, by\nrolling it out and evaluating it in a specific context,\ncould and should lead to amending and refining it\nbased on feedback from practitioners and end us-\ners. The framework should thus be treated as a liv-\ning document.\nAnother challenge is the wide scope of this frame-\nwork, targeting all people, from young children to\nadults, thus touching upon different educational set-\ntings. Moreover, due to the vast and rapidly evolving\nnature of the sustainability concept, this framework\ndepicts competences necessary for sustainability\nas an overarching topic. Therefore, subfields are not\ndirectly addressed in this context. Some examples\nof these competences include but are not limited\nto, responsible production and consumption, com-\npetences for the circular economy, or competences\nfor specific education levels. Future developments\nin these directions can very well be envisaged on\nthe basis of GreenComp.\nLearning for environmental sustainability is essential\nto achieve a sustainability mindset and trigger the\nwillingness to act for a sustainable future. However,\neducation and training, including this competence\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n9\nframework, only form part of the puzzle. Systemic\nchange towards sustainability is a global necessity\nand a shared responsibility. Investments in research\nand innovation, laws and regulations, technological\neco-innovations, transparency and accountability\nby companies and global value chains are required\nto achieve a comprehensive change. Individual be-\nhaviour should be supported by enabling measures\nand contexts that are all designed by, with, and for\nthe people and the planet.\n1.4 Structure of the report\nFollowing the introduction, Chapter 2 introduces\nthe terminology and concepts that form the basis\nof GreenComp, namely its definition; an overview of\nhow people learn for environmental sustainability;\nand the definition of a sustainability competence.\nChapter 3 introduces GreenComp, with its four\ncompetence areas, 12 sustainability competences\nand related descriptors. Section 3.1 introduces the\nmetaphor used to illustrate GreenComp.\nChapter 4 provides descriptions of the competence\nareas and the sustainability competences. This is\nfollowed by how they are applied in practice.\nChapter 5 describes options for further develop-\nment.\nAppendix 1 presents use cases, which aim to show\nhow the 12 sustainability competences are equally\nimportant and interrelated when it comes to think-\ning, planning, and acting to achieve sustainabil-\nity. Appendix 2 contains the list of competence\ncomponents, namely knowledge, skill and attitude\nstatements developed to define and refine the sus-\ntainability competences.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n10\n2. Defining sustainability\n2.1 A working definition of\nsustainability\nThere is broad consensus that sustainability themes\nneed to be embedded in lifelong learning. However,\nsustainability is a complex concept to define and is\nvery ambiguous10\n.\nSustainability means different things to different\ngroups of people at different times11. Often,\nsustainability and sustainable developmentviii are\nused interchangeably, despite their conceptual\ndifference. As claimed by UNESCO12, sustainability\nis best described as a long-term goal, such\nas attaining a more sustainable world, while\nviii As expressed in the UN’s ‘Our Common Future’ (or\nBrundtland Report), 1987.\nFigure 2.

For example, the SDGsix are\nglobal goals encouraging all countries and sectors\nto work in collaboration to eventually achieve\nsustainability by addressing challenges related to\nsustainable development.\nIn this report, we use the following working defini-\ntion for sustainability:\nSustainability means prioritising the needs of\nall life forms and of the planet by ensuring that\nhuman activity does not exceed planetary bound-\naries.\nPlanetary boundaries describe how human activi-\nties, based on fossil fuel use, cause or accelerate\ndetrimental changes to the planet. Scientists have\nidentified nine Earth system processes that need to\nbe monitored and not crossed13, such as (Figure 2):\ni) biosphere integrity, ii) land-use change, iii) climate\nchange, iv) freshwater use, v) ocean acidification,\nvi) biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phospho-\nrus cycles), vii) atmospheric aerosol pollution, viii)\nstratospheric ozone depletion, and ix) release of\nnovel chemicals.\n2.2 Sustainability compe-\ntences\nlearning programmes remains up to individual insti-\ntutions and local educational leaders. Furthermore,\nresearch conducted so far has tended to be at the\nhigher education level, focusing on what compe-\ntences young graduates and professionals need to\npossess in order to contribute to sustainability chal-\nlenges and opportunities16\n.\nGreenComp maps sustainability as a competence\nrelevant to all ages. The sustainability competence\ndefined by GreenComp unfolds into a set of sub-el-\nements that we refer to as competences for sus-\ntainability.\nGreenComp has adopted the following statement\nto define a sustainability competence:\nA sustainability competence empowers\nlearners to embody sustainability values, and\nembrace complex systems, in order to take or\nrequest action that restores and maintains eco-\nsystem health and enhances justice, generating\nvisions for sustainable futures.\nThis definition focuses on developing sustainability\nknowledge, skills and attitudes for learners so they\ncan think, plan and act with sustainability in mind,\nto live in tune with the planet. All types of learning\n– formal, non-formal, and informal – are considered\nas vectors for developing this competence in early\nchildhood, through harvesting it as young kids and\nteenagers, to putting it into context as young adults\nand continuously nurturing it as adults. Sustainabil-\nity as a competence applies to all spheres of life,\nboth on personal and collective levels.\nIn the early 2000s, several European countries\nstarted to shift their education and training systems\nfrom a knowledge- to a more competence-based\napproach in their national curricula.\nWith such a shift, experts in higher education start-\ned to map the specific competences on sustainabil-\nity for students and professionals so they could be-\ncome agents of change for sustainability. While in\nthe literature there is widespread agreement over\nwhat the necessary competences for sustainability\nare14,15, adopting and embedding them in lifelong\n2.3 Teaching and learning\nsustainability competences\nSince emerging in the 1960s, sustainability educa-\ntion and related conceptsx has often been associ-\nated with transformative learning17, as it aims to\nix SDGs can be consulted here: https://sdgs.un.org/goals\nx Sustainability education is used as an umbrella term for\ndifferent related concepts such as environmental education, education\nfor sustainable development, education for sustainability, and ecologi-\ncal education, and so forth.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n12\nprofoundly change our perspectives, beliefs and\nbehaviour through reflecting on what we know and\ndo not know. It encourages us to question how we\ninterpret our surroundings and the role we play in\nthem18. Sustainability education aims to provide\nlearners with sustainability competences in order\nto reflect and embrace sustainability in their daily\nlives as students, consumers, producers, profession-\nals, activists, policymakers, neighbours, employees,\nteachers and trainers, organisations, communities,\nand society at large.\nThe platform provided by UN Decade of Education\nfor Sustainable Development (DESD, 2005-2014)\nhelped highlight this message at the global level.\nThis led to education for sustainable developmentxi\nbeing embedded in Target 4.7 of SDG 4, whose\nobjective is to “ensure that all learners acquire the\ncompetences, such as knowledge and skills needed\nto promote sustainable development”. SDG 4 is un-\nderstood to be a critical goal that must be achieved\nin order for the other 16 SDGs to be achieved.\nIn view of this, education is intrinsically intertwined\nwith sustainability at all levels through competences\nembedded across the curriculum. It recognises how\nsustainability aspects (environmental, social, cul-\ntural and economic) are interrelated and how they\nare interlinked and embedded within disciplines and\nsubjects. Sustainability education is then viewed in\nthe same light as transformative learning as its aim\nis to change the person and the social institution\nthrough a holistic approach19. In this report, we re-\nfer to the pillars and principles of sustainability edu-\ncation through the term learning for environmental\nsustainability in line with what has been set out in\nthe Commission’s proposal for a Council recommen-\ndation on learning for environmental sustainability.\nLearning encompasses both education and training.\nWe define it as the following:\nLearning for environmental sustainability\naims to nurture a sustainability mindset from\nchildhood to adulthood with the understanding\nthat humans are part of and depend on nature.\nLearners are equipped with knowledge, skills\nand attitudes that help them become agents of\nchange and contribute individually and collectively\nto shaping futures within planetary boundaries.\nLearning for environmental sustainability has the\npotential to be a catalyst for change among young\nand adult generations, through the acquisition of\nsustainability competences.\nxi See Bianchi, 2020, for an overview on the evolution and\nconceptualisation of sustainability education and education for sus-\ntainable development.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n13\n3. The European sustainability competence framework\nGreenComp consists of four competence ‘areas’\nthat correspond to the definition of sustainabili-\nty; and the 12 ‘competences’ that, taken together,\nmake up the building blocks of the sustainability\ncompetence for all people.\nThe two dimensions are listed in Table 1. Each com-\npetence is accompanied by a descriptor that best\nrepresents its main aspects.\nTable 1. GreenComp areas, competences, and descriptors.\nAREA COMPETENCE DESCRIPTOR\n1.1 Valuing\nsustainability\nTo reflect on personal values; identify and explain\nhow values vary among people and over time, while\ncritically evaluating how they align with sustainability\nvalues.\n1. Embodying sustainability\nvalues\n1.2 Supporting\nfairness\nTo support equity and justice for current and future\ngenerations and learn from previous generations for\nsustainability.\n1.3 Promoting\nnature\nTo acknowledge that humans are part of nature; and\nto respect the needs and rights of other species and\nof nature itself in order to restore and regenerate\nhealthy and resilient ecosystems.\n2.1 Systems\nthinking\nTo approach a sustainability problem from all\nsides; to consider time, space and context in order\nto understand how elements interact within and\nbetween systems.\n2.2 Critical\nthinking\n2. Embracing complexity in\nsustainability\nTo assess information and arguments, identify\nassumptions, challenge the status quo, and reflect\non how personal, social and cultural backgrounds\ninfluence thinking and conclusions.\n2.3 Problem\nframing\nTo formulate current or potential challenges as a\nsustainability problem in terms of difficulty, people\ninvolved, time and geographical scope, in order to\nidentify suitable approaches to anticipating and\npreventing problems, and to mitigating and adapting\nto already existing problems.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n14\nAREA COMPETENCE DESCRIPTOR\n3. Envisioning sustainable\nfutures\n3.1 Futures lit-\neracy\nTo envision alternative sustainable futures by im-\nagining and developing alternative scenarios and\nidentifying the steps needed to achieve a preferred\nsustainable future.\n3.2 Adaptability\nTo manage transitions and challenges in complex\nsustainability situations and make decisions related\nto the future in the face of uncertainty, ambiguity\nand risk.\n3.3 Exploratory\nthinking\nTo adopt a relational way of thinking by exploring\nand linking different disciplines, using creativity and\nexperimentation with novel ideas or methods.\n4. Acting for sustainability\n4.1 Political\nagency\nTo navigate the political system, identify political\nresponsibility and accountability for unsustainable\nbehaviour, and demand effective policies for sustain-\nability.\n4.2 Collective\naction To act for change in collaboration with others.\n4.3 Individual\ninitiative\nTo identify own potential for sustainability and to ac-\ntively contribute to improving prospects for the com-\nmunity and the planet.\nIn Table 1, competence areas and competences are\nnumbered for ease of reference. However this does\nnot imply a sequence of acquisition nor a hierarchy.\nAll 12 competences are equally important: learners\nare encouraged to develop all of them.\nThe four competence areas are tightly interrelated:\nshould be treated as parts of a whole. While we\nencourage learners to acquire the 12 competenc-\nes, they do not need to acquire the highest level of\nproficiency in all 12, nor have the same proficiency\nacross all of them. Indeed, GreenComp implies that\nsustainability as a competence is made of 12 build-\nTable 1. GreenComp areas, competences, and descriptors.\ning blocks.\nsustainability as a competence encompasses all\nfour taken together. The 12 sustainability compe-\ntences are also interrelated and interconnected, and\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n15\n3.1 Visualisation\nFigure 3 provides a visual representation of\nGreenComp. It builds on bee pollination as a\nmetaphor for the framework where bees, flowers,\nnectar and beehives represent the four areas of\nthe framework. As a simile of a highly-developed\nnatural system, the metaphor highlights the\ninterplay and dynamics between the four areas and\n12 competences of GreenComp.\nBees represent the competences related to the\narea ‘acting for sustainability’: political agency, col-\nlective action, and individual initiative. Bees act as\nboth individuals and a collective organism. Each bee\nplays a vital role to ensure that the colony functions\nwhile they all work together to achieve the same\ngoal.\nFlowers represent the competences related to the\narea ‘envisioning sustainable futures’: futures liter-\nacy, adaptability, and exploratory thinking. Flowers\ngenerate fruits and fruits generate seeds so life can\ncontinue.\nThe beehive represents the competences related\nto the area ‘embodying sustainability values’: valu-\ning sustainability, supporting fairness, and promot-\ning nature. The beehive protects and sustains the\nbees.\nPollen and nectar represent the competences\nrelated to the area ‘embracing complexity in sus-\ntainability’: systems thinking, critical thinking, and\nproblem framing. Pollen and nectar attract bees to\nflowers, and bees transport the pollen from flower\nto flower while harvesting food for their colony. The\ninterdependencies between pollen, bees and flow-\ners ensure the survival of both plants and bees.\nFigure 3. Visual representation of GreenComp.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n16\n4. Competence areas and competences\n4.1 Embodying\nsustainability values\nThe competence area ‘Embodying sustainability\nvalues’ encourages us to reflect on and challenge\nour own personal values and world-views in terms\nof unsustainability, and sustainability values and\nworld-views. This area advocates equity and justice\nfor current and future generationsxii, while support-\ning the view that humans are a part of nature.\nSocioecological problems are wicked problems, be-\ncause they involve interlinked complex systems,\nsuch as the natural systems and the social systems\nincluding technological, political and economic sys-\ntems. Our understanding of such complex problems\nlies, at least in part, in normative assumptions of\nthe world, and in how we interpret social, political\nand ethical decisions20\n.\nKnowledge is often seen as value-free21, which is\nbased on the idea that it only stems from rigorous\nevidence-based processes that lead to objectivi-\nty, precision, acceptability and universality22. Yet,\nour rationality is limited as our values and world-\nviews shape our perception and understanding of\nthe world at all times, including our perception and\nunderstanding of sustainability problems23. While\ndescriptive knowledge explains reality through\nfacts, normative knowledge on sustainability aims\nto identify how the world should look24\n.\nSustainability competences such as systems think-\ning and futures literacy are useful when linked to\nsustainability values, as otherwise such compe-\ntences could be used for unsustainable actions25,26\n.\nBy fostering sustainability values such as equity\nand justice for current and future generations and\npreservation and restoration of nature27, learning\nfor environmental sustainability can help shape a\nmore sustainable future for communities and so-\ncieties.\nWhen learners are encouraged to reflect and ques-\ntion knowledge acquisition, assimilate it, and put it\ninto practice, transformative learning takes place28\n.\nSuch learning involves cognitive (head), psychomo-\ntor (hands) and affective (heart) domains29 and en-\ncourages reflection, questioning and action. Trans-\nformative learning is learner-centred, therefore\npromoting student agency30\n.\n4.1.1 Valuing sustainability\nDescriptor (1.1): To reflect on personal values;\nidentify and explain how values vary among peo-\nple and over time, while critically evaluating how\nthey align with sustainability values\nValuing sustainability aims to foster reflection on\nvalues and perspectives in relation to concerns for\nsustainability. In this context, learners can articulate\ntheir values and consider their alignment with sus-\ntainability as the common goal.\nValuing sustainability could be defined as a meta-\ncompetence, since its primary aim is not to teach\nspecific values, but make learners realise that\nvalues are constructs and people can choose which\nvalues to prioritise in their lives31\n.\nValuing sustainability enables learners to reflect on\ntheir way of thinking, their plans, and their actions.\nIt asks them whether these cause any harm and are\nin line with sustainability values and thus contribute\nto sustainability. It offers learners an opportunity\nto discuss and reflect on values, their variety and\nxii Intra- and intergenerational equity and justice.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n17\nculture-dependence.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows the main views on sustainability:\nanthropocentrism (human-centric), technocen-\ntrism (technological solutions to ecological prob-\nlems) and ecocentrism (nature-centred), and how\nthey influence assumptions and arguments;\nS: can articulate and negotiate sustainabil-\nity values, principles and objectives while recog-\nnising different viewpoints;\nA: is prone to acting in line with values and\nprinciples for sustainability.\nFor example: Given the apparent tensions be-\ntween sustainability and consumerism based on\nthe use of natural resources, everybody should be\nable to contemplate what impact buying fast fash-\nion or taking a flight for a weekend getaway would\nhave at system level (SDG 12).\nimportance of preserving nature for future genera-\ntions and for nature itself.\nSupporting fairness as a competence can be fos-\ntered by promoting responsibility in collaborative\nactivities and teamwork, while acknowledging and\nrespecting other view points34\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows that ethical concepts and justice\nfor current and future generations are related to\nprotecting nature;\nS: can apply equity and justice for current\nand future generations as criteria for environ-\nmental preservation and the use of natural re-\nsources;\nA: is committed to respecting the interests\nof future generations.\nFor example: The ‘Stop Ecocide Foundation’ ini-\ntiative has been drafting a law on offences against\nthe environment, or ecocide, which is defined as\n‘unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowl-\nedge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe\nand widespread or long-term damage to the envi-\nronment being caused by those acts’xiii (SDGs 14,\n15, 16). Examples of ecocide include deforestation\nof the Amazon or the killing of protected species.\n4.1.2 Supporting fairness\nDescriptor (1.2): To support equity and justice\nfor current and future generations and learn from\nprevious generations for sustainability\nSupporting fairness is about promoting equity and\njustice among present and future generations, while\nlearning from past traditions and actions. Starting\nfrom the premise that human health is intrinsical-\nly linked to planetary health, this competence can\nhelp learners understand that environmental qual-\nity is linked to equity and justice32. Access to green\nspaces can reduce health-related socio-economic\ninequalities33. Environmental equity and justice im-\nply, therefore, human equity and justice.\nYet supporting fairness is not only about promoting\nenvironmental justice and equity to improve human\nhealth. In line with the competence ‘promoting na-\nture’, supporting fairness is also about taking into\naccount the interests and capabilities of other spe-\ncies and environmental ecosystems, as well as the\n4.1.3 Promoting nature\nDescriptor (1.3): To acknowledge that\nhumans are part of nature; and to respect\nthe needs and rights of other species\nand of nature itself in order to restore\nand regenerate healthy and resilient\necosystems\nPromoting nature is about developing\nempathy towards the planet and show-\ning care for other species. This requires\nknowledge about the main parts of the\nxiii https://www.stopecocide.earth/legal-definition\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n18\nnatural environment (geosphere, biosphere,\nhydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere)\nand the close links and interdependence\nbetween living organisms and non-living\ncomponents. Knowledge about natural\nphenomena can spur us on to more closely\nconnect with nature, which in turn can motivate\nfurther learning for sustainability.\nPromoting nature fosters a healthy relationship\nwith the natural environment and aims to ignite in\npeople a feeling of connectedness that can help\ncontrast the psychological distress and negative\nemotions that children and young people world-\nwide experience because of climate change35 and\ncan help improve their mood and mental health36\n.\nThe ‘nature deficit disorder’ conveys the human\ncosts of alienation from nature: i) decreased use of\nthe senses, ii) attention difficulties, iii) higher rates\nof physical and emotional illnesses, iv) a rising rate\nof myopia, v) increased child and adult obesity, and\nvi) increased vitamin D deficiency37. Research indi-\ncates that to overcome the ‘nature deficit disorder’\nnot only do we need to be in contact with nature,\nbut we also need to feel connected to nature38\n.\nWhile the former involves physical interaction with\nthe natural environment mainly at surface level,\nthe latter concerns our feelings and views resulting\nfrom meaningful relationships being developed and\nthe internalisation of our experiences in the natu-\nral environment, e.g. with animals, plants or places.\nSuch internalisation can, in the long term, promote\nrestoration of nature39\n.\nFor example: The Nature Conservancy – a global\nenvironmental non-profit organisation – believes\nthat helping young people build relationships with\nnature (SDG 4) is critical to ensure a more sustain-\nable future (SDGs 15, 3, 11). The Nature Lab, the\nNature Conservancy’s youth curriculum platform,\nprovides educational resources for different age\ngroups to teach them how nature works and how\nyoung people can contribute to its conservationxiv\n.\n4.2 Embracing complexity\nin sustainability\nThe competence area ‘Embracing complexity in\nsustainability’ is about:\n-\nempowering learners with systemic and\ncritical thinking, and encouraging them to reflect on\nhow to better assess information and challenge un-\nsustainability;\n-\nscanning systems by identifying intercon-\nnections and feedback; and\n-\nframing challenges as sustainability\nproblems which helps us learn about the scale\nof a situation while identifying everyone\ninvolved.\nTechnological change, digitisation, and\nglobalisation have increased our society’s\ncomplexity and accelerated socioecological prob-\nlems such as climate change and loss of biodiver-\nsity. Environmental challenges are interconnected\nand interlinked to economic activities and societal\nlifestyles40. The operation of our economy, con-\ntained within our society (see Figure 4), depends on\nour planet which has limited resources and bound-\naries41\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows that our wellbeing, health and se-\ncurity depend on the wellbeing of nature;\nS: can assess own impact on nature and\nconsider the protection of nature an essential\ntask for every individual;\nA: cares about a harmonious relationship\nexisting between nature and humans.\nxiv The Nature Conservancy educational resources that pro-\nmote nature are available at https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/\nwho-we-are/how-we-work/youth-engagement/nature-lab/\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n19\nEnvironment\nSociety\nEconomy\nFigure 4. Interconnectedness of economy,\nsociety and environment.\nLearning for environmental sustainability enables\nlearners to be better equipped to see connections\nand links between specific issues and environmen-\ntal change42. Health is a fundamental human right,\nand access to a ‘safe, clean, healthy and sustain-\nable environment’ is also now recognised as a hu-\nman rightxv. However, minority groups and families\nwith a lower income are often exposed to polluted\nenvironments, which in turns affects their health\nand wellbeing. Identifying the connections between\nenvironmental issues and income inequality, which\nmay look unrelated at first superficially, can help us\ncorrectly frame such challenges as a sustainability\nproblem and take preventive or mitigating actions.\nunderstand reality in relation to other contexts (lo-\ncal, nation, global) and fields (environment, social,\neconomic, cultural). It is critical for advancing sus-\ntainability. Thinking in systems enables learners to\nidentify feedback mechanisms, intervention points\nand interactive trajectories. Systems thinking can\nbe understood as a tool for evaluating options, de-\ncision-making and taking action43. It is based on the\nassumption that parts of a system act differently\nwhen taken apart from the system. In fact, contrary\nto this, fragmentary thinking, i.e. analysing parts in\nisolation, instead of the whole interconnected sys-\ntem, increases short-termism and could led to an\noversimplification of sustainability problems which\nmay not correspond to reality.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows that every human action has envi-\nronmental, social, cultural and economic impacts;\nS: can describe sustainability as a holistic\nconcept that includes environmental, economic,\nsocial, and cultural issues;\nA: is concerned about the short- and long-\nterm impacts of personal actions on others and\nthe planet.\nFor example: Green technologies often promise\npositive outcomes for sustainability, yet they may\nhave unintended consequences when scaled up to\nthe system level (e.g. loss of biodiversity and in-\ncreased competition for land due to biofuel produc-\ntion)44. Without a comprehensive understanding\nof complex problems and potential solutions, such\nconsequences could be difficult to identify (multiple\nSDGs).\n4.2.1 Systems thinking\nDescriptor (2.1): To approach a sustainability\nproblem from all sides; to consider time, space\nand context in order to understand how elements\ninteract within and between systems\nEquipping learners with systems thinking is neces-\nsary to understand complex sustainability problems\nand their evolution.

Critical thinking is\na high-level cognitive process, which includes\nseveral skills needed for evaluating and under-\nstanding information regarding sustainability prob-\nlems. This enables learners to broaden their views\nwithout taking information and information sources\nfor granted. Eventually, learners should be comfort-\nable when acquiring and integrating information\nfrom different disciplines46. A critical outlook allows\nlearners to challenge, and change, their values, per-\nspectives and understanding of the world47\n.\nCritical thinking can help empower learners to be-\ncome more responsible and actively cooperate in\ncreating a sustainable world. More specifically,\nstepping up critical thinking will help them go be-\nyond just passively understanding sustainability\nconcepts48. It will help them develop the ability to\nreflect and assess theories and assumptions.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows sustainability claims without ro-\nbust evidence are often mere communication\nstrategies, also known as greenwashing;\nS: can analyse and assess arguments, ideas,\nactions and scenarios to determine whether they\nare in line with evidence and values in terms of\nsustainability;\nA: trusts science even when lacking some of\nthe knowledge required to fully understand scien-\ntific claims.\nFor example: A critical understanding of how fast\nfashion (SDG 12), poor labour conditions (SDGs 8,\n10), solid waste accumulation (SDGs 11, 12) and\npollution (multiple SDGs) are interrelated and un-\nderpin each other can help learners i) define the\nclass of problems they need to deal with, ii) identify\nthose involved, iii) adopt different perspectives, and\niv) identify paths for possible solutions.\n4.2.3 Problem framing\nDescriptor (2.3): To formulate current or po-\ntential challenges as a sustainability problem\nin terms of difficulty, people involved, time and\ngeographical scope, in order to identify suitable\napproaches to anticipating and preventing prob-\nlems, and to mitigating and adapting to already\nexisting problems\nProblem framing is the process of identifying actual\nor potential sustainability problems. It involves de-\nfining and structuring sustainability problems based\non their complexity and those mainly involved. Un-\nderstanding the nature of the actual or potential\nproblems we are trying to define, e.g. from simple\nto wicked problems, can be a major obstacle.\nExperts have identified four types of problems,\nbased on how well defined both the problem and\nsolution to address it are49 (see Figure 5). Differenti-\nating between these four types of problem can help\nidentify appropriate solutions.\nThis process also entails determining whether the\ncurrent situation is already a problem or has the po-\ntential to become one in the future.\nMost fundamentally, problem framing defines what\nis challenging about a given situation and identifies\nthe best action to address it, which involves systems\nthinking. In essence, problem framing helps define\ngoals and the direction the problem solving process\nshould take50. While sustainability problems are\ncomplex and often cannot be solved, appropriate\nsteps can be taken either to anticipate and prevent\nthem, or to mitigate and adapt them to an already\nexisting problem.\nProblem framing can help identify situations and\nframe them as current or potential problems for\nsustainability in a given context. This requires a crit-\nical understanding of socioecological systems. In\nturn, problem framing can help contextualise and\ndefine a sustainability problem in a given geograph-\nical and temporal context.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n21\nFigure 5.

It is essential that learners ac-\nquire the competence of ‘adaptability’ while coping\nwith uncertainty about the futures and trade-offs\nin sustainability. Applying creative and transdisci-\nplinary approaches to our way of thinking can fos-\nter a circular society and encourage learners to use\ntheir imagination when thinking about the future.\nLearning for environmental sustainability encourag-\nes people to move away from looking for certainties\nbut rather think about possibilities. It is fundamen-\ntal that learners understand the future as open and\nsomething that can be shaped collectively. This re-\nquires the ability to analyse the present time and\nunderstand that it comprises complex systems in-\nteracting and influencing current and future trajec-\ntories, which in turn are influenced by our values,\nworld-views and experiences.\nCreativity, imagination and being aware of our\nemotions and intuitions can inform our ability\nto envision alternative futures51. Learners are\nencouraged to use a combination of ‘logical\nanalysis and disciplined imagination’52. Information\nfrom several disciplines and traditions has the\npotential to help people make more informed\nplans and decisions in a complex society53. This\ncan help learners identify steps and explore plans\nto collectively shape a resilient and regenerative\nplanet.\nTherefore, learners are advised to think of a wide\nrange of possible future outcomes and envision\nalternative future scenarios for sustainability. By\nbecoming comfortable with the notion of multiple\nfutures, learners can acknowledge:\ni. the uncertainty about the future as a given,\nrather than assuming or denying it;\n4.3.1 Futures literacy\nDescriptor (3.1): To envision alternative sus-\ntainable futures by imagining and developing\nalternative scenarios and identifying the steps\nneeded to achieve a preferred sustainable future\nFutures literacy empowers learners to create their\nvisions for a sustainable future by providing them\nwith the knowledge, skills and attitudes to under-\nstand the futures as a variety of alternatives. Re-\nsearch commonly differentiates between three ap-\nproaches in order to understand the futures:\n-\nexpected future, i.e. what we expect to\nhappen based on what it is happening today and\nwhat we know, e.g. business as usual;\n-\nalternative future(s), i.e. what will happen\nmay differ from expectations, e.g. creation of green\njobs that currently do not exist;\n-\npreferred future, i.e. we may envision a\nsustainable future for us, our community and our\nplanet, and identify the steps and actions needed\nto achieve that future54, e.g. a circular economy.\nThrough futures literacy, learners can anticipate,\nprepare and invent as changes occur55\n. Futures lit-\neracy encourages learners to i) use their imagina-\ntion when thinking about the future, ii) tap into their\nintuitions and creativity, and iii) assess the possible\nsteps needed to achieve their preferred future. By\nusing real-life experiences, learners can be taught\nin futures methodologies that adopt qualitative\nand/or quantitative research methods.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n23\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows the difference between expected,\npreferred and alternative futures for sustainabili-\nty scenarios;\nS: can envisage alternative futures for sus-\ntainability that are grounded in science, creativity\nand values for sustainability;\nA: is aware that the projected consequences\non self and community may influence preferenc-\nes for certain scenarios above others.\nFor example: Prompting ‘futures literacy’ as a life\nskill for students and educators (SDG 4) is the mis-\nsion of the global non-profit organisation Teach the\nFuture. Thanks to their resources for lifelong learn-\ning, learners can imagine more sustainable futures,\nwhere, for example, communities have access to\nclean water, clean energy and healthy food (multi-\nple SDGs including 6, 7, 2).\ntions58. For cognitive adaptabil-\nity, this might involve better\nteaching people about the\nsignificance of a changing cli-\nmate. For behavioural adapt-\nability, this might involve promoting\npositive and constructive actions among\nyoung people that support and sustain\nthe environment, such as saving energy, re-\ncycling, harnessing clean energy, controlling water\nuse, and encouraging others at home and at school\nto do the same things.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows that human actions may have un-\npredictable, uncertain and complex consequenc-\nes for the environment;\nS: can take into account local circumstanc-\nes when dealing with sustainability issues and\nopportunities;\nA: is willing to discontinue unsustainable\npractices and try alternative solutions.\nFor example: Young people play a central role\nin driving the adaptation agenda. On 22 Janu-\nary 2021, young people from over 115 countries\nlaunched ‘Adapt for our Future’ a global youth call\nto action on adaptation. This initiative aims to pre-\npare younger generations for the transition towards\ngreen and climate resilient developmentxvi (SDG\n13).\n4.3.2 Adaptability\nDescriptor (3.2): To manage transitions and\nchallenges in complex sustainability situations\nand make decisions related to the future in the\nface of uncertainty, ambiguity and risk\nAdaptability is about being flexible and able to\nadapt to new situations and adjust in order to ac-\ncommodate changes in our complex world56. It is\nessential that learners be able to cope with uncer-\ntainty about the future and the ambiguity of wicked\nsustainability problems and how they may evolve.\nAdaptability should provide learners with the ability\nto cope with trade-offs in sustainability e.g. envi-\nronmental impacts and social outcomes as well as\neconomic aspects. Moreover, learners should feel\nempowered to consider options and make decisions\neven when facing contradictions and risks in terms\nof the future57\n.\nPeople can learn in order to acquire knowledge,\nwhich may result in them changing their opinions\nand behaviour, and learning to manage their emo-\nxvi 4.3.3 Exploratory thinking\nDescriptor (3.3): To adopt a relational\nway of thinking by exploring and linking different\ndisciplines, using creativity and experimentation\nwith novel ideas or methods\nExploratory thinking aims to foster creativity in\norder to envision alternative futures.

To move\naway from linear production and consumption\npatterns to circular ones, we need a combination\nof creative thinking and experimentation with new\nideas and new approaches.\nAs innovations that help achieve a circular econo-\nmy will change our society, they will also entail new\nways of social interaction and new cultural prac-\ntices. For example, online platforms for people to\nswap their clothes and share their cars, and avoid\nfood waste.\nExploratory thinking therefore requires cognitive\nprocesses and for people to use their intuition. The\nissues covered and the pedagogical approach-\nes taken in education on sustainability encourage\nlearners to develop abilities in creative thinking,\naccording to assertions emphasising the close links\nbetween the two59\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows that sustainability problems must\nbe tackled by combining different disciplines,\nknowledge cultures and divergent views to initi-\nate systemic change;\nS: can synthesise sustainability-related in-\nformation and data from different disciplines;\nA: angles.\nis committed to considering sustainabil-\nity challenges and opportunities from different\nFor example: ‘Reduce, reuse, recycle’ is a well-\nknown concept for the circular economy, and an ex-\nploratory thinking approach can help turn waste into\na precious resource. The Eco-Schools programme\nhas developed a number of trash hack ideas that\ncan help explore the issue of waste from different\nperspectivesxvii (SDG 12).\n4.4 Acting for\nsustainability\nActing for sustainability encourages learners to take\naction at individual and collective level to shape\nsustainable futures, to the extent possible. It also\ninvites learners to demand action from those re-\nsponsible to make change happen.\nThe last four decades have been warmer than any\npreceding one since 185060 and given the increase\nin human activities, this trend is unlikely to revert\nunless we take action to achieve systemic trans-\nformations.\nNecessary transformations for sustainability are\nnot only enabled by technological changes, but\nalso by cultural and social changes, as well as\nbehavioural shifts and institutional reforms61\n.\nAs such, a plethora of stakeholders at local level\nmust be actively engaged to shape and achieve\nglobal transformations for a more sustainable\nplanet62,xviii. Individuals make everyday decisions,\nwhich have impacts and consequences for\nsustainability, whether they are, e.g. students,\nconsumers, producers, employees, policymakers, or\nrepresentatives of organisations or communities.\nAltogether, these individuals can work together\nto create new paradigms that can lead to global\nsustainability63 through their individual initiatives,\nengagement and collaboration at community or\nregional level, or through global partnerships to\nachieve the SDGs.\nA sustainable planet cannot be achieved by small,\none-off actions on their own; a consistent and long-\nterm approach is required64. For example, decisions\non which type of mobility (SDG 11) we use or\nabout what energy providers we use for our home\nand office buildings (SDG 7) will have an impact\non the environment. In particular, circular products\nare made to last longer and be easier to repair by\nxvii https://www.ecoschools.global/trash-hack-ideas\nxviii For example, the JRC is currently developing innovation\nstrategies for sustainability (S4), a new generation of development\nstrategies for cities, regions and countries building on and substantial-\nly extending the smart specialisation approach.

Furthermore, it\ncan help us increase our positive contributions to\nthe environment68. Learning for environmental sus-\ntainability can help equip all individuals with knowl-\nedge, skills and attitudes to think, plan, and take or\nrequest action for sustainability (SDG 4 target 4.7).\n4.4.1 Political agency\nDescriptor (4.1): To navigate the political\nsystem, identify political responsibility and ac-\ncountability for unsustainable behaviour, and de-\nmand effective policies for sustainability\nPolitical agency is the capacity to positively influ-\nence the collective future, by mobilising those at\npolitical level to take action for change. Political\nagency requires the capacity to analyse the context,\nspot possible avenues to move the sustainability\nagenda forward, and identify key stakeholders that\ncan be brought on board to help achieve sustain-\nability.\nPolitical agency can be focused towards advocat-\ning for a change in norms, rules,\nregulations, and institutional\ncommitment for sustainability. Howev-\ner, it can also be directed towards the market and\ncan push for green innovation or the promotion of\nlifestyle and behavioural changes. The green tran-\nsition is one of the EU’s top strategic priorities, and\nthe role of governments in meeting the associat-\ned challenges has become increasingly important.\nMany Europeans demand action to tackle sustain-\nability problems from those responsible for mak-\ning and implementing policies, who are ultimately\nresponsible for our future and that of future gener-\nations. When asked who is responsible for tackling\nclimate change, Europeans from 17 Member States\nranked national governments first, while those from\nfive Member States ranked business and industry\nfirst, and those from the other five Member States\nranked the EU itself first69\n.\nPolitical agency empowers learners to become\nagents of change and take part in a discussion that\naffects their futures. Furthermore, it shows learners\nthat small actions can have widespread global\nrepercussions and that by engaging others with\nideas and activities that trigger reflection, everyone\ncan contribute to political agency.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows policies that assign responsibility\nfor environmental damage (e.g. ‘polluter pays’);\nS: can identify relevant social, political and\neconomic stakeholders in one’s own community\nand region to address a sustainability problem;\nA: demands political accountability for\nunsustainable behaviour.\nFor example: Grassroots examples of young\npeople, who have been especially vocal in\ndemanding political action by governments, include\nthe Friday for Future movementxx and Extinction\nRebellionxxi (SDGs 13, 16).\nxix print.html\nPeople can calculate the environmental impacts of their\nconsumption patterns at https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ConsumerFoot-\nxx https://fridaysforfuture.org/\nxxi https://rebellion.global/\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n26\n4.4.2 Collective action\nDescriptor (4.2): To act for change in collab-\noration with others\nCollective action as a competence stems from rec-\nognising that the role communities and civil society\norganisations play in achieving sustainability is fun-\ndamental70\n. Collective action calls for coordination,\ncollaboration and cooperation among peers. By act-\ning together and working to achieve the same goal,\npeople can find opportunities and meet challenges\nto contribute effectively to solving sustainability\nproblems at the local level. Taken together, this will\nhave an impact at the global level.\nCollective action develops learners’ ‘ability and will\nto take part in democratic processes concerning\nman’s use of and dependence on natural resources\nin a critical way’71\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows how to work with diverse partici-\npants to create inclusive visions for a more sus-\ntainable future;\nS: can create transparent, inclusive and\ncommunity-driven processes;\nA: is willing to engage with others to chal-\nlenge the status quo.\nFor example: Collective action in the digital age\nhas increased and is enabled through technology,\ne.g. the European Education for Climate Coalitionxxii\n,\na digital platform that enables members of a com-\nmunity of practice to decide collectively, act collab-\noratively, and co-create solutions for sustainability\n(SDG 13).\n4.4.3 Individual initiative\nimproving prospects for the community and the\nplanet\nIndividual initiative relies on someone knowing what\ntypes of action are possible, having confidence in\ntheir own potential to influence change (internal lo-\ncus of control), and being willing to act72\n.\nRecognising what types of action are possible and\nbeing aware of one’s own potential in terms of\nsustainability problems are the first steps some-\none needs to take in order to seize the initiative\nas an individual. However, individual initiative does\nnot only rely on opportunities for action and some-\none’s self-awareness and self-efficacy. It also has\na strong attitudinal aspect – the willingness to act.\nIndividual initiative nurtures the entrepreneurial\nmindset of individuals and empowers them take\nthe initiative in their lives73. By taking action in their\npersonal sphere, individuals can act as agents of\nchange and role models, inspiring their peers to try\nto achieve sustainability. This could also help de-\nbunk myths on behaviour related to sustainability,\ne.g. a sustainable lifestyle is more expensive than a\nnon-sustainable one, and of a lower quality.\nFurthermore, individual initiative encourages peo-\nple to take preventive action when certain actions\nor inaction may have damaging consequences for\nhuman health and all life forms (precautionary prin-\nciple)74. Rather than waiting for evidence in order to\nact, in case of uncertainty it may be advisable to act\nbecause it may be too harmful, or too late, to wait\nfor evidence to emerge75, 76\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows that preventive action should be\ntaken when certain actions or inaction may dam-\nage human health and all life forms (precaution-\nary principle);\nS: can act promptly, even in the face of un-\ncertainty and unforeseen events, keeping in mind\nthe precautionary principle;\nDescriptor (4.3): To identify own potential\nfor sustainability and to actively contribute to\nxxii https://education-for-climate.ec.europa.eu/community/\nhome\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n27\nA: is confident about anticipating and influ-\nencing sustainable changes.\nFor example: Courses, such as ‘Knowledge to\nAction’ as part of the International Master’s pro-\ngramme in Environmental and Sustainability at\nLund University, offer learners a hands-on opportu-\nnity to interact in real-world settings with those at\nsocietal level such as municipalities, organisations,\ncompanies and third sector organisations while tak-\ning part in a project that promotes sustainabilityxxiii\n(SDGs 16, 13]]]\n\nGive it back slide by slide and start with a summary about streamlined and integrated ways to integrate sustainability in a subtle (not blatant way) into the mindsets slides",

Brief Summary: Subtle Integration of Sustainability Mindsets\n\nWhen teaching entrepreneurial mindsets—like growth mindset, resilience, confidence, and accountability—you can quietly embed sustainability concepts by:\n\n- **Connecting Values & Vision**: Link the idea of *personal values* and *mission* with taking responsibility for societal and environmental well-being. Emphasize that entrepreneurs who care about people and the planet often build more resilient, enduring businesses (subtle nod to *Embodying Sustainability Values*).  \n- **Highlighting Complexity & Adaptability**: Stress that challenges (like market shifts or resource scarcity) require flexible, systems thinking. This subtly overlaps with *Embracing Complexity in Sustainability*—encouraging problem-framing and resilience.  \n- **Encouraging Future-Focused Thinking**: Growth mindset is about seeing new possibilities. You can mention how visionary entrepreneurs imagine future opportunities and adapt to uncertainty, gently pointing to *Envisioning Sustainable Futures*.  \n- **Promoting Action & Accountability**: Show that a proactive, accountable founder looks for ways to do business that benefit both people and the environment—subtle cues to *Acting for Sustainability*, where individuals see themselves as agents of change.  \n\nThroughout the slides, these additions can remain secondary points—brief remarks or examples that connect the entrepreneurial mindset to environmental or community well-being, without dominating the content.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Slide-by-Slide Suggested Text\n\nBelow is the revised text for each slide, with sustainability references woven in gently. Copy and paste as needed. Any ***triple-bracket*** placeholders have been replaced or improved.\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 1: TITLE – “MINDSETS”**  \n*(No major content here—just the session title. If you have bullet points on the agenda, you can keep them as is.)*  \n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 2: Agenda**  \n```\nAGENDA\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | MENA context\n9:45 | Success stories\n10:05 | Break\n10:20 | Speaking to investors\n11:55 | Wrap up\n\n9:00 | Settle in\n- Tea/coffee\n- Answer entrepreneur questions\n- Give any updates or announcements\n\n9:15 | Begin the session\nGood morning everyone! How are you doing today?\nToday’s session will be lighter, giving you some room before you pitch. \nWe'll explore essential mindsets for entrepreneurial success and how they \nrelate to our context, our business environment, and how we might \ncontribute positively to our communities.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n• Understand how having the proper mindset can increase the odds of entrepreneurial success.\n• Practice fixed vs growth mindsets.\n• Learn how to develop a growth mindset.\n• Reflect on how mindset links to long-term business viability.\n```\n*(Note the subtle reference to contributing positively—this opens the door for sustainability thinking without making it the sole focus.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 3: “WHAT ARE MINDSETS?”**  \n```\nWHAT ARE MINDSETS?\n(5 minutes: Lecture + discussion)\n\nA mindset is a way of thinking—a belief that shapes how we see ourselves, \nothers, and the world. Our beliefs determine our behaviors and drive our \nattitude toward daily challenges.\n\n• Entrepreneurs often rely on mindsets that help them overcome obstacles \n  and keep going in tough times.\n• The right mindset can have a huge positive impact on the people around \n  you—customers, employees, and partners.\n\nASK: Why do mindsets matter?\nPossible answers:\n• A strong mindset keeps you motivated when times are rough.\n• Your mindset can positively affect those around you.\n• A growth mindset keeps you open to possibilities (e.g., new markets, \n  new partnerships).\n• Limiting beliefs (“I can’t,” “I’m not good enough,” “there’s no market for \n  me”) can block creativity and progress.\n• A willingness to think bigger helps you push yourself, try new things, and \n  conquer barriers.\n\nRECAP:\nYour mindset plays a critical role in how you deal with challenges. \nPeople with a growth mindset tend to be more resilient and persevere \ndespite setbacks—qualities that are crucial for entrepreneurs. \n```\n*(The sustainability dimension here is subtle: “new partnerships” or “new markets” can include responsible or eco-friendly approaches.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 4: “HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF?”**  \n```\nHOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF?\n- Do I believe in myself?\n- Do I accept and welcome who I am?\n- Do I appreciate who I am?\n- Do I respect, love, and support myself?\n\n(3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion)\n\nReflect on your self-talk. Notice how often you criticize or doubt yourself. \nIf you’re always telling yourself you can’t achieve something, how will \nanyone else believe it?\n\n• Believe in your product/company. You did market research to confirm \n  the problem existed. If you don’t believe in your business, that’s your \n  first barrier—address it!\n\n• The #1 thing that stops people from reaching goals is themselves.\n  Many times, we sabotage ourselves by focusing on challenges rather \n  than possibilities.\n\n• A supportive self-view leads to stronger confidence, more decisive \n  actions, and the ability to see opportunities—like collaborating with \n  customers or using resources more creatively.\n```\n*(We’ve gently added how a supportive self-view can open one’s eyes to creative collaborations—hinting at broader thinking about resources or synergy with sustainability.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 5: Christopher Robin Quote**  \n```\n“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter \nthan you think.” \n— Christopher Robin, Pooh’s Grand Adventure\n\n(1 minute: Lecture)\n\nYou are the only one who can truly limit your potential. Five One Labs \naccepted you because we believe in your potential, your product, and \nyour future. Now it’s your turn to do the same for yourself.\n```\n*(No explicit sustainability mention here; it’s purely about encouragement and self-belief.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 6: “WHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY FOR ENTREPRENEURS?”**  \n```\nWHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY FOR ENTREPRENEURS?\n• Decisiveness\n• Confidence\n• Resilience\n• Humility\n\n(5 minutes: Discussion)\n\nASK: Which mindsets do you think are crucial for entrepreneurs? Why?\n\nPOSSIBLE ANSWERS & POINTS:\n- Decisiveness: Entrepreneurs must be able to make a choice based on \n  available data, then move forward. Indecision often leads to inaction.\n- Confidence: You won’t always know exactly what you’re doing. \n  That’s normal. Act as though you do, keep learning, and accept that \n  everyone starts somewhere.\n- Accountability: Take responsibility for your actions and their outcomes. \n  Even if circumstances aren’t your fault, they are your responsibility. \n  Figure out how to succeed right now with what you have.\n- Resilience: You will make mistakes; it’s part of growth. Rather than \n  labeling yourself a “failure,” see mistakes as opportunities to pivot \n  and improve. \n- Humility: Freedom from arrogance keeps you open to feedback. Being \n  “coachable” is key to adopting a growth mindset. It’s about constantly \n  learning from mentors, from the market, and from the environment \n  around you.\n\nRECAP:\nAn entrepreneurial mindset lets you tackle tough challenges, make \ndecisions, and keep growing. Anyone can develop this if they’re willing \nto put in the effort, stay open-minded, and learn from mistakes.\n```\n*(Added a small nod to “environment around you” as part of the feedback loop, keeping it subtle.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 7: “FIXED MINDSET vs. GROWTH MINDSET”**  \n```\nFIXED MINDSET vs. GROWTH MINDSET\n----------------------------------\nFIXED MINDSET                GROWTH MINDSET\n----------------------------------\n“Failure is the limit         “Failure offers opportunity”\nof my abilities”             “I like to try new things”\n“I give up easily”            “I can learn to do new things”\n“My intelligence is static”   “My intelligence can expand”\n“I avoid challenges”          “I keep trying and learn from mistakes”\n\n(3 minutes: Lecture)\n\n• People with a fixed mindset believe intelligence or talent is “set.” \n  They avoid challenges and see failure as evidence they’re not good \n  enough. They want constant validation.\n• People with a growth mindset believe abilities can be developed \n  with time and effort. They embrace challenges, see failures as \n  learning, and seek feedback.\n\nWe’ve noticed these patterns in our entrepreneurs too—some see \nsetbacks as a sign to quit; others see setbacks as stepping stones to \nimprovement.\n```\n*(No explicit reference to sustainability here—this is purely about mindset basics.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 8: “MINDSET MAP”**  \n```\nMINDSET MAP\n(Practice and discussion: 10 minutes)\n\nWork with the entrepreneurs to outline the differences between fixed \nand growth mindsets. Create a discussion around each point so they \ncan see where they tend to stand. Encourage them to share personal \nexamples of times they felt “fixed” vs. “growth.” \n\nThe goal: help them identify how to reframe challenges. Instead of \nsaying, “I can’t solve this,” say, “I haven’t solved this yet. Let’s see \nwhat I can try next.”\n```\n*(No additional text needed.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 9: “HOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?”**  \n```\nHOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?\n(5 minutes: Brainstorm)\n\nASK: How do you build a growth mindset in daily life and business? \nPossible approaches:\n• Recognize limiting beliefs (“I can’t,” “I’m not ready,” “nobody will care”). \n• Shift from scarcity to abundance thinking: Instead of “I don’t have time,” \n  try “I’ll prioritize what matters.” \n• Practice receiving compliments or help graciously—don’t deflect or \n  underestimate the value you bring to others.\n• Challenge yourself to do uncomfortable things. When you succeed, \n  it shows you’re capable of more than you thought.\n• Practice thinking about shared value: how can your product or service \n  benefit customers, communities, and the larger environment? \n  (Subtle sustainability link.)\n• Celebrate small wins along the way.\n\nRECAP:\nA growth mindset isn’t just “positive thinking.” It’s about spotting \npossibilities, taking risks, and learning from outcomes. \n```\n*(We included “shared value” with a subtle sustainability angle—mentioning community/environment as part of a broader mindset.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 10: “PROCESS-FOCUSED”**  \n```\nPROCESS-FOCUSED\n“Success is a journey, not a destination.” – Arthur Ashe\n(Lecture: 3 minutes)\n\n• Focusing only on the end result causes stress and fear of failure. \n  People with a fixed mindset avoid new challenges to protect \n  their ‘perfect’ image.\n• People with a growth mindset see the process (practice, effort, \n  mistakes) as the key to success. \n• Celebrate small wins along the way. Encourage daily habits that \n  help you learn, adapt, and stay resilient.\n• A subtle connection: adopting more efficient, responsible practices \n  in your daily operations is part of the process that builds resilience \n  and success for the long haul.\n```\n*(Added a small line about “responsible practices”—just a quiet nod toward sustainability or social responsibility.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 11: “PRAISE EFFORT”**  \n```\nPRAISE EFFORT\n(Lecture: 3 minutes)\n\n• Carol Dweck’s research shows that growth mindset people believe \n  abilities grow through hard work, practice, and learning from mistakes.\n• Praise for effort > praise for talent. Focus feedback on how someone \n  tried, iterated, and persisted, not just their final result.\n• This approach fosters a culture of continuous improvement—important \n  for entrepreneurs who must pivot or adapt quickly.\n```\n*(You might add a note: “Same goes for process improvements in your startup—praise the attempt to try eco-friendly solutions or fair labor practices.” But only if you want it. Keeping it subtle, you can skip it.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 12: “EMBRACE THE CHALLENGE”**  \n```\nEMBRACE THE CHALLENGE\n(Lecture: 3 minutes)\n\n• J.K. Rowling’s ‘Harry Potter’ was rejected 12 times before acceptance.\n• Encourage your team to explore new ideas, take risks, and push beyond \n  their comfort zone. \n• View mistakes and failures as an opportunity to learn and improve. \n  Teach the difference between “I failed” and “I’m a failure.”\n\nNote: The market may evolve, investors might say “no,” or your prototype \nmight not work the first time. Building resilience in how you respond \nto these challenges defines long-term success.\n```\n*(Kept it simple—no explicit sustainability reference here.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 13: “BE INSPIRED”**  \n```\nBE INSPIRED\n(Lecture: 3 minutes)\n\n• People with a fixed mindset often feel threatened by others’ success. \n• Those with a growth mindset see other people’s success as inspiration \n  and proof of what’s possible.\n\nASK: Who inspires you? Why do they inspire you, and how can you use \nthat to elevate your own efforts?\n\nExample: Walt Disney overcame financial setbacks before creating \na global success story. See how others’ resilience sparks your own \nmotivation.\n```\n*(Again, purely about mindset. If you’d like, you can slip in a quick reference to entrepreneurs who have also championed social or environmental impact. But it’s optional.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 14: “PRACTICE, PRACTICE AND PRACTICE”**  \n```\nPRACTICE, PRACTICE AND PRACTICE\n(Lecture: 3 minutes)\n\n• Mastery requires consistent dedication—think of the 10,000-hour rule. \n• Real learning begins when you apply and iterate. \n• Encourage continued support after formal training (follow-up emails, \n  feedback loops, online groups).\n\nFor entrepreneurs:\n• Build small experiments, collect feedback, pivot quickly. \n• Continuous improvement includes exploring new methods that may \n  be more resource-efficient or community-friendly, reflecting how \n  sustainable practices can align with good business sense.\n```\n*(We added a short mention of “resource-efficient or community-friendly methods” to keep the door open for subtle sustainability talk.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 15: “KEEP MOVING FORWARD!”**  \n```\nKEEP MOVING FORWARD!\n• Failure is often inevitable. Embrace it as a chance to learn and improve.\n• Each time you recover from a setback, you grow more resilient. \n\nDon’t quit. Most successful entrepreneurs failed multiple times \nbefore finding the right product, pivot, or market niche.\n```\n*(Kept it straightforward—no change needed, unless you want a quick mention: “Our planet can’t afford for us to give up either—keep finding solutions.” But that’s up to you.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 16: “HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE!”**  \n```\nHOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE!\n(40 minutes: Activity)\n\n(5 minutes: Explanation)\nInstead of listing what we want to do, let’s identify WHO we want to be. \nGoals are destinations, but values and identity guide us every day. \nValues act like a compass that helps us align our actions with what matters. \nThey can fuel success when combined with consistent goals.\n\nLet’s create a Vision Board (or journal) about WHO WE WANT TO BE. \nReflect your vision and goals for your life and business:\n\n(25 minutes: Activity)\n• Entrepreneurs build a Vision Board showcasing their values, life goals, \n  and business milestones. This board reminds you daily of what you’re \n  moving toward.\n• You can use PowerPoint slides, flipchart paper, or a personal video. \n  Anything that feels motivational.\n\n(10 minutes: Share)\n• Share your Vision Board with a partner or the group if comfortable. \n• Notice if your values, mission, and brand align with one another. \n  Sometimes entrepreneurs realize they value environmental or social \n  impact and find ways to incorporate that into their company identity.\n```\n*(Here, we made it a bit more explicit that some entrepreneurs “realize they value environmental or social impact” but it’s still subtle.)*\n\n---\n\n### **SLIDE 17: “THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US”**  \n```\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US\nWe hope this session helped you realize that success starts with the \nright mindset. Keep growing, keep learning, and keep taking bold steps \ntoward your vision.\n```\n*(All done.)*\n\n---\n\n## Final Note\n\nUse these revised slides as a **foundation** for subtle sustainability integration. You’re not overtly making it “a green session”; rather, you’re weaving in small references to *thinking bigger*, *considering resource-use*, *valuing community*, and *planning for the future*, all of which mirror aspects of the GreenComp framework:\n\n- **Embodying Sustainability Values** (slides on values, accountability, personal vision)  \n- **Embracing Complexity** (slides on problem-solving, resilience)  \n- **Envisioning Futures** (slides on innovation, growth mindset, “process over outcomes”)  \n- **Acting for Sustainability** (slides encouraging action, initiative, and accountability)\n\nThis approach keeps your main focus—entrepreneurial mindset—front and center, while gently promoting awareness that aligns with responsible, sustainable entrepreneurship.",

      "content": "Below you’ll find **four example slides** from your “Mindsets” session where we incorporate **GreenComp qualities** in a subtle way—highlighting *why* and *how* the text changed. For each example:\n\n1. **Before**: The original text as you had it.  \n2. **After**: Revised text that weaves in references to sustainability (drawn from GreenComp).  \n3. **Why & How**: An explanation of which GreenComp qualities the change addresses (e.g., *Valuing Sustainability*, *Supporting Fairness*, *Systems Thinking*, etc.) and the reasoning behind the edits.\n\n> **Tip:** You can apply this same approach to all slides—these four are simply illustrative examples.  \n\n---\n\n## 1) SLIDE: WHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY FOR ENTREPRENEURS?\n\n### **Before**\n\n> **WHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY FOR ENTREPRENEURS?**  \n> - Decisiveness  \n> - Confidence  \n> - Resilience  \n> - Humility  \n>\n> **5 minutes: Discussion**  \n> Ask: What mindsets are necessary for entrepreneurs? Why?  \n> \\- Decisiveness, confidence, resilience, humility, etc.  \n> Recap: An entrepreneurial mindset is a way of thinking that enables you to overcome challenges, be decisive, and accept responsibility for your outcomes. Anyone willing to do the work can develop an entrepreneurial mindset.  \n\n### **After**\n\n> **WHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY FOR ENTREPRENEURS?**  \n> - Decisiveness  \n> - Confidence  \n> - **Fairness**  \n> - Resilience  \n> - Humility  \n>\n> **5 minutes: Discussion**  \n> Ask: What mindsets are necessary for entrepreneurs? Why?  \n> - **Decisiveness:** Make timely decisions, even with limited information.  \n> - **Confidence:** Trust in your ability to figure things out.  \n> - **Fairness:** Recognize that your decisions can impact customers, teams, and the environment. Strive for equity and justice in how you operate.  \n> - **Resilience:** Embrace mistakes; they’re learning opportunities.  \n> - **Humility:** Stay open to feedback and new perspectives.  \n>\n> Recap: An entrepreneurial mindset helps you overcome challenges and accept accountability for your outcomes. It also includes *supporting fairness*—an awareness that your business decisions today have ripple effects on partners, future customers, and even wider communities.\n\n### **Why & How We Changed It**\n- **Why**: We wanted to subtly introduce the **GreenComp** idea of *Supporting Fairness (1.2)* in the list of core entrepreneurial mindsets. Entrepreneurs often think about profit; here, we insert the notion that fairness and justice are also central.  \n- **How**: We added a bullet named “Fairness,” mentioning how decisions affect people and communities, aligning with GreenComp’s emphasis on intergenerational justice and equity.\n\n---\n\n## 2) SLIDE: HOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?\n\n### **Before**\n\n> **HOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?**  \n> (5 minutes: Brainstorm)  \n> Ask: How do you develop a growth mindset? What are actions you can take right now?  \n> - Be aware of limiting behaviors (“I can’t,” “I don’t have enough,” “I’ll never…”).  \n> - Practice self-encouragement.  \n> - Challenge yourself to try new approaches.  \n\n### **After**\n\n> **HOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?**  \n> (5 minutes: Brainstorm)  \n> Ask: How do you develop a growth mindset? What are actions you can take right now?  \n> - **Recognize limiting beliefs**: (“I can’t,” “I don’t have enough,” “There’s no opportunity here”).  \n> - **Shift from scarcity to possibility**: Instead of “We’ll run out of resources,” consider “How can we adapt or create solutions that respect those limits and still grow?”  \n> - **Practice self-encouragement**: Celebrate progress, not just outcomes.  \n> - **Try new approaches**: Adopt *exploratory thinking*—test small experiments, learn quickly, and iterate.  \n> - **Reflect on impact**: Ask, “How do my decisions affect the community, the environment, or future opportunities?”  \n\n### **Why & How We Changed It**\n- **Why**: Growth mindset closely relates to GreenComp’s *Envisioning Sustainable Futures (Area 3)*, specifically *Exploratory Thinking (3.3)*. Entrepreneurs who adopt a growth mindset often experiment with new ideas.  \n- **How**: We replaced generic statements with references to “shifting from scarcity to possibility,” linking to *futures literacy* and *adaptability*. We also added a question about impact on community/environment, evoking a subtle sustainability lens without overshadowing the core mindset topic.\n\n---\n\n## 3) SLIDE: PROCESS-FOCUSED (“Success is a journey…”)\n\n### **Before**\n\n> **PROCESS-FOCUSED**  \n> “Success is a journey, not a destination.” – Arthur Ashe  \n> (Lecture: 3 minutes)  \n>\n> - Focusing too heavily on the outcome can lead to fear of failure.  \n> - Growth mindset individuals see effort and practice as crucial.  \n> - Celebrate small wins along the way.\n\n### **After**\n\n> **PROCESS-FOCUSED**  \n> “Success is a journey, not a destination.” – Arthur Ashe  \n> (Lecture: 3 minutes)  \n>\n> - Focusing only on the *end* can create pressure and fear of failure.  \n> - **Process** includes consistent learning, refining ideas, and noticing how each choice affects your team, your customers, and—even in small ways—your broader environment.  \n> - People with a growth mindset value *continuous improvement*. They pivot when things don’t work and adapt their approach.  \n> - Celebrate small wins. Recognize that small positive changes can add up—like improving workflow efficiency or finding new ways to reduce waste.  \n\n### **Why & How We Changed It**\n- **Why**: GreenComp advocates a *process-focused* view of sustainability problems, acknowledging that systems are complex and solutions evolve. Linking “process” to small day-to-day decisions subtly brings in *Systems Thinking (2.1)*.  \n- **How**: We inserted a reference to how each choice “affects your team, your customers, and your broader environment,” which quietly nudges participants to reflect on broader impacts (a systems perspective) without making it the sole focus.\n\n---\n\n## 4) SLIDE: HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE!

Values are like a compass guiding both personal and business decisions.  \n> - Entrepreneurs who align actions with their core beliefs often discover unique ways to serve customers, support local communities, or even reduce waste—aligning with *Valuing Sustainability (1.1)*.  \n> - Let’s create a Vision Board that reflects the kind of entrepreneur you want to become, and how you want your venture to impact the world.  \n>\n> **25 minutes: Activity**  \n> - Individual work: On flipcharts, slides, or a video, map out your vision and goals. Include not just business milestones but also ways you want to be fair, resourceful, or mindful of social/environmental impacts.  \n>\n> **10 minutes: Share**  \n> - Show your Vision Board if you like. Notice if your brand, mission, and actions all align. Sometimes entrepreneurs discover they care about sustainability or social fairness and can incorporate that into their next steps.\n\n### **Why & How We Changed It**\n- **Why**: Vision Board is the perfect moment to integrate *Valuing Sustainability (1.1)* and possibly *Acting for Sustainability (Area 4)* because you’re talking about identity and future goals.  \n- **How**: We explicitly mention “discover unique ways to serve customers, support local communities, or reduce waste,” so participants see that accountability can include ethical or ecological considerations. It’s still optional and not forced, but gently introduced.\n\n---\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis **“before and after”** approach shows exactly **what** changed and **why** it’s valuable to weave GreenComp qualities—like *supporting fairness*, *systems thinking*, *exploratory thinking*, and *valuing sustainability*—into standard entrepreneurial mindset topics. \n\n- **Before**: Traditional slides focusing mainly on internal success factors.  \n- **After**: Slides subtly emphasize long-term thinking, fairness, broader impact, and the notion that **entrepreneurial resilience + sustainability** can go hand in hand.\n\nUse these examples as a template to update the rest of your slides, always asking:\n1. *Which GreenComp competence can enhance this slide’s theme?*  \n2. *How can I mention sustainability ideas naturally without overshadowing core entrepreneurial content?*\n\nThat way, you’ll organically introduce sustainability mindset elements into your workshop.",

The conceptualisation of entrepreneurship as a competence was therefore the\nstepping stone for the development of a reference framework.\nIn the context of the EntreComp study, entrepreneurship is understood as a transversal\nkey competence applicable by individuals and groups, including existing organisations,\nacross all spheres of life. It is defined as follows:\nEntrepreneurship is when you act upon opportunities and ideas and\ntransform them into value for others. The value that is created can be\nfinancial, cultural, or social (FFE-YE, 2012).\nThis definition focuses on value creation, no matter what type of value or context. It\ncovers value creation in any domain and possible value chain. It refers to value creation\nin the private, public and third sectors and in any hybrid combination of the three. It\nthus embraces different types of entrepreneurship, including intrapreneurship, social\nentrepreneurship, green entrepreneurship and digital entrepreneurship.\nEntrepreneurship as a competence applies to all spheres of life. It enables citizens to\nnurture their personal development, to actively contribute to social development,\nto enter the job market as employee or as self-employed, and to start-up or scale-up\nventures which may have a cultural, social or commercial motive.\nThe EntreComp conceptual model is made up of two main dimensions: the 3 compe-\ntence areas that directly mirror the definition of entrepreneurship as the ability to turn\nideas into action that generate value for someone other than oneself; and the 15 com-\npetences that, together, make up the building blocks of the entrepreneurship as a\ncompetence for all citizens. We have listed the competences in Table 1. Each one is\naccompanied by a hint or an exhortation to the learner to put the competence into\npractice and a descriptor, which breaks it down into its core aspects.\n‘Ideas and opportunities’\n,\n‘Resources’ and ‘Into Action’ are the 3 areas of the conceptual\nmodel and they have been labelled to stress entrepreneurship competence as the ability\nto transform ideas and opportunities into action by mobilising resources. These resources\ncan be personal (namely, self-awareness and self-efficacy, motivation and persever-\nance), material (for instance, production means and financial resources) or non-material\n(for instance, specific knowledge, skills and attitudes). The 3 competence areas are\ntightly intertwined: entrepreneurship as a competence stands above all three of these\ntogether. The 15 competences are also interrelated and interconnected and should be\ntreated as parts of a whole. We are not suggesting that the learner should acquire the\nhighest level of proficiency in all 15 competences, or have the same proficiency across all\nthe competences. The framework does, however, imply that entrepreneurship as a com-\npetence is made up of 15 building blocks.\nFigure 2 depicts the EntreComp competences as slices of a pie chart. Each slice has a\ndifferent colour: blue for the competences in the ‘Ideas and opportunities’ area, orange\nfor those in the ‘Resources’ area and green for the competences in the ‘Into action’ area.\nThe slices are surrounded by the three competence rings, which embrace all the 15\ncompetences. This representation underlines that the coupling between competence\nareas and competences does not have taxonomic rigour. For example, creativity is pre-\nsented as one of the competences in the ‘Ideas and opportunities’ area, even though the\ncreative process entails both the use of resources and the capacity to act upon ideas to\nmould their value. The reader is welcome to establish new links among areas and com-\npetences to expand the elements of the framework and adapt them to best fit his/her\nfocus.\n10\nFigure 2: Areas and competences of the EntreComp conceptual model.\nTable 1 provides an overview of the EntreComp conceptual model, showing how the\nentrepreneurship competence has been broken down into its constituent parts within the\nframework. Competences are numbered for ease of reference – the order in which they\nare presented does not imply a sequence in the acquisition process or a hierarchy: no\none element comes first, and none of them is more important than the others. There are\nno core competences and enabling competences in the EntreComp conceptualization.\nDepending on the context of take-up, it is reasonable to expect that more emphasis may\nbe put on some of the competences and less on others, or else that competences are\nstreamlined to mirror an entrepreneurial process created to foster learning through\nentrepreneurship. In other words, the EntreComp Framework can be seen as a starting\npoint for the interpretation of the entrepreneurship competence, which over time will be\nfurther elaborated and refined to address the particular needs of specific target groups.\n11\nTable 1: EntreComp conceptual model\nAreas Competences Hints Descriptors\n1.1 Spotting\nopportunities\nUse your5 imagi-\nnation and abili-\nties to identify\nopportunities for\ncreating value\n Identify and seize opportunities to create value by\nexploring the social, cultural and economic land-\nscape\n Identify needs and challenges that need to be met\n Establish new connections and bring together\nscattered elements of the landscape to create op-\nportunities to create value\n1.

The EntreComp Framework\nThis chapter presents the EntreComp Framework progression model and the key charac-\nteristics of the learning outcomes that have been based on it.\nThe stakeholders involved in the review of the EntreComp regard it as a very compre-\nhensive and broad-based tool with 3 competence areas, 15 competences, 15 de-\nscriptors, 8 proficiency levels and 442 learning outcomes (see Appendix). They\nacknowledge that the EntreComp Framework (i) reflects the complexity of the entrepre-\nneurship competence domain, which touches upon several aspects of our everyday lives,\nand (ii) can be used as a multi-purpose reference guide. The advantage of having a\nbroad yet comprehensive competence framework is that although it can accommodate\nbespoke customisations, it also allows initiatives that tackle entrepreneurship as a com-\npetence to be compared, facilitating a common understanding of what being entrepre-\nneurial means.\nThe comprehensiveness of EntreComp is one of its main assets. However, the reader\nshould bear in mind that not all citizens, learners, or users will be interested in\ndeveloping all the competences here described to the highest level of proficien-\ncy. It is expected that institutions, intermediaries and initiative developers who are\nwilling to adopt EntreComp as a reference framework adapt it to their own purposes and\nto the needs of the user group they intend to target. In other words, the EntreComp\nframework presented in this report should be considered as a starting point. It must be\ntailored to the context of use in order to be implemented (see also below, in Section\n3.2).\n3.1 Progression Model\nEntrepreneurship as a competence is developed through action by individuals or collec-\ntive entities to create value for others.\nThe progression in entrepreneurial learning is made up of two aspects:\n1. Developing increasing autonomy and responsibility in acting upon ideas and op-\nportunities to create value;\n2. Developing the capacity to generate value from simple and predictable contexts\nup to complex, constantly changing environments.\nThe EntreComp Progression Model does not lay down a linear sequence of steps that\nevery citizen must take to become proficiently entrepreneurial or to start-up a venture.\nInstead, it shows that the boundaries of individual and collective entrepreneurial compe-\ntences can be pushed forward, to achieve greater and greater impact through value\ncreating endeavours.\nThe EntreComp Progression Model provides a reference for the development of proficien-\ncy starting from value creation achieved through external support, up to transformative\nvalue creation. It consists of four main levels: Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced and\nExpert. Each level is in turn split into two sub-levels, as illustrated in Table 2. At Founda-\ntion level, entrepreneurial value is created with external support. At Intermediate level,\nentrepreneurial value is created with increasing autonomy. At Advanced level, responsi-\nbility to transform ideas into action is developed. At Expert level, the value created has\nconsiderable impact in its reference domain.\nThese proficiency levels provide a way for the reader to look at the learning outcomes.\nFor instance, the first learning outcome of the 8th proficiency levels is: I can spot and\nquickly take advantage of an opportunity. Although ‘spotting and taking advantage of\nopportunity’ is a skill that learners start developing at lower levels, level 8 emphasises\nthe need to do it ‘quickly’. At this expert level, timeliness in making use of a window of\nopportunity has a strategic importance which can lead to high growth, breakthrough\ninnovation or radical transformation.\nThe EntreComp aims to be comprehensive and to offer a tool that can be adapted to\ndifferent needs. It is not prescriptive and it does not suggest that all learners should\n14\nacquire the highest level of proficiency in the competences, or that they should reach the\nsame proficiency across all the competences. For example, we could imagine designing\nan entrepreneurial learning experience targeted at the employees of the shoe-making\ndistrict of our region. In our programme we could, for instance, aim at an advanced level\nof proficiency in competences like ‘spotting opportunities’\n‘vision’\n,\n,\n‘mobilizing resources’\n,\n‘mobilising others’ and ‘planning and organising’\n. At the same time, we could aim to\nachieve an intermediate level of proficiency in ‘financial and economic literacy’. We could\ndeem it important to provide our learners with the skills to understand the financial\nviability of their ideas, but not important to have them develop double-entry bookkeep-\ning skills, which would require and advanced level of proficiency.\nWe remind the reader that entrepreneurial value creation and entrepreneurial learning\ncan take place in any sphere of life. The EntreComp Progression Model does not refer to\nany specific setting, especially not to formal education settings. By focusing on the de-\nvelopment of competences through the actual creation of entrepreneurial value, the\nprogression model breaks down the boundaries between education, work and civic en-\ngagement. In this respect, the EntreComp Progression Model is transversal to formal,\nnon-formal and informal learning contexts.\n15\nTable 2: EntreComp Progression model\nFoundation Intermediate Advanced Relying on support6 from others Building independence Taking responsibility Under direct super-\nvision.\nWith reduced\nsupport from\nothers, some\nOn my own and\ntogether with my\npeers.\nTaking and\nsharing some\nresponsibilities.\nWith some guidance\nand together with\nothers.\nTaking responsi-\nbility for making\ndecisions and\nautonomy and\ntogether with my\npeers.\nworking with\nothers.\nDiscover Explore Experiment Dare Improve Reinforce Level 1 focuses\nLevel 2 focuses\nLevel 3 focuses on\nLevel 4 focuses\nLevel 5 focuses on\nLevel 6 focuses\nmainly on discover-\ning your qualities,\npotential, interests\nand wishes.

These statements can be designed\nand used for educational planning and curriculum development or for different types of\naccountability such as legal or professional accountability (Prøitz, 2010).\nEntrepreneurial learning can hardly be reduced to fixed pre-specified statements of\nlearning outcomes since it deals with the creation of value that does not exist prior to\nthe entrepreneurial learning process and cannot be foreseen in abstraction.\nHowever, learning outcome statements are considered as crucial to make the framework\nactionable. EntreComp learning outcomes have been developed as references for differ-\nent purposes. They could be used in the formal education and training sector for curricu-\nla design. In a non-formal learning context, they could be used to inspire the creation of\nprogrammes which aim to foster intrapreneurship within existing organisations. They\ncould also be used to guide the definition of tailored pedagogies, assessment methods,\nand learning environments that foster effective entrepreneurial learning.\nThus, EntreComp learning outcomes should not be taken as normative statements to be\ndirectly transposed into actual learning activities, or be used to measure student perfor-\nmance. They are a basis for the development of specific learning outcomes that are fit\nfor the specific context and a basis for the development of performance indicators.\nAlthough the vast majority of learning outcomes have been formulated as ‘I’ statements,\nthis does not mean that Entrepreneurship Competence only refers to the capacity of\nindividuals. On the contrary, the subject of entrepreneurial learning and behaviour can\nbe a group, like a project team, a non-profit organisation, a company, a public body or a\ncivil society movement.\nEntreComp learning outcomes are presented in the Appendix. Though comprehensive,\nthe list of learning outcomes is not exhaustive as it aims to suggest transversal applica-\nbility across educational contexts and application sectors.\n3.3 The EntreComp Framework at a glance: the overview table\nThe EntreComp overview table depicts the 3 areas and all the 15 competences, but\ndevelops them only on the three levels of proficiency that apply to all citizens: the foun-\ndation, intermediate and advanced levels. The expert level by definition captures a level\nof expertise that is beyond average, and more context-dependent and, as a result, it is\nnot detailed in the overview table.\nThe overview table consists of descriptors that capture the essence of the different levels\nof proficiency. Its aim is to provide the general readership with a bird's eye view of the\nEntreComp Framework similar to those presented in the Common European Framework\nof Reference for Languages7 or in the Digital Competence Framework (Ferrari, 2013;\nVuorikari, Punie, Carretero, & Van den Brande, 2016).\n7 http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/cadre1_en.asp\n17\nTable 3: EntreComp Overview\nLevels of proficiency\nArea Competence Foundation Intermediate Advanced\nSpotting opportu-\nLearners8 can find opportunities to\nLearners can recognise opportunities\nLearners can seize and shape oppor-\nnities\ngenerate value for others.\nto address needs that have not been\ntunities to respond to challenges and\nIdeas and opportunities\nmet.\ncreate value for others.\nCreativity Learners can develop multiple ideas\nLearners can test and refine ideas that\nLearners can transform ideas into\nthat create value for others.\ncreate value for others.\nsolutions that create value for others.\nVision Learners can imagine a desirable\nLearners can build an inspiring vision\nLearners can use their vision to guide\nfuture.\nthat engages others.\nstrategic decision-making.\nValuing ideas Learners can understand and appreci-\nLearners understand that ideas can\nLearners can develop strategies to\nate the value of ideas.\nhave different types of value, which\nmake the most of the value generated\ncan be used in different ways.\nby ideas.\nEthical and sus-\nLearners can recognise the impact of\nLearners are driven by ethics and\nLearners act to make sure that their\ntainable thinking\ntheir choices and behaviours, both\nsustainability when making decisions.\nethical and sustainability goals are\nwithin the community and the envi-\nmet.\nronment.\nSelf-awareness\nLearners trust their own ability to\nLearners can make the most of their\nLearners can compensate for their\nResources\nand self-efficacy\ngenerate value for others.\nstrengths and weaknesses.\nweaknesses by teaming up with oth-\ners and by further developing their\nstrengths.\nMotivation and\nLearners want to follow their passion\nLearners are willing to put effort and\nLearners can stay focused on their\nperseverance\nand create value for others.\nresources into following their passion\npassion and keep creating value de-\nand create value for others.\nspite setbacks.\n8 Learner is a broad the term used to indicate the subject of lifelong learning.

Entrepreneurs need to pivot quickly to meet shifting demands; sustainability-minded entrepreneurs also adapt to new environmental or social constraints.\n\n*(You can pick whichever synergy resonates best with your workshop focus.)*\n\n---\n\n## STEP 2: Create a Single “Synergy Slide” (Optional Variation: Two Slides)\n\nUse **one slide** for a quick synergy overview, or **two slides** if you want more room for brief examples and bullet points.\n\n### Slide Title Suggestion\n“**GreenComp & EntreComp: Building Sustainable Entrepreneurial Mindsets**”\n\n### Slide Structure\n1. **Intro Sentence:** A brief statement on why it’s valuable to combine sustainability-oriented thinking (GreenComp) with entrepreneurial competencies (EntreComp).  \n2. **Table or Bullets**: Display 2-3 synergy points (see examples above). For each synergy pair, have a short explanation (1-2 lines) connecting how the two competencies reinforce each other.  \n3. **Benefits**: End with a quick bullet or two on *why* this synergy helps entrepreneurs succeed (e.g., “enhances brand credibility,” “manages risk better,” “aligns with consumer demand for responsible products,” etc.).  \n\n---\n\n## STEP 3: Provide a Concrete “Why It Helps Business” Rationale\n\nExplain briefly that **sustainability-minded entrepreneurs**:  \n- Often see **new opportunities** first (e.g., green markets, ethical consumer segments).  \n- Build **resilience** (less likely to be blindsided by regulatory or resource changes).  \n- Attract **employee and customer loyalty** by demonstrating purpose and fairness.  \n\n---\n\n## SAMPLE SLIDE CONTENT\n\nBelow is a **single-slide** example with synergy points. Adapt the text and format to your style and branding:\n\n---\n\n### **Slide: “GreenComp & EntreComp: Building Sustainable Entrepreneurial Mindsets”**\n\n**GreenComp & EntreComp – A Powerful Mix**\n\n- **Valuing Sustainability (GC 1.1)** \\+ **Ethical & Sustainable Thinking (EC 1.5)**  \n  \\- *Both emphasize long-term impacts on people and planet.*  \n  \\- Entrepreneurs who adopt these mindsets weigh the social/environmental consequences of their ideas from day one, leading to more trustworthy brands and responsible innovation.\n\n- **Systems Thinking (GC 2.1)** \\+ **Spotting Opportunities (EC 1.1)**  \n  \\- *Both require seeing the “big picture.”*  \n  \\- Entrepreneurs scan markets for new opportunities, while also recognizing interconnected environmental or social factors. This broader lens can reveal hidden niches or unmet needs.\n\n- **Adaptability (GC 3.2)** \\+ **Coping With Uncertainty (EC 3.3)**  \n  \\- *Both focus on navigating change and ambiguity.*  \n  \\- By staying flexible and open-minded—especially in rapidly shifting global contexts—entrepreneurs can pivot, innovate, and thrive under pressure.\n\n**Why Does It Matter for Business?**\n- **Reduced Risks**: Anticipate regulation changes or resource constraints.  \n- **Customer Loyalty**: Consumers increasingly value responsible brands.  \n- **Innovation**: Sustainability constraints often spark original ideas and solutions.  \n\n“**Aligning GreenComp and EntreComp mindsets** helps entrepreneurs create viable businesses that not only succeed financially but also contribute to a healthier, more equitable future.”\n\n---\n\n## Final Tips\n\n1. **Use Real Examples**: If you have time, mention a local startup or global brand that used a sustainability lens to spot a winning opportunity or build resilience.  \n2. **Keep It Brief**: This synergy slide is a connector, not a complete lesson. A short bullet format often works best.  \n3. **Relate to Your Workshop Flow**: Introduce this synergy either right after discussing entrepreneurial competencies or just before you delve into sustainability mindsets, so participants see the seamless connection.  \n\nThis **step-by-step** approach—with an optional **synergy slide**—will help participants recognize that **developing sustainability mindsets** (per GreenComp) **enhances** entrepreneurial success (per EntreComp).",

How are you doing today? \nThe session today will be a bit lighter than the others. We want to make sure that we are not giving you too much work or overwhelming you before the pitch. Although this wont be a heavy session, we will cover very important points that all entrepreneurs should know about in this context we are operating in. \n\n\nUnderstand how having the proper mindset can increase the odds of entrepreneurial success.\n\nPractice fixed vs growth mindsets.\n\nLearn how to develop a growth mindset.\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE MINDSETS?\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nA mindset is a way of thinking—a belief that shapes how we see ourselves, others, and the world. Our beliefs determine our behaviors and drive our attitude toward daily challenges. \nEntrepreneurs often rely on mindsets that help them overcome obstacles and keep going in tough times. \nThe right mindset can have a huge positive impact on the people around you—customers, employees, and partners.\nOur goal for this session is to discuss a few that we believe in and want to work on. Entrepreneurs generally have these mindsets as they look to overcome obstacles.\n\nAsk: Why do mindsets matter?\nPotential answers:\nHaving a good mindset can keep you going when times are rough\nA good mindset can have a positive affect on others around you including employees and customers\nA growth mindset keeps you open to possibilities (e.g., new markets, new partnerships).\nMindsets play a role in determining your future. \nWhen you limit yourself in your mind, you will put up barriers for yourself. \nWhen you think you can do something and embrace possibilities, it is easier for you to push yourself, try new things, and conquer barriers.\nEtc…\n\nRecap: \nYour mindset plays a critical role in how you deal with challenges. \nPeople with a growth mindset tend to be more resilient and persevere despite setbacks—qualities that are crucial for entrepreneurs. \u000b\n\n\n\nHOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF?\nDo I believe in myself? \nDo I accept and welcome myself?\nDo I appreciate who I am?\nDo I respect, love, and support myself?\n\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nA good starting point to improve your interpersonal communication is to reflect on how you actually see and communicate with yourself. \n\nBe aware of what you’re saying to yourself. You might be surprised at just how often you put yourself down. The important piece of this step is to be non-judgmental. If you’re already calling yourself dumb, or saying you’ll never be able to accomplish a certain thing, or you aren’t the right person, how will anyone else believe that you are/can?! Judging yourself is the farthest thing from helpful.\nDo you believe in the product and your company?\nYou should! Why would you all be working so hard?!\nFacts are facts. You went to the market did research to find out what problems your customers were actually facing, and you designed and tested it for them! If this is true, the product isn’t the problem.\nIf you don’t believe in the product, that’s your first problem and you should work on that. \nDo you think that your company is good? Is there a place for it in this world?\nThink about all the good stuff you are planning and how you intend to expand! You should believe in the vision.\n\nThe number one thing that’s stops people from achieving their goals is themselves! So, the next big question is: \nDo you believe in yourself?\nThis is the one that stops people!\nYou can have the best product in the world, but we sabotage ourselves!\nWe are often focused on the challenges\n4\n\n“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.” \n\n-Christopher Robin, \nPooh’s Grand Adventure\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nYou are the only one putting limits on your capabilities. You are the only one who will stop yourself from succeeding. Five One Labs has accepted you into this incubator because WE BELIEVE in your product and your business and in YOU! You just have to believe in yourself. \n\n5\n\nWHAT MINDSETS ARE NECESSARY \u000bFOR ENTREPRENEURS?\nDecisiveness\nConfidence\nResilience\nHumility\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What mindsets are necessary for entrepreneurs? Why?\nPotential answers:\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts freely, but make sure to touch on some of the points below as well!\nDecisiveness: To succeed as an entrepreneur, you must gain the ability to look at a problem or situation, digest all available data (at that point in time), and make a confident decision to move forward. Your ability as a decision-maker will make or break your future successes. In fact, at the opposite end, indecision is one of the greatest causes of business failure. When you can’t decide what to do, you delay taking action. In other words, you do nothing. Think about how many dreams (and businesses) failing to take action has killed.\nConfidence: It is essential that you get used to the uncomfortable feeling of knowing that you don't know what you’re doing, but you should act like you do! Whether it's getting on stage to speak, launching your product, or learning how to start a blog and publishing your ideas to the world, we tend to see others doing it and incorrectly assume they've always been good at it. They weren't born knowing how to speak confidently, launch successful products, or write excellent books. They also weren't born knowing how to become entrepreneurs. \nAccountability: The entrepreneurial mindset comes from taking responsibility for your actions and outcomes. From this moment forward, you must accept responsibility for everything in your life and hold yourself accountable to it. Sorry to tell you, but nobody cares how little time, money, or external support you have to accomplish your goals. Your circumstances may not be your fault, but they are your responsibility. All that matters is what you are doing RIGHT NOW to find your success. There are no more excuses. Accountability is required of entrepreneurs as well as successful employees. Stop passing the buck and blaming others. Hold yourself accountable – even when you aren’t to blame – and take action to fix the problem.\nResilience: As an entrepreneur, you will need to learn to deal with making mistakes and failing. They are inevitable and a part of your growth. If every misstep plummets you into self-doubt, you have to change the way you look at being wrong. This mindset shift takes resilience and is foundational to the entrepreneurial mindset. Success rarely happens in a straight line. Taking wrong turns and making mistakes is something that happens to everyone. Resilience isn’t only helpful when dealing with catastrophic mistakes. It’s a way to handle the small, simple decisions you’ve made that didn’t turn out right. “The only people who don’t make mistakes are the ones who don’t do anything.” \nHumility: Humility is freedom from pride or arrogance, and it ties all of the characteristics of entrepreneurship. Humility will keep you focused and centered (especially while being confident and decisive). Along with humility comes coachability — the ability to be coached. If you want to accomplish big things in life, you need to be willing to learn from others and nourish a growth mindset. To do big things, you need to grow. To grow, you need to learn. Thinking like an entrepreneur means seeking out mentors and coaches who have been where you are trying to go — and having the humility to accept their guidance.\nFairness: Recognize that your decisions can impact customers, teams, and the environment. Strive for equity and justice in how you operate.\nhttps://hacktheentrepreneur.com/entrepreneurial-mindset/\n\nRecap: An entrepreneurial mindset is a way of thinking that enables you to overcome challenges, be decisive, and accept responsibility for your outcomes. It is a constant need to improve your skills, learn from your mistakes, and take continuous action on your ideas. Anyone willing to do the work can develop an entrepreneurial mindset. \n\n6\n\nFIXED MINDSET\nGROWTH MINDSET\n“Failure is the limit of my abilities”\n“I give up easily”\n“My potential is predetermined”\n“My intelligence is static”\n“I avoid challenges”\n“I will never improve”\n“Failures offer opportunity”\n“I like to try new things”\n“I can learn to do what I want”\n“My intelligence can be develped”\n“I keep trying”\n“my mistakes will help me grow”\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe are going to go deeper in this session from the perspective of 2 main type of mindsets.\nThis is something we have noticed in various people that we’ve worked with and those in our friendship group. That some people have a fixed mindset and others have a growth mindset.\n\nA fixed mindset is a belief that your intelligence, talent and personality are inherently fixed and unchanging. In other words, you have a certain amount and nothing can change it. The ultimate desire in an individual with a fixed mindset is to be the best and to be seen as talented and perfect. This leads them to need constant validation and they seek to prove themselves over and over. Failure is simply not an option and they are extremely sensitive about making mistakes and being wrong. In the event that they do fail, they instantly become discouraged, give up and label themselves a ‘failure’. They avoid new challenges and will not risk doing anything that might expose their weaknesses and flaws.\n\nA growth mindset is the belief that your intelligence, talent and personality can be developed and cultivated through your actions. They believe that by learning and through constant practice, anyone can do anything. Their desire to become a better person fuels their passion to grow, take risks and do new things and they thrive on being challenged. For them, feedback is essential and provides them with constructive evidence to improve their performance and develop their abilities. In the event of failure, they see the setback.\n\n\n\nMINDSET MAP\nMap Practice and discussion: 10 minutes  \n\nPractice the mindset map with the entrepreneurs and show them the differences between the fixed and growth mindsets. Create a discussion among each one with them to better understand \n\nHOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nHave a discussion with the entrepreneurs on how to develop a growth mindset. Try to write down all the answers on the white board.\nAsk: How can you develop your growth mindset? What are actions you can take right now? \nPotential answers:\nBe aware of limiting behaviors and mindsets:\nYou believe life is permanent. The scarcity mentality sees life as fixed and unchangeable. It’s not seeing things as they truly are – temporary – and instead believing “that’s just the way it is and always will be.” An abundance mentality sees life as dynamic, malleable and in constant flux. Money comes and goes. Opportunities continually present themselves. Good and bad times will pass.\nYou use the language of lack. Do you find yourself using the following phrases often? “I can’t, I don’t have enough, I’ll just go without, I don’t need much.” Instead, experiment with the language of prosperity. “I always have more than enough, I can always find/earn more, there’s plenty.” \nYou hold on to things. Keeping items well past their useful point, food, clothes, shoes, trinkets, tools, gadgets…who knows what else. Get rid of things you don’t need – this creates the mindset that you can have more! \nYou have difficulty receiving. You have trouble accepting compliments or gifts, you’re uncomfortable with someone paying your way, and you feel like you have to even the score immediately.  If you cannot graciously receive then you mistakenly believe that when someone gives you something, they must have “lost” something in return. This is NOT how giving and receiving works. It’s scarcity mentality. \nYou make small gestures of lack. Under tipping, underestimating, shortchanging yourself or others. When you make small demonstrations of lack, you are keeping yourself from receiving more in life. If you believe in lack, not matter how small your actions may be, your life will mirror those same beliefs back to you.\nhttps://justwaybetter.com/2014/07/08/scarcity-vs-abundance-mindset/\nMake a conscious decision to shift from a limited mindset. Here are some ideas: \n1. Say ‘both’. When faced with a situation that you’d normally look at as ‘either-or’, try saying ‘both’. Should you get the new shed, or the new lawnmower? Both! Can you afford the new bag or just the new shoes. Both! Just saying ‘both’ makes it possible, and gets the creativity flowing (see #5 below).\n2. Say thank you when you receive a compliment. Don’t dismiss, deflect or try to quickly reciprocate – just accept a compliment as the gift that it is. Giving is a win-win. When you won’t accept a compliment, you make it lose-lose.\n3. Give or throw your old stuff away. Clothes are an easy one. Fill a trash bag with clothes you never wear and drop them at a clothing bin.\n4. Catch yourself when you say “I don’t have the time/money”. Be mindful that you always find the time and money for the things that are important – it’s a matter of priorities. Don’t delude yourself in small ways in speech and thought. Start to speak differently, and you’ll see your thinking start to change.\n5. Think of in terms of more. Instead of spending time figuring out how to save, skimp, or otherwise ‘afford’ the things you want, you could try spending that creative energy coming up with a way to make more money. Assuming you have a fixed income assumes you have maxed out your value to the world, and that you have no further ability to contribute or improve your skills. That’s literally a poor approach. Ask for that well overdue raise, sell some of your many things, try a small side business, optimize your investments, cut out wasteful spending (different than skimping), or all of the above. You might surprise yourself. It’s amazing what arises just by thinking differently.\n\nRecognize limiting beliefs: (“I can’t,” “I don’t have enough,” “There’s no opportunity here”).\nShift from scarcity to possibility: Instead of “We’ll run out of resources,” consider “How can we adapt or create solutions that respect those limits and still grow?”\nPractice self-encouragement: Celebrate progress, not just outcomes.\nTry new approaches: Adopt exploratory thinking—test small experiments, learn quickly, and iterate.\nReflect on impact: Ask, “How do my decisions affect the community, the environment, or future opportunities?”\n\n\nRecap: Practice thinking in abundance. Abundance applies to a lot more than money or material things, it applies to the really important things like time, opportunity, experiences, happiness and love. If you find that you have a scarcity mentality, it’s okay!  Most of us do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nPROCESS-FOCUSED\n“Success is a journey, not a destination”\n- Arthur Ashe\nLecture: 3 minutes  \n\nWe’ve all heard the saying, ‘Success is a journey, not a destination.’ This means that the process is more important than the outcome. Of course we all want to achieve success, but a fixation on the end-result, can lead to stress and fear of failure. It is most important for fixed mindset individuals to look good and be the best, so they often avoid taking action in case they fail. Tony Robbins calls this the ‘pain-pleasure’ syndrome. They will do more to avoid the pain of failure than they will to achieve the pleasure of success.\nHowever, the opposite is true of people with a growth mindset. They also want to achieve their desired outcome, but they understand that it is a process, which requires practice, effort and motivation. Their success is often a by-product of their dedication to the craft, whether it be a sport, business or a relationship.\nEncourage your entrepreneurs to celebrate the small wins along the way to achieving the end goal. Teach them the process behind the skill and provide them with the opportunity to practice, get feedback and ask questions.\n\nFocusing only on the end can create pressure and fear of failure.\nProcess includes consistent learning, refining ideas, and noticing how each choice affects your team, your customers, and—even in small ways—your broader environment.\nPeople with a growth mindset value continuous improvement. They pivot when things don’t work and adapt their approach.\nCelebrate small wins. Recognize that small positive changes can add up—like improving workflow efficiency or finding new ways to reduce waste.\n\n\n10\n\nPRAISE EFFORT\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nDweck’s research showed that ability can be developed through sheer effort and hard work, as opposed to natural talent. This is the key principle behind the concept of the growth mindset. However, most children are praised for their achievements by parents and educators, and rewards are given for attainment not effort.\nIn a growth mindset culture, praise and feedback is given for hard work and effort, not just for talent and ability. This means that in the training room, entrepreneurs should be praised for their willingness to try and for giving their best effort in every task, not purely on the outcome they achieve.\n\n11\n\nEMBRACE THE CHALLENGE\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nJ.K. Rowling’s first Harry Potter book was rejected by 12 publishers before it was eventually accepted and published. But she never gave up and the book went on the sell over 4oo million copies.\nSo create a safe learning environment which is conducive to the entrepreneurs trying new things, taking risks and pushing beyond their comfort zone. Encourage them to learn from their mistakes and use failure and setbacks as an opportunity to grow. Teach them the difference between ‘I am a failure’ and ‘I failed’, and instill the need to manage their motivation and keep moving forwards.\n\n12\n\nBE INSPIRED\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nPeople with a fixed mindset feel threatened by the success of others. However, in growth mindset individuals, the success of others is a massive source of inspiration for them personally, and they love to see others being successful.\nWho inspires you? It might be a person (famous or not, alive or dead), or it could be an organization. Think about why they inspire you. How can you use them as a key source of inspiration in your own life? For example, one of my hero’s in the context of creativity is Walt Disney. So whenever I am working on a creative project, I ask, ‘What would Walt do?’\n\n13\n\nPRACTICE, PRACTICE AND PRACTICE\nLecture: 3 minutes \n\nIt takes consistent practice, patience and persistence to reach the level of mastery in anything – there are no quick fixes. Remember the 10,000 hours principle? The process of learning does not stop at the end of the training day. In fact, that’s when the real learning begins as entrepreneurs begin to apply their skills in their everyday work. Therefore, it is important that the entrepreneurs understand the need for consistent practice in order to embed the learning and to develop their proficiency. Create a mechanism to provide post-training support in the form of follow-up emails, webinars, online courses etc. Proactively encourage your entrepreneurs to feedback their progress, successes and failures in order that you can provide them with continuous development and inspiration into the future.\n\n14\n\nKEEP MOVING FORWARD!\nFailure is often inevitable, but if we learn to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn, improve, and then get back up again, we're more likely to succeed in future attempts.\n\nLearn that it's alright to fail as long as you don't give up or quit.\n\u000b\n15\n\nHOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE!\nBerries.com\n40 minutes : Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nLet's not make a list of what we want to do, but rather, who we want to be! These are ways to be, not things to do. A goal is a destination; we can arrive there and yet be unsatisfied, feeling unsure where to go next. Values are like directions on the compass; we always know which way to travel. They define \"how: we want to live our lives. Of course our goals and reactions matter very much, but they are always more powerful when they are driven by our values. Our values express the states we essentially want to be in. Every action, large or small, can be an expression of what matters to us.\nLet's create a Vision Board or a journal to communicate and track WHO WE WANT TO BE! All your visions and goals should be in line with this. \n\n25 minutes: Activity \nAsk entrepreneurs to  create their Vision Board to communicate all their vision and goals to themselves that they can reflect on a daily basis. This should clearly communicate what they want in life to achieve on that board especially their goals for their businesses!\nIndividual work: On flipcharts, slides, or a video, map out your vision and goals. Include not just business milestones but also the values you want to live - how you want to be fair, resourceful, or mindful of social/environmental impacts.\nTool: PowerPoint, flipchart paper or any other medium would work. It could even be a video or slideshow they watch every morning. \n\n10 minutes: Share\nShow your Vision Board if you like. Notice if your brand, mission, and actions all align. Sometimes entrepreneurs discover they care about sustainability or social fairness and can incorporate that into their next steps.\n16\n\n\nTHANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US\n17]]]",

Money comes and goes. Opportunities continually present themselves. Good and bad times will pass.\nYou use the language of lack. Do you find yourself using the following phrases often? “I can’t, I don’t have enough, I’ll just go without, I don’t need much.” Instead, experiment with the language of prosperity. “I always have more than enough, I can always find/earn more, there’s plenty.” \nYou hold on to things. Keeping items well past their useful point, food, clothes, shoes, trinkets, tools, gadgets…who knows what else. Get rid of things you don’t need – this creates the mindset that you can have more! \nYou have difficulty receiving. You have trouble accepting compliments or gifts, you’re uncomfortable with someone paying your way, and you feel like you have to even the score immediately.  If you cannot graciously receive then you mistakenly believe that when someone gives you something, they must have “lost” something in return. This is NOT how giving and receiving works. It’s scarcity mentality. \nYou make small gestures of lack. Under tipping, underestimating, shortchanging yourself or others. When you make small demonstrations of lack, you are keeping yourself from receiving more in life. If you believe in lack, not matter how small your actions may be, your life will mirror those same beliefs back to you.\nhttps://justwaybetter.com/2014/07/08/scarcity-vs-abundance-mindset/\nMake a conscious decision to shift from a limited mindset. Here are some ideas: \n1. Say ‘both’. When faced with a situation that you’d normally look at as ‘either-or’, try saying ‘both’. Should you get the new shed, or the new lawnmower? Both! Can you afford the new bag or just the new shoes. Both! Just saying ‘both’ makes it possible, and gets the creativity flowing (see #5 below).\n2. Say thank you when you receive a compliment. Don’t dismiss, deflect or try to quickly reciprocate – just accept a compliment as the gift that it is. Giving is a win-win. When you won’t accept a compliment, you make it lose-lose.\n3. Give or throw your old stuff away. Clothes are an easy one. Fill a trash bag with clothes you never wear and drop them at a clothing bin.\n4. Catch yourself when you say “I don’t have the time/money”. Be mindful that you always find the time and money for the things that are important – it’s a matter of priorities. Don’t delude yourself in small ways in speech and thought. Start to speak differently, and you’ll see your thinking start to change.\n5. Think of in terms of more. Instead of spending time figuring out how to save, skimp, or otherwise ‘afford’ the things you want, you could try spending that creative energy coming up with a way to make more money. Assuming you have a fixed income assumes you have maxed out your value to the world, and that you have no further ability to contribute or improve your skills. That’s literally a poor approach. Ask for that well overdue raise, sell some of your many things, try a small side business, optimize your investments, cut out wasteful spending (different than skimping), or all of the above. You might surprise yourself. It’s amazing what arises just by thinking differently.\n\nRecognize limiting beliefs: (“I can’t,” “I don’t have enough,” “There’s no opportunity here”).\nShift from scarcity to possibility: Instead of “We’ll run out of resources,” consider “How can we adapt or create solutions that respect those limits and still grow?”\nPractice self-encouragement: Celebrate progress, not just outcomes.\nTry new approaches: Adopt exploratory thinking—test small experiments, learn quickly, and iterate.\nReflect on impact: Ask, “How do my decisions affect the community, the environment, or future opportunities?”\n\n\nRecap: Practice thinking in abundance. Abundance applies to a lot more than money or material things, it applies to the really important things like time, opportunity, experiences, happiness and love. If you find that you have a scarcity mentality, it’s okay!  Most of us do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\nfor the slide that says HOW TO DEVELOP YOUR GROWTH MINDSET?",

Of course we all want to achieve success, but a fixation on the end-result, can lead to stress and fear of failure. It is most important for fixed mindset individuals to look good and be the best, so they often avoid taking action in case they fail. Tony Robbins calls this the ‘pain-pleasure’ syndrome. They will do more to avoid the pain of failure than they will to achieve the pleasure of success.\nHowever, the opposite is true of people with a growth mindset. They also want to achieve their desired outcome, but they understand that it is a process, which requires practice, effort and motivation. Their success is often a by-product of their dedication to the craft, whether it be a sport, business or a relationship.\nEncourage your entrepreneurs to celebrate the small wins along the way to achieving the end goal. Teach them the process behind the skill and provide them with the opportunity to practice, get feedback and ask questions.\n\nFocusing only on the end can create pressure and fear of failure.\nProcess includes consistent learning, refining ideas, and noticing how each choice affects your team, your customers, and—even in small ways—your broader environment.\nPeople with a growth mindset value continuous improvement. They pivot when things don’t work and adapt their approach.\nCelebrate small wins. Recognize that small positive changes can add up—like improving workflow efficiency or finding new ways to reduce waste.\n\n\" and after it is about praising effort. so it's all about growth mindset with this as an intermission, maybe it should be moved or rephrased or what can we do?

      "content": "You're right that it feels like an intermission rather than a natural flow from the growth mindset discussion. Since the surrounding slides are about developing a growth mindset, effort, and process, this slide should reinforce that rather than feeling like a separate list of new mindsets.  \n\n### **Options to Improve Flow:**  \n1. **Rephrase the Title for Continuity**  \n   Instead of making it feel like a brand-new concept, tie it back to the growth mindset.  \n   - **\"How Growth Mindsets Shape Business Success\"**  \n   - **\"Applying a Growth Mindset to Your Business\"**  \n   - **\"Bringing Growth Mindset Into Action\"**  \n\n2. **Frame It as an Extension of Growth Mindset Principles**  \n   The content on the slide is valuable, but instead of making it feel like an unrelated set of principles, frame it as *what a growth mindset enables in business*—essentially, *if you develop a growth mindset, these are the skills that will emerge*.  \n   \n   Example:  \n   - **Opportunity Spotting:** A growth mindset helps you see challenges as opportunities.  \n   - **Systems Thinking:** Growth-focused entrepreneurs understand how their actions shape the bigger picture.  \n   - **Adaptability:** A growth mindset lets you pivot and adjust rather than give up.  \n   - **Values-Driven Leadership:** With a growth mindset, you lead with integrity, learning from failures and refining your vision.  \n\n3. **Reposition the Slide in the Flow**  \n   If it still feels out of place, consider moving it:  \n   - **After \"Process Focused\" but before \"Praise Effort\"** → This way, it follows naturally from process-focused learning and leads into the idea that growth requires continuous effort.  \n   - **As a Summary Slide Before Closing** → Frame it as: \"When you apply a growth mindset in business, here’s what it looks like.\"  \n\n4. **Facilitation Notes for Better Integration:**  \n   - \"Now that we've discussed how to build a growth mindset, let's talk about how it plays out in business.\"  \n   - \"A growth mindset isn't just about personal improvement—it directly impacts how you build and sustain a business.\"  \n   - \"These are the ways a growth mindset shows up in successful entrepreneurs.\"  \n\nWould this kind of reframing help make it feel more cohesive?",

      "content": "### **How Does a Growth Mindset Help Systems Thinking?**\nA **growth mindset** supports **systems thinking** by encouraging **learning, iteration, and seeing connections between parts of a system rather than just focusing on immediate outcomes.** Here’s how:\n\n#### **1. Seeing Interconnectedness Instead of Silos**\n- A **fixed mindset** often leads people to focus only on **immediate success or failure**—isolating individual actions instead of seeing **how different elements interact**.\n- A **growth mindset** encourages people to **step back** and ask:  \n  - *How do my decisions affect the bigger picture?*  \n  - *How does solving this one problem impact other areas of my business, team, or community?*\n\n#### **2. Continuous Learning in Complex Environments**\n- Systems **change over time**, and a **growth mindset helps entrepreneurs embrace adaptation**.  \n- Instead of assuming a business or market will stay the same, entrepreneurs with a growth mindset:  \n  - Learn from **feedback loops**—adjusting strategies as they see how their actions ripple out.  \n  - Accept that **unexpected challenges** are normal and part of the system, not just failures.  \n\n#### **3. Testing Small Changes & Iterating**\n- A **fixed mindset** often leads to a fear of experimenting—people hesitate to test things because they think **they have to get it right the first time**.  \n- A **growth mindset** fosters **experimentation**, allowing entrepreneurs to:  \n  - **Prototype solutions** and tweak them based on system-wide feedback.  \n  - **Understand cause and effect** by tracking how one action influences another.  \n  - **Adapt business models based on changing inputs** (customer needs, environmental factors, supply chain issues).  \n\n#### **4. Embracing Uncertainty Instead of Seeking Control**\n- Systems are **not always predictable**—a growth mindset helps people **become comfortable with uncertainty** and **stay curious instead of reactive**.  \n- Instead of saying *“This isn’t working, let’s quit,”* a growth mindset asks:  \n  - *What part of the system is influencing this outcome?*  \n  - *What happens if we adjust one variable at a time?*  \n  - *How does our business fit into larger economic, social, or environmental contexts?*  \n\n### **Example in Practice**\n🚀 **Imagine an entrepreneur launching a sustainable packaging startup:**  \n- A **fixed mindset** would say: *“Customers aren’t buying as much as I expected. Maybe my product isn’t good enough.”*  \n- A **growth mindset with systems thinking** would say:  \n  - *“Are customers aware of the sustainability benefits?”*  \n  - *“What role does price play? What about distribution challenges?”*  \n  - *“How does this fit into broader supply chain trends?”*  \n  - *“What if I tweak one factor—would the whole system adjust?”*  \n\n---\n\n### **How to Bring This Into the Slide?**\nTo **reinforce this connection**, the **Systems Thinking** section on the slide could be reworded slightly:  \n\n#### **Before:**  \n*\"Our business decisions affect our team, customers, and community.\"*  \n\n#### **After:**  \n*\"A growth mindset helps us see the bigger picture—how each decision influences our team, customers, and the world around us.\"*  \n\nThis small tweak makes it **clear that growth mindset enables systems thinking**, rather than just listing them side by side. Would this version work better for you?",
