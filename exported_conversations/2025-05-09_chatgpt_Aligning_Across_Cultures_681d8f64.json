When I talk about a relational orientation to truth, I mean understanding truth through relationships—between people, communities, and the environment. In many indigenous worldviews, truth isn’t a fixed point but emerges from the dynamic interaction and balance between all living things. It's not that they don't care about what's real; it's that reality is understood as fundamentally interconnected and co-created.\\n\\nFor example, in many indigenous cultures, knowledge is passed down through stories, ceremonies, and lived experiences that emphasize the interconnectedness of all life. This contrasts with a purely empirical approach that seeks to isolate variables and find universal laws. The relational approach values context, ongoing relationships, and the idea that truth is something lived and experienced collectively rather than abstractly defined.\\n\\nBeyond the three pillars we've discussed, there are other philosophical traditions and perspectives that consider what is real or true. For instance, African philosophies like Ubuntu emphasize a relational ontology, where a person is a person through other people—meaning identity and truth are deeply embedded in community and relationships.\\n\\nIn terms of other frameworks, existentialist philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre focus on individual freedom and responsibility in creating meaning. Phenomenology, as explored by Edmund Husserl and later Maurice Merleau-Ponty, looks at the structures of experience and consciousness, suggesting that our perception of truth is always filtered through our lived experience.\\n\\nYes, we're all biological creatures, but the way we interpret and give meaning to our experiences varies greatly due to culture, history, and environment. This diversity in worldview shapes what we consider important, how we seek knowledge, and what we accept as truth.\\n\\nSo, incorporating a more balanced approach means acknowledging these diverse ways of knowing and being open to multiple forms of truth.

Is that sort of like you are, let's say that it's pitch black, and then you have a thousand laser pointers pointing at a sphere. Suddenly the sphere, even though you don't ever see the sphere, you just see the reflections off of the sphere, you can see that there's a sphere. And similarly, when you're in a sensory deprivation tank, it's really hard to sense the contours of your body. It's actually the world that is informing you of you, the wind on your skin, the pressure in your tendons against each other, and the proprioceptive awareness. And also, when you think of yourself, you often think of your relationships, even your relationships to other ideas, and so it's like a tensegrity, this idea that you don't actually independently exist, you exist in a relational way to all of these things. And so that really makes sense across all of these different traditions, and I don't see them as different ways and modes of accessing truth, it's just a reality. So this reality also even sounds like phenomenology a little bit, that we are always not just sensing truth, but we're sensing our selves in its relationship, right? Like the other part of the tensegrity is the part that is connected to us, and so there is a self, but there also is a non-self, like the self would completely collapse without the other, and so there's this tension I think that emerges that kind of shows these things, but at the same time, all of these things are real, right? Like if you think of the analogy of the tensegrity or the body as a tensegrity system, tendons are real, bones are real, the air against my skin is real, but it is relationship that all of these things become a real illusion of a complete individual self, right? So how does this change our thinking about the fact that there is something both true and real that might be relational and subjective in the personal, but that there is something that we can say about the real, and what are the things about the real that is about the common pattern of tensegrity systems, right? Like people's skeletal systems are generally the same. We can conduct medicine on people, doing tests mostly on men, and it usually works for women as well, even though it's not perfect, but the fact that it kind of works shows that there is some non-subjective reality that we're a part of, right?

This aligns closely with phenomenology, where our experience of the world is always shaped by our embodied and situated perspective.\\n\\nRecognizing this doesn\\'t mean we abandon the idea of objective or shared truths.

This means recognizing that qualities like beauty, goodness, and a sense of meaning are not just subjective whims but are integral aspects of human experience that can be systematically observed, described, and even measured in certain ways.\\n\\nFor instance, we could develop methodologies that capture these qualitative dimensions through phenomenological studies, which focus on the lived experience of individuals, or through integrative frameworks that combine subjective reports with objective measures of their impact on well-being and decision-making.\\n\\nBringing quality perception into scientific discourse could involve creating a lexicon and set of metrics that respect the subjective while grounding it in observable patterns. For example, if a large number of people consistently report a sense of meaning or beauty in certain environments or actions, and this correlates with measurable positive outcomes, we can start to treat these qualitative experiences as integral parts of our understanding of reality.\\n\\nBy framing these qualitative elements as part of a foundational \"base layer\" of reality—one that is cross-culturally recognized and experientially validated—we can start to integrate these dimensions into a rigorous scientific framework.
