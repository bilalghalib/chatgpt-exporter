      "content": "can you fix this prompt: Can you return it as a table and then make a table comparing it side by side with our current 5 day +1 table with two additional columns for similarities and differences? and then can you make a table just for the core learning objectives for the day that we can give to people as the frame, what are the different elements we want to be sure htey understand by the end of the day. It might help to start with this first so we can be sure there's a comprehensive, and clear flow. We would need a higher level objective for the whole training, what's the goal, what will they learn, why is it useful, and then we essentially break it down day by day, and then we can have the day by day overview \n\nand then the table with the previous version, this version and a column for similarities and differnces ",

      "content": "Here’s a cleaned-up and structured version of your prompt that’s clearer, more actionable, and better sequenced for a collaborator or AI to follow:\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt: Training Module Table Comparison and Learning Objectives Design**\n\nCan you help me rework and compare training content using the following steps?\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1: Define the Overall Training Objective**\nStart by drafting a **high-level objective** for the full 5+1 day training. Include:\n- **What** the participants will learn  \n- **Why** it's valuable or relevant in their context  \n- **How** it connects to real-life application or opportunities  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Core Daily Learning Objectives**\nCreate a **new table** that breaks the training into days, with a **clear and comprehensive list of learning objectives** for each day. This table should be:\n- Simple and actionable  \n- Usable as a framing tool for participants  \n- Focused on **what participants should understand or be able to do by the end of each day**  \n\nSuggested columns:\n- Day #\n- Theme or Topic\n- Core Learning Objectives (bulleted if helpful)\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Overview Table of the Revised 5+1 Day Plan**\nBased on the above, generate a **daily overview table** of the revised training plan (same format as before). Include:\n- Day #\n- Title / Topic\n- Key activities or content\n- Tools or methods used\n- Notes\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Side-by-Side Comparison Table**\nCreate a **comparison table** between:\n- The previous version of the 5+1 day training\n- The updated version (based on new insights)\n\nAdd **two extra columns** for:\n- **Similarities** (what stayed the same or has continuity)\n- **Differences** (what changed and why, if possible)\n\nSuggested columns:\n- Day #\n- Previous Plan (title + content)\n- Revised Plan (title + content)\n- Similarities\n- Differences\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to generate a scaffold for any of these tables.",
