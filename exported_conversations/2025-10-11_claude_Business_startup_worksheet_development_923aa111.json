  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user requested an update to their comprehensive Excel workbook for an insulation training program, asking Claude to enhance it with all the research and insights developed throughout their project. They wanted the workbook to serve dual purposes: as a training tool during the course and as a practical business management system afterward. The user specifically requested features including assessment pages for home problem areas, cost savings calculations, supplier lists, receipt pages, and other business tools to help trainees start insulation businesses.\n\nClaude created a sophisticated 9-tab Excel workbook called \"Mosul Insulation Business Workbook\" that integrates all the training materials and business requirements. The workbook includes: Customer Intelligence System (CRM with auto-generating IDs), Energy Analysis Engine (using proper Iraqi tariff bands of 5/10/15 IQD per kWh instead of flat rates), Solution Designer Pro (material selection with phased retrofit approach), Quote Generator Excellence (with Install-First Pay-Later payment terms), Project Command Center (pipeline management), Supplier Intelligence Hub (with Mosul-specific suppliers pre-loaded), Diagnostic Excellence Tools (featuring the 4 Comfort Factors assessment framework), Financial Control Tower (revenue and expense tracking), and Innovation Laboratory (for testing new products and techniques).\n\nThe workbook incorporates key training elements including the Second Floor Comfort Test (Omar's ≤3°C benchmark for success), quality checklists that explicitly warn against using expired materials or \"zift\" (old bitumen), green wall supplements as a 5,000 IQD low-cost option, and a systematic phased approach prioritizing air sealing, then roof, then walls. Claude implemented 124 formulas with error handling to ensure the workbook functions properly even with empty cells, used color-coding (blue for user inputs, black for automatic calculations), and created cross-tab integration so data entered once populates throughout the system. The user also received a comprehensive 30-page user guide explaining how each tab works, training integration schedules, and best practices for daily business operations.\n\n**Tool Knowledge**\n\nClaude used the xlsx skill to create a complex Excel workbook with advanced formatting and formula integration. The openpyxl library proved effective for creating professional spreadsheets with multiple worksheets, custom styling including PatternFill for background colors, Font objects for text formatting, and Border objects for cell borders. When implementing formulas, Claude discovered that IFERROR functions are essential for template workbooks to handle empty cells gracefully, preventing #DIV/0! and #N/A errors that would appear before users enter data. The recalc.py script at /mnt/skills/public/xlsx/recalc.py successfully processed all 124 formulas in the workbook, and Claude learned that initial calculation errors in empty templates are normal and resolve once users input data. For cross-sheet references, the syntax 'SheetName'!CellReference worked reliably for pulling data between tabs, enabling the integrated workflow where customer information entered once automatically populates quotes, project tracking, and financial dashboards.",

Where helpful, I’ve referenced the existing slide you should insert **after**.\n\n---\n\n### 1) **Insulation is a Basic Right (AR‑first)**\n\n* **Insert after:** Slide **2** (Hadith) → becomes slide 3.\n* **Show:** Split image “before/after family” + bilingual headline\n  **Arabic:** **في الموصل، نعتبر العزل رفاهية — لكن هذا خطأ**\n  **English:** “In Mosul, we treat insulation as a luxury — but this is wrong.”\n* **Script prompt:** “What would your family do with +100k IQD/month?”\n* **Implements:** Cultural reframing; strengthens WHY.\n\n---\n\n### 2) **Trainer Voices: Why This Matters (quote boxes)**\n\n* **Insert after:** new slide 1 above → becomes slide 4.\n* **Show:** 3 quotes (Ghassan/Omar/Yahia) with headshots. Keep quotes to ≤25 words each; include **Omar’s second‑floor test** line.\n* **Implements:** Use local authority; frames comfort > kilowatts.\n\n---\n\n### 3) **Second‑Floor Comfort Test (benchmark)**\n\n* **Insert after:** Slide **21–22** “Heat Gain Breakdown” and before “Your Home as an Energy Envelope” (#24).\n* **Show:** Thermal before/after mock with headline:\n  **“إذا قدرت تعيش بالطابق الثاني… فأنت وصلت المرحلة الممتازة”**\n  “If the 2nd floor is livable in August, you’ve reached excellent level.”\n* **Add:** “Why 2nd floor is the test” bullets + ΔT numbers.\n* **Implements:** Success metric & honest expectations (10–12 °C). \n\n---\n\n### 4) **Hall of Shame: When Insulation Goes Wrong (3 caselets)**\n\n* **Insert after:** “Meet the Materials” block (Slides **28–35**).\n* **Show:**\n\n  * **4,000‑unit new build with no roof insulation → retrofit 5× cost**\n  * **Zift/old bitumen disaster → toxic melt & redo**\n  * **Reflective tile mistake → heats neighbor, forced removal**\n* **Add:** **Red Flag Checklist** (Never use… Always check…).\n* **Implements:** “Teach failure modes” and stop shortcuts.\n\n---\n\n### 5) **Comfort Over Kilowatts (reframe the pitch)**\n\n* **Insert:** Day 1 SELL section (≈ Slide **47–49** zone).\n* **Show:** Two columns **OLD TECH PITCH** vs **NEW HUMAN PITCH** (health, sleep, pride, productivity, money). Include “under‑promise: 10–12 °C” note.\n* **Implements:** Sales psychology per trainers.\n\n---\n\n### 6) **Real Mosul Stories (testimonials slide)**\n\n* **Insert:** After comfort pitch above.\n* **Show:** Short 2–3‑line stories (e.g., **Um Youssef medical costs**, **Abu Hamza WFH**).\n* **Implements:** Local credibility & social proof. \n\n---\n\n### 7) **kWh Tariff Bands: Honest Money Math**\n\n* **Insert:** Replace/adjacent to current **“Why Heat = Money”** slide (#6).\n* **Show:**\n\n  * **Savings (IQD) = kWh_saved × tariff_band_rate**\n  * **Low/Med/High tariff** examples + **generator fuel path** (kWh from L/h).\n  * **Kill** “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD flat” line.\n* **Implements:** Fixes common error trainers flagged. \n\n---\n\n### 8) **Quality & Expiry Checklist (procurement reality)**\n\n* **Insert:** Day 2 Apply block (materials).\n* **Show:** Expiry date, storage, supplier training, warranty, onsite QA.\n* **Implements:** Market reality & anti‑corruption prevention. \n\n---\n\n### 9) **Mixing Lab (bucket‑mark ratios + 24 h curing)**\n\n* **Insert:** Day 2–3 Apply block.\n* **Show:** **Bucket mark photo**, weight equivalence, “mason demo only,” **curing time clock (24 h)**.\n* **Implements:** Practical accuracy & safety.\n\n---\n\n### 10) **Install‑First, Pay‑Later (trust‑building model)**\n\n* **Insert:** Day 5 Business section.\n* **Show:** 30% materials + 70% after ΔT verification; phased roof→walls→sealing; “What‑if” corruption scenarios with scripts.\n* **Implements:** Real‑world business model. \n\n---\n\n# C) Slides to **modify** (surgical edits with copy you can paste)\n\n> These are the fastest high‑impact fixes in your current Day‑1 slides.\n\n1. **Opening / Icebreaker terminology**\n\n   * **Slide 5 title** currently “Breaking the barrier of traditional construction.” Replace the earlier “Myth‑Buster/Legends” terminology everywhere with: **“كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”**. Keep the toss activity, but rename it: **“Myth Toss / رمي الأساطير”** and simplify the myths list.\n\n2. **Why Heat = Money (Slide 6)**\n\n   * Remove: “Every 1 kWh costs 800 IQD” and “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh for 1 hour.”\n   * Replace with the **Tariff Bands** slide spec in **B‑7** above. Trainers asked for ranges & generator reality.\n\n3. **Building Heat Gain Breakdown (Slide 22)**\n\n   * Keep **Roof 70% / Walls 20% / Leaks 10%** but **add a footnote**:\n     “Based on typical Mosul homes (concrete roof, hollow block walls, single‑pane windows). Your house may vary.”\n   * Add **Retrofit Priority Matrix** below: **Phase 1: Air sealing** → **Phase 2: Roof** → **Phase 3: Walls**. \n\n4. **Meet the Materials (Slides 28–32)**\n\n   * Convert to a **5‑column table**: *Material / Best Use / Typical Cost / Red Flags / Available in Mosul?*\n   * **Thermal plaster (Labkh/Mantofly)**: keep benefits but add a **small footnote on every benefits slide**:\n     “Supplier/manufacturer data; performance depends on prep, thickness, application quality.” (this replaces over‑claims like “> 1000 °C” and “60% savings” as standalone promises).\n\n5. **ETIS term check (Slide 34)**\n\n   * Ensure Arabic label is consistent **“ETIS: نظام العزل الحراري الخارجي”** and clarify “continuous wrap to kill thermal bridges.” \n\n6. **Your Home as an Energy Envelope (Slide 24)**\n\n   * Keep, but add humidity target box **(40–60% RH)** and explicitly tie to **reduced AC runtime**—your text draft already hints this; make it explicit.\n\n7. **Safety First (Slide 37)**\n\n   * Keep ladder rule/hydration; add **“roof work without harness is common—use 4:1 ladder rule + spotter”** (practical over theoretical PPE). \n\n8. **Spreadsheet moments (Slides 43, 48)**\n\n   * Above the calculator tables, add **“What could this money fund?”** (school fees, medicine). This connects to SELL framing. \n\n---\n\n# D) Slides to **delete or move** (to hit the 3‑hour rhythm)\n\n* **Cut** any **U‑value deep dives** beyond the 5 you need (your Day‑1 already has a clean table—keep that; trim any repeats across days).\n* **Move** line‑by‑line BOQ examples to a **handout**; keep only a single **BOQ template slide** in deck.\n* **Consolidate** repetitive business theory into **3 slides max** (include Install‑First/Pay‑Later + phased offers + objections flow).\n* **Move QR promo** slides to end of Day‑5 only.\n  These cuts match the **executive targets** (192 → ~120 slides total; 3‑hour days).\n\n---\n\n# E) Quote & case‑study slides you can paste in\n\n> Two “ready” slides that use **real trainer lines**; keep each quote ≤25 words.\n\n**Slide: Trainer Voices (Omar)**\n\n> “If you can make the second floor comfortable, you’ve reached excellent level.” — *Omar Laith* \n\n**Slide: Trust Warning (Ghassan)**\n\n> “One bad job ruins 10 referrals—invest once, save long‑term.” — *Ghassan* (also echoed on Day‑1 slide 23)\n\n**Slide: Zift Hall‑of‑Shame (caselet)**\n\n* “Old bitumen melted at ~50 °C; family paid twice to redo.” (Use warning icon + 2 bullet “real cost”.) \n\n**Slide: 4,000‑Unit Disaster (caselet)**\n\n* “Zero roof insulation → 5× retrofit cost; property values ↓30%.” (Make it visual—before/after roof section.) \n\n**Slide: Reflective Tile Mistake (caselet)**\n\n* “Shiny roof tiles cooked the neighbor’s windows—forced removal.” (Add “Reflection ≠ Reduction” note.) \n\n---\n\n# F) Find‑and‑Replace & micro‑copy fixes (15‑minute pass)\n\n1. **Myth terms:** replace “Myth‑Busting/Breaking Legends” with **“كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”** everywhere.\n2. **Money math:** purge “1 amp ≈ 1 kWh; 800 IQD flat” and any single‑price statements; replace with “Tariff bands + generator path.”\n3. **Thermal plaster claims:** add small **footnote** under benefits (“supplier data; performance depends on prep/thickness/application”).\n4. **Arabic‑first:** for every section title, add Arabic title first and keep concise English subtitle in smaller type. \n5. **ETIS term:** unify Arabic naming; mention “continuous wrap” to kill bridges. \n\n---\n\n# G) Day‑by‑Day **LEARN / APPLY / SELL** micro‑blueprints (retrofit‑only)\n\n> Keep these as section cover notes for each day—one slide each.\n\n**Day 1 – Understanding Heat & Trust**\n\n* **LEARN:** Iraq heat trend; **3 modes**; **heat‑gain map**; **2nd‑floor test**.\n* **APPLY:** Home‑Audit Sprint (temps, leaks, generator amps).\n* **SELL:** Comfort‑first pitch + tariff‑band savings; record 30‑sec hook.\n\n**Day 2 – Roofs & Materials (retrofit focus)**\n\n* **LEARN:** XPS/EPS/mineral wool/PU + **thermal plaster** incl. red flags.\n* **APPLY:** **Mixing Lab** + **Quality & Expiry** checks; mini‑tile ΔT tests. \n* **SELL:** “Cheap‑now = pay‑later” with live ΔT and ROI.\n\n**Day 3 – Walls, Windows & BOQ (retrofit)**\n\n* **LEARN:** ETIS basics; **WWR** limits; sealing priority.\n* **APPLY:** BOQ **template** only + supplier quotes; no line‑item rabbit holes. \n* **SELL:** Three options (**GOOD/BETTER/BEST**) with phaseable caps.\n\n**Day 4 – Retrofit Planning & Quoting**\n\n* **LEARN:** Priority matrix (air‑sealing → roof → walls); objections map. \n* **APPLY:** Quote Generator; evidence pack (IR + ΔT + photos).\n* **SELL:** Pilot proposal with **Install‑First, Pay‑Later** draft terms. \n\n**Day 5 – Enterprise & Launch**\n\n* **LEARN:** “What‑if” corruption scenarios; trust systems. \n* **APPLY:** 30‑day launch plan (weekly milestones + WhatsApp check‑ins). \n* **SELL:** Final pitch; commit to 3 pilot homes.\n\n---\n\n# H) Exactly where to click/change in **your current deck** (fast map)\n\n* **Slide 2** (Hadith) → keep; add one‑line bridge **“اليوم… سنكون أنفع للناس عبر…”** (Today we’ll be “of benefit” by…).\n* **Slide 3/4** (Explore trainings) → **move to Day‑5 end**.\n* **Slide 5** (Icebreaker) → rename **“كسر الحاجز / Icebreaker”**; keep toss activity.\n* **Slide 6** (Why Heat = Money) → **replace** with **Tariff Bands** version (**B‑7**).\n* **Slides 12–16** (Context) → keep 1–2 strong visuals; trim any duplicates.\n* **Slide 22** (Heat Gain Breakdown) → add **footnote** + **Priority Matrix**. \n* **Slides 28–32** (Meet the Materials) → convert to **5‑column table** + **footnote** under Mantofly/thermal plaster benefits; insert **Hall of Shame** right after.\n* **Slide 34** (ETIS) → keep; fix term; add “continuous wrap” note.\n* **Slide 37** (Safety) → keep; add **4:1 ladder** + hydration callouts (already present; just make explicit).\n* **Slides 43, 48–49** (Calculator + pitch) → add **“What could this money fund?”** prompt; add **Comfort Over Kilowatts** + **Mosul stories** as new slides after 47.\n\n---\n\n# I) Asset checklist (so production isn’t blocked)\n\n* **Photos:**\n\n  * Family before/after (can stage quickly on site).\n  * Thermal plaster **on‑site** application (Ghassan media when available; placeholder until then).\n* **Icons:** Warning triangle / fire / sun reflect (Hall of Shame). \n* **Tables:**\n\n  * Materials 5‑column table template. \n  * Tariff bands table (3 scenarios + generator path). \n* **Worksheets:** BOQ template (single slide + downloadable sheet). \n\n---\n\n## J) One‑page task list (hand this to your editor)\n\n1. **Reorder agenda** on each day to **3‑hour rhythm**; paste the rhythm slide. \n2. **Insert 10 new slides** exactly where noted (B‑section). \n3. **Modify 8 slides** (C‑section) incl. money math, materials footnotes, ETIS Arabic term. \n4. **Delete/move** QR promos, deep U‑value repeats, line‑by‑line BOQ, generic business theory (leave template + 3 targeted business slides).\n5. **Add quotes & caselets** (E‑section) with ≤25‑word quotes. \n6. **Run the 15‑minute Find‑&‑Replace** pass (F‑section).\n\n---\n\n### Want me to turn this spec into the actual **.pptx** next?\n\nIf you say “go,” I’ll implement **this exact change kit** directly into **BG Updated of Insulation Module Day 1‑5 (BEIT Template)(To Share).pptx**—keeping your template, Arabic‑first titling, and the LEARN/APPLY/SELL rhythm throughout.\n"

            "extracted_content": "# INSULATION TRAINING: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n## Critical Issues & Quick Wins\n\n---\n\n## THE CORE PROBLEM\n\nYour training is **technically solid but culturally tone-deaf**. \n\nThink of it like teaching someone to swim by explaining water moleculesâ€”accurate, but missing the point. Trainees need to understand the **social context** of insulation in post-conflict Mosul, not just the physics.\n\n---\n\n## 3 STRENGTHS (Keep These)\n\n1. **Hands-on demos are excellent** - Incense smoke, IR cameras, real measurements\n2. **Financial logic is clear** - Amp-to-IQD conversion makes sense\n3. **Material coverage is comprehensive** - Real products available in Iraqi markets\n\n---\n\n## 5 CRITICAL WEAKNESSES\n\n### 1. **Cultural Blindness**\n**The Issue:** Training treats insulation as a technical upgrade, not a cultural shift.  \n**The Fix:** Add \"Insulation is a Right, Not a Luxury\" slide (see Slide 1 in full document).  \n**Impact:** HIGH - This frames everything else correctly.\n\n### 2. **No Failure Mode Education**\n**The Issue:** Trainees learn what to DO but not what to AVOID.  \n**The Fix:** \"Hall of Shame\" case studiesâ€”the 4,000-unit disaster, the zift nightmare, the reflective tile mistake.  \n**Impact:** HIGH - One bad job kills 10 referrals. Prevention is worth 10x cure.\n\n### 3. **Missing Success Benchmark**\n**The Issue:** No clear pass/fail metric trainees can sell to customers.  \n**The Fix:** \"Second Floor Comfort Test\" - If you can't make the 2nd floor livable, you failed.  \n**Impact:** MEDIUM - Gives trainees confidence and customers a tangible goal.\n\n### 4. **Sessions Too Long**\n**The Issue:** 192 slides, 5-hour blocks, exhausted participants.  \n**The Fix:** Cut to 3-hour daily rhythmâ€”45min learn, 75min practice, 45min sell.  \n**Impact:** HIGH - Attention = retention. Long â‰  better.\n\n### 5. **Business Model Gaps**\n**The Issue:** Zero content on corruption, customer trust barriers, or payment models.  \n**The Fix:** Add \"Install-First, Pay-Later\" model + \"What If\" corruption scenarios.  \n**Impact:** MEDIUM - Trainees need tools for messy reality, not perfect theory.\n\n---\n\n## THE 10 REORGANIZATION SLIDES (Priority Order)\n\n### **MUST DO BEFORE NEXT SESSION:**\n\n1. **Slide 8: 3-Hour Daily Rhythm** â†’ Restructure entire schedule  \n   *Why first?* Format determines everything else.\n\n2. **Slide 1: \"Insulation is a Right\"** â†’ Cultural reframing  \n   *Why?* Sets the tone for the entire training.\n\n3. **Slide 2: \"Hall of Shame\"** â†’ Anti-patterns  \n   *Why?* Prevention is easier than explaining failures later.\n\n### **TEST IN NEXT TRAINING:**\n\n4. **Slide 4: Comfort Over Kilowatts** â†’ Reframe value prop  \n   *Why?* Changes how trainees sell to customers.\n\n5. **Slide 6: The Mixing Lab** â†’ Practical measurement tools  \n   *Why?* Quality control starts with accurate ratios.\n\n6. **Slide 10: 30-Day Battle Plan** â†’ Accountability structure  \n   *Why?* Training without launch = wasted investment.\n\n### **IMPLEMENT WITHIN 2 MONTHS:**\n\n7. **Slide 3: Second Floor Test** â†’ Clear success metric\n8. **Slide 9: Results Database** â†’ Evidence-based practice\n9. **Slide 7: Passive Systems** â†’ Traditional + modern integration\n10. **Slide 5: Corruption Reality** â†’ Business model for real-world barriers\n\n---\n\n## QUICK WINS (Can Implement Today)\n\n### **Cut These Immediately:**\n- Slides 50-75: Redundant U-value math (keep 5 slides max)\n- Slides 110-125: BOQ details (move to handout)\n- Slides 160-185: Repetitive business slides (cut 70%)\n\n**Result:** 192 slides â†’ ~120 slides â†’ actually finishable in 3 hours/day\n\n### **Add These This Week:**\n- RED FLAG CHECKLIST: What materials to never use (zift, old bitumen, thin single-pane glass)\n- BUCKET-MARK TEMPLATE: Laminated cards showing exact mixing ratios with visual guides\n- WHATSAPP ACCOUNTABILITY: Set up 30-day check-in system with trainer responses\n\n---\n\n## WHAT TRAINERS ACTUALLY SAID (Direct Quotes Worth Remembering)\n\n**Ghassan:**  \n> \"Many see insulation as a luxury, not a necessity. We need stronger narrative to reframe it as a basic right.\"\n\n**Omar:**  \n> \"Say '10-12Â°C savings' instead of '15+' to create pleasant surprise. Under-promise, over-deliver.\"\n\n**Omar:**  \n> \"If you can make the second floor comfortable, you've reached the excellent level.\"\n\n**Muthanna:**  \n> \"5-hour blocks felt 'too long'; suggest â‰¤ 3 hours per day.\"\n\n**Ghassan:**  \n> \"One bad job ruins 10 referrals. This is why we focus on trust and qualityâ€”invest once, save long-term.\"\n\n---\n\n## THE METAPHOR THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING\n\nYour current training is like teaching someone to **build a bridge** by showing them:\n- Steel tensile strength calculations âœ“\n- Concrete curing chemistry âœ“\n- Load distribution formulas âœ“\n\nBut NOT teaching them:\n- Where people actually need to go âœ—\n- Why the river floods every spring âœ—\n- What happens when corrupt contractors use cheap rebar âœ—\n- How to convince the village council to fund it âœ—\n\n**Technical knowledge without context = expensive paperweight.**\n\n---\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS (How You'll Know This Worked)\n\n### **During Training:**\n- Participant phone-checking < 10% of session time\n- 80%+ say \"session length was right\"\n- 70%+ correct answers on Day 5 quiz\n\n### **30 Days After Training:**\n- 60%+ of trainees land 3+ customers\n- 50%+ input data to shared database\n- Average second-floor Î”T: 12-15Â°C\n- Customer satisfaction: 8+/10\n\n### **Cultural Shift Indicators:**\n- How many customers say \"I thought insulation was too expensive\"?\n- How many request the second floor comfort test?\n- How many testimonials mention comfort vs. just money?\n\n**If these numbers hit, the training works. If not, iterate again.**\n\n---\n\n## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY\n\n**Current training teaches the physics of insulation; revised training teaches how to build a profitable business that improves lives in post-conflict Iraqâ€”huge difference.**\n\n---\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\n1. Read the full 10-slide reorganization document\n2. Decide which 3 slides you'll implement BEFORE next training\n3. Cut 70 slides this week (be ruthless)\n4. Test revised format with next cohort\n5. Track the 30-day metrics\n6. Iterate based on real results\n\n**The feedback is clear. The path is clear. The only question is: will you act on it?**\n"

But customers sometimes still complain. Here's how to diagnose:\"\n\n**THE 4 COMFORT FACTORS:**\n\n**1. THERMAL (Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø­Ø±Ø§Ø±ÙŠØ©)**  \nâœ… **Your expertise**  \n- Temperature, humidity, airflow  \n- Fixed by: Insulation + proper AC sizing  \n**Check:** Did Î”T drop by 10Â°C+? If yes, thermal is fixed.\n\n**2. VISUAL (Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ù„ÙˆÙ†ÙŠØ©ØŒ Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø¨ØµØ±ÙŠØ©)**  \nâš ï¸ **Quick mention**  \n- Dark walls FEEL hotter even at same temp  \n- Glare from windows makes heat feel worse  \n**Quick fix:** \"Try lighter paint colors - costs 50,000 IQD vs. 2,000,000 IQD for more insulation\"\n\n**3. ACOUSTIC (Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ ØµÙˆØªÙŠØ©)**  \nâœ… **Bonus benefit of insulation**  \n- Insulation reduces noise ~20 decibels  \n- Generator noise often confused with heat discomfort  \n**Pitch:** \"You'll be cooler AND quieter\"\n\n**4. SPATIAL (Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø£Ø«Ø§Ø«ÙŠØ©)**  \nâš ï¸ **Not your job, but worth checking**  \n- Furniture blocking AC vents  \n- Poor room layout trapping heat  \n**Quick check:** \"Is your couch blocking the AC? That's why you feel hot on that side\"\n\n---\n\n**REAL QUOTE (Omar Laith, Architect/Engineer):**\n> \"Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ ØµÙˆØªÙŠØ© Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ù„ÙˆÙ†ÙŠØ©ØŒ Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø¨ØµØ±ÙŠØ©ØŒ ÙŠØ¹Ù†ÙŠ Ø®Ù„ÙŠ Ù†Ù‚ÙˆÙ„ ÙŠÙ„Ø§ Ø¢ Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø­Ø±Ø§Ø±ÙŠØ©ØŒ Ø¶ÙˆØ¶Ø§Ø¡ Ø£Ø«Ø§Ø«ÙŠØ©\"  \n> \"Noise pollution, color pollution, visual pollution, let's say thermal pollution, furniture pollution\"\n\n---\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING SCRIPT:**\n\n**Customer:** \"I still feel hot after you installed insulation!\"\n\n**You (Checklist):**\n1. âœ… \"Let me check the Î”T. [Measures] Roof is 12Â°C cooler - insulation IS working\"\n2. \"Are your walls dark brown or black? [Yes] That's visual warmth - your brain thinks it's hot\"\n3. \"Is your generator right outside the window? [Yes] That's acoustic stress - noise makes heat feel worse\"\n4. \"Is your sofa blocking the AC vent? [Yes] That's airflow - move it 50cm left\"\n\n**Solution:** \"Your insulation works perfectly - the problem is these other 3 factors.

The workbook is empty - there's no data entered yet\n2. The formulas are dividing by zero when there's no input data\n3. The INDEX/MATCH formula can't find values in empty cells\n\nThis is normal for a template. When users enter data, these errors will resolve. However, I should fix these to make the template cleaner by adding IFERROR functions to handle empty states gracefully.\n\nLet me create a fix for these errors.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nNow let me run this fix script and then recalculate again.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood!

Let me create a comprehensive guide document that explains how to use the workbook.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nPerfect! Now I have created:\n1. A comprehensive Excel workbook with 9 tabs\n2.

On the right, you see:\nPeak Cooling Load (Tons): the capacity your system must handle.\nOversized by (%): how much larger your current AC is compared to the optimal size.\nPotential Savings (IQD/month): the monthly fuelâ€‘cost reduction if you rightâ€‘size or retrofit.\u000b\nLetâ€™s do a quick demo: Who measured a 2â€¯mÂ² window and entered 0.8â€¯Tons AC? Enter those values now and watch the numbers update.â€\nKey Points:\nOnly the two yellow cells drive all outputs.\nPeak Cooling Load shows true system demand.\nOversized by % reveals inefficiency you can eliminate.\nPotential Savings quantifies the monthly benefit.\u000b\nLocal example:\nâ€œIn Basra, halving an oversize of 40â€¯% saved households around 25â€¯Mâ€¯IQD per monthâ€”just like this.â€\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk a volunteer team to enter their auditâ€™s Window Area and AC Size.\nObserve the Peak Cooling Load, Oversized by %, and Potential Savings fields.\nDiscuss briefly what this savings figure means for budgeting.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Outputs donâ€™t refresh after entry.\u000b Solution: Click any blank cell or press F9 to recalculate.",

You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\\n\\n## Important Requirements\\n\\n**LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the `recalc.py` script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run\\n\\n## Reading and analyzing data\\n\\n### Data analysis with pandas\\nFor data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities:\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\n# Read Excel\\ndf = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx')  # Default: first sheet\\nall_sheets = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', sheet_name=None)  # All sheets as dict\\n\\n# Analyze\\ndf.head()      # Preview data\\ndf.info()      # Column info\\ndf.describe()  # Statistics\\n\\n# Write Excel\\ndf.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)\\n```\\n\\n## Excel File Workflows\\n\\n## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values\\n\\n**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.\\n\\n### ❌ WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values\\n```python\\n# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result\\ntotal = df['Sales'].sum()\\nsheet['B10'] = total  # Hardcodes 5000\\n\\n# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python\\ngrowth = (df.iloc[-1]['Revenue'] - df.iloc[0]['Revenue']) / df.iloc[0]['Revenue']\\nsheet['C5'] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15\\n\\n# Bad: Python calculation for average\\navg = sum(values) / len(values)\\nsheet['D20'] = avg  # Hardcodes 42.5\\n```\\n\\n### ✅ CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas\\n```python\\n# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum\\nsheet['B10'] = '=SUM(B2:B9)'\\n\\n# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula\\nsheet['C5'] = '=(C4-C2)/C2'\\n\\n# Good: Average using Excel function\\nsheet['D20'] = '=AVERAGE(D2:D19)'\\n```\\n\\nThis applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes.\\n\\n## Common Workflow\\n1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting\\n2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file\\n3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting\\n4. **Save**: Write to file\\n5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the recalc.py script\\n   ```bash\\n   python recalc.py output.xlsx\\n   ```\\n6. **Verify and fix any errors**: \\n   - The script returns JSON with error details\\n   - If `status` is `errors_found`, check `error_summary` for specific error types and locations\\n   - Fix the identified errors and recalculate again\\n   - Common errors to fix:\\n     - `#REF!`: Invalid cell references\\n     - `#DIV/0!`: Division by zero\\n     - `#VALUE!`: Wrong data type in formula\\n     - `#NAME?`: Unrecognized formula name\\n\\n### Creating new Excel files\\n\\n```python\\n# Using openpyxl for formulas and formatting\\nfrom openpyxl import Workbook\\nfrom openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment\\n\\nwb = Workbook()\\nsheet = wb.active\\n\\n# Add data\\nsheet['A1'] = 'Hello'\\nsheet['B1'] = 'World'\\nsheet.append(['Row', 'of', 'data'])\\n\\n# Add formula\\nsheet['B2'] = '=SUM(A1:A10)'\\n\\n# Formatting\\nsheet['A1'].font = Font(bold=True, color='FF0000')\\nsheet['A1'].fill = PatternFill('solid', start_color='FFFF00')\\nsheet['A1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')\\n\\n# Column width\\nsheet.column_dimensions['A'].width = 20\\n\\nwb.save('output.xlsx')\\n```\\n\\n### Editing existing Excel files\\n\\n```python\\n# Using openpyxl to preserve formulas and formatting\\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\\n\\n# Load existing file\\nwb = load_workbook('existing.xlsx')\\nsheet = wb.active  # or wb['SheetName'] for specific sheet\\n\\n# Working with multiple sheets\\nfor sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:\\n    sheet = wb[sheet_name]\\n    print(f\\\"Sheet: {sheet_name}\\\")\\n\\n# Modify cells\\nsheet['A1'] = 'New Value'\\nsheet.insert_rows(2)  # Insert row at position 2\\nsheet.delete_cols(3)  # Delete column 3\\n\\n# Add new sheet\\nnew_sheet = wb.create_sheet('NewSheet')\\nnew_sheet['A1'] = 'Data'\\n\\nwb.save('modified.xlsx')\\n```\\n\\n## Recalculating formulas\\n\\nExcel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided `recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:\\n\\n```bash\\npython recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]\\n```\\n\\nExample:\\n```bash\\npython recalc.py output.xlsx 30\\n```\\n\\nThe script:\\n- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run\\n- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets\\n- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)\\n- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts\\n- Works on both Linux and macOS\\n\\n## Formula Verification Checklist\\n\\nQuick checks to ensure formulas work correctly:\\n\\n### Essential Verification\\n- [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model\\n- [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK)\\n- [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6)\\n\\n### Common Pitfalls\\n- [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with `pd.notna()`\\n- [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+ \\n- [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first\\n- [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using `/` in formulas (#DIV/0!)\\n- [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!)\\n- [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets\\n\\n### Formula Testing Strategy\\n- [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly\\n- [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist\\n- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values\\n\\n### Interpreting recalc.py Output\\nThe script returns JSON with error details:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\",           // or \\\"errors_found\\\"\\n  \\\"total_errors\\\": 0,              // Total error count\\n  \\\"total_formulas\\\": 42,           // Number of formulas in file\\n  \\\"error_summary\\\": {              // Only present if errors found\\n    \\\"#REF!\\\": {\\n      \\\"count\\\": 2,\\n      \\\"locations\\\": [\\\"Sheet1!B5\\\", \\\"Sheet1!C10\\\"]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Best Practices\\n\\n### Library Selection\\n- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export\\n- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features\\n\\n### Working with openpyxl\\n- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)\\n- Use `data_only=True` to read calculated values: `load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True)`\\n- **Warning**: If opened with `data_only=True` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost\\n- For large files: Use `read_only=True` for reading or `write_only=True` for writing\\n- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use recalc.py to update values\\n\\n### Working with pandas\\n- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str})`\\n- For large files, read specific columns: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E'])`\\n- Handle dates properly: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column'])`\\n\\n## Code Style Guidelines\\n**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:\\n- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments\\n- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations\\n- Avoid unnecessary print statements\\n\\n**For Excel files themselves**:\\n- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions\\n- Document data sources for hardcoded values\\n- Include notes for key calculations and model sections\",\"stderr\":\"\"}",

Use the provided `recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:\\n\\n```bash\\npython recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]\\n```\\n\\nExample:\\n```bash\\npython recalc.py output.xlsx 30\\n```\\n\\nThe script:\\n- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run\\n- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets\\n- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)\\n- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts\\n- Works on both Linux and macOS\\n\\n## Formula Verification Checklist\\n\\nQuick checks to ensure formulas work correctly:\\n\\n### Essential Verification\\n- [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model\\n- [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK)\\n- [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6)\\n\\n### Common Pitfalls\\n- [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with `pd.notna()`\\n- [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+ \\n- [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first\\n- [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using `/` in formulas (#DIV/0!)\\n- [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!)\\n- [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets\\n\\n### Formula Testing Strategy\\n- [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly\\n- [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist\\n- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values\\n\\n### Interpreting recalc.py Output\\nThe script returns JSON with error details:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\",           // or \\\"errors_found\\\"\\n  \\\"total_errors\\\": 0,              // Total error count\\n  \\\"total_formulas\\\": 42,           // Number of formulas in file\\n  \\\"error_summary\\\": {              // Only present if errors found\\n    \\\"#REF!\\\": {\\n      \\\"count\\\": 2,\\n      \\\"locations\\\": [\\\"Sheet1!B5\\\", \\\"Sheet1!C10\\\"]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Best Practices\\n\\n### Library Selection\\n- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export\\n- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features\\n\\n### Working with openpyxl\\n- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)\\n- Use `data_only=True` to read calculated values: `load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True)`\\n- **Warning**: If opened with `data_only=True` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost\\n- For large files: Use `read_only=True` for reading or `write_only=True` for writing\\n- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use recalc.py to update values\\n\\n### Working with pandas\\n- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str})`\\n- For large files, read specific columns: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E'])`\\n- Handle dates properly: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column'])`\\n\\n## Code Style Guidelines\\n**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:\\n- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments\\n- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations\\n- Avoid unnecessary print statements\\n\\n**For Excel files themselves**:\\n- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions\\n- Document data sources for hardcoded values\\n- Include notes for key calculations and model sections\",\"stderr\":\"\"}"

Despite similar climates, material choice makes a huge difference in indoor comfort.\nNotice how the stone walls have thicker profiles and overhangs, while the concrete facades lack shading and thermal mass controls. This illustrates why, after walls and windows, the roof is our next critical frontier for reducing heat gain.â€\n\nKey Points:\nThermal mass: Stoneâ€™s density buffers temperature swings.\nShading & overhangs: Traditional designs minimize direct solar absorption.\nModern concrete: High Uâ€‘value drives indoor heat load.\u000b\nLocal Example:\nâ€œIn Basraâ€™s old neighborhoods, we saw indoor temperatures 5â€¯Â°C lower in stone homes versus nearby concrete flats without any AC.â€\n\nActivity Instructions:\nDiscuss with your neighbor: what passive feature from the stone houses could you apply to a retrofit?",
