  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is a curriculum development consultant working with the International Trade Centre (ITC) on the Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq. Based in France, they have spent nearly a year developing green building training programs for Mosul, conducting extensive expert interviews to create three distinct training tracks: insulation/thermal envelope (entrepreneurship-focused), solar energy systems (employment-focused), and heritage-informed architecture (awareness/advocacy-focused). They successfully delivered a Training of Trainers (ToT) session October 12-14, 2025, and needed help writing the final project report for Output 3 deliverables.\n\nThe user demonstrated deep expertise in adult learning design, emphasizing principles like the 80/20 rule, \"one clear message per day,\" and relationship-building over pure information transfer. They developed innovative approaches including the \"I'm a student, I'm learning\" technique for participants to build supplier relationships, culturally relevant framing connecting work to Islamic principles of service, and a stations-based rotation model for hands-on learning. Key insights from their work included the importance of using proper energy calculations (kWh-based reasoning rather than \"amps × IQD\" shortcuts) and addressing market misconceptions about green building effectiveness.\n\nClaude helped structure and draft a comprehensive 25+ page report including executive summary, detailed ToT activity report, internship/apprenticeship framework, sustainability plan, and annexes. The user requested that Claude first extract all their verbatim insights into a structured artifact to preserve their authentic voice, then draft the formal report sections. They emphasized capturing specific moments like trainer debates about insulation techniques, the \"grandparents' homes\" icebreaker, and key recommendations including a Green Home Festival, digital community hub, and government subsidy expansion. The user plans to enhance the draft with interview transcripts and Arabic session recordings to add specific quotes and examples before final submission.",

      "content": "Okay. So my specific role was to design the curriculum and to Interview all of the experts and to extract their insights and to make a training program that will be able to guide Recent graduates technical experts into potentially 3 different tracks. 1 is the idea that Mosul really needs a cultural shift in understanding the importance of insulation and opening up this idea of, like, energy consulting as a field. And so there aren't people that go and kind of assess homes and, identify if efficiencies that are possible through retrofitting. And the International Trade Center is, you know, working to help people start businesses or develop, the the different sectors economy, and to do good at the same time. And so this opportunity came up to do that for the installation. And so each each, training has its own sort of sub goal. So the goal for installation is to, get people with some technical background To understand how to the different options and opportunities for retrofitting homes and increasing their value, I I think this is something we yeah, increasing their value and also decreasing their cost. Over the long term by reducing energy expenditures while also having a lot of other returns on investment from quality of life standards and health and all that. So that's so there's an element that needs to be about financial literacy. There's element that needs to be about Soft skills and sales, and there's an element that needs to be about awareness and making sure that the classes create these opportunities for exposing people to ideas and then there's an element of Technical skills and and learning how to do stuff. And so putting it all together, like, you go, you assess the house, you identify areas of intervention, and then you can actually implement them. And you also understand that that could be a business. And so we want them to develop that competence, over that training. The other trainings are different. So, for solar, it's a recognized field. There already are solar companies, providing the in Muleside, it's Pretty standardized, and we want to help grow the market by increasing the number of people who can do the work and also getting them ideas about how to sell it because a lot of the challenge with the solar market is that people don't think it's actually appropriate for MOSLEN, and they need to be convinced. And part of the reason why they're not convinced is that previous installers were using low quality materials leading to bad outcomes and, not the best ROI. And so the thing we're looking to do is to train recently graduated electrical engineers on, solar skills, along with a lot of the other Same skills, from the previous training in terms of sales and pitching and creating t o, return on investments and stuff like that. And, the last one is the, one about may not So the thing about the solar one, though, is that the the outcomes are gonna be different. We we don't actually Like them to be able to, start a business immediately. We kind of expect them to Join to join another person's team, because it's a bit of a challenge to So from scratch without having any, learning on another person's team. And so that's the idea is that they would join somebody else's team after getting knowledge. Of the the entire industry. And Yeah. And then Getting knowledge about the entire Industry practical experience, and then also helping them get their first portfolio pieces. So at the end, of the program is, we really expect them and hope that they will go and do an install And if they do an install, then we're gonna meet up a month after. And this kind of relates to the jobs part, which is we want to create, like, at least a little bit of a reunion, a meeting of all the 3 different modules and a connection to the, the overall, like, green business Ecosystem and Landscape. And so to do that, we wanted to, make an event out of it, and I think that can be a part of what we do with the jobs, element is Is the month after training We're gonna be bringing all the people together and then the last The training is architecture, and this is the one that connects to the how's the fiddler? How baby fiddler? It connects to the, last, training is the architecture And in the architecture one, our goals are slightly different. Because, it's sort of like the highest level overview one, actually. Have you reached out? And the thing that we want to do with the, architecture one is help people Remember, that before Mosul was destroyed, a lot of the architecture was actually quite appropriate. For the environment, and it's only modern architecture that really moves away from it for speed for cost, and for copying, the west. And so one of the main things that we're trying to do is make new things that are worth copying That are worth copying for mostly And, And so, we're working with junior architects who apparently all already believe And green, design. The challenge is that don't think their bosses also believe in it, but they just don't think that the market is ready for it. And so a lot of what we're doing in the architecture module is simply creating Awareness and Hi. Having people design things and share it on social media so that, you know, we're gonna be training a 100. I don't know how many people. And so if each of them is sharing, then we're creating a bit of, impact on the consciousness then And so we're talking about, like, looking back to leave forward, learning from the past, combining it with modern science, and, creating Sort of new designs And the goals are, 2. 1 is that, we have a normal, design for a real person. Like, we want our, organizing space, mussel space, the implementing partner to be able to find them real clients or they could actually, since they're all architects, they could all be getting clients from their workplace and then what we can do with them is, bring those clients and say, hey. Listen. We're gonna do just like a dentist does, like, a free job or something like that, we want them to do a, a job during class, that kind of Moores, there's some heritage and green architecture design creates, moments where they get to share it and also, makes it so that they are making social media and other outputs All of them will meet in a month the month Later for the installation and the solar is going to be Did you Get to install something. Did you take what you learned and actually implement it? The one for the in cell, architecture is gonna be a design competition. So the design competition for, model home where they all have the same standard. During class, everyone's gonna have a different standard because everyone's gonna clients They're gonna be talking to them. Learning emotional intelligence and pitching skills to try to really learn how to convince the person to go with their design. But, the final design project is gonna be their, They're gonna be their, All gonna have the same project. This is, the things that I got so far. I'll answer your other questions next. If you wanna add some more questions to the list, you can do that now. I'm just trying to get you as much background. I've been doing this for about a year now. I'm interviewing a lot of trainers. I have the transcripts from all my interviews. Will be helpful. But I I wanna do a good job with this final, product and submission. So what can I do to do that best? Ask all questions.",

      "content": "Wow, this is incredibly rich and detailed. The user has been deeply embedded in this project for a year, and there's so much genuine insight and passion here. Let me identify what I'm hearing:\n\n1. **Three distinct tracks with different goals:**\n   - Insulation: Creating a NEW field (energy consulting/retrofitting) - entrepreneurial focus\n   - Solar: Growing an EXISTING field - employment/apprenticeship focus\n   - Architecture: Cultural shift - awareness/design competition focus\n\n2. **Key philosophical commitments:**\n   - Looking back to leap forward (heritage-informed design)\n   - Financial literacy + technical skills + soft skills = holistic training\n   - Quality over quantity (avoiding the mistakes of previous low-quality solar installs)\n   - Market transformation through awareness and social proof\n   - Practical application (not just theory)\n\n3. **The user's role:** Curriculum designer + expert interviewer + synthesizer\n\n4. **Unique challenges for Mosul context:**\n   - Destroyed heritage architecture\n   - Market skepticism (solar doesn't work here)\n   - Low-quality previous work damaging trust\n   - Junior staff believe but senior staff/market don't\n   - Need to rebuild cultural memory of what worked before\n\n5. **The reunion/competition structure** is really clever - it creates accountability and community\n\nNow I need to ask questions that will help them:\n- Express their personal journey and learning\n- Connect the feedback to their design decisions\n- Articulate what surprised them\n- Explain the \"why\" behind key choices (like kWh vs amps × IQD)\n- Reflect on what worked and what needs adjustment\n\nLet me craft questions that will draw out authentic voice and help structure the report.This is brilliant context - thank you. I can feel how much thought and care you've put into this. Now let me ask some questions that will help us capture YOUR voice and YOUR learning journey in this report:\n\n## On the ToT experience itself:\n\n**5. You designed three very different outcomes (entrepreneur vs. employee vs. awareness/design). During the October ToT, did the trainers \"get\" why each module needed such a different approach?** What resistance or confusion did you encounter, if any?\n\n**6. The report mentions participants asked for \"simple diagrams/decision trees to structure complex choices.\" Did you anticipate this need when you were designing the curriculum, or did it surprise you?** What does this tell you about how engineers/architects learn differently than you expected?\n\n**7. You've been interviewing experts for a year. What's ONE insight from those interviews that fundamentally changed how you designed the training?** (Give me a specific example - like \"Ali Sabah said X and that made me realize Y\")\n\n## On the \"kWh not amps × IQD\" crusade:\n\n**8.

You designed three very different outcomes (entrepreneur vs. employee vs. awareness/design). During the October ToT, did the trainers \"get\" why each module needed such a different approach?** What resistance or confusion did you encounter, if any?\n\n**6. The report mentions participants asked for \"simple diagrams/decision trees to structure complex choices.\" Did you anticipate this need when you were designing the curriculum, or did it surprise you?** What does this tell you about how engineers/architects learn differently than you expected?\n\n**7. You've been interviewing experts for a year. What's ONE insight from those interviews that fundamentally changed how you designed the training?** (Give me a specific example - like \"Ali Sabah said X and that made me realize Y\")\n\n## On the \"kWh not amps × IQD\" crusade:\n\n**8. When you were interviewing experts, did they ALSO make this mistake? Or is this something you observed trainers doing?** Help me understand where this bad habit comes from and why it matters so much to you.\n\n**9.

I I think they they do partially because all of the trainers are the ones that have derived all these insights from. So the people that were in the TOT were the people that I was talking to to learn all this stuff. Like, I I live in France. I have no idea. I had to fly to Iraq and call these people over and over. Until I finally started to understand what's going on? For the overall vision. Right? So maybe I should send you a bait like, overall vision of kind of launching the green housing Market, in Iraq or you know, making that more possible. Well, bringing in youth and women into the workplace and, yeah. So one of our main MNEs is the financial literacy components and, yeah. So that's why it's Like that. The report mentions participants simple diagram decision trees for complex choices Yeah. I guess the way that I anticipated it or what I was really thinking is, like, we have 5 days, you know, And so I don't want the complicated stuff. I think the complicated stuff has to be in the trainer's knowledge base in their mind, but, the participant we need to give him the larger context, say, but for you, learn how to do this one thing well. Especially, you know, for installation. There's like a a 1000000000 things you can do. Different layers, different materials, different compounds, But we wanted to give them the 80% 80 20. Right? So, like, you learn this few things, and you'll be dangerous in the market, and you can actually have a business. So that that was the idea. But, it was during the sessions that people kept saying, like, but what about this? But what about this? You know? And every like, it's, not always so straightforward. It's actually good to have all of these different trainers with their different opinions. And so one of the things that I'm trying to do is actually Make that trainer database visible. And so and queryable. So I'm I'm working on creating an r a g treatment. Augmented generation, project that will, let us get to, you know, if the the trainers have a question or even if the participants have a question, can actually ask that because, the all the trainer's mind. And maybe instead of just giving them the answer, we can say, hey. Like, if you can talk to this person, they would know the answer to your question best. And I think that that is actually something that I'm doing. It's a little bit beyond my contract. But, it's something that I thought was cool to do. I'm not sure if I'm just overdoing it, though. Okay. Let's see. What else? When you're interviewing experts, they also make this mistake. No. The experts you know, they they understand that the customer speaks in amps because they pay per amp by the generator company. But in the end, they need to do the math and all the calculations with the appropriate measures. Looking back to the forward, monsoyed copies the west. Specific heritage technique Yeah. I I think there's not exactly a specific heritage technique What I would like them to do is, learn the first principles because they think that the past is some, like, frozen thing that we're going to copy in a suddenly everything will be okay, it's not true. We need to be inspired by the principles, and some of them are are values based. They're not just, like, technical. Principles. For instance, a lot of roads are curved because it creates a sense of privacy. Right? You can't look so far and, like, gaze at people who are walking by. And other things. Yeah. So I think that would really be it. First of all, I'd like to appreciate that the past has something to teach us. And that, By instead of going to copying if and and just rushing into things, if we really connect with the things that make Mosul feel like home, We can build the homes of the future. And I actually like that kind of framing. And, everybody has memories of their grandparents' homes and places that they've been mostly that, like, surprisingly are great even in some of the hotter days or colder days even, because Mosul does have both. Cashy versus concrete reflectivity. Not sure why it's in the TOT report. Parts. Yeah. It doesn't seem so relevant for, like, the end of reporting. It seems like a technical thing. TOT feedback in attendance sheets Yeah. I don't know. Could you review the attendance sheets and feedback and tell me what you think? I think the thing that I was really excited about was just how engaged and active everyone was. You know? We were really Having a great discussion and I really felt like Amina, that they were really there to learn and grow, and that actually one of the really cool things is I feel like they were learning from each other and that just bringing them together made them feel like thing. You know, we talked about this community. I think that's actually really important. I These sealants don't meet each other. They all work at different companies and, do, different things even. And right now, the the engagement is just with each cohort individually. So installation trainers, solar trainers, and the well, we didn't actually complete the CEO t for the architecture. But these are, like, 3 Hey. 3 different trainers groups that can also be a part of a broader coalition of people working on, like, green and, efficient housing that Is useful for mostly And now let's see what else. Ahmad from the University of Molesale. Well, I guess I just really trust that he's gonna be able to do something cool. Because he's, the person who's taking forward the, activity for the TOT. And he has all of the right backgrounds and knowledge And, in a later message, I will send you our Interview. Together. I train him on the content. I think he appreciates the content, but I think he'll bring a lot to the table as well. Beautiful 3 tregs. Yes. Hold on. Jobs placement. CVs aren't trusted. Yeah. I think it's I I understand that. I know there's a lot of, like, people looking for jobs. And this is a part of the reason why I think We have to work on the market. As well as, the the job side. So, like, can give people skills, but if nobody wants those skills, it's gonna be a problem. This is why a big part of the training is this awareness campaign, and I think that might be something I recommend in the project. How important the awareness is, and all of the misconceptions think that's the big one. Like, there's just a lot of misconceptions about what will and what won't work. And we just need to get people to understand that, like, the stuff that you're saying doesn't work actually works. There's a lot more benefits than first meets the eye. And it's financial, and it's more than financial. So woo hoo. So I think the important element from the training is going to be to have the participants become advocates and the trainers to become advocates and to have them share and to do things that are Like, public. And this is why I was thinking of having the design competition and other things and and and maybe just to be Not so UN based NGO about it. Right? And just say, listen. Like, we know that, it Yeah. Prices for, gas are gonna rise. And oil, based on the the trends and, like, what the government, is doing. And so gonna become more expensive. And right now, we know that there way cheaper than they actually really should be. And that, it's horrible for our health, and we don't like the sound, and we don't like I'm the way our city looks, and we don't you know, we don't like these things. We don't want these things. There's other ways to do things And and also, like, the reason why all of the solar was bad is because people buying literally used batteries. Bad BMSs. You know? And installation. Like, people are skimping out because they can pocket some money if they use cheaper insulation. And just keep the rest. Right? From a government contract. And even though the government contract doesn't hardly include any, and there's, like, a huge gap here in terms of the government and and some people from the trainers, like, one of the biggest and exciting insights that I had was, that the government does sort of have subsidies for materials for construction, where they can say, hey. I bought this material they can get money back. And that sounds like a huge opportunity, and Wifert is the one who talked the told me that.

      "content": "This is incredibly rich. Let me capture the key authentic insights and help organize them:\n\n1. **On trainer understanding**: The trainers ARE the experts he interviewed - so they inherently get it because they co-created the insights. He had to fly from France to Iraq and do extensive interviews to understand the context.\n\n2. **On decision trees**: He designed for the 80/20 rule - give participants the essentials to be \"dangerous in the market\" not everything. The complexity should be in trainers' heads, not overwhelming participants. But during sessions, the \"what about this?\" questions showed the need for clearer navigation.\n\n3. **On the RAG system**: He's building something beyond his contract - a queryable trainer knowledge base so people can get answers or be connected to the right expert. This is authentic to his problem-solving approach.\n\n4. **On \"amps × IQD\"**: The experts DON'T make this mistake - they know customers speak in amps (because generators charge per amp) but do proper calculations. So this is about translating between customer language and technical reality.\n\n5. **On heritage**: NOT about copying specific techniques but learning FIRST PRINCIPLES - both technical and values-based (like curved roads for privacy). The key insight: \"connect with things that make Mosul feel like home to build homes of the future.\" Everyone has memories of grandparents' homes that worked well.\n\n6. **On ToT success**: What excited him most was how engaged everyone was and that they learned FROM EACH OTHER. The community building aspect - bringing together people who normally don't meet across companies/sectors.\n\n7. **On Dr. Omar**: Trust and delegation - Omar has the right background and will bring his own value.\n\n8. **On job placement reality**: He gets why CVs aren't trusted. The key insight: you can give people skills but if nobody wants those skills, it's a problem. This is why MARKET AWARENESS is crucial.\n\n9. **On misconceptions**: This is huge - there are misconceptions about what works/doesn't work. The training needs to create ADVOCATES (both participants and trainers) who share publicly and challenge these misconceptions.\n \nThe energy landscape reveals critical economic and environmental challenges. Current energy systems are unsustainable, with artificially low gas prices masking significant health and urban aesthetic problems. Previous solar initiatives failed due to poor infrastructure - used batteries, inadequate battery management systems, and contractors cutting corners with cheap materials. A breakthrough opportunity emerged through Wifaq, who highlighted government subsidies for construction materials - a potential game-changing leverage point for sustainable development.Okay, this is GOLD. I'm starting to see your vision and voice clearly. Let me dig deeper on a few things that will make your report authentic and powerful:\n\n## On the RAG system and trainer knowledge base:\n\n**16. You said you're building a queryable trainer database \"beyond your contract\" - what problem were you personally frustrated by that made you decide to build this?** (This is the kind of authentic detail that makes a report real - when did you realize you needed this?)\n\n**17. If the RAG works, what's the dream scenario? Like - give me a concrete example: \"Participant asks [X question] and instead of [Y happening], now [Z happens]...\"**\n\n## On misconceptions and awareness:\n\n**18.

(This could be a powerful section in your report)\n\n**19. You mentioned past solar failures were due to \"used batteries, bad BMSs, contractors pocketing money.\" When did you learn this? Was this from one specific interview or did multiple people tell you the same story?**\n\n## On the government subsidy opportunity (Wifaq's insight):\n\n**20. This seems HUGE - people can get government money back for construction materials. Why isn't everyone already doing this? What's the barrier?** And how does your training help unlock this?\n\n**21. When Wifaq told you about this subsidy, what was your immediate reaction?** Did this change your curriculum design?\n\n## On the 80/20 principle and \"what about this?\" questions:\n\n**22. You wanted to teach \"the few things that make you dangerous in the market.\" For insulation specifically - what ARE those few things?** (Like if you could only teach 3 techniques, what would they be?)\n\n**23. When trainers kept asking \"but what about this? but what about this?\" - were they worried their expertise wasn't being captured? Or were they genuinely trying to help participants?** (This tension between comprehensiveness and simplicity is real)\n\n## On heritage and \"homes that feel like home\":\n\n**24. You said everyone has memories of grandparents' homes that worked surprisingly well.

You mentioned \"don't be so UN-based NGO about it\" - what did you mean by that?** What would a non-NGO approach look like?\n\n## On what you learned about yourself:\n\n**30.

            "thinking": "This is incredibly rich. Let me capture the key authentic insights and help organize them:\n\n1. **On trainer understanding**: The trainers ARE the experts he interviewed - so they inherently get it because they co-created the insights. He had to fly from France to Iraq and do extensive interviews to understand the context.\n\n2. **On decision trees**: He designed for the 80/20 rule - give participants the essentials to be \"dangerous in the market\" not everything. The complexity should be in trainers' heads, not overwhelming participants. But during sessions, the \"what about this?\" questions showed the need for clearer navigation.\n\n3. **On the RAG system**: He's building something beyond his contract - a queryable trainer knowledge base so people can get answers or be connected to the right expert. This is authentic to his problem-solving approach.\n\n4. **On \"amps × IQD\"**: The experts DON'T make this mistake - they know customers speak in amps (because generators charge per amp) but do proper calculations. So this is about translating between customer language and technical reality.\n\n5. **On heritage**: NOT about copying specific techniques but learning FIRST PRINCIPLES - both technical and values-based (like curved roads for privacy). The key insight: \"connect with things that make Mosul feel like home to build homes of the future.\" Everyone has memories of grandparents' homes that worked well.\n\n6. **On ToT success**: What excited him most was how engaged everyone was and that they learned FROM EACH OTHER. The community building aspect - bringing together people who normally don't meet across companies/sectors.\n\n7. **On Dr. Omar**: Trust and delegation - Omar has the right background and will bring his own value.\n\n8. **On job placement reality**: He gets why CVs aren't trusted. The key insight: you can give people skills but if nobody wants those skills, it's a problem. This is why MARKET AWARENESS is crucial.\n\n9. **On misconceptions**: This is huge - there are misconceptions about what works/doesn't work. The training needs to create ADVOCATES (both participants and trainers) who share publicly and challenge these misconceptions.\n \nThe energy landscape reveals critical economic and environmental challenges. Current energy systems are unsustainable, with artificially low gas prices masking significant health and urban aesthetic problems. Previous solar initiatives failed due to poor infrastructure - used batteries, inadequate battery management systems, and contractors cutting corners with cheap materials. A breakthrough opportunity emerged through Wifaq, who highlighted government subsidies for construction materials - a potential game-changing leverage point for sustainable development.",

Let me dig deeper on a few things that will make your report authentic and powerful:\n\n## On the RAG system and trainer knowledge base:\n\n**16.

      "content": "Okay. Great. I'm gonna answer the first questions that you asked. That I didn't really answer yet. I as you Reframe that. Yeah. So let's see. Too much information at once. Really? Is that what they said? Yeah. So the difficult thing is we have 5 days, and it was not decided by me. Was thinking 20 days, and I was thinking 4 trainings. But really, I think because we have some constraints, we need to go into 5 days. And that means that we are going to have to have a lot of information. But like I said earlier, we wanna to have a have a yell, m g. To have the information, but to But to, to make it so that people can know the 80 8020. Right? Like, This is the broad overview. You need to know all of these things, all the different ways of intervening, and in the end, your likely going to use this. So for, insulation, it's going to be working on the roof and doing a thermal paint. Sealing the cracks the windows and, which is like a plaster that is, insulating on the walls if there's funds. Otherwise, it's gonna be the first 2. So that's like that's what you do. Whatever the person's situation is, And so I We want them to do that. And Really, no, like, convection and r values and u values and all technical stuff. They're they're also supposed to be technical people to begin with. So we are hoping that they come with some information They they come with some information. And then we want them to be able to learn some new things, particularly Thank you. Less about all this technical stuff and more about how to sell how to install, And to inspire them to start looking for jobs, feeling more confident because they have a certificate from the ITC, which is actually kind of important. It's something we didn't talk about yet. Yeah. And so to feel more confident to just apply for jobs by saying, I did this. Right? I have some skills. Like, I'm not just random person emailing you the fresh bread. So that's one. And, So secondly, and then the other thing is, We want them to, be able to start businesses and to feel confident for that, and that's why we get them to call suppliers. That's really important that they have their own relationships Actually, that's a huge thing that, you know, in terms of, like, the job and marketplace connection part of this report, it's, like, really important, we should emphasize this, in the report. That we want them to build relationships both with the trainers themselves each other, the kind of ecosystem, and also suppliers and customers. And so they're gonna be calling people, talking to people, breaking that sort of inner barrier of feeling like who am I to to do this? And you could give an excuse early because you say, hey. I'm a student. I'm learning. But that opens the door for later things. So that's also another really important element I'd like to take all of these things that I've said, oh, it's really important insightful. Like, let's make sure to keep track of that. And make sure to add it, in the report and that the report kind of emphasize emphasizes it. I'll be with you too. Okay. I think that's good. I think it's good for now. I'll start answering the the other questions. Okay. On the rag side, if it works, what's the dream scenario? So, yeah, the participant I'm I was saying mostly for the trainer at first, but the trainer comes and he says, Oh, shoot. Didn't prepare for the day at all. What am I doing today? And you could just say, okay. So it's day 2. What am I supposed to do? And it tells him, like, these are the main topics. This is what you do. Or, maybe the, trainer says, okay. I can't remember the equation for this. And you gotta talk to And I think that's actually very similar to what the, walk them through the equation and guide them even on the material. I actually have a list of materials a spreadsheet with all the r values, and all the different content that I've, kind of generated over time, not just all the trainer interviews. You know, I have different presentations. I have papers. So, yeah, I wanted to be able to ask that, but then also definitely to be able to get to the the source. And actually to connect to each other, to the trainers, to the supply suppliers. You know? Like, if I put in a supplier database in there, I think I have some some materials that you can say, okay. I I got this project. What's a good material, and what are the, like, specifications? Right? And it should be able to know that and do that. And and the other thing is, like, the the rag is great, but I think that we need to kind of have maybe more structured use cases. So instead of, like, free form text, it's sort of like Mad Libs or something else. I'm not exactly sure. Maybe you can help me think about how to do that best where There's, like, templated, questions and maybe different views or endpoints for different users. Even for the MNE person. Right? Like, it would be great to say, how many interviews, did Belet have? And then they could just say, yeah, x, y, z interviews and show them them. Lots of misconceptions, top 3 misconceptions, Okay. Solar doesn't work. The battery dies, too fast. And the cost of the replacement of the battery is gonna be too, expensive. There's no room in our modern houses for gardens anymore. And the is kind of ignoring the modern, garden design for small spaces that is definitely possible. And even rooftop gardens. And, like, That There's really nothing we can do on the roof after the tile has been installed to reduce, the heat load. I'm not sure that's, like, a huge misconception. I just think it's a blind So it's like misconceptions and blind spots. Just like things that don't people don't even know, like, you could actually have a rooftop garden and what it could provide for you And then the other thing is the, all of the other blind spots have all the benefits. So for instance, people don't even know that increasing, home temperatures increases divorce rates. If they did, they might wanna do something about it. Right? A little bit more instead of just being like, I can deal with it. And other things, in terms of, oh, another one is some people think air conditioners actually filter the air so that the viruses don't come through. But in fact, that's actually why people get sick more in the winter be or summer because they just stay indoors circulating viruses. Not all ACs do that, maybe not most. And then when was the last time you changed your filter? So these are, like, some really important ones. Yeah. Use battery, bed, BMS, contractors pocketing money. Yeah. These are people from the interviews. Multiple people told me the same story for sure. Actually, I asked every trainer, like, what are the biggest problem that you see, when people are doing installs for solar? Need to get them answered in their own way and when I give you the, the transcripts, I think you can find them. I think maybe that should be something that we 4 And, actually, it gets it gives me an idea. Like, I feel like you should help me come up with the prompt, and, like, the ideas that I want to be, asking the extractor that pulls information out of my context and my content for instance, like, the biggest problem, stories, other things that I seem to be missing, I think, are, like, systems thing and, like, working with the governments. It wasn't really a huge one. And we felt definitely had some great ideas. I don't actually know. I think it's like I don't and I think that not a lot of people know about that. Like, nobody else told me about it. Right. And so he mentioned it. I was so excited I did not change the curriculum design because it's it's like it's work to do with the government. To add the materials for installation as a subsidy. It's not it doesn't actually exist yet. For these materials. I don't know exactly what the materials are, but it's, for something else. That he thought we could You know, get on top of and do other things. Make it dangerous for the market, installations specifically. Do we need to add that to this, document? I'm not sure. If That's the most things to this document, instead of putting it into the trainer guide, 3 most things to learn. What about this? What about this? Oh, I think they're nerds, actually. The trainers are big nerds, and they did sort of want to share ideas some of them are really deeply passionate about the participants, and those are the ones that were high I'll answer 24 and 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 3031 the next one.

      "content": "Okay. So this is gonna be the last round of questions. And then I want to think with you about what the prompts are or, like, what the questions I wanna be asking my data are for the reg or you know, to help write the report, Yeah. Even even the reg to help break the report could be good. So I I want something that, like, prompting, structuring the questions, like, what should I be asking, what should I be 4 health. And I'll give you next the, the actual TOR, and I'm just doing the 3rd the third one. There's, like, 3 parts. So I'm gonna be doing the third one. And then, Yeah. Hopefully, that'll be Good. Yeah. Chronologically, it's probably good. Here. Let's go to the questions. Didn't get to all the rest. Right? So let's go over here. I mean, not so NGO about it by, like, pulling punches, not talking about corruption, not talking about you know, people selling bad products and just likes being kinda clear and straightforward is all I mean. Yeah. Bringing them together like a thing. That's actually a really important part of, the project. They're like, what should we do next with the trainers? I think we should at least twice, year, gather them together, ask them how the trainings are going, Although, the you know, maybe we need to do it more during the course of, like, the training. Because the training is gonna happen earlier maybe within a year or 2. So, yeah, gathering them together regularly, most of the space already has convening power, and they have something called climate space they've been doing. And so maybe we can kinda it to that. There are other elements of the, project from project 8, that we could be, leveraging. And we can be, Connecting to we can be connecting to 3 point 2, which I think has, like, a design competition to build 200 houses in Molsland. And they're gonna be trying to get, like, a retrofit product startup basically that they're trying to sponsor. And from there, they want to, build 200 houses as kinda like model homes. Baby. And then from there, so that that's, like, something that we can connect with maybe I was suggesting, but it just is really hard to make these things happen. So I I can put it in the recommendation can tell them I've told them a 100 times, but I don't really know how to just maybe I'm not politically savvy enough. But basically, they're gonna be doing their design competition. And gonna be spending money on the events. We don't have as much money in our budget for hosting events, but I think we should do Sort of like a like a a green home festival or something where we get the different, people, from the the okay? Hi, blubber. Where we get to, bring the market together, all the suppliers and the vendors and the students and the participants And the glover glover. Hope it's your body. Hello. And the participants and to get them to do something in at this you know, to bring them all together and, like, what is it called? A fair or showcase or something like that. Green business fair where where we can actually see all the products, that are available people could be, you know, maybe even having launching for their business or, like, raising money or, like, we could do matchmaking, mentors and cofounders and Like, you know, we could do so much. If we had The this fair or this event I could have, like, a jobs fair, you know? And things like that. And so And so I think we should do that, but where we're gonna get the money to do it? What project is it gonna connect to? We're doing 3.3. It could be a part of the design competition, you know, At the end of the design competition, Connected the homes they're showcasing of the, designs for the, retrofit projects for the homes we already had a hackathon last year. We have the beginning of, like, all these different pieces of community, from the hackathon from all of the trainers that I've been talking to, for so long. You know, like, I've I've annoyed them so much. Over this time period. And now they've they started to meet each other. And so I feel like we really can activate and galvanize this momentum. And, actually, I ask you a question. Like, how can we like, now that you know about all this, how can we really, take advantage of this to do something great, you know, and really activate the community and leverage, all of the different moving pieces of this project from the homes to the design competition, to the training, that we're doing and to put them together. And this is why I've been thinking about and wondering about there's 2 things. You know? Like, I I guess I'm, like, a digital person. So I was like, oh, is there, like, a digital home? Know, maybe it's connected to the reg element, but just like one place where people can see all the different things. Right? And then we can have all of our different trainers. And maybe that could be a good thing. Have you leaned in your leg? And we can have all of the different trainers that have been selected and their credentials and even, like, the participants. And so we can even say, like, these people went through this program hire them. Here's their LinkedIns, and we can connect their LinkedIn profile. And and other things like that. And that could be great. If they don't have a LinkedIn, that should be something that we do. And I really feel like that kind of thing where maybe initially I was thinking of it more as like, oh, here's a here's a website that has everything. You know, the materials, the suppliers, the data sheets, the training. You can even go on to do the training. But instead, maybe we could just, think of it as, like, the thing that houses the community. You know? And that's, like, one of the things that they've asked me to suggest. Like, what are the next steps? And I think seeing these people in action and especially when I send you the, the, TOT session audio as Arabic files, and the upcoming chats. Maybe you'll have some more ideas. I'll first only share the TOR, like, report But I don't necessarily just wanna do the report. Like, I wanna do a good job and wrap it up well. I've been working with them for almost a year and a half, so do it good. Doing this for a year. One thing about learning design that I didn't know before I guess, what can we say? Yeah. I think something about Making things simpler. Even simpler. You know? And having you know, splitting the day into 3 pieces and having, like, one clear message for each day one clear message for the like, the reason. Right? Like, why are people What are they why are they even showing up? For the trainers, for people, giving them, like, reasons and then ways that all the different and and building blocks, like add up to that. So you know, I think that's really great. Just, I I feel like I just don't want people to get lost. Know? And I want them to be excited. Does it have any initial fiddler? Hardest trade off. It's about time Yeah. I wanted more hands on stuff, like I think it would be really great if people were actually Just, you know, More hands on. Just, like, doing things, getting, a feel for the materials, installing it multiple times, and really just getting more, like, community and, like, team orientation and getting everyone to feel like they're a part of a single project and team and getting them to go and tour the city and to, like, document, the existing Like, green architecture that's still there, and then to, think for themselves and come up with their own principles and to, like, really work in this kind of different way. But of all, it would be hard to teach other people how to do that. I feel like that would be something that would take a longer t o t to get people to think differently about training, not being something that you give, but but, experience that you create that creates co learning moments. And, yeah, also more hands on stuff and things like that. And let's do the new questions, man. There's just so many questions. Everyone has grandparents' homes. Yeah. Some people talked about their The homes of their families Saders Lake. Oh, Barhead. Wow. Yes. And yeah, that was an icebreaker. And so I'm continuing to use that icebreaker. Actually, that's an important thing to have, icebreakers. Like, we need to talk about all the icebreakers everyone should be doing every day.",

Maybe you have questions for me on Like, how we can make the right prompts better. So maybe you can ask me some questions to make sure I got you get the right information. And then for And also, like, yeah, I wanna think with you. I I asked you some questions about the rag and about having kind of templatized Mad Lib style things, what are other ways that we can do that? And maybe you can have 3 ideas about ways to do that better so we get structured Questions and not just, like, people looking at a blank screen with a cursor and wondering what's Okay. It's 24. Yeah. We already did that one. Specific moment. Yeah. Definitely saw them connecting. We're all on the same WhatsApp groups. They don't need to exchange numbers. But, people were asking each other about some of these kind of alternative things that they've done that Don't happen that often, and they wanted to get photos and, stories about people that did basically, like, insulating from the inside. You know, it's it's usually better to insulate the roof from the outside but one of the people had, like, an insulation from the inside, because of some constraints, I don't remember why he couldn't do outside. And everyone was super interested to figure out how and what and A cool fiddler. Uncle Fitbit, play your time. And so, yeah. The, That was that was cool. Especially when they're, like, no way. Like, doesn't make sense. And he was like, yeah. It does. I can show you the numbers. And so got into it and kinda nerdy. About that kind of stuff, and I thought that was great. Specific moments connecting reunion. Yeah. They definitely had lunch together. I mean, it felt fun. It was nice. I think, everyone kind of connected. And we actually this is one really important thing. Every time I do my thing, I always tell people to have good intentions. Like, We're here to stack all the intentions. Right? So we're here for the benefit of people. Are living in difficult situations and paying too much and want to benefit them by saving money and save also protect the environment and, pollution and also to, know, at some level, I'll make money and have a job. And so and feed our families. And so how can we set ourselves up to be in service so that we, connect to this idea of the Muslim tradition that actions by their intentions and to try to make this entire project, an act of worship. I think it would be beautiful. And very culturally relevant, and everyone really resonated with that idea. And so, basically, I said that every single it's it's another one of those one thing things where I'm trying to get one thing all the way through. Who is your primary audience? Yeah. It's like the potential customers, I think. Initially, for the solar, and installation and architecture. We want them to be on Uh-huh. To get at least growing awareness. And to grow that And then the bosses that the junior architects think won't go for green design, they kind of get convinced when people get convinced. So that's why we are inviting the bosses to the final day where they're presenting their designs, with the community of people they designed it for. Biggest thing I learned about training design I think it's about Yeah. Doing things in a way where there's one clear message, I think, is super important so people know what they're doing and what they're taking away. And not, you know, having all the content, but people, listen. If you if you get this one thing, you're good today. No. I think I answered all those questions already about trade off in the curriculum and stuff. Yeah. It was my idea. Okay. Well, now let's highlight the students, learning thing. To kind of help them ease into the marketplace and develop relationships. I think that's another important thing. I wanted to say, like, hey. You're gonna develop relationships in this thing. And that's gonna be something that you take out of the training. It's not just the knowledge or the skills. Advocacy action. Yeah. I definitely, we should talk with Wipao and get the ideas and ask ITC to explore these options and and others. I know they're already talking with the government but exactly how I know that there's something about the, the engineers union. It's like one of the communities that we are working with and they're going to be contributing to the project And really important to involve them, but I'm not exactly sure how. It's like what exactly is this engineers union? I know that it's a big deal in Iraq, and I think when people graduate, they become a part of it. Maybe you have some more information about that, but my colleague, Lada, has the one in interacting with him mostly. Yeah. So One of the participants, Omar, basically, like, I've had maybe 3 or 4 calls before the TOT and, he was has a lot of experience. And there's not a lot of people that have this, experience. He's an architect, and he just is passionate. And he keeps, like, very sharing and caring and his primary idea is, like, if you really help people, you will make a business, you'll make a life, and you know that you're really successful when people start inviting you to their weddings. And that's really beautiful. Rag system, it's not really done, so I'm not really sure I want to supereemphasize it. Yeah. Different endpoints for different users. So a trainer was the initial use case. I was thinking about participants, maybe, to be able to find, like, materials and equations and stuff. And the ITC just to, like, ask questions like, well, how many trainings have happened? Oh, sorry. How many, t o TOT trainings happened? Was the percentage of men and women, etcetera? And, yeah. I think that's it. And I'll give you the some of the content from the DOT is next. And then Maybe you could even run it against the rag questions, or you can even, like, ask me the right questions yourself. And find ways of maybe getting more insights from me to develop the right questions better. So we can see kind of, like, a demo response. Because you're a LLM, so you can, you know, pretend to be taking this rag question against the content. That I'll share in the next message.",

Maybe you have questions for me on Like, how we can make the right prompts better. So maybe you can ask me some questions to make sure I got you get the right information. And then for And also, like, yeah, I wanna think with you. I I asked you some questions about the rag and about having kind of templatized Mad Lib style things, what are other ways that we can do that? And maybe you can have 3 ideas about ways to do that better so we get structured Questions and not just, like, people looking at a blank screen with a cursor and wondering what's Okay. It's 24. Yeah. We already did that one. Specific moment. Yeah. Definitely saw them connecting. We're all on the same WhatsApp groups. They don't need to exchange numbers. But, people were asking each other about some of these kind of alternative things that they've done that Don't happen that often, and they wanted to get photos and, stories about people that did basically, like, insulating from the inside. You know, it's it's usually better to insulate the roof from the outside but one of the people had, like, an insulation from the inside, because of some constraints, I don't remember why he couldn't do outside. And everyone was super interested to figure out how and what and A cool fiddler. Uncle Fitbit, play your time. And so, yeah. The, That was that was cool. Especially when they're, like, no way. Like, doesn't make sense. And he was like, yeah. It does. I can show you the numbers. And so got into it and kinda nerdy. About that kind of stuff, and I thought that was great. Specific moments connecting reunion. Yeah. They definitely had lunch together. I mean, it felt fun. It was nice. I think, everyone kind of connected. And we actually this is one really important thing. Every time I do my thing, I always tell people to have good intentions. Like, We're here to stack all the intentions. Right? So we're here for the benefit of people. Are living in difficult situations and paying too much and want to benefit them by saving money and save also protect the environment and, pollution and also to, know, at some level, I'll make money and have a job. And so and feed our families. And so how can we set ourselves up to be in service so that we, connect to this idea of the Muslim tradition that actions by their intentions and to try to make this entire project, an act of worship. I think it would be beautiful. And very culturally relevant, and everyone really resonated with that idea. And so, basically, I said that every single it's it's another one of those one thing things where I'm trying to get one thing all the way through. Who is your primary audience? Yeah. It's like the potential customers, I think. Initially, for the solar, and installation and architecture. We want them to be on Uh-huh. To get at least growing awareness. And to grow that And then the bosses that the junior architects think won't go for green design, they kind of get convinced when people get convinced. So that's why we are inviting the bosses to the final day where they're presenting their designs, with the community of people they designed it for. Biggest thing I learned about training design I think it's about Yeah. Doing things in a way where there's one clear message, I think, is super important so people know what they're doing and what they're taking away. And not, you know, having all the content, but people, listen. If you if you get this one thing, you're good today. No. I think I answered all those questions already about trade off in the curriculum and stuff. Yeah. It was my idea. Okay. Well, now let's highlight the students, learning thing. To kind of help them ease into the marketplace and develop relationships. I think that's another important thing. I wanted to say, like, hey. You're gonna develop relationships in this thing. And that's gonna be something that you take out of the training. It's not just the knowledge or the skills. Advocacy action. Yeah. I definitely, we should talk with Wipao and get the ideas and ask ITC to explore these options and and others.

Works offline-first if you pre-populate common scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## My recommendation: Combine all 3\n\n- **Dashboard (Idea 1)** for quick access to common tasks\n- **Conversational flow (Idea 2)** for exploratory/learning tasks\n- **Template library (Idea 3)** for producing outputs (proposals, portfolios, lesson plans)\n\nBehind the scenes, all three interfaces query the same RAG system, but the UX matches the **job to be done**.\n\n---\n\n## Now answer my 5 questions above, and then share the content!\n\nOnce you send the ToT transcripts + key docs, I'll:\n1. **Demo the RAG** by answering sample queries against your actual content\n2. **Draft sections of your report** using real quotes/data\n3. **Suggest specific prompt templates** for the three interface ideas\n\nReady when you are! 🚀",

MY ROLE & PROJECT OVERVIEW\n\n### What was my specific role?\n\n\"My specific role was to design the curriculum and to Interview all of the experts and to extract their insights and to make a training program that will be able to guide Recent graduates technical experts into potentially 3 different tracks.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this for about a year now. I'm interviewing a lot of trainers. I have the transcripts from all my interviews.\"\n\n\"I live in France. I had to fly to Iraq and call these people over and over until I finally started to understand what's going on.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. THE THREE TRACKS - DIFFERENT GOALS\n\n### Track 1: INSULATION\n\n**The Market Gap:**\n\"Mosul really needs a cultural shift in understanding the importance of insulation and opening up this idea of, like, energy consulting as a field. And so there aren't people that go and kind of assess homes and, identify if efficiencies that are possible through retrofitting.\"\n\n**The Goal:**\n\"Get people with some technical background to understand how to the different options and opportunities for retrofitting homes and increasing their value... increasing their value and also decreasing their cost over the long term by reducing energy expenditures while also having a lot of other returns on investment from quality of life standards and health and all that.\"\n\n**What They Need to Learn:**\n\"There's an element that needs to be about financial literacy. There's element that needs to be about soft skills and sales, and there's an element that needs to be about awareness and making sure that the classes create these opportunities for exposing people to ideas and then there's an element of Technical skills and and learning how to do stuff.\"\n\n\"Putting it all together, like, you go, you assess the house, you identify areas of intervention, and then you can actually implement them. And you also understand that that could be a business. And so we want them to develop that competence over that training.\"\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\"We really expect them and hope that they will go and do an install. And if they do an install, then we're gonna meet up a month after.\"\n\n### Track 2: SOLAR\n\n**The Market Reality:**\n\"For solar, it's a recognized field. There already are solar companies, providing the in Mosul, it's pretty standardized, and we want to help grow the market by increasing the number of people who can do the work.\"\n\n**The Challenge:**\n\"Also getting them ideas about how to sell it because a lot of the challenge with the solar market is that people don't think it's actually appropriate for Mosul, and they need to be convinced. And part of the reason why they're not convinced is that previous installers were using low quality materials leading to bad outcomes and, not the best ROI.\"\n\n**The Goal:**\n\"Train recently graduated electrical engineers on solar skills, along with a lot of the other same skills from the previous training in terms of sales and pitching and creating ROI and stuff like that.\"\n\n**Expected Outcome (Different from Insulation):**\n\"We don't actually like them to be able to start a business immediately. We kind of expect them to join another person's team, because it's a bit of a challenge to start from scratch without having any learning on another person's team.\"\n\n\"At the end of the program, we really expect them and hope that they will go and do an install. And if they do an install, then we're gonna meet up a month after.\"\n\n### Track 3: ARCHITECTURE\n\n**The Context:**\n\"Before Mosul was destroyed, a lot of the architecture was actually quite appropriate for the environment, and it's only modern architecture that really moves away from it for speed for cost, and for copying the west.\"\n\n**The Goal:**\n\"We're trying to do is make new things that are worth copying that are worth copying for Mosul.\"\n\n**The Audience:**\n\"We're working with junior architects who apparently all already believe in green design. The challenge is that don't think their bosses also believe in it, but they just don't think that the market is ready for it.\"\n\n**The Approach:**\n\"A lot of what we're doing in the architecture module is simply creating awareness and having people design things and share it on social media so that, you know, we're gonna be training 100 people. And so if each of them is sharing, then we're creating a bit of impact on the consciousness.\"\n\n\"Looking back to leap forward, learning from the past, combining it with modern science, and creating sort of new designs.\"\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\"The one for the architecture is gonna be a design competition. During class, everyone's gonna have a different standard because everyone's gonna have clients they're gonna be talking to them, learning emotional intelligence and pitching skills to try to really learn how to convince the person to go with their design. But the final design project is gonna be - they're all gonna have the same project.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. DESIGN PRINCIPLES & CURRICULUM DECISIONS\n\n### The 5-Day Constraint\n\n\"The difficult thing is we have 5 days, and it was not decided by me. I was thinking 20 days, and I was thinking 4 trainings. But really, I think because we have some constraints, we need to go into 5 days.\"\n\n\"That means that we are going to have to have a lot of information. But like I said earlier, we wanna have the information, but to make it so that people can know the 80/20.\"\n\n### The 80/20 Approach\n\n\"This is the broad overview. You need to know all of these things, all the different ways of intervening, and in the end, you're likely going to use this.\"\n\n\"For insulation, it's going to be working on the roof and doing a thermal paint, sealing the cracks in the windows and, which is like a plaster that is insulating on the walls if there's funds. Otherwise, it's gonna be the first 2. So that's like that's what you do.\"\n\n\"We wanted to give them the 80% 80/20. Right? So, like, you learn this few things, and you'll be dangerous in the market, and you can actually have a business.\"\n\n### \"One Clear Message\" Per Day\n\n\"I feel like I just don't want people to get lost. And I want them to be excited.\"\n\n\"One clear message, I think, is super important so people know what they're doing and what they're taking away. And not, you know, having all the content, but people, listen. If you get this one thing, you're good today.\"\n\n### Hands-On Practice & Stations\n\n\"It was during the sessions that people kept saying, like, but what about this? But what about this? You know?\"\n\n\"One of the things that I'm trying to do is actually make that trainer database visible and queryable... if the trainers have a question or even if the participants have a question, can actually ask that.\"\n\n\"We split the room (~20 people) into small groups that rotate across 3 stations to touch materials, run quick trials, and take photos, then regroup for reflection. Stations reduce overload and keep it real.\"\n\n### Building Relationships (KEY INSIGHT)\n\n\"We want them to build relationships both with the trainers themselves, each other, the kind of ecosystem, and also suppliers and customers.\"\n\n\"They're gonna be calling people, talking to people, breaking that sort of inner barrier of feeling like who am I to do this? And you could give an excuse early because you say, hey. I'm a student. I'm learning. But that opens the door for later things.\"\n\n**[IMPORTANT: This \"I'm a student, I'm learning\" was MY IDEA]**\n\n\"I think that's another important thing. I wanted to say, like, hey. You're gonna develop relationships in this thing. And that's gonna be something that you take out of the training. It's not just the knowledge or the skills.\"\n\n### The Importance of Certification\n\n\"Feeling more confident because they have a certificate from the ITC, which is actually kind of important. It's something we didn't talk about yet. To feel more confident to just apply for jobs by saying, I did this. Right? I have some skills. Like, I'm not just random person emailing you fresh grad.\"\n\n---\n\n## 4. ToT EXPERIENCE (October 12-14, 2025)\n\n### Who Were the Trainers?\n\n\"The people that were in the ToT were the people that I was talking to to learn all this stuff. Like, I I live in France. I have no idea.\"\n\n\"All of the trainers are the ones that have derived all these insights from.\"\n\n### What Worked\n\n**Engagement & Discussion:**\n\"I was really excited about was just how engaged and active everyone was. We were really having a great discussion and I really felt like they were really there to learn and grow, and that actually one of the really cool things is I feel like they were learning from each other.\"\n\n**Community Building:**\n\"Just bringing them together made them feel like a thing. These people don't meet each other. They all work at different companies and do different things even.\"\n\n\"Every time I do my thing, I always tell people to have good intentions. We're here to stack all the intentions. We're here for the benefit of people living in difficult situations and paying too much and want to benefit them by saving money and save also protect the environment and pollution... to connect to this idea of the Muslim tradition that actions by their intentions and to try to make this entire project an act of worship. I think it would be beautiful and very culturally relevant, and everyone really resonated with that idea.\"\n\n**Specific Connecting Moment:**\n\"People were asking each other about some of these kind of alternative things that they've done that don't happen that often, and they wanted to get photos and stories about people that did basically, like, insulating from the inside. You know, it's usually better to insulate the roof from the outside but one of the people had, like, an insulation from the inside because of some constraints... And everyone was super interested to figure out how and what... especially when they're, like, no way. Like, doesn't make sense. And he was like, yeah. It does. I can show you the numbers. And so got into it and kinda nerdy about that kind of stuff, and I thought that was great.\"\n\n\"They definitely had lunch together. It felt fun. It was nice. I think everyone kind of connected.\"\n\n### What Needs Adjustment\n\n**\"Too Much Information at Once\":**\n\"It was during the sessions that people kept saying, like, but what about this? But what about this?\"\n\n\"The report mentions participants asked for 'simple diagrams/decision trees to structure complex choices.'\"\n\n\"The way that I anticipated it or what I was really thinking is, like, we have 5 days... I don't want the complicated stuff. I think the complicated stuff has to be in the trainer's knowledge base in their mind, but the participant we need to give him the larger context, say, but for you, learn how to do this one thing well.\"\n\n**Need for Visual Scaffolds:**\n\"Some of them are really deeply passionate about the participants... I think they're nerds, actually.\"\n\n### Dr. Omar's Role\n\n\"He's the person who's taking forward the activity for the ToT. And he has all of the right backgrounds and knowledge. I train him on the content. I think he appreciates the content, but I think he'll bring a lot to the table as well.\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. MISCONCEPTIONS & MARKET BARRIERS\n\n### TOP 3 MISCONCEPTIONS\n\n**1. Solar doesn't work / batteries die too fast:**\n\"Solar doesn't work. The battery dies too fast. And the cost of the replacement of the battery is gonna be too expensive.\"\n\n**WHY this misconception exists:**\n\"The reason why all of the solar was bad is because people buying literally used batteries. Bad BMSs. And installation - people are skimping out because they can pocket some money if they use cheaper insulation and just keep the rest from a government contract.\"\n\n**2. No room for gardens in modern houses:**\n\"There's no room in our modern houses for gardens anymore. And that is kind of ignoring the modern garden design for small spaces that is definitely possible. And even rooftop gardens.\"\n\n**3. Nothing can be done on roofs after tiles are installed:**\n\"There's really nothing we can do on the roof after the tile has been installed to reduce the heat load. I'm not sure that's, like, a huge misconception. I just think it's a blind spot... people don't even know, like, you could actually have a rooftop garden and what it could provide for you.\"\n\n### Blind Spots (Things People Don't Know)\n\n\"All of the other blind spots have all the benefits. For instance, people don't even know that increasing home temperatures increases divorce rates. If they did, they might wanna do something about it.\"\n\n\"Some people think air conditioners actually filter the air so that the viruses don't come through. But in fact, that's actually why people get sick more in the winter [or summer] because they just stay indoors circulating viruses. Not all ACs do that, maybe not most. And then when was the last time you changed your filter?\"\n\n### Quality Issues in the Market\n\n**From multiple expert interviews:**\n\"Previous installers were using low quality materials leading to bad outcomes and not the best ROI.\"\n\n\"People buying literally used batteries. Bad BMSs. Installation - people are skimping out because they can pocket some money if they use cheaper insulation and just keep the rest from a government contract.\"\n\n---\n\n## 6. THE \"kWh NOT AMPS × IQD\" CRUSADE\n\n### Why This Matters So Much\n\n**Where the bad habit comes from:**\n\"The experts, you know, they understand that the customer speaks in amps because they pay per amp by the generator company. But in the end, they need to do the math and all the calculations with the appropriate measures.\"\n\n**What we're teaching instead:**\n\"Use U-value references and kWh-based reasoning when talking about performance/benefits and ROI. Verify numbers locally before claiming ranges in slides or handouts.\"\n\n\"We want them to do that. And really, know, like, convection and R values and U values and all technical stuff. They're supposed to be technical people to begin with.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. JOB PLACEMENT & PARTNERSHIPS\n\n### The Reality of Hiring in Mosul\n\n**From Zeina Tareq (expert interview):**\n\"CVs aren't trusted → practical trials used. Typical hiring: trial month (low/no pay) to test competence.\"\n\n**From Hossam Al-Deen Khalil:**\n\"Volunteer period → hire those who adapt and execute. Idea: coordinate field placements with companies; propose the institution covers trainee salaries for ~2 months to de-risk hiring.\"\n\n### My Reaction to This\n\n\"I understand that. I know there's a lot of people looking for jobs. And this is a part of the reason why I think we have to work on the market as well as the job side.\"\n\n\"You can give people skills, but if nobody wants those skills, it's gonna be a problem. This is why a big part of the training is this awareness campaign.\"\n\n### Partners Identified\n\n**Solar:**\n- Voltage Co.\n- Energy Solutions\n- Mosul Space (site access, supervised installs, mentors)\n\n**Insulation/Materials:**\n- SIKA (Erbil)\n- SMTC\n- Al-Ghanim\n- Beltec\n- Al-Wissam\n(material demos, visits, pricing, samples)\n\n**Architecture/Heritage:**\n- Mosul Heritage House (بيت التراث)\n- Dr. Omar (venue, case houses, integration)\n\n**Networks & QA:**\n- Engineering Union (trainer pipeline, QA, venue, outreach)\n\n---\n\n## 8. WIFAQ'S GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY INSIGHT (HUGE)\n\n### What Wifaq Said\n\n\"One of the biggest and exciting insights that I had was that the government does sort of have subsidies for materials for construction, where they can say, hey. I bought this material they can get money back. And that sounds like a huge opportunity, and Wifaq is the one who told me that.\"\n\n### My Reaction\n\n\"When Wifaq told you about this subsidy, what was your immediate reaction?\"\n\n\"I was so excited!\"\n\n### Current Status & Barriers\n\n\"It doesn't actually exist yet for these [insulation] materials. I don't know exactly what the materials are, but it's for something else that he thought we could get on top of and do other things.\"\n\n\"It did not change the curriculum design because it's work to do with the government to add the materials for installation as a subsidy.\"\n\n### What Should Happen\n\n\"We definitely should talk with Wifaq and get the ideas and ask ITC to explore these options and others. I know they're already talking with the government but exactly how...\"\n\n\"I know that there's something about the engineers union. It's like one of the communities that we are working with and they're going to be contributing to the project... I'm not exactly sure how. It's like what exactly is this engineers union? I know that it's a big deal in Iraq, and I think when people graduate, they become a part of it.\"\n\n---\n\n## 9. HERITAGE & \"LOOKING BACK TO LEAP FORWARD\"\n\n### First Principles, Not Copying\n\n\"I think there's not exactly a specific heritage technique. What I would like them to do is learn the first principles because they think that the past is some frozen thing that we're going to copy and suddenly everything will be okay, it's not true. We need to be inspired by the principles, and some of them are values based. They're not just technical.\"\n\n### Examples of Values-Based Principles\n\n\"For instance, a lot of roads are curved because it creates a sense of privacy. You can't look so far and, like, gaze at people who are walking by.\"\n\n\"I'd like to appreciate that the past has something to teach us. And that, by instead of copying and just rushing into things, if we really connect with the things that make Mosul feel like home, we can build the homes of the future. And I actually like that kind of framing.\"\n\n### The Grandparents' Home Icebreaker\n\n\"Everybody has memories of their grandparents' homes and places that they've been in Mosul that, like, surprisingly are great even in some of the hotter days or colder days even, because Mosul does have both.\"\n\n\"Some people talked about their homes of their families. And yeah, that was an icebreaker. And so I'm continuing to use that icebreaker. Actually, that's an important thing to have, icebreakers.\"\n\n---\n\n## 10. SUSTAINABILITY & COMMUNITY BUILDING\n\n### The Monthly Reunion Idea\n\n\"At the end of the program is, we really expect them and hope that they will go and do an install. And if they do an install, then we're gonna meet up a month after.\"\n\n\"A big part of what we do with the jobs element is the month after training we're gonna be bringing all the people together.\"\n\n\"For the insulation and the solar is going to be: Did you get to install something? Did you take what you learned and actually implement it? The one for the architecture is gonna be a design competition.\"\n\n### Green Home Festival / Fair (KEY RECOMMENDATION)\n\n**The Vision:**\n\"I was thinking we should do sort of like a green home festival or something where we get the different people from the... to bring the market together, all the suppliers and the vendors and the students and the participants... to get them to do something... to bring them all together and, like, a fair or showcase or something like that. Green business fair.\"\n\n**What Could Happen:**\n\"We can actually see all the products that are available, people could be maybe even having launching for their business or raising money or we could do matchmaking, mentors and cofounders... we could do so much.\"\n\n\"It could have a jobs fair, you know? And things like that.\"\n\n**How to Make It Happen:**\n\"I think we should do that, but where we're gonna get the money to do it? What project is it gonna connect to? We're doing 3.3. It could be a part of the design competition... connected to the homes they're showcasing of the designs for the retrofit projects.\"\n\n\"They're gonna be doing their design competition and gonna be spending money on the events. We don't have as much money in our budget for hosting events... they're gonna be spending money on the events, so if we had this fair or this event...\"\n\n**Connection to Other BEIT Components:**\n\"There's 3.2, which I think has a design competition to build 200 houses in Mosul. And they're gonna be trying to get a retrofit product startup basically that they're trying to sponsor. And from there, they want to build 200 houses as kinda like model homes.\"\n\n### Digital Community Hub\n\n**The Evolution of My Thinking:**\n\"I'm, like, a digital person. So I was like, oh, is there, like, a digital home? Maybe it's connected to the RAG element, but just like one place where people can see all the different things.\"\n\n\"We can have all of the different trainers that have been selected and their credentials and even the participants. And so we can even say, like, these people went through this program hire them. Here's their LinkedIns, and we can connect their LinkedIn profile.\"\n\n\"Initially I was thinking of it more as like, oh, here's a website that has everything. The materials, the suppliers, the data sheets, the training. You can even go on to do the training. But instead, maybe we could just think of it as the thing that houses the community.\"\n\n### WhatsApp Groups\n\n\"Create cohort WhatsApp for homework, supplier photos, and quick questions.\"\n\n\"We're all on the same WhatsApp groups. They don't need to exchange numbers.\"\n\n### Bi-Annual Trainer Gatherings\n\n\"They're like, what should we do next with the trainers? I think we should at least twice a year gather them together, ask them how the trainings are going.\"\n\n\"Maybe we need to do it more during the course of the training. Because the training is gonna happen... maybe within a year or 2.\"\n\n\"Mosul Space already has convening power, and they have something called Climate Space they've been doing. And so maybe we can kinda connect it to that.\"\n\n---\n\n## 11. THE RAG SYSTEM (Beyond Contract Scope)\n\n### Why I'm Building It\n\n\"It's a little bit beyond my contract. But it's something that I thought was cool to do. I'm not sure if I'm just overdoing it, though.\"\n\n\"One of the things that I'm trying to do is actually make that trainer database visible and queryable... if the trainers have a question or even if the participants have a question, can actually ask that.\"\n\n### What Goes Into It\n\n\"I actually have a list of materials, a spreadsheet with all the R values, and all the different content that I've kind of generated over time, not just all the trainer interviews. You know, I have different presentations. I have papers.\"\n\n### Use Cases\n\n**For Trainers:**\n\"The trainer comes and he says, oh, shoot. Didn't prepare for the day at all. What am I doing today? And you could just say, okay. So it's day 2. What am I supposed to do? And it tells him, like, these are the main topics. This is what you do.\"\n\n\"Or maybe the trainer says, okay. I can't remember the equation for this. And you gotta talk to... walk them through the equation and guide them even on the material.\"\n\n**For Everyone:**\n\"To be able to ask that, but then also definitely to be able to get to the source. And actually to connect to each other, to the trainers, to the suppliers.\"\n\n\"If I put in a supplier database in there, I think I have some materials that you can say, okay. I got this project. What's a good material, and what are the specifications?\"\n\n### Future Maintenance\n\n\"Maybe they can hire me for that. Could be cool, because I would like another contract. I could be in charge of kind of the data warehousing and all they have to do is send me the trainer audio.\"\n\n---\n\n## 12. WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT TRAINING DESIGN\n\n### The Biggest Surprise\n\n\"Biggest thing I learned about training design... I think it's about doing things in a way where there's one clear message, I think, is super important so people know what they're doing and what they're taking away.\"\n\n\"Making things simpler. Even simpler. And having, you know, splitting the day into 3 pieces and having, like, one clear message for each day... giving them reasons and then ways that all the different building blocks add up to that.\"\n\n\"I feel like I just don't want people to get lost. And I want them to be excited.\"\n\n### The Hardest Trade-Off\n\n\"It's about time. I wanted more hands on stuff. I think it would be really great if people were actually just doing things, getting a feel for the materials, installing it multiple times, and really just getting more community and team orientation.\"\n\n\"Getting everyone to feel like they're a part of a single project and team and getting them to go and tour the city and to document the existing green architecture that's still there, and then to think for themselves and come up with their own principles.\"\n\n\"But first of all, it would be hard to teach other people how to do that. I feel like that would be something that would take a longer ToT to get people to think differently about training, not being something that you give, but experience that you create that creates co-learning moments.\"\n\n---\n\n## 13. PASSIONATE TRAINERS - OMAR'S STORY\n\n\"One of the participants, Omar, basically, I've had maybe 3 or 4 calls before the ToT and he has a lot of experience. And there's not a lot of people that have this experience. He's an architect, and he just is passionate. And he keeps sharing and caring.\"\n\n\"His primary idea is: if you really help people, you will make a business, you'll make a life, and you know that you're really successful when people start inviting you to their weddings. And that's really beautiful.\"\n\n---\n\n## 14. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REPORT\n\n### On Awareness\n\n\"I think the important element from the training is going to be to have the participants become advocates and the trainers to become advocates and to have them share and to do things that are public.\"\n\n\"This is why I was thinking of having the design competition and other things and just to be not so UN based NGO about it.\"\n\n### What \"Not So UN-NGO\" Means\n\n\"Pulling punches, not talking about corruption, not talking about people selling bad products... just being kinda clear and straightforward is all I mean.\"\n\n\"We know that prices for gas are gonna rise and oil based on the trends and what the government is doing. And so gonna become more expensive. And right now, we know that they're way cheaper than they actually really should be. And that it's horrible for our health, and we don't like the sound, and we don't like the way our city looks.\"\n\n### On Working with Government\n\n\"We really need to double down on how to also collaborate the governments and the whole system in a legit [way].\"\n\n---\n\n## 15. TECHNICAL DETAILS TO REMEMBER\n\n### For Insulation - The 80/20 Basics\n\n\"For insulation, it's going to be working on the roof and doing a thermal paint, sealing the cracks in the windows and, which is like a plaster that is insulating on the walls if there's funds. Otherwise, it's gonna be the first 2.\"\n\n### Materials & Suppliers\n\n\"I actually have a list of materials, a spreadsheet with all the R values.\"\n\n### The Numbers Page Template\n\n\"Use U-value references and kWh-based reasoning when talking about performance/benefits and ROI.\"\n\n---\n\n## 16. ICEBREAKERS & TEACHING AIDS TO DOCUMENT\n\n1. **Grandparents' homes memory** - values-based, connects to heritage\n2. **\"Actions by their intentions\"** - spiritual framing, culturally relevant\n3. **\"I'm a student, I'm learning\"** - phone script for calling suppliers\n4. **Decision trees / visual scaffolds** - to reduce cognitive overload\n\n---\n\n## 17. IMPORTANT THINGS NOT TO FORGET\n\n- \"I have some some materials that you can say... this is really important, insightful. Like, let's make sure to keep track of that.\"\n- The relationship-building aspect is CRITICAL\n- The certificate matters for confidence\n- Students calling suppliers breaks psychological barrier\n- Community feeling > information transfer\n- Trainers learning from each other during ToT\n- \"If you get this one thing, you're good today\" messaging\n\n---\n\n*End of verbatim content extraction.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nBetween October 2024 and October 2025, the International Trade Centre worked with local partners in Mosul to develop and pilot a training-of-trainers program aimed at launching a green housing market in Iraq. This report covers the delivery of Output 3: Training of Trainers activities, development of an apprenticeship framework, and recommendations for long-term sustainability.\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\nOver three intensive days (October 12-14, 2025), we convened expert trainers from across Mosul's construction, solar, and architecture sectors to prepare them to deliver three distinct training modules:\n\n1. **Insulation & Thermal Envelope** - creating a new market for energy consultants and retrofit specialists\n2. **Solar Energy Systems** - growing the solar installer workforce and improving market quality\n3. **Heritage-Informed Architecture** - reconnecting modern design with Mosul's architectural wisdom\n\nThe ToT brought together trainers who had been interviewed individually over the previous year but had rarely met each other as a community. This convening created something unexpected and valuable: a coalition of practitioners who can now support each other, share knowledge, and collectively shift market perceptions about green building in Mosul.\n\n### Three Core Insights\n\n**1. We're building a coalition, not just delivering training.**  \nThe trainers aren't contractors hired to deliver content—they're the experts who co-created this curriculum through months of interviews and iteration. Bringing them together revealed how much they can learn from each other. One trainer's unconventional solution (insulating a roof from the inside) sparked a technical debate that taught everyone more than any slide deck could.\n\n**2. Simplicity is the unlock.**  \nWith only five days per module, we can't teach everything. What we can do is teach the 80/20: the few interventions that work in most Mosul homes (roof insulation, thermal paint, window sealing) and the financial literacy to sell them. Participants need one clear takeaway per day. Trainers need decision trees, not encyclopedias. Complexity belongs in the trainer's mind; clarity belongs in the participant's hands.\n\n**3. Relationships are the real curriculum.**  \nBeyond technical skills, trainees need confidence to enter the market. We designed specific mechanisms to build this: participants call suppliers during training (\"I'm a student, I'm learning\" opens doors), trainers become mentors, cohorts stay connected via WhatsApp, and everyone meets again one month later to showcase what they built. The training creates a network that outlasts the five days.\n\n### Three Priority Recommendations\n\n**1. Launch a Green Home Festival/Fair (Leverage 3.2 Design Competition)**  \nThe BEIT project is funding a design competition to showcase 200 retrofitted homes. This is the perfect anchor for a larger event that brings together suppliers, vendors, trainers, graduates, and potential clients. With minimal additional budget, we can transform the design competition finale into a Green Business Fair featuring:\n- Product showcases and supplier booths\n- Job matching for trained participants\n- Mentor/co-founder matchmaking\n- Business launches and pitches\n- Public awareness campaign\n\nThis event connects all three training tracks, demonstrates market viability, and shifts the narrative from \"green building is expensive\" to \"green building is the future of Mosul.\"\n\n**2. Build a Digital Community Hub (Evolution of the Resource Repository)**  \nCreate a lightweight online directory that houses the community, not just the content:\n- **Trainer profiles** with credentials and contact information\n- **Graduate portfolios** with photos and LinkedIn profiles (making them hireable)\n- **Supplier database** with specifications and verified contacts\n- **Materials reference** with R-values and thermal calculations\n- **Queryable knowledge base** where trainers and participants can ask technical questions\n\nThis isn't a comprehensive learning management system—it's a community connector that makes it easy for graduates to find work, trainers to find answers, and suppliers to find customers.\n\n**3. Advocate for Government Subsidy Expansion (Unlock Systemic Change)**  \nExpert interviews revealed that the Iraqi government already provides subsidies for certain construction materials. This program should be expanded to include insulation materials, thermal paint, and energy-efficient windows. ITC should work with the Engineering Union and relevant ministries to:\n- Document the economic and health benefits of thermal retrofits\n- Propose specific materials for subsidy eligibility\n- Create a simple application process for homeowners\n- Publicize the program through the trained network\n\nGovernment subsidies would dramatically accelerate market adoption and make green retrofits accessible to lower-income families—the population most burdened by energy costs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. ToT ACTIVITY REPORT\n\n### 2.1 Background & Objectives\n\n**Why Mosul Needs This**\n\nMosul faces an energy crisis. Residents spend significant portions of their income on diesel generators, endure noise and air pollution, and live in homes that are uncomfortably hot in summer and cold in winter. Meanwhile, modern construction has largely abandoned the thermal design principles that made traditional Mosul architecture comfortable even in extreme weather.\n\nThis isn't just a technical problem—it's a market perception problem. Residents don't believe solutions exist or will work. Solar installers have damaged the market by using cheap, low-quality components. Contractors pocket money by using inadequate insulation. Architects assume their clients won't pay for green design.\n\nThe BEIT project recognizes that changing this reality requires changing the workforce. We need:\n- **Energy consultants** who can assess homes and recommend cost-effective retrofits\n- **Skilled solar installers** who deliver systems that actually work\n- **Architects** who design for Mosul's climate and draw inspiration from its heritage\n\nBut training graduates alone won't shift the market. We also need trainers who can deliver this content, experts who can mentor new practitioners, and a community that can advocate for better standards.\n\n**Three Different Tracks for Three Different Goals**\n\nThe curriculum was designed with three distinct modules, each targeting a different outcome:\n\n| Module | Target Audience | Market Reality | Training Goal | Expected Outcome |\n|--------|----------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|\n| **Insulation** | Engineers & technical graduates | No established market; opportunity to create consultancy businesses | Entrepreneurship: assess homes, recommend interventions, implement retrofits | Start their own business; conduct paid assessments within 30 days |\n| **Solar** | Electrical engineering graduates | Established market but damaged reputation; companies hiring | Employment: join existing teams, learn professional installation standards | Join a solar company; complete portfolio installation within 30 days |\n| **Architecture** | Junior architects | Market exists but green design seen as impractical; need to convince bosses and clients | Awareness & advocacy: design projects, share on social media, shift perceptions | Complete one real client project using heritage-informed green principles; showcase at design competition |\n\nThis differentiation is critical. We're not training everyone to be entrepreneurs or everyone to be employees. We're preparing people for the specific paths available in each market.\n\n**Core Competencies Across All Modules**\n\nWhile each track has different goals, all three share essential competencies:\n\n1. **Technical Skills** - hands-on practice with materials, tools, and calculations\n2. **Financial Literacy** - understanding ROI, creating client proposals, pricing projects\n3. **Sales & Communication** - pitching to clients, handling objections, building trust\n4. **Relationship Building** - connecting with suppliers, mentors, and peers\n5. **Awareness & Advocacy** - challenging misconceptions, documenting work, sharing publicly\n\nThe training balances all five, recognizing that technical skills alone won't create market change.\n\n### 2.2 ToT Process & Methodology\n\n**The Year-Long Interview Process**\n\nThis ToT didn't begin in October 2025. It began nearly a year earlier, when I started interviewing experts across Mosul's construction, solar, and architecture sectors. These weren't formal academic interviews—they were conversations with practitioners solving real problems in real homes.\n\nI asked them:\n- What are the biggest challenges you see in the market?\n- What mistakes do new installers/designers make?\n- What do clients misunderstand about green building?\n- What would you teach if you had five days with 20 graduates?\n\nTheir answers shaped everything: the curriculum structure, the daily agendas, the hands-on activities, the financial literacy components, even the icebreakers.\n\nThe trainers who attended the ToT in October *are* the experts who were interviewed throughout the year. This means the ToT wasn't about imposing an external curriculum—it was about bringing co-creators together to finalize and align on what they had collectively built.\n\n**Core Design Principles**\n\nFive principles guided the curriculum design:\n\n**1. The 80/20 Rule**  \nWith only five days per module, we can't teach every possible intervention or technique. Instead, we focus on the few things that work in most situations:\n- For insulation: roof work, thermal paint, window sealing\n- For solar: proper component selection, professional installation, client education\n- For architecture: climate-responsive principles, heritage inspiration, practical constraints\n\nTrainers need to understand the full landscape, but participants need to master the essentials that will make them \"dangerous\" in the market immediately.\n\n**2. One Clear Message Per Day**  \nEach training day delivers one core takeaway. Day structure follows a simple pattern:\n- Morning: introduce the concept\n- Midday: demonstrate and practice hands-on\n- Afternoon: apply to real scenarios and calculate ROI\n- End of day: participants can articulate \"If I only learned one thing today, it's...\"\n\nThis prevents cognitive overload and ensures retention.\n\n**3. kWh-Based Reasoning, Not \"Amps × IQD\"**  \nIn Mosul, electricity bills are calculated per ampere (generator companies charge by amp draw). This leads to shortcuts like estimating savings as \"amps × IQD\" which is technically meaningless.\n\nWe insist on proper energy calculations:\n- Use U-values to estimate heat transfer\n- Calculate kWh consumption before and after interventions\n- Apply local electricity tariffs to show actual savings\n- Present ROI in years/months, not vague promises\n\nThis teaches participants to make credible claims, builds client trust, and differentiates trained graduates from unqualified competitors.\n\n**4. Verify Everything Locally**  \nNo generic \"best practices\" or assumptions. Every material recommendation, cost estimate, and ROI calculation must be verified in the Mosul context:\n- What suppliers actually stock these materials?\n- What do they actually cost today?\n- What local regulations or building codes apply?\n- What installation constraints exist in typical Mosul homes?\n\nWe maintain a materials spreadsheet with R-values, costs, and supplier contacts, updated continuously.\n\n**5. Build Relationships, Not Just Skills**  \nThe training deliberately creates opportunities for participants to connect with:\n- **Suppliers**: Participants call suppliers during training to ask about materials. \"I'm a student, I'm learning\" opens doors and begins relationships that continue after graduation.\n- **Each other**: Small group rotations, shared lunches, WhatsApp groups.\n- **Trainers**: Trainers become mentors, not just instructors.\n- **Clients**: Architecture students work with real clients during training; others conduct assessments on real homes.\n\nThese relationships reduce the psychological barrier to entering the market and create a support network that outlasts the five days.\n\n**Teaching Structure: The Stations Model**\n\nTo manage ~20 participants in limited space and time, we use a rotation system:\n\n1. **Break into small groups** (4-5 people)\n2. **Three stations**, each focused on one hands-on activity\n   - Station 1: Material identification and R-value testing\n   - Station 2: Installation technique practice (mock-up models)\n   - Station 3: Measurement and documentation (photos, notes, thermal imaging if available)\n3. **Groups rotate** every 30-40 minutes\n4. **Document everything**: Groups take photos at each station\n5. **Regroup and reflect**: Each group shares one key learning\n\nThis keeps everyone engaged, prevents bottlenecks, and produces visual documentation that participants can reference later.\n\n**The Take-Home Practice**\n\nAt the end of each training, participants receive a small physical sample to take home—a piece of insulation, a section of tile (kāshi), a solar connector—something they can observe, handle, and experiment with outside of class. This extends learning beyond the five days and gives participants a tangible reminder of what they learned.\n\n### 2.3 ToT Delivery (October 12-14, 2025)\n\n**Who Attended**\n\nThe ToT convened [X] trainers representing:\n- UNESCO\n- Mosul Office of Iraqi Engineers\n- Municipalities & Government offices\n- Freelance consultants\n- Private sector companies (solar installers, construction contractors)\n- University of Mosul College of Engineering\n- Mosul Heritage House\n- ITC\n\n*(See Annex for full attendance list with signatures and contact information)*\n\nAll participants were practicing professionals with years of field experience. Many had been interviewed during the curriculum development phase and contributed their expertise to the modules. The ToT was, in essence, bringing the curriculum's co-creators together for the first time as a cohort.\n\n**Daily Agenda**\n\nThe ToT followed the same structure we expect trainers to use with participants:\n\n**Day 1 (October 12): Orientation & Insulation Module Preview**\n- Morning: Framing the purpose (trainers teaching engineers/early-career practitioners)\n- Midday: Envelope topics overview (inverted roof insulation, window-to-wall ratio)\n- Afternoon: Roof decisions, materials, and practical implications (kāshi reflectivity, legacy systems)\n- Key discussion: avoiding \"amps × IQD\" shortcuts; using U-values and kWh\n\n**Day 2 (October 13): Deep Dive on Materials & Market Realities**\n- Morning: Case discussions on roof systems and materials\n- Midday: Cost perceptions, market pricing, temperature references\n- Afternoon: Group problem-solving on common installation challenges\n- Key discussion: Trainers debated insulation-from-inside approach; \"show me the numbers\"\n\n**Day 3 (October 14): Stakeholder Alignment & Architecture Integration**\n- Morning: Technical sync with Dr. Omar (University of Mosul) on thermal-insulation + architecture content alignment\n- Midday: Discussion of local house suitability and heritage principles\n- Afternoon: Next steps, feedback collection, sustainability planning\n\n*(See Annex for detailed session agendas)*\n\n**The \"Actions by Their Intentions\" Framing**\n\nEvery session began with a reminder to set intentions rooted in service:\n> \"We're here to benefit people living in difficult situations, paying too much for energy. We're here to save them money, protect the environment, reduce pollution—and yes, to make a living and feed our families. How can we set ourselves up to be in service? Let's connect this work to the Muslim tradition that actions are judged by their intentions, and make this entire project an act of worship.\"\n\nThis cultural framing resonated deeply and set a tone of collective purpose rather than individual competition.\n\n**Key Moments**\n\n**1. The \"Insulation from Inside\" Debate**  \nStandard practice is to insulate roofs from the outside. One trainer mentioned he'd done an interior roof insulation due to constraints. Several others immediately challenged: \"That doesn't make sense.\" He responded: \"It does. I can show you the numbers.\"\n\nWhat followed was a passionate, technical debate—participants pulling out phones to check calculations, sketching on whiteboards, referencing thermal bridge principles. Everyone learned more in that 20-minute spontaneous discussion than they would have from a lecture.\n\nThis moment demonstrated what the ToT was really about: not transferring information, but creating a space where expert practitioners could challenge and teach each other.\n\n**2. Building Community Over Lunch**  \nLunch wasn't just a break—it was where relationships formed. Trainers exchanged phone numbers, discussed potential collaborations, and discovered they'd been working on similar problems in isolation.\n\nOne participant later said: \"I didn't know there were others in Mosul thinking about these things. Now I feel like I'm part of something.\"\n\n**3. The Grandparents' Home Icebreaker**  \nWe opened Day 1 with a simple question: \"Think of a home from your childhood—maybe your grandparents' house. What made it comfortable, even in extreme heat or cold?\"\n\nParticipants shared memories of courtyards, high ceilings, thick walls, strategically placed windows. This icebreaker served three purposes:\n- Connected the group emotionally before diving into technical content\n- Surfaced heritage design principles organically\n- Reminded everyone that Mosul already knows how to build for its climate—we just need to remember and modernize\n\n### 2.4 Participant Feedback\n\nFormal feedback was collected via written forms at the end of the ToT *(full dataset in Annex)*. Here are the key themes:\n\n**What Worked**\n\n**High Engagement & Practical Focus**  \nParticipants appreciated that the training focused on real-world application:\n> *\"The training helps us do real work in real homes—not just theory.\"* (Participant feedback, translated from Arabic)\n\n> *\"Hands-on time with local materials made it real.\"* (Participant feedback, translated from Arabic)\n\n**Learning from Each Other**  \nMultiple participants noted that the most valuable moments came from peer discussion, not presentation slides:\n> *\"I liked when we discussed different approaches. I learned things I wouldn't have found in books.\"*\n\n**Relevance to Mosul Context**  \nTrainers valued that examples, materials, and prices were specific to Mosul, not generic international standards.\n\n**What Needs Adjustment**\n\n**Cognitive Load & Information Density**  \nThe most common concern was \"too much information at once.\" Participants asked for:\n- Simpler visual scaffolds (decision trees, flowcharts) to structure choices\n- Clearer progressive sequencing so each concept builds on the last\n- More time for hands-on practice relative to lecture time\n\nOne trainer summarized: *\"We need to give them the larger context, but then say: for you, learn to do this one thing well.\"*\n\n**Need for Decision-Support Tools**  \nWhen discussing complex interventions (e.g., roof retrofits with multiple material options and installation methods), trainers frequently asked: \"But what about [alternative approach]?\"\n\nThis revealed a gap: we need simple decision trees that help trainers (and eventually participants) navigate choices without getting overwhelmed. For example:\n\n```\nDoes the client have budget for roof work?\n  ├─ YES → Is the roof accessible?\n  │   ├─ YES → Exterior insulation (best ROI)\n  │   └─ NO → Interior ceiling insulation\n  └─ NO → Start with thermal paint + window sealing\n```\n\nSuch tools don't exist yet in the curriculum and should be added.\n\n**Request for More Hands-On Time**  \nSeveral trainers wanted to spend more time physically installing, measuring, and troubleshooting rather than discussing theory. This aligns with the curriculum's philosophy but will require adjusting the daily schedule to allocate more time to stations and less to presentation.\n\n*(See Annex for full feedback responses, including participant ratings and open-ended comments)*\n\n### 2.5 Materials Developed\n\nThe following materials were developed for the ToT and will be used by trainers in subsequent participant-facing sessions:\n\n**1. Trainer Resource Toolkit**\n- **Facilitator Guides**: Day-by-day lesson plans with timing, key messages, and facilitation tips\n- **Technical Reference Sheets**: Equations, R-values, U-value tables, thermal calculations\n- **Case Studies**: Real Mosul projects with before/after data, costs, and lessons learned\n- **Icebreaker Library**: Activity descriptions including \"Grandparents' Home,\" \"Intentions Framing,\" \"I'm a Student Learning\" phone scripts\n\n**2. Hands-On Activity Guides**\n- **Stations Model Instructions**: How to set up and rotate groups through three practice stations\n- **Take-Home Practice Guide**: Instructions for the small samples participants take home\n- **Documentation Templates**: Photo checklists, measurement logs, safety protocols\n\n**3. Financial Literacy Tools**\n- **ROI Calculator Template**: Spreadsheet for inputting costs, kWh savings, and payback period\n- **Client Proposal Template**: Professional format for presenting retrofit recommendations\n- **Supplier Contact Database**: Local Mosul suppliers with materials, prices, and phone numbers\n\n**4. Assessment Instruments**\n- **Daily Pre-Tests**: Short (6-question) checks at the start of each day to gauge baseline knowledge\n- **Final Post-Test**: End-of-training assessment using same constructs to measure learning gains\n- **Feedback Forms**: Participant satisfaction and suggestions for improvement\n\n*(See Annex for sample materials)*\n\n**5. Decision Trees (In Development)**\n\nBased on ToT feedback, we are developing visual decision trees for common scenarios:\n- Roof intervention selection\n- Wall insulation approaches\n- Window and opening improvements\n- Solar system sizing\n- Material selection based on budget\n\nThese will be added to the Trainer Resource Toolkit before the first participant-facing delivery.\n\n### 2.6 Key Insights & Lessons Learned\n\n**1. \"Even Simpler\" - The Discipline of Clarity**\n\nThe hardest part of curriculum design wasn't deciding what to include—it was deciding what to *exclude*.\n\nWith only five days, every hour matters. The temptation is to pack in as much as possible (\"they need to know this, and this, and this...\"). But information density creates cognitive overload. Participants shut down or retain nothing.\n\nThe discipline is to ask: \"If they only remember *one thing* from today, what should it be?\" Then structure the entire day around that one thing. Everything else is context or reinforcement.\n\nThis means trainers must hold complexity in their minds but deliver simplicity to participants. The trainer needs to understand 100% of the landscape; the participant needs to master the 20% that delivers 80% of results.\n\nWe now design every day with:\n- **One clear message** (articulated at start and end of day)\n- **Three components**: explain it, demonstrate it, practice it\n- **One takeaway artifact**: a calculation, a photo, a filled template\n\n**2. Trainers Are a Community, Not Contractors**\n\nWe initially framed trainers as service providers who would deliver a curriculum. That's technically correct but misses something crucial: these trainers are the experts who *created* the curriculum through months of interviews.\n\nBringing them together revealed that many had been working on similar problems in isolation. They hadn't met each other. They didn't know who else in Mosul was passionate about thermal design or heritage-informed architecture or high-quality solar installation.\n\nThe ToT created a coalition. Now they have each other's phone numbers. They're in the same WhatsApp group. They reference each other's projects. When a tricky technical question comes up, they know who to call.\n\nThis community is as valuable as the curriculum itself. It enables:\n- **Peer learning**: Trainers continue to teach each other after the ToT ends\n- **Quality control**: Shared standards and accountability\n- **Market advocacy**: Collective voice for better building codes and regulations\n- **Participant support**: Mentorship and job placement networks\n\nFuture ToTs should explicitly build time for community formation: meals together, site visits as a group, even social activities outside the training itself.\n\n**3. Relationships > Information**\n\nThe most valuable component of the training isn't the technical content—it's the network participants enter.\n\nA graduate who knows how to calculate U-values but has no supplier contacts, no mentor to call when problems arise, and no peer network for encouragement will struggle to enter the market. Meanwhile, a graduate with slightly less technical skill but strong relationships (knows three suppliers, has a trainer's phone number, is in a WhatsApp group with 20 other graduates) has a much higher chance of success.\n\nThis is why we designed deliberate relationship-building mechanisms:\n- **Supplier calls during training**: \"I'm a student, I'm learning\" is a psychologically safe way to initiate contact; it opens doors that stay open after graduation\n- **WhatsApp groups per cohort**: Homework questions, supplier photos, quick technical clarifications\n- **Monthly reunions**: All three modules (Solar, Insulation, Architecture) meet together 30 days after training to showcase what they built\n- **Trainer mentorship**: Trainers stay available for questions after the five days end\n\nThe training is the beginning of a relationship, not a one-time information transfer.\n\n**4. The RAG System as Institutional Memory**\n\nOne challenge became clear during the ToT: trainers have years of knowledge in their heads, but it's not easily accessible to others. When a participant asks a specific question (\"What's the R-value of EPS foam available in Mosul?\" or \"How do I calculate heat gain through a window?\"), the trainer might know the answer—but what if they don't? What if they're unavailable?\n\nThis led to the idea of creating a queryable knowledge base—a system where trainers, participants, and staff can ask questions and get answers drawn from:\n- All expert interview transcripts\n- Materials databases\n- Training slide decks\n- Technical papers\n- Feedback forms from past cohorts\n\nThis \"RAG\" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system would function like an AI assistant trained on the project's entire knowledge base. It could:\n- Help trainers prepare for a session: \"What am I teaching on Day 2?\"\n- Solve technical problems: \"Calculate U-value for 5cm EPS foam\"\n- Find suppliers: \"Who has mineral wool in Mosul?\"\n- Generate reports: \"How many participants have completed the Solar module?\"\n\nThis is beyond the current contract scope but represents a logical next step for institutionalizing the trainers' expertise and ensuring it remains accessible as the program scales.\n\n**5. The 5-Day Constraint is Real**\n\nOriginally, I envisioned 20-day trainings with extensive site visits, multiple iterations of hands-on practice, and co-created learning experiences. The reality is 5 days per module.\n\nThis isn't enough time for deep mastery. It *is* enough time to:\n- Introduce core concepts\n- Demonstrate proper technique\n- Give participants a taste of hands-on practice\n- Build confidence and relationships\n- Provide resources for continued learning\n\nThe training is a *launchpad*, not a complete education. Participants need follow-up support: apprenticeships, mentorship, access to the knowledge base, and peer networks.\n\nThe hardest trade-off was between breadth and depth. We chose breadth—expose participants to many possibilities, then focus hands-on time on the 80/20 essentials—because five days isn't long enough for mastery anyway. Better to give them a map of the landscape and a compass (trainers, peers, resources) than to drill deeply into one narrow skill.\n\n---\n\n**End of Sections 1 & 2**\n\n*Next sections (Internship Framework & Sustainability Plan) will follow in a separate document.*",

INTERNSHIP / APPRENTICESHIP / JOB SHADOWING FRAMEWORK\n\n### 3.1 Market Reality: What We Learned from Employers\n\nDuring the curriculum development phase, we interviewed companies and experts about their hiring practices and willingness to host trainees. Their responses revealed important realities that shaped this framework.\n\n**CVs Aren't Trusted**\n\nMultiple employers told us the same story: resumes in Iraq often don't reflect actual skills. As one solar company owner (Zeina Tareq) explained:\n> \"The typical hiring process is a trial month with low or no pay to test competence. CVs often aren't trusted—we use practical trials instead.\"\n\nThis means our graduates need more than certificates. They need:\n- **Demonstrated work** (portfolio pieces, photos, client testimonials)\n- **Practical tests** that prove competence\n- **Relationships** with potential employers built during training\n\n**Different Markets, Different Pathways**\n\nThe three training tracks lead to different employment outcomes:\n\n| Track | Market Status | Typical Entry Path | Timeline to Income |\n|-------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Insulation** | Emerging market, no established companies | Start own consultancy/business | Can begin earning within 30 days (assessments, small jobs) |\n| **Solar** | Established market, companies actively hiring | Join existing team as apprentice/junior installer | 1-3 months volunteer/low-pay → full hire if competent |\n| **Architecture** | Market exists but green design needs advocacy | Continue at current firm, take on green projects | Ongoing (junior architects already employed, need clients willing to pay for green design) |\n\n**The De-Risking Challenge**\n\nOne company (Aqtab Al-Taqa, Hossam Al-Deen Khalil) suggested a creative solution:\n> \"Coordinate field placements with companies; propose that the institution covers trainee salaries for ~2 months to de-risk hiring.\"\n\nThis shared-cost model recognizes that companies want to hire but can't afford to pay full salary during the trial period. If ITC/BEIT can subsidize the first 1-2 months, companies are more willing to take on trainees.\n\n**Skills Employers Actually Want**\n\nBeyond technical skills, employers emphasized:\n- **Safety practices** - especially for solar (electrical hazards) and roof work (heights, PPE)\n- **Professional communication** - explaining work to clients, writing proposals\n- **Reliability** - showing up on time, completing what you commit to\n- **Problem-solving** - handling unexpected issues on site\n- **Teamwork** - working within existing company workflows\n\nThe training addresses these through role-plays, safety modules, and relationship-building exercises. But real competence comes from supervised practice in real work environments—which is what this framework provides.\n\n### 3.2 Three Pathways: Shadowing, Apprenticeship, Internship\n\nThis framework offers three levels of engagement, each suited to different participant readiness and company capacity.\n\n#### **PATHWAY 1: Job Shadowing (1-2 weeks)**\n\n**What It Is:**  \nFollow an experienced practitioner (ustādh) on real job sites. Observe, take notes, ask questions, document with photos. No hands-on work—this is pure observation and learning.\n\n**Who It's For:**  \n- Participants who completed training but feel unready to do work themselves\n- Those who want to see the full workflow before committing\n- Anyone exploring whether this career path is right for them\n\n**What Participants Do:**\n- Shadow the practitioner through 3-5 site visits\n- Use a simple checklist to guide observation (What tools are used? What safety measures? What do they tell the client? What problems arise?)\n- Take before/after photos\n- Write 1-2 page reflection: \"What I learned\" + \"What surprised me\"\n\n**Company Commitment:**  \nMinimal. The company just allows the trainee to tag along. No supervision burden beyond answering occasional questions.\n\n**Stipend:**  \nUsually none. Transportation costs covered if possible.\n\n**Output:**  \n- 1-2 page site notes with photos\n- Reflection document\n- Relationship established with potential future employer\n\n**Partners Open to Job Shadowing:**\n- Solar: Voltage Co., Chisage ESS, Aqtab Al-Taqa\n- Insulation/Materials: SIKA (Erbil), SMTC, Al-Ghanim\n- Architecture: Mosul Heritage House, University of Mosul (Dr. Omar)\n\n---\n\n#### **PATHWAY 2: Apprenticeship (1-3 months)**\n\n**What It Is:**  \nWork 3 days per week on real projects under supervision. Perform supervised tasks: prep work, installations, measurements, simple troubleshooting, BOQ (bill of quantities) assistance.\n\n**Who It's For:**  \n- Participants who completed training and are ready for hands-on work\n- Those who want to join an existing company full-time after proving themselves\n- Solar and insulation graduates (architecture graduates typically continue at their existing firms)\n\n**What Participants Do:**\n- Show up 3 days/week (scheduled in advance)\n- Start with prep tasks (organizing tools, cutting materials, measuring)\n- Gradually take on installation work (always supervised)\n- Document each project with photos and brief notes\n- Build a portfolio: \"Projects I contributed to\"\n\n**Company Commitment:**  \nModerate. The company provides supervision, tools, and on-the-job training. The apprentice is genuinely helpful (not just observing) but needs oversight.\n\n**Stipend:**  \nSmall stipend if possible (shared cost model: ITC/BEIT covers first 1-2 months to de-risk, then company takes over if performance is good).\n\n**Output:**\n- **One-page portfolio** per month: \"What I did/learned\" with photos\n- **Mentor evaluation** at end: Would you hire this person full-time? Why/why not?\n\n**End Goal:**  \nCompany hires the apprentice full-time if they prove competent. If not, the apprentice has real portfolio pieces to show other employers.\n\n**Partners Open to Apprenticeships:**\n- Solar: Aqtab Al-Taqa (explicitly interested), Voltage Co., Chisage ESS\n- Insulation: SMTC, Al-Ghanim, Beltec, Al-Wissam\n- University of Mosul (Dr. Abdulhakim) - field training with installers, linking graduates to real projects\n\n---\n\n#### **PATHWAY 3: Internship (1 month, full-time)**\n\n**What It Is:**  \nAssist end-to-end on one small project (e.g., insulate one room, conduct home energy assessment, design a heritage-informed residential renovation). Work full-time (5 days/week) for one month.\n\n**Who It's For:**  \n- Participants who want intensive, immersive experience\n- Those preparing to start their own business (insulation track especially)\n- Architecture graduates working on a specific real client project\n\n**What Participants Do:**\n- Commit full-time for 1 month\n- Work on ONE complete project from start to finish: initial assessment → proposal → client approval → implementation → handover\n- Document the entire process with photos, measurements, costs, client feedback\n- Write a mini-report: \"What worked, what I'd do differently next time\"\n\n**Company/Mentor Commitment:**  \nHigh. The mentor needs to dedicate time to guide the intern through a complete project cycle. This is most feasible for:\n- University faculty supervising student projects\n- Small businesses with one ongoing project that needs extra hands\n- NGOs/implementing partners (like Mosul Space) with model home projects\n\n**Stipend:**  \nSmall stipend if full-time (since the intern can't do other work during this month).\n\n**Output:**\n- **Mini-report**: Project summary with before/after photos, costs, ROI calculation, client testimonial (if possible)\n- **Mentor sign-off**: \"This person successfully completed [X project]\"\n\n**End Goal:**  \nThe intern has a complete portfolio piece they can show to clients or employers. For insulation/solar graduates, this may be their first paying project (if the client agrees to hire them at reduced cost in exchange for training).\n\n**Partners Open to Internships:**\n- Mosul Space (can coordinate with real homeowners as part of BEIT pilot projects)\n- University of Mosul (capstone project model)\n- Mosul Heritage House (architecture projects with heritage focus)\n\n---\n\n### 3.3 Matching Process: How Participants Get Placed\n\nWe use a simple, lightweight process to match participants with opportunities.\n\n**Step 1: Post Open Slots in WhatsApp**\n\nAfter each training cohort, we post available opportunities in the cohort WhatsApp group:\n\n> 📢 **Job Shadowing Opportunity**  \n> Company: Voltage Co. (Solar)  \n> Duration: 1-2 weeks  \n> Start date: November 15  \n> Slots: 2 people  \n> Requirements: Completed Solar Training Module  \n> Contact: [Name], [Phone]  \n> Interested? Send your 1-page portfolio to [email] by November 10\n\n**Step 2: Participants Submit Simple Portfolio**\n\nNo lengthy CV. Just a **1-page document** with:\n- Photo (professional, not selfie)\n- Training completed (module, date, certificate number)\n- Technical skills summary (2-3 sentences: \"I can calculate ROI, size a solar system, identify insulation materials, use a multimeter...\")\n- Photos of any hands-on work done during training (station work, take-home practice, any real projects)\n- **Numbers page**: One example calculation (U-value → kWh → ROI) to demonstrate they understand the methodology\n- Contact: phone, email, LinkedIn (if they have one—if not, we help them create one)\n\nThis format is quick to produce and shows actual competence, not just credentials.\n\n**Step 3: Mentor Shortlists 2-3 Candidates**\n\nThe company/mentor reviews portfolios and picks 2-3 people for a brief practical test.\n\n**Step 4: 10-Minute Hands Test**\n\nInstead of a formal interview, candidates do a short practical task. Choose one:\n\n**For Solar:**\n- Safety mini-drill: \"Put on PPE and identify 3 hazards in this mock setup\"\n- Component identification: \"Match these components to their function; which one is wrong for this system?\"\n- Simple calculation: \"This house uses 10 kWh/day. How many panels do they need?\"\n\n**For Insulation:**\n- Room/roof checklist demo: \"Walk me through this space. What would you check? What would you recommend?\"\n- Material identification: \"Here are three insulation samples. Tell me the pros/cons of each.\"\n- Quick ROI calculation: \"Customer pays 50,000 IQD/month on generators. Roof insulation costs 2 million IQD and saves 30% energy. What's the payback period?\"\n\n**For Architecture:**\n- Sketch critique: \"Here's a floor plan. Point out 2 things that hurt thermal performance and suggest improvements.\"\n- Heritage principle: \"How would you incorporate natural ventilation in a modern Mosul home?\"\n\nThese tests take 10 minutes, reveal actual competence, and feel less intimidating than formal interviews.\n\n**Step 5: Select 1 Person, Start Placement**\n\nThe mentor picks the candidate who performed best and sets a start date. The placement begins.\n\n**Step 6: Simple Documentation During Placement**\n\nNo heavy reporting burden. Just:\n- **Weekly check-in** (15 minutes, in-person or phone): \"How's it going? Any problems?\"\n- **Photo documentation**: Participant takes photos of their work (with permission)\n- **End-of-placement evaluation**: Mentor answers 3 questions:\n  1. Would you hire this person? (Yes / Maybe / No)\n  2. What did they do well?\n  3. What do they need to improve?\n\nThis feedback goes to the participant and to ITC/Mosul Space for program improvement.\n\n### 3.4 Host/Mentor Onboarding (Lightweight)\n\nWe keep mentor burden minimal so companies actually participate.\n\n**What We Provide to Mentors:**\n\n1. **Simple task list** (template) - Examples of appropriate tasks for each stage:\n   - Week 1: Observation, tool organization, material prep\n   - Week 2-3: Supervised installation tasks\n   - Week 4+: Lead small tasks with mentor oversight\n\n2. **Safety checklist** - One-page reminder of safety protocols (especially for solar and roof work)\n\n3. **Weekly check-in template** - 3 quick questions to ask the participant each week\n\n4. **End-of-placement evaluation form** - The 3 questions listed above, plus space for open feedback\n\n5. **Emergency contact** - ITC/Mosul Space staff phone number if issues arise\n\n**What We Ask from Mentors:**\n\n- Name one person as the designated mentor (doesn't have to be owner/manager—can be a senior technician)\n- Do a 15-minute weekly check-in (can be informal, during work)\n- Provide honest feedback at the end\n- If the participant isn't working out, tell us early (don't wait until the end)\n\n**Incentives for Companies:**\n\n- **De-risked trial period**: If ITC/BEIT covers stipend for first 1-2 months, company can evaluate performance before committing to full salary\n- **Access to trained talent**: Companies get first pick of graduates before they go to competitors\n- **Quality certification**: Companies that host apprentices get listed as \"BEIT Certified Training Partners\" (useful for marketing)\n- **Community membership**: Mentors join the broader coalition of trainers and practitioners (networking, peer learning, potential collaborations)\n\n### 3.5 Partners Identified & Contact Information\n\nThe following organizations expressed willingness to host trainees. *(Full contact details in Annex; summary here)*\n\n#### **SOLAR**\n\n| Organization | Contact Person | Willingness | Opportunities Offered | Preferred Duration | Notes |\n|--------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Aqtab Al-Taqa** | Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | YES | Site visits, practical training, possible hiring | Project-dependent | Suggested institution covers trainee salaries for ~2 months to de-risk |\n| **Chisage ESS** | Ali Sabah Mohammed | MAYBE | Site visits | Short-term (1-3 months) | Focus: inverter programming, system integration, troubleshooting |\n| **Voltage Co.** | Zeina Tareq | MAYBE | Depends on project needs | Trial month | Typical hiring: trial month (low/no pay) to test competence |\n| **University of Mosul (Engineering)** | Dr. Abdulhakim N.

SUSTAINABILITY PLAN\n\nThis section outlines how the training program and practitioner community can continue beyond the initial BEIT contract period.\n\n### 4.1 Community Mechanisms: Keeping the Coalition Alive\n\n**WhatsApp Groups (Ongoing, Zero Cost)**\n\nEvery training cohort gets a dedicated WhatsApp group that stays active after the five days end. These groups serve multiple purposes:\n- **Homework and questions**: \"Can someone remind me how to calculate U-value?\"\n- **Supplier photos and tips**: \"FYI, Al-Ghanim has EPS foam in stock at good price\"\n- **Job opportunities**: \"My company needs an installer next week, anyone interested?\"\n- **Moral support**: \"First client meeting tomorrow, nervous, any advice?\"\n\nMosul Space (implementing partner) moderates these groups to:\n- Answer questions when possible\n- Connect people who have similar questions\n- Post opportunities and updates\n- Gently remind people of the \"actions by intentions\" framing when conflicts arise\n\nNo budget required. Just commitment to stay engaged.\n\n**Bi-Annual Trainer Gatherings (Twice per year)**\n\nEvery six months, we convene all trainers (across all three modules) for a half-day gathering:\n- **Share experiences**: What's working? What's not? What did you learn from your cohort?\n- **Troubleshoot problems**: Common trainee questions, difficult topics, logistical challenges\n- **Update content**: New materials available? Price changes? Regulation changes?\n- **Strengthen relationships**: Lunch together, site visit together, plan collaborations\n\nThese gatherings serve as quality assurance checkpoints and keep trainers connected.\n\n**Format:**\n- Morning: Round-table discussion (each trainer shares 2 takeaways from recent sessions)\n- Midday: Problem-solving workshop (address 2-3 common challenges)\n- Afternoon: Site visit or guest speaker (e.g., tour a successful retrofit project, hear from a government official about building codes)\n\n**Budget:** Minimal (venue, lunch, transportation for trainers). Mosul Space can host. Estimated cost: $500-800 per gathering.\n\n**Leverage Climate Space (Existing Convening Power)**\n\nMosul Space already runs \"Climate Space\" - periodic gatherings of people working on environmental issues in Mosul. Our green building coalition can plug into this existing structure rather than creating parallel infrastructure.\n\nBenefit: Broader network (connects our practitioners to climate activists, urban planners, NGO staff, journalists, etc.)\n\n### 4.2 Monthly Cohort Reunions (30 Days After Training)\n\nEvery cohort reunites one month after training to showcase what they've accomplished.\n\n**Format Varies by Module:**\n\n**Solar & Insulation:**  \n\"Show and Tell\" - Did you install something? Did you do an assessment? Did you get a job? Bring photos, share stories, calculate ROI together.\n\n**Architecture:**  \n\"Design Competition\" - Everyone presents their real client project. Judges (trainers, Dr. Omar, Mosul Heritage House staff) give feedback and award recognition (no cash prizes needed—public recognition is valuable).\n\n**Why One Month?**  \nLong enough for participants to take action, short enough that momentum hasn't died. The reunion creates accountability (\"I need to have *something* to show\") and celebrates early wins.\n\n**Logistics:**\n- 2-hour evening event\n- Light refreshments (tea, snacks)\n- Simple presentations (5 minutes per person/team)\n- Open networking time afterward\n- Photos/videos shared on social media (with permission)\n\n**Cross-Module Benefit:**  \nAll three modules can meet together. Solar graduates meet insulation graduates meet architects. Collaborations form: \"I have a client who needs both solar and insulation—want to partner on the proposal?\"\n\n**Budget:** $300-500 per reunion (venue, refreshments, certificates of participation)\n\n### 4.3 Green Home Festival / Fair (Annual Flagship Event)\n\n**The Vision**\n\nOnce per year, host a large public event that brings the entire green building ecosystem together: suppliers, installers, graduates, trainers, potential clients, government officials, media.\n\nThis is the signature moment that demonstrates market viability and shifts public perception from \"green building is niche/expensive\" to \"green building is the future of Mosul.\"\n\n**Connection to BEIT 3.2 (Leverage Existing Budget)**\n\nComponent 3.2 of the BEIT project includes a design competition to showcase 200 retrofitted homes and support a retrofit product startup. This competition will have a finale event with budget already allocated.\n\n**Our recommendation:** Expand that finale into a full Green Business Fair with minimal additional cost.\n\n**What the Fair Includes:**\n\n**1. Design Competition Showcase (3.2 core activity)**\n- Display boards with architectural designs for 200 homes\n- Winners announced and recognized\n- Media coverage\n\n**2. Product & Supplier Expo (minimal cost add-on)**\n- Supplier booths: SIKA, SMTC, Al-Ghanim, Beltec, solar companies, etc.\n- Live demos: How to install insulation, how to size a solar system, thermal imaging demonstrations\n- Materials samples people can touch and feel\n- Pricing information and special \"fair discounts\"\n\n**3. Job Fair / Talent Showcase (zero cost)**\n- Our training graduates display portfolios (photo boards, before/after projects)\n- Companies looking to hire can meet graduates in person\n- Speed networking: 5-minute conversations, exchange contacts\n\n**4. Matchmaking Sessions (facilitated, zero cost)**\n- Mentor/mentee matching: Experienced practitioners meet graduates looking for guidance\n- Co-founder dating: Graduates with complementary skills (e.g., solar expert + salesperson) explore partnerships\n- Investor connections: Graduates with business ideas meet potential funders\n\n**5. Public Awareness Stage (leverages existing media presence)**\n- Short talks (10 minutes each): \"3 Misconceptions About Solar,\" \"Why Your House is Expensive to Cool,\" \"What Our Grandparents Knew About Building\"\n- Client testimonials: Homeowners who did retrofits share ROI and quality-of-life improvements\n- Live Q&A with experts\n\n**6. Business Launch Corner (symbolic, zero cost)**\n- Graduates who are starting businesses get 5 minutes to pitch\n- Collect contact info from interested potential clients\n- Media covers \"new green businesses launching in Mosul\"\n\n**Target Audience:**\n- **Primary**: Homeowners considering retrofits (the customer base)\n- **Secondary**: Graduates looking for jobs/clients, companies looking to hire, media, government officials\n\n**Logistics:**\n- **Venue**: Outdoor space (public square, university campus) or large hall\n- **Duration**: 1 full day (10am-6pm) or 2 half-days\n- **Timing**: Coordinate with 3.2 design competition finale (likely Q2-Q3 2026)\n- **Budget**: If piggybacking on 3.2 event, incremental cost is minimal (supplier booths are free; they want the exposure). Main costs: stage/sound, printed materials, refreshments. Est. $2,000-5,000.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nThe fair does three things training alone cannot:\n1. **Demonstrates market scale**: Seeing 50 suppliers, 100 graduates, 1,000 visitors changes the narrative from \"niche hobby\" to \"real economy\"\n2. **Creates earned media**: Local news, social media buzz, word-of-mouth\n3. **Accelerates transactions**: Homeowners meet installers, graduates get clients, companies get hires—all in one day\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n- X homeowners request quotes/assessments (track follow-ups)\n- Y graduates get hired or start businesses\n- Z media impressions (articles, social posts, TV coverage)\n- Supplier commitments to sponsor/support future trainings\n\n### 4.4 Digital Community Hub (Evolutionary Development)\n\n**Phase 1: Simple Directory (Low-Tech, Immediate)**\n\nStart with a basic webpage or shared spreadsheet/Airtable that lists:\n\n**Trainer Profiles:**\n- Name, photo, expertise (Solar / Insulation / Architecture)\n- Contact: phone, email\n- Credentials: degree, years of experience, companies worked with\n- Availability: \"Available for consulting / mentoring / training\"\n\n**Graduate Portfolios:**\n- Name, photo, module completed (Solar / Insulation / Architecture)\n- Certificate number, graduation date\n- Portfolio: 3-5 photos of work with brief descriptions\n- Contact: phone, email, LinkedIn\n- Tagline: \"Available for: installations / assessments / design projects\"\n\n**Supplier Database:**\n- Company name, materials offered\n- Contact: address, phone, website\n- Materials specs (R-values, prices, availability)\n- Notes: \"Good prices,\" \"High quality,\" \"Fast delivery,\" etc.\n\n**Materials Reference:**\n- Spreadsheet with R-values, U-values, costs\n- Links to technical datasheets\n- Local availability notes\n\nThis can be built in 1-2 days using free/cheap tools (Google Sites, Airtable, Notion). It makes the community visible and searchable.\n\n**Phase 2: Queryable Knowledge Base (RAG System, Future Development)**\n\nAs budget allows, develop a more sophisticated system where users can ask questions and get answers drawn from the full project knowledge base:\n\n- All trainer interview transcripts\n- Training slide decks and handouts\n- Technical papers and datasheets\n- Feedback from past cohorts\n- Supplier catalogs\n\n**Example queries:**\n- \"What's the R-value of EPS foam available in Mosul?\"\n- \"How do I calculate heat gain through a window?\"\n- \"What am I teaching on Day 2 of the Insulation module?\"\n- \"Which supplier has mineral wool in stock?\"\n- \"Show me examples of successful insulation projects\"\n\n**Interface Options** (see earlier discussion):\n- **Dashboard with pre-set question cards** (reduces blank-cursor paralysis)\n- **Conversational flow** (guided progressive disclosure: pick module → pick day → get agenda)\n- **Template library** (ROI calculator, client proposal, daily lesson plan, portfolio piece)\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using embeddings + LLM\n- Backend: All documents indexed and searchable\n- Frontend: Simple chat interface + dashboard\n- Languages: Arabic and English (bilingual support)\n\n**Maintenance:**\n- After each training, upload feedback forms and participant work\n- Update supplier database quarterly\n- Add new interview transcripts or technical documents as they become available\n\n**Budget:** Phase 1 (directory) = $0-500. Phase 2 (RAG system) = $5,000-15,000 depending on scope. Consider as future project phase.\n\n### 4.5 Government Advocacy: Expanding Material Subsidies\n\n**The Opportunity (Insight from Wifaq Ahmad)**\n\nDuring expert interviews, Wifaq Ahmad (one of the trainers) revealed that the Iraqi government already provides subsidies for certain construction materials. Homeowners can get reimbursed for verified purchases.\n\nCurrently, this subsidy does NOT cover insulation materials, thermal paint, or energy-efficient windows. But the mechanism exists—it just needs to be expanded.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nGovernment subsidies would:\n1. **Make retrofits affordable** for low/middle-income families (the people who suffer most from high energy costs)\n2. **Signal government support** for green building (shifting market perceptions)\n3. **Create demand** that pulls our trained graduates into jobs\n4. **Multiply the impact** of BEIT training (every trained graduate can serve 10x more clients if cost isn't a barrier)\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n**1. Document the Case**\n- Compile data: energy cost burden on households, health impacts of generator pollution, ROI of common retrofits\n- Calculate fiscal benefit: \"For every 1 million IQD in insulation subsidies, government saves X million in future energy infrastructure costs\"\n- Gather testimonials from pilot project homeowners\n\n**2. Identify the Right Ministry/Agency**\n- Likely: Ministry of Construction, Housing, and Municipalities OR Ministry of Planning\n- Engineering Union may be a key intermediary (they have government relationships)\n- Wifaq Ahmad can advise on specific contacts\n\n**3. Propose Pilot Program**\n- Don't ask for universal subsidies immediately (too big)\n- Propose: \"50-home pilot in Mosul: government subsidizes 50% of material costs for thermal retrofits\"\n- Measure results: energy savings, homeowner satisfaction, installer quality\n- If successful, scale nationally\n\n**4. Engage Engineering Union**\n- They already partner with BEIT and have credibility with government\n- They can advocate for standards and certifications (only BEIT-trained installers qualify for subsidized projects)\n- This creates quality control and job pipeline for our graduates\n\n**Who Leads This:** ITC, in coordination with UN-Habitat (they have government relationships through BEIT component 1 & 2). Mosul Space and Engineering Union as local implementing voices.\n\n**Timeline:** Begin conversations in 2026, aim for pilot program by 2027.\n\n### 4.6 Trainer Cascade Model: Scaling Beyond Mosul\n\nAs the program expands to other cities (Anbar, Baghdad, etc.), we don't need to train entirely new trainers from scratch. Instead, we identify **lead trainers** from the Mosul cohort who can train future facilitators.\n\n**Selection Criteria for Lead Trainers:**\n- Successfully delivered at least 2 training cohorts in Mosul\n- Received positive feedback from participants\n- Demonstrated community leadership (active in WhatsApp, attends gatherings, mentors others)\n- Strong technical knowledge + good communication skills\n\n**Lead Trainer Responsibilities:**\n- Co-facilitate ToTs in new cities alongside ITC/Mosul Space staff\n- Share Mosul lessons learned and adaptations\n- Stay connected to new trainer cohorts (become part of expanded network)\n\n**Incentive:** Lead trainers receive higher day-rate for ToT delivery and are recognized publicly as \"BEIT Master Trainers\"\n\n**Timeline:** Identify 3-5 lead trainers by mid-2026, begin cascade training in Anbar/Baghdad by late 2026.\n\n### 4.7 Continuous Improvement Loop\n\n**Feedback Collection (Every Cohort):**\n- Daily pre-tests (at start of each training day)\n- Final post-test (end of 5 days)\n- Written feedback forms (same questions every time for comparison)\n- 30-day follow-up survey: \"Did you install something? Get a job? Start a business? What support do you still need?\"\n\n**Analysis & Adjustment:**\n- Compare pre/post scores to measure learning gains\n- Identify topics where participants struggle (need more time or better explanation)\n- Track employment/business outcomes (which graduates succeed? what factors predict success?)\n- Update curriculum based on patterns (if everyone struggles with U-value calculations, add a simpler visual tool)\n\n**Sharing Learnings:**\n- Bi-annual trainer gatherings include \"what we changed and why\"\n- Best practices documented in Trainer Resource Toolkit (living document, not static)\n- Successful graduate case studies added to training materials (inspire future cohorts)\n\n**Quality Assurance:**\n- Trainers who consistently receive low feedback scores get coaching or are rotated out\n- Participants who complete training but never enter the market are interviewed: \"What held you back? How could we better support you?\"\n- Host companies that provide poor apprenticeship experiences are flagged; future placements redirected\n\n### 4.8 Budget & Resource Requirements (Sustainability)\n\nHere's what it costs to keep this running annually (after initial BEIT funding ends):\n\n| Activity | Frequency | Cost per Event | Annual Cost | Who Could Fund |\n|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Bi-annual trainer gatherings | 2x/year | $500-800 | $1,000-1,600 | Mosul Space core budget; Engineering Union sponsorship |\n| Monthly cohort reunions | 12x/year (1 per cohort x 3 modules x 4 cohorts/year) | $300-500 | $3,600-6,000 | Modest; could be participant contributions ($5/person) |\n| Green Home Festival | 1x/year | $2,000-5,000 (incremental; piggybacking on 3.2 event) | $2,000-5,000 | BEIT 3.2 budget; supplier sponsorships |\n| WhatsApp groups | Ongoing | $0 | $0 | Free |\n| Digital directory (Phase 1) | Setup + annual hosting | $500 setup + $100/year hosting | $600 first year, $100 after | One-time ITC investment |\n| RAG system (Phase 2) | Future development | $5,000-15,000 | TBD | Future grant/project phase |\n| Apprenticeship stipends (shared cost) | Variable (depends on # of placements) | $200-400/month x 2 months per apprentice | $400-800 per apprentice | ITC/BEIT for first 1-2 months; then company takes over |\n| **TOTAL (excluding apprenticeship stipends)** | | | **$7,300-12,700/year** | Mosul Space, Engineering Union, supplier sponsorships, participant fees |\n\nThis is highly sustainable. Most costs are modest and can be covered by:\n- Mosul Space's core operating budget (they host Climate Space already)\n- Engineering Union sponsorship (they benefit from trained members)\n- Supplier sponsorships (companies want access to graduates and exposure at fair)\n- Participant contributions (modest: $5-10 per person for reunion refreshments)\n\n**Critical Success Factor:** The community must be ACTIVE. If trainers stop attending gatherings, if graduates don't use WhatsApp groups, if no one shows up to reunions—the infrastructure collapses. Sustainability depends on engagement, not just budget.\n\n---\n\n## ANNEXES\n\n### Annex A: ToT Detailed Agenda (October 12-14, 2025)\n\n**Day 1: Sunday, October 12, 2025**\n\n| Time | Activity | Facilitator | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------------|-------|\n| 9:00-9:30 | Registration & Welcome Coffee | Mosul Space staff | Informal networking |\n| 9:30-10:00 | Opening & Intentions Framing | Bilal Ghalib (ITC) | \"Actions by their intentions\" - set tone of service |\n| 10:00-10:30 | Icebreaker: Grandparents' Homes | Facilitator | Small groups share memories of comfortable traditional homes |\n| 10:30-11:00 | Project Overview & Module Goals | Bilal Ghalib | Why three tracks?

This annex includes key insights that directly shaped the curriculum and ToT.\n\n**On Market Misconceptions (Multiple Interviewees):**\n\n> *\"People think solar doesn't work here. The real problem is they're buying used batteries and cheap BMSs. Of course it fails.\"*  \n— [Name], Solar Installer, [Date]\n\n> *\"Clients don't realize that increasing home temperature increases divorce rates. If they knew the full cost, they'd invest in cooling solutions.\"*  \n— [Name], [Date]\n\n**On Hiring Practices (Zeina Tareq, Private Sector):**\n\n> *\"We don't trust CVs. We do a trial month—usually low or no pay—to test if someone actually knows what they're doing. If they prove themselves, we hire. Otherwise, no.\"*\n\n**On Government Subsidies (Wifaq Ahmad):**\n\n> *\"The government already subsidizes some construction materials. We just need to get insulation and thermal materials added to the list. That would change everything.\"*\n\n**On Heritage & Climate-Responsive Design ([Name], Architect):**\n\n> *\"Our grandparents knew how to build for Mosul. Thick walls, courtyards, strategic window placement. We abandoned all that for cheap concrete boxes. Now we're paying for it—literally—in generator costs.\"*\n\n*(More excerpts available in full interview transcripts)*\n\n### Annex E: Partner Contact List\n\n| Organization | Contact Person | Title | Phone | Email | Willing to Host | Notes |\n|--------------|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|-------|\n| **Aqtab Al-Taqa** | Hossam Al-Deen Khalil | [Title] | [Phone] | [Email] | YES | Suggested cost-sharing for apprentice stipends |\n| **Chisage ESS** | Ali Sabah Mohammed | Sales Manager (Iraq & Middle East) | [Phone] | [Email] | MAYBE | Focus on technical support, inverter maintenance |\n| **Voltage Co.** | Zeina Tareq | [Title] | [Phone] | [Email] | MAYBE | Project-dependent; uses trial month model |\n| **University of Mosul** | Dr. Abdulhakim N.

(200-500k IQD)\n    ├─ YES → RECOMMEND: Reflective thermal paint + window sealing\n    │         Expected savings: 10-20% cooling costs\n    │         ROI: 1-2 years\n    └─ NO → RECOMMEND: Low-cost solutions (curtains, ventilation, behavioral changes)\n              Expected savings: 5-10%\n              Start here, build trust, upgrade later\n```\n\n**Sample 2: ROI Calculator Template (Simplified)**\n\n```\nCLIENT: [Name]\nDATE: [Date]\nPREPARED BY: [Your name]\n\nCURRENT SITUATION:\n- Monthly electricity cost: _______ IQD\n- Primary source: ☐ Grid  ☐ Generator  ☐ Both\n- House size: _______ m²\n- Current cooling/heating: _______________________\n\nPROPOSED INTERVENTION:\n☐ Roof insulation (exterior)\n☐ Roof insulation (interior)  \n☐ Thermal paint\n☐ Window sealing\n☐ Wall insulation\n☐ Other: _______________________\n\nESTIMATED COSTS:\n- Materials: _______ IQD\n- Labor: _______ IQD\n- TOTAL: _______ IQD\n\nESTIMATED SAVINGS:\n- Reduction in kWh consumption: _______% \n- New monthly cost: _______ IQD\n- Monthly savings: _______ IQD\n\nRETURN ON INVESTMENT:\n- Payback period: _______ months (Total cost ÷ Monthly savings)\n- 5-year savings: _______ IQD\n- 10-year savings: _______ IQD\n\nNON-FINANCIAL BENEFITS:\n☐ Improved comfort (more consistent indoor temperature)\n☐ Reduced noise (less generator use)\n☐ Better air quality (less generator pollution)\n☐ Increased home value\n☐ Reduced maintenance (less AC strain)\n\nCLIENT SIGNATURE: _________________ DATE: _______\n```\n\n**Sample 3: Icebreaker Guide (Grandparents' Home)**\n\n**PURPOSE:** Connect participants emotionally; surface heritage design principles; create safe space for sharing\n\n**TIME:** 15-20 minutes\n\n**SETUP:**  \n- Arrange chairs in circle or small groups (4-5 people)\n- No slides needed\n\n**FACILITATION SCRIPT:**\n\n*\"Before we dive into technical content, I want us to remember something. All of us have experienced comfortable homes—maybe not recently, but at some point in our lives.*\n\n*Think back to your childhood. Maybe your grandparents' home, or an older relative's house, or a place you visited. Picture it in your mind.*\n\n*Now think: What made that home comfortable? Even on very hot days, or very cold days, what about that house kept you comfortable? The thick walls? The courtyard? The high ceilings? The way the windows were positioned?*\n\n*Turn to your neighbor and share: Where was this home? What made it work?*\n\n*[Give groups 5 minutes to talk]*\n\n*Let's hear a few examples. Who wants to share?*\n\n*[Collect 3-4 examples; write key features on flipchart: \"thick walls,\" \"courtyard,\" \"high ceilings,\" \"strategic windows,\" etc.]*\n\n*Look at this list. These are principles of climate-responsive design—things our ancestors understood intuitively. We're not here to go backward and copy old homes exactly. We're here to learn the principles, combine them with modern science and materials, and design the homes of the future.*\n\n*That's what we're doing in this training. Let's begin.\"*\n\n**TRAINER NOTES:**\n- This works in every cultural context; everyone has childhood home memories\n- Emphasizes continuity (past wisdom + modern tools)\n- Creates emotional connection before technical content\n- Surfaces local examples naturally (better than showing foreign case studies)\n\n---\n\n### Annex G: Internship/Apprenticeship Framework (Full Document)\n\n*(The detailed framework document created earlier is attached here as a standalone reference)*\n\n---\n\n**END OF REPORT**\n\n---\n\n## Document Metadata\n\n**Title:** Training of Trainers (ToT) Activity Report  \n**Project:** Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT)  \n**Component:** Output 3.3 - Green Skills Development  \n**Period Covered:** October 2024 - October 2025  \n**Submitted by:** [Your Name], Curriculum Development Consultant  \n**Date:** [Submission Date]  \n**Contact:** [Email], [Phone]\n\n---\n\n*This report fulfills the deliverables specified in the Terms of Reference for Output 3: Contribute to Training of Trainers (ToT) activities.*",
