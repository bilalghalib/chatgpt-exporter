And I remembered that I should talk to Mark Crane From dream of Detroit because I talked to him, about applying together for a project the dog Song Foundation. And, we never heard back. So I wanna see if he heard back I don't know why they came to me this morning. Oh, yeah. Because I realized that this thing that I'm making, this, like, prompt for self reflection and growth, is pretty soupy at least. If not, at least Islamic. And, I thought that maybe it could be something that I consult with Islamic, organizations 1st with because they might be better adapted to it or, like, more Easy to Inspire and convince that this is a good idea. Other than that, have an hour to make my support. Hopefully, I'll have about 20 minutes to eat it. Joe wants me to take the baby to the mani today. It's fine. Let's do that. And Hi. Not sure if I'll take at all. I'm thinking about it. I think I will because I wanna have a good day, and Actually, I don't know. We'll figure it out, like, we can correlate whether or not it currently today is the day or not. Into the future. What would make today a good day? Maybe calling my brother Amon? Well, my dad is going to see my sister today, so maybe I could schedule a call to talk to all of them on Zoom rather than WhatsApp. Make it like a real meeting. Oh, I definitely gotta prepare for tomorrow. Have to you know, I should probably write up I think, about this whole process that we're doing. The growth through reflection thing. And, so see if it could be something that isn't just for be bad. And isn't just for Sufis, but something that could be more broadly I'm beginning to think it might not be enough to do it on a system prompt because, like, Kinda think that this history stuff is important. And, Yeah. Something that I would like is it has to be in my own words. You know, like, I see some of these values cards and these other things that you make. And I just don't know if they're, They really hit home because I didn't say it. And so you know, how I have this idea of just, like, writing until you get to a point where you feel like you're You make the l l m has enough of your words write things in your own words. Maybe I should do that for this. As well. What do you think What am I missing? What do I need? Oh, my energy level. Yeah. 3.54. Feeling excited, actually. Excited of using this tool. Kind of testing my own dog food, feeling like it's real. And I'm wondering if that's part of the reason why I have good results as Okay. I really wanted to work. This is gotta be great, so I have to do the thing that tells me. You know, something like that. But it's not even the thing that tells me. I have to use it and reflect Yeah. We Claude tools for Bloom, but we never used them real. I never really you know, like, you know, take the assessments we made serious me personally. I would take him to test if the software worked. I was building it, but not really to deeply reflect. I mean, sometimes we have a little glimpses of insight but there are few and far between. This is like, insight here. I'll see.EditMorning Mirror & Challenge\nCurrent State\n\nTime: 6:30 AM\nEnergy: 3.5-4/5\nEmotional tone: Excited, reflective\nKey insight emerging about \"eating your own dog food\" authentically\n\nPattern Recognition & Challenge\nI notice a critical insight about your previous pattern with Bloom tools:\nCopyBefore: Built tools → Tested functionality → Moved on\nNow: Built tool → Actually using it → Seeing real value\nWhat You Might Not See\nYou're wrestling with authenticity in two ways:\n\nTool Creation\n\n\n\"has to be in my own words\"\nValues cards feeling external\nNeed for personal language\n\n\nTool Usage\n\n\nPrevious pattern: Build but don't deeply use\nCurrent shift: Actually engaging with the tool\nQuestion: Is the engagement real or performance?\n\nDirect Challenge\nYou've mentioned several possible directions:\n\nIslamic organizations angle\nWriting about the process\nFamily Zoom call\nMark Crane follow-up\nTaking Adderall decision\n\nBut what if the most valuable thing right now is to stay with this insight about authentic tool use vs building?

So I just dropped off the baby in a hardware store, and I have a plan for putting up some shelves. I think it could be really cool, to do that. I would feel like I made some progress, and I got a callback asking me to do more work. And if I have time for a call later today, I'm almost done with my vikir, which is awesome. Okay. So all that is good. My wife is having a bit of a tough day. I wanna find a way of supporting her and making her feel Happy? I'm fasting today. I might go pick up the drill so I can just get this job done. Although, I could also work on my system prompt and, facilitation, maybe I should do that with, you actually and just chat through that so I can actually be productive while I'm on the road.

So I'm now back in the art store. I wanted to try some new or different craft That's what I'm finding myself actually you know, like, buying more pens and notebooks than actually using them. I'm sure I'm not the only one that's had this I was thinking of, like, a more hands on craft linocut or something like that, but I can't find those tools here. I picked up what I need, and I'm gonna go I just wanted to get some envelopes to be able to continue my poetry writing for my life. And, think about getting a really big notebook. Just to see if I can actually be more absorbed in the process of writing, then I little bullet journal, but then I'll have 2 bullet journals. I'm wondering if I should use the big notebook to write ideas, and draw things out, Yeah. Just, like, take my ideas more seriously about, like, like, putting their as Iterations of ideas and writing out the stuff that I thought through with the LLM instead of just having things everywhere. And in the bullet journal throughout, like, Voluntary is like my day stuff. Right? Like, what do I do Today and the big one can be, like, this is an idea I had for the book. Let me think about it and write it down. But I do a lot of my thesis best when I'm, like, iterating you over this stuff So Do I the idea of notebooks or do I like I've used to have the bullet journal that I'm pretty active with, and it was nice. It worked. But, yeah. Can you help me reflect on this and let me know if I should make these purchasing decisions? Like, I got my, I think we're getting couple of new notebooks and pens and going home and trying something different. With a really big Luca Term 1917 dot notebook has, like, a a 4. It's, like, really big. Or should I get it completely blank, you know, so I don't have, so I could just draw or should I get it without with dots?

So I bought the yellow 150 gram weight leukoterm notebook and a pen in the envelope for the poems that I write for my wife. And, wanna do it differently this time. Like, Let's just be sure that I'm not being dumb again. Can I use this boat notebook alongside you following my principles in a way that would inspire me, uplift me, be beautiful? I was imagining, you know, Like, practicing a little bit of my poetry in here with Thich Nhat Hanh style, circles using ink. And then also doing things like, writing life's poem or practicing my watercolors that is really when Yeah. And, like, maybe leaving more pages blank, like, more blank. It's sparse and doing some I don't know. Like, my mind works in parallel, and it would be great if I used this notebook well instead of just nice. I think it's too nice to use in scribble, but or the opposite I'm like, I'm just gonna scribble anyway. And the problem with the scribbling anyway thing that. And then, like, I use a little bit, then they stop, and you know, like, how can we do this a little bit differently this time? And, like, what do you think? Are the deep underlying patterns here and how can we move forward? So that it actually is useful for, you know, the different yellow notebook. And I have this Hello. Journal that I use together with you, but It's to here. And part of my idea about, like, appropriate AI use is has to become the, you know, like, somehow all of this enter deeply into me and be something you know, maybe that's you or something. Like, Yes.

I heard of, like, simple, smaller, linear, Models. I've been reading this book called Alignment Problem about AI and it's informing me that it seems like historically, you know, even though we're all excited about big models, it turns out, like, the smallest models sometimes are the most reliable, the most accurate, and give the best results. So, like, what do you think, and how can we scientifically Claude you know, rigorously determine the fewest number of type of variables that we collect in somebody, like values, and blockers. Resistance and values. And they iOS that it's not that you should start with a simple model, but you should start with a complex modeling.

Well, wondering what am I gonna do The packing and when am I gonna buy those things that I told myself I wanted to buy, like, the craft stuff and finding craft today. And then I do have the thing where it's like, ah, buying something. It's like progress because I got this new tool that's gonna make it so that can blah blah blah blah instead of using tools. I'm I want to, like, maybe go through a couple of rounds back and forth thinking about because this is actually a deep and really important thing for me to figure out because, you know, like oftentimes, I read so many books, and when a friend talks to me about a problem or something, I'm like, oh, yeah. There's this really great book. Then they actually implement it. And they get rich or they get know, the progress that they're looking for. Like, their business is more orderly. They they set up, like, systems and it it sticks. Right? It like becomes a foundational part of the world and you know, like, I'm a graffiti artist, I go through and I don't take too much time, I just like scribble on walls. Right? Like with my creativity.

When I get really in Baghdad, really messy or like disrupted, I could double book an and then I'll feel guilty, ashamed, and guilty because it's a pattern that I clip so long.

Sometimes I'm supposed to be in a different country. And I'm booked in another country. And I like, late for my flight or something. It's crazy. It's really like, if you think about it, I can't believe it. Right? Like, who who's like that? I am. And that's too much. That's like one day, was supposed to go to Algeria, and I show up to the, Airport. They're like, your flight left yesterday. And that's not good, Beth. That that's an expensive and painful bet that I have to be really apologetic and sad and sorry and to get them to get me on the next flight for free if they can Android don't know. Other things like that. And maybe this is, like, the problem in my career too. And maybe it's related a little bit to the fact that like, at least my website, you know, it's there. And even if it is very sparse, like, you can see that I've been working on and thinking about stuff. For long enough that I have a record going back years but it's sad that the record also shows that I remember that I can't do things consistently.

You know, I asked my chef the other day, and he was like, don't worry about it. You're good. You know? Something like that. Like, you're good. Just go for it. Right? I just don't believe it somehow.

I guess, you know, there are probably some people in the world whose Good. Is to Just be loving. I mean, like, look at Rumi. He, loved Shamsit Tabriz and wrote all this poetry. I mean, if he was a scholar, it would have impacted it. A few Muslims went study or poetry that touched the world and inspires me at least. It really changed my life by thinking, like, first, I was wise and I wanted to change the world. First, I was smart, and I wanted to change the world. Now I am wise, and I'm changing myself. Like, that felt like a true insight, and it's been a long, slow shifting process, but the fact that those ideas are out there has impacted me and I'm hopefully with my self reflection, check-in tools, or might Support impacting others And now I'm home. And I could take a shower, and I got the wood, and everything is good. Like, I can now go and, Pack the oils Potentially have a call with my assistant Niram, n I l e m.

She can she can go through the backlogs, and maybe I should send her these things. You know? Maybe you can export also all the tasks and like, things that my assistant needs to know about. Maybe all of my to dos, and we can break down which one she can do only I can do That that might be helpful, actually. And then I could do that, and then I can actually make today's.

Setting up the context for emergence and setting up setting up setting up and never actually using the notebooks or you know, even if I make a lot of progress on, like, my thesis and you know, I just kept doing research until it time to write and submit. So I wrote and submitted it, and, like, oh, okay. Great. Finally, somebody else gave me, like, a diploma because they forced me to give in something I've given it, but I didn't take it and turn it into a paper and share it with the world.

I kinda like that, actually. That It's not you know, I maybe it's they say actions are by their intentions. And so let's intend that this book be something that I share And, like, why does sharing matter? Because I need validation? Is it okay to need validation? Or is it about contributing? And so maybe that's what it is. It's like I want to share, but I don't wanna be egotistical. And like, what if I'm just drawing? What if just these little silly things? Like, what should be published and what should not be published and what should be shared and whom and, how can I be sure that it's, like, additive and constructive towards that thing that aligns all those things that we talked about? You know, my need for financial security, my, and my other needs. And actually leverages the way my mind naturally works. You know? And I'm really good at committing. Like, fasting, I can fast. I can really easily not do. Right? And you know, at some point, like, I meditated every day for 3 months for an hour because I was like, that's it. I'm just doing that. It's gonna be a part of my day. I'll find time for it. And I think that I need to not really have a job and be more flexible to be able to do those types of random commitments. And I like this friend's idea of, like, doing something every day for a month as a challenge. But like, I feel really guilty to share on social media these days in between the war without mentioning something about the war or having my work be something for the war. But should my whole life be directed at oppression and violence, Like, how do you have a normal life? When you know not only are the oppressed being injured, but the oppressors are injuring their spirits and their souls. And it's like this has to stop. You know? And maybe there's energy there for me, but also worried about getting canceled or making myself unhireable or even just making myself an activist. Like, that's not me. And Maybe I could put myself into a process where I have a site on my page where I link to all the different things I'm connected to that are happening. And whenever I share, I say, and don't forget this is day x of the war What are you doing Are you connecting with your Jewish friends? Are you supporting Palestinians somehow? Are you making art raising money, teaching, You know, I I've taught You know, polyvagal theory and how to create classrooms of resilience for Palestinian teachers and kinda liked it, but I don't didn't get a lot of feedback afterwards. And I think it's lack of self trust is another interesting thing. It's like maybe we need another question for that. Like, why can't I trust myself?

I have a system prompt. I can put it on GitHub. Maybe I should just, like, blog and, like, describe my process and share and then but share with who. I feel like nobody cares. You know? So the perfume business, 10 years, natural completion cycles, Well, the perfume business is different because you know, Etsy takes care of the marketing and sales and brings me people. All I do is, like, you know, the upfront work of the hard work of you know, taking time, taking pictures, making products, and putting it And then it's just like, here, order. Okay. And then I have all the things at home needed to do it. You know, the files and, I sticker paper and the cardboard and the bottles, and I know where to find it. And know, and then just follow the orders Android there's like this time pressure as well like, oh my god, I'll be late and I won't be a star seller if I don't send it on time and all that stuff. Because when I'm cooking, I love I love people, and I just love to see them happy. And so, like, when I see Joe smile, I'm like, oh, are you happy? Are you she likes it? You know? Yeah. I don't like the idea of activism being an angry thing. I want it to be from love and care and generosity. It didn't feel like enough activism because I didn't know if it was actually helpful. Like, What Did it change anybody's mind? Did it give someone a real tool? Did they use it? Do they remember it? I have no idea. Well, I guess it's hard to trust the validation because it's all online, and I'm here in France, and I have no friends. And all of my impact in the Middle East. I go there Android share her come back And, yeah, also because I don't care what other people think. I care what God thinks, and I don't know what God thinks. Especially, like, with the biggest issue in my life right now is I'm far from my parents. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. And I'm here because my wife wants to be by her mom. But should I go where my parents are? And I don't wanna move back to America. It's kind of a crazy place these days. And this is another real tension that I I definitely need to Stop. Thinking. I've been thinking about it. Since I met the Dalai Lama in 2022. I asked him, who deserves our kindness most? Right. Is it should I go back and be with my parents and and submit to the commandments in the Quran. Maybe that's fundamentally it. It's like one of these big things that God commands us is to be with my parent, be gentle and kind and support them in their old age like they supported you when you were young. And and I don't feel like I'm doing that. I'm far away. I tried doing my best by calling my mom and calling my dad and trying to help my dad with his business and my mom with Quran memorization. But they're getting old and physically feeble and they need help, you know, and what am I supposed to do? I don't even have money to hire them an assistant or, like, cleaners or anything like that. But would that be enough? Would I still feel good enough? Because a lot like, I just wanna cook for them and rub their feet and spend time with them and be good to them the way I can be good to my wife.

And then dropped the letter off in your mailbox and then drove back 11 hours just so that she knows that I did it. You know? And, I have all these bigger visions, and I think that's the thing. Like, I know that when I have this bigger vision that I can something about it, like, you know, new creative studios was a vision. I had a vision about, like, how I wanted to share the beauty of the world, and it became this business and bloom. You know? I had this vision of, like, unlocking human potential for positive change. And even this system prompt, like, it's the same vision. How do we unlock human potential for positive change in themselves and in the world? I I kinda wanna reformulate how I say that like, Becoming you. In the best way, something like that. You know? I have these visions, Android I work on them. And I have this book about bad economics. It's a vision. You know? And I love that about me iOS that the world and all this swirling. Like, if I digest it and and maybe ask some interesting questions or even it comes sometimes in prayer when I have my head on the ground and I'm just like putting all these things together And then, like, a vision would come. It's a small thing, like, buy a flotation experience for your mom. You know? But I have to know more about what's happening for them. And if I'm not there with them or talking to them enough or also, like, my hands are my craft. Like, I'm great at massage. I'm great To listen. I know that like, I actually listen a little bit differently than most people, and my parents life because I have studied you know, nonviolent communication and all these things. And I think I'm making assumptions that they know that I'm there, would feel better, but they're also kinda chaotic crazy and wanna travel and do all these things. And They're just getting older and and decaying and you know, my mom's health is not so great. She doesn't isn't able to come visit her grandson, baby, my baby. Because she has doctor's appointments. I'm like, shoot. Well, then when? You know? Come while he's still a baby. Yeah. What questions do you think I can answer to help me make strong choices? Like, both me and my my wife are not committed to living here forever. More like we know this is temporary.EditDeep Pattern Recognition & Choice Architecture\nWhat Your Examples Reveal\nWhen you operate from vision + spontaneity:\n\nTransformative moments emerge\n\n\n24-hour window → Spain → Sheikh → New community\n22-hour drive → Letter delivery → Love expression\nPrayer inspiration → Flotation gift → Parent care\n\n\nYour unique gifts activate\n\n\nDeep listening\nPhysical care (massage)\nVision emergence\nCommunity building\n\nCritical Pattern Understanding\nYour \"extra\" nature isn't just about grand gestures, it's about:\n\nSeeing possibilities others miss\nActing on inspirations others might dismiss\nCreating meaning through bold moves\n\nKey Tension Revealed\nNot just about location, but about:\n\nTemporary vs Permanent\nPresent Care vs Future Vision\nSmall Actions vs Big Dreams\n\nQuestions to Guide Strong Choices\n\nImmediate Window Question\nGiven your parents' current health and your baby's age, what 3-month window in the next year could be dedicated to intensive parent time?\nVision Integration Question\nHow could your system prompt work (unlocking human potential) include your parents as both participants and beneficiaries?\nLocation Freedom Question\nIf both you and Jo see France as temporary, what location would:\n\n\nSupport both families\nEnable your vision\nCreate community\n\n\nGift Expression Question\nYour hands-on care (massage, cooking) seems core to your expression of love.

CopyRetryBGI like that. I definitely think that this is a critical pattern or a value. Like, let's make a values card about it Creating meaning through bold moves you know, acting on inspiration that others might dismiss or miss. Right? Like, my chaotic diverse brain sees these amazing, like, you know, because I led such a broad, well traveled, broadly exposed Life I see these things that are possible, and I can sort of like the hero's journey. Like, I come home bearing gifts, but I'm not actually going home to my parents, but I'm sharing it with them. Right? Like, I can share things with them. You know? I even shared with them these processes, and coached my dad on how to talk to my brother, but It's it's best when I'm there facilitating the conversation because not able to do it. And I I guess I just feel like I need to be there to do it for them in a way like take care of your body. You know? You know, do intermittent fasting or you know, like, here's the rolfing method to like unlock your fascia so that you're can move more freely. And if you do that, then you'll have less pain. If you have less pain, you'll take more walks. If you take more walks, your blood sugar will go down, etcetera, etcetera. Yeah. I really think that this creating meaning through bold moves and seeing possibilities and on inspiration is a big thing that makes me live and, like, I I want to find the bold move of the day somehow. Yeah. I guess I could go 3 months. I'm gonna go for 3 weeks to visit in April. And then you know, I have a couple of contracts that will probably take me to Iraq I should reply. To the email. Yeah. How could it could we unlock here potentially, including parents I don't know. You think this system prompt, like, if I shared it with my parents, and told them, like, I'll only call you if you fill it out. Once a day, checking in, Yeah. Because, you know, I see my parents and they're like, buying houses, selling houses, so distracted, doing a lot of things manually. Stressing out and I see their patterns and they wanna change. But maybe the system prompt and this setup could be great for them, but, like, how would they do it? They don't really write. They don't really read books. Like, they talk. They're old. You know? What how could I do it? Yeah. Create community. I think we really need to just call our friends more often as a couple. I think that would be great. That's like a small little thing. And maybe the bold move is just like pinging the Habibis group in Lebanon and scheduling that call. Yeah. 3 months intensive presence. 9 months vision building, regular digital connection. That could be great. Maybe 3 months non but 3 months consecutive is kind of intense, and my wife needs to be in France. She currently has the job, and If I did that, then I'd have to pay taxes in America It could be good. Especially if it connected with some other things in America. Like, I love the fall in Michigan. Know, I wonder if we can connect it with some seasons. You know? Like, maybe I can go buy plot of land in Detroit plant stuff. And then find things that I can permaculture so that I don't need to be there every day, but, like, plant in the the spring. And come back in the fall, and have one and a half months, one and a half months, and I can do that with my mom. And we can make it like a community garden, and then we can use it to, like, harvest and feed people. You know? Feed the poor, make it a. And I love that it would be so beautiful and it would connect me to Michigan and connect me to land and earth. And a lot of these things that I talk about like, theoretically, and, yeah, I think it's really hard to commit to, like, moving somewhere. Right? But this would be something, and there's definitely people that live there that we could offer use of the land Maybe my cousin Sarnes could manage it. I have a little bit of money. Like, I could take it out of crypto. And try that. You know? Like, maybe that would be a good idea. And my brother, Amar, who really needs help, Both my brothers really need help too. This is like the other thing about my family. It's like everyone is really struggling. And Amada, like, loves plants, you know, and we can connect it with, business, new creative studios, where we maybe make some herbal aromatic stuff, have a pop up cafe and pay for the trip, you know, me and my wife. She can't she still has until the baby 3 years old the opportunity to take a couple of, years off. Or some time off. Maybe if I talked to my dad and talked to my wife and made a bold like, crypto's about 45,000. Let's say that 15,000 goes to taxes. It's 30,000. Let's say that I give my dad 5,000 of that. And we have 20 $5,000 and commit to using those $25,000 for buying the property for $20,000 or something. And then 5 k for the flights. And then we try to make it self sustaining where we kind of invest in this idea of this community home even if I told my dad that I wanna invest in this to spend more time with him, he'd probably give me that $5,000. We'll have $30,000 We could just put it in the Claude, and we'll figure out the flights. I'm sure we can figure out the flights. And maybe we can start it with this first flight. It's gonna be the beginning of the spring. Like, this is the time. 3 weeks only. Maybe we can check-in to, like, extending the flights. But I like this idea I think we're getting somewhere. And then I could ask my brother, Hamad, to help manage it. Maybe not manage it for the whole year, but just, like, can you promise me to come for a month and a half? Right. And then we can also use that to go through a family process of simplifying my parents' life, and helping my brother, Amen, find a partner and get married. Maybe there's something I can do Maybe in the process of, like, the couple of months working there, inviting know, people from the Muslim community. I could could even from the beginning outreach from From now, And know, talk about doing this. I could ask my sheikh what he thinks, you know, offer this suggestion, like, know, Shay, I've I've really been wanting to meet my parents more often, and I have this idea to, like, set up a community garden that's means like a continual charity so that when we die, like, and I should I should ask my parents to invest in it so that it's like theirs as well. You know? And it's for me, the intention is to be closer to my parents. And I love this thing. So, like, I want to call my mom and I want to do more Quran memorization or reading. So when I started when I found out, like, this 2 for 1 special of like, oh, I call my mom and I help her with her practice. And that's awesome. I get to do so much at the same time. And if I can do that while playing with a baby, even better. So, like, this thing of the the community garden and tying my brother and my family and investing and, like, long term charity and, like, a bold action. And also I've been really stressed out of the money in the stocks and in the, like, crypto and whatever and, like, who cares about that if I don't have family and community? Like why not just sell it and do this? Like, I think that could be cool. And I just need to be confident that I won't be guilty about, like, oh, wow. I could have been a millionaire. Like, I could have bought, like, a whole acres and acres. If I just held on to my crypto and through this bull market. But like, instead of if I just sell it and do this. How can I feel confident that that's the right choice? And yeah, it's a cool idea.

This is actually kinda connected to something that I remember. When I was in Michigan, I had keys to the hackerspace I helped found. I had keys to the robotics studio I was a cofounder of. I had keys to the neutral zone, which is a teen center in Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I was teaching screen printing, and I had keys to my parents' house, and I had keys to my house in downtown Ann Arbor. And I was running a screen fitting studio and a robot studio and I had a hacker space that I was a cofounder of and on the board of, and I just remember feeling like this is awesome. Like, I'm deeply integrated, deeply connected, and, like, this keys set of keys, the the the heft of it, the weight of it just felt awesome. And, like, whenever I would go back to Michigan, I would go to the hacker space, and I would feel happy to see my locker there even if I wasn't a member anymore. I'd left a long time ago. They kept it for me because it's like you know, one of the cofounders' lockers. And it had, like, all of the weird stuff and, like, materiality is really important to me. Like, I had uranium and giant neodymium magnets and fun chocolate project ideas and had memories there. And, like, I I love having that even if I didn't live there anymore. I would go back Android would be a part of it and see it. And when I go to Lebanon and I see this tree in the middle of the road that I love. I don't know why. And even at The university, the AUB in in Beirut, there's a tree that I was there with Josephine, and I saw the bark. And I remembered it's like, Joel, one day we'll be old and we'll have texture in our skin like this bark. And I just remember that moment and that Claude, and that place is special to me. You could say it's sacred or something.

CopyRetryBGYeah. This reminds me of other stuff that I used to do, which is like take memory photos of special moments where I'm feeling happy. I remember one of my previous partners sitting on a stone by a river looking backward over her shoulder at me, and I just was like, this is beautiful and perfect. And I just Claude my eyes and I captured that moment. And I can return to it today And I've been very like, sparse and rare at taking these memory photos because I don't know how much storage I have. But this idea of having these memory anchors, and I guess I'm pretty sentimental as a person. It's just weird for someone that has so little and travels and loses things all the time and is, you know, how many times have I lost my wallet and I lost some media rights given to me by tribes in the Sahara, like I think I left it in San Francisco in the house that I used to crash on its couch for 5 years. But this process of, like, standout memories and moments in our life and, like, what they mean, I think, is really important and, like, how do we help people capture those and use them and their reflections. Like, what's the importance of these memories? Like, how does it actually change what I do today? Yeah. Yeah. Something about inviting continuation. Like spaces. And it's kinda related to this, like, my sealio understanding of my process of creation is, like, create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer, and work with natural processes and even communities as natural processes season. Just the right things together to create the context for the emergence of beauty that I don't even No what's gonna happen. It just emerges unexpectedly. And, yeah, How would we bring in this process of bringing those meaningful stories into the this system prompt, And make What what do we do with that?
