Let me break this down systematically.\n\nCurrent Structure Analysis:\nThe current workshop is 2 hours and 50 minutes long, focusing on design thinking and prototyping with marginalized communities. \n\nStrengths:\n1. Good flow from introduction to practical application\n2. Interactive elements throughout (check-ins, chat sharing, icebreakers)\n3. Mix of theory and practice\n4. Includes both high-tech and grounded solutions\n5. Bookended with reflection (opening word and closing word)\n6. Includes case studies and real examples\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n1. Too compressed for community work - rushing through important topics\n2. Many complex topics get only 5 minutes\n3. Not enough time for relationship building\n4. Limited time for actual prototyping work\n5. Missing community context-setting\n6. No breaks scheduled\n7. No time allocated for cultural considerations\n\nRecommendations for 2-Day Split:\n\nDay 1 - Community Context & Design Thinking Foundations\nMorning (9:00-12:30):\n- Opening ceremony/cultural considerations (30 min)\n- Introductions & community building (45 min)\n- Community context mapping (60 min)\n- Break (15 min)\n- Understanding prototyping in community context (60 min)\n\nAfternoon (13:30-17:00):\n- Story sharing session (45 min)\n- Design thinking principles (60 min)\n- Break (15 min)\n- Local solution showcase (45 min)\n- Community feedback session (45 min)\n- Closing reflection (30 min)\n\nDay 2 - Practical Application & Prototyping\nMorning (9:00-12:30):\n- Opening check-in (30 min)\n- Review & reconnection (30 min)\n- Hands-on design thinking exercises (90 min)\n- Break (15 min)\n- Prototyping basics (45 min)\n\nAfternoon (13:30-17:00):\n- Prototype development (90 min)\n- Break (15 min)\n- Community feedback session (45 min)\n- Action planning (45 min)\n- Closing ceremony (30 min)\n\nKey Improvements:\n1. More time for relationship building\n2. Proper breaks included\n3. Cultural considerations integrated\n4. Extended time for actual prototyping\n5. Community feedback sessions\n6. Action planning for implementation\n7. Opening and closing ceremonies\n8. Balance between structure and flexibility\n\nAdditional Recommendations:\n1. Include local community leaders in facilitation\n2. Build in documentation methods\n3. Consider accessibility needs\n4. Plan for different literacy levels\n5. Include movement activities\n6. Provide materials in local languages\n7. Create space for storytelling\n8. Include evaluation components\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or focus on specific areas you'd like to develop further?",

Let me revise my recommendations for a virtual, multi-timezone workshop with individual projects.\n\nKey Considerations for Virtual Format:\n1. Zoom fatigue - need shorter sessions with more breaks\n2. Time zone management - participants from different countries\n3. Virtual collaboration tools needed\n4. Different internet connectivity levels\n5. Individual project focus while maintaining group learning\n\nRecommended 2-Day Structure:\n\nDAY 1 - CONNECTION & CONTEXT\nSession 1 (2.5 hours):\n- Virtual welcome & tech check (15 min)\n- Introduction & project sharing (30 min)\n- Community context presentation (20 min)\n- Break (10 min)\n- Interactive session: Mapping challenges (45 min)\n- Story highlight presentations (20 min)\n- Closing check-in (10 min)\n\nBreak (1.5 hours) - Offline project work\n\nSession 2 (2.5 hours):\n- Energizer (10 min)\n- Design thinking principles (30 min)\n- Break (10 min)\n- Individual project work with group consultation (45 min)\n- Cross-regional solution sharing (45 min)\n- Day 1 reflection (10 min)\n\nDAY 2 - PROTOTYPING & ACTION\nSession 1 (2.5 hours):\n- Opening & reflection sharing (20 min)\n- Prototyping methods for virtual context (30 min)\n- Break (10 min)\n- Individual prototyping work (45 min)\n- Peer feedback sessions in small groups (35 min)\n- Closing check-in (10 min)\n\nBreak (1.5 hours) - Offline project work\n\nSession 2 (2.5 hours):\n- Energizer (10 min)\n- Project iteration time (45 min)\n- Break (10 min)\n- Action planning presentation (20 min)\n- Individual action plan development (35 min)\n- Final sharing & next steps (20 min)\n\nTechnical Recommendations:\n1. Use Miro/Mural for visual collaboration\n2. Create breakout rooms for small group work\n3. Use chat actively for ongoing engagement\n4. Have alternative participation methods (chat, verbal, collaborative docs)\n5. Record sessions for those who may have connectivity issues\n6. Use asynchronous tools for between-session work\n\nEngagement Strategies:\n1. Pair participants across regions for peer feedback\n2. Create smaller accountability groups in similar time zones\n3. Use shared document for real-time documentation\n4. Incorporate silent reflection time\n5. Mix individual work with group sharing\n6. Use polls and quick surveys for engagement\n7.

            "extracted_content": "\n\n00:00:08 Kalyan\nWe struggle with a common challenge. I mean, I, I, I'd say that I found one version of the answer to that.\n\n00:00:20 Kalyan\nI wouldn't say that would be the answer, but my work over the last three years has been to convert that answer into a framework, right, as to how it can be geologically put into some other terrain and see if the same thing can be worked. And my, my goal was to build a framework that can be contextualized to any place.\n\n00:00:46 Kalyan\nAnd I, I struggled with the challenge and I'll describe it. I'll describe the challenge that I faced.\n\n00:00:57 Kalyan\nAnd then you'd see the commonalities, right? A lot of rural education was very similar to urban education in India, right?\n\n00:01:08 Kalyan\nIt's the same. It's the same shoe that fits all.\n\n00:01:13 Kalyan\nNow, The thing is that the villagers, when they learn the math and the science and learn it the way the urban kids do, by the time they're 15, they fall out of love with their village. They become indifferent to whatever the hell happens to their village.\n\n00:01:28 Kalyan\nWhether somebody comes and minds their mountains off, they don't really care because they've already set their eyes on Bangalore and Mumbai, all these places. So in the process, if education drives all the youth of the village out of the villages, the challenge is the villages will become intellectually bankrupt over a period of time.\n\n00:01:54 Kalyan\nIt just takes one generation. Now we won't have villages anymore.\n\n00:01:59 Kalyan\nAnd that brought me the question, why should we have villages at all, right? The answer is villages have that indigenous wisdom.\n\n00:02:10 Kalyan\nThey are the lighthouses of the indigenous wisdom. So we need to have villages, we need to safeguard their culture because through culture leaves that wisdom of how to how to thrive in coexistence, right?\n\n00:02:27 Kalyan\nAnd all of those things and different civilizations that you spoke about, they evolved different kinds of lifestyles that suited their terrain, right? The way they built houses in Iraq would be very different from the houses they built in Indus Valley, right?\n\n00:02:44 Kalyan\nThe food, they, the clothes they wore, all of these things that add up to culture were defined by how well they understood their surroundings, right? But The thing is that the the challenge, if I say was how do I get the villagers, the youngsters to fall in love with their villages?\n\n00:03:06 Kalyan\nBecause if they don't love it, they won't fight for it, right? And how do I get them to do it?\n\n00:03:12 Kalyan\nAnd the more I thought about motivating them to fall in love with their cities, the more I started realizing it just doesn't work right. Motivation is an effort, whereas it should work like gravity.\n\n00:03:28 Kalyan\nLike it should be as effortless as a snowflake falling on the ground, right? So which means it should work through validation, not motivation.\n\n00:03:41 Kalyan\nSo if I know something, my knowledge should immediately be relevant to 100 other people around me. You know my community.\n\n00:03:50 Kalyan\nWhen they celebrate my knowledge is when I feel validated about learning something and that would be a community LED motivation. It's not a structured motivation, right?\n\n00:04:04 Kalyan\nSo if 1000 farmers benefit by my knowledge of physics, that minimizes the amount of water that I use to irrigate. The whole community talks about my knowledge and then that motivates me to learn more without the facilitators having to motivate the kids to fall in love with the village.\n\n00:04:24 Kalyan\nThe village loves the kids learn what is relevant to the village right now. Having said that, the next level of challenges.\n\n00:04:35 Kalyan\nHow do you link all that up with the concepts that they need to learn? So how do you make the globally global concepts locally relevant?\n\n00:04:46 Kalyan\nAnd that is what we build the framework for. I mean, we could go through it in detail, man.\n\n00:04:52 Kalyan\nI'd love to share and even participate if, if there is AI mean even beyond this UN nonsense or whatever that is. But if if you're keen on doing it and I, I'd love to just volunteer and just be there, You know that that would be something.\n\n00:05:12 Kalyan\nAnd what I would, what I'd be super happy to do is share, share the framework and talk you through whatever I've learned over the years.\n\n00:05:26 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah.\n\n00:05:27 Kalyan\nAnd if that framework makes sense to you, then you know you you'll have something working, or at least you'll have some something to run with, right, Instead of starting from the scratch or yeah.\n\n00:05:41 Bilal Ghalib\nI see the the relationship between the, the emotional and the interpersonal and the cultural and and these kinds of things and wanting to find a way of structuring it into a framework that matches outside and definitely want to learn more about the framework is I'm not sure. I don't know.\n\n00:06:03 Bilal Ghalib\nMaybe next time we we call, we can, we can get you on a computer and you can like share the slides or share a screen or something. So I can see I don't know how the framework is designed, but that that would be great.\n\n00:06:13 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. And already like, yeah, just talking to you today.\n\n00:06:16 Bilal Ghalib\nI feel like it's, it's changing a little bit this, you know, some of my my theory of change, or at least like in my design that I was initially thinking about for being a struggle to motivate to something that's more of a love and a falling for something. And this idea of validation really means a lot.\n\n00:06:43 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd, and it kind of makes me question like in, in what I'm setting out to do, is it possible for me to create these moments of validation where someone learns and does something in a training context where they're celebrated somehow that begins to inspire this desire for continuing to learn? Because in terms of the way that this, this whole thing is architected, it's I'm, I'm like the kick off a little bit.\n\n00:07:09 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's like, you know, understanding what's the, the context and, and then they would move on to maybe either further funding or further longer, you know, they called it a design competition or something like that. And so I'm wondering how can I support as as best as possible in this early phase?\n\n00:07:30 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I really love this idea of, of thinking about how to get that moment of the stuff I'm learning matters to my community, you know?\n\n00:07:41 Kalyan\nYeah, and that way, you know, they have a purpose to learn something. And the purpose is to serve my community, right?\n\n00:07:55 Kalyan\nOtherwise, I spend years learning calculus without knowing why the hell am I learning it, right? It just didn't make sense.\n\n00:08:01 Kalyan\nIt was a lot of hard work. Where is everything that they're learning here immediately?\n\n00:08:08 Kalyan\nIt serves the purpose. They learn thermal physics and they use it to create water bottles which keep the water pleasant for the shepherds in the community.\n\n00:08:21 Bilal Ghalib\nHow does that work?\n\n00:08:22 Kalyan\nAnd if the shepherds are happy, what?\n\n00:08:23 Bilal Ghalib\nIs the water bottle like?\n\n00:08:25 Kalyan\nSo that they use the Pepsi, Pepsi bottles, plastic bottles. The shepherds usually take one bottle, fill, fill it with water.\n\n00:08:36 Kalyan\nAnd, you know, the temperatures here. Yeah.\n\n00:08:38 Kalyan\nSo by afternoon, they're drinking it like coffee, right? It's, it's hot, not even warm.\n\n00:08:44 Kalyan\nAnd So what the kids did is they put 2 bottles, one inside the other and then stuck, you know, the outer bottle onto the, you know, like the two concentrate bottles, right? The neck of the outer bottle was stuck and then they filled the entire gap with rock wool, whatever they they figured out as an excellent thermal insulator.\n\n00:09:13 Kalyan\nAnd it's a fairly simple solution. And the shepherds are so bloody happy.\n\n00:09:18 Kalyan\nThat's amazing. And, and it's a very, very small experiment, but The thing is that it made a difference to about 10 or 20 people.\n\n00:09:27 Kalyan\nNow that kid is now working on building an E bike and then you want to build a greens harvester. You know all of those things with just one sign of validation.\n\n00:09:41 Kalyan\nPeople appreciating him.\n\n00:09:42 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, that's beautiful.\n\n00:09:45 Kalyan\nIt just, yeah.\n\n00:09:47 Bilal Ghalib\nHaving having a village as a contact village as a school, right? And you know, they talk about lifelong learning, but having a similar context for a whole life of learning is different.\n\n00:10:03 Kalyan\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n00:10:04 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's so wonderful to be able to see that stuff happening there. It's not what most people think.\n\n00:10:09 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's like, you know, their their first grade teacher is not their second grade teacher. And they're going to have, you know, individual teachers for every single class in college and maybe probably in a different city for most educated people, right?\n\n00:10:22 Bilal Ghalib\nThey they leave wherever they were to go study somewhere else. And it disconnects so much of learning with contribution.\n\n00:10:29 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I'll see what I can do in this small area. I think the the nice thing is the challenge is bring people together, right?\n\n00:10:39 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd everyone knows that there's a big challenge to rebuilding their their city. And yeah, there's also a real opportunity to potentially do it differently.\n\n00:10:50 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd even if I, you know, follow the rules and make a curriculum that lasts 2 weeks and it's not as I would have done it if I had full control of designing the, the, the whole program. If I can like instill just a couple of these ideas of making sure that by the end of the training they've made somebody's life better, That's it.\n\n00:11:13 Bilal Ghalib\nYou know, something like that, like that, that's already a great, a great change. Yeah.\n\n00:11:18 Bilal Ghalib\nBecause one of the things that I was taught when I've been doing a lot of interviews with people that are working in sustainability and you know, they, they usually say the reason is, for instance, on this, this lady who is running a solar company in Iraq is that she loves animals, right? She has a love reason for doing the hard thing of starting a business as a woman in Iraq to bring solar like electricity and, and to outfit places.\n\n00:11:48 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I think that connecting people in that moment of, hey, we're learning something about sustainability, but like, what's the point of sustainability? The whole point of like reduction in greenhouse gases is to make a livable planet for you and your neighbors to to be able to take care of the animals that are your friends in your environment, to be able to, you know, these abstract concepts, You know, like right now, I think they want us to measure like greenhouse gases.\n\n00:12:14 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd a lot of the the focus is on income, right? They're like, Hey, if you 222 directional, right?\n\n00:12:22 Bilal Ghalib\nSo One Direction is if you learn how to install solar panels, you can have a job. And in the Middle East where there's, you know, a lot of low employment and employment is related to having a family and getting married because otherwise you can't get married.\n\n00:12:36 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd there's like the desire for marriage. So getting a job is like high priority for everyone.\n\n00:12:40 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so there's this pressure, right? And so if you say, hey, like learn these techniques and you can get a job, that's one.\n\n00:12:46 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd then the other one is you have a home, you have your family, but you're paying for gasoline. I don't know if you know, in Iraq, the power cuts all the time.\n\n00:12:54 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so most people are running on generators. And that's a first of all, it's horrible for the planet.\n\n00:12:59 Bilal Ghalib\nThere's a lot of pollution. The city smells terrible and their generators are running non-stop because of air conditioning and because of electrical needs.\n\n00:13:09 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so when you say, hey, if you install a solar panel, there's an increase in upfront cost, but long term you're actually gonna be better off. And financially, there's another financial motivation.\n\n00:13:21 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I'm, I'm trying to bring in more of this, this love motivation into the equation, this. And I, I really like this idea of somehow including validation, basically like, first of all, helping somebody.\n\n00:13:36 Bilal Ghalib\nYou're, you're right, though, I didn't realize that it's missing the validation element. There needs to be a celebration of the person's validate, like support of somebody else, right?\n\n00:13:45 Bilal Ghalib\nSomehow in the meaning there needs to be a moment of I don't know who helped the most number of people or like clapping or somehow highlighting.\n\n00:13:54 Kalyan\nYeah.\n\n00:13:54 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah.\n\n00:13:55 Kalyan\nThat element I mean in the In that sense, helping one should not be less than helping 1000.\n\n00:14:01 Bilal Ghalib\nIndeed.\n\n00:14:02 Kalyan\nRight, It's, it's still still equal at some level. Now talking about solar Bilal, I, I remember recently coming across a Bangladeshi company which was started by a German group of people.\n\n00:14:16 Kalyan\nI'll send you the link right after the call. So I think, I don't remember the name, but I've got the link in my WhatsApp.\n\n00:14:28 Kalyan\nI'll just send it to you. I found their solution very, very interesting.\n\n00:14:34 Kalyan\nWhat they do is they they set up solar panels, which is, which is fairly, you know, like standardized right now everybody sets up solar panels, but what they do is they connect every home to every other home. All right, So they create a community of solar panels and then enable each homeowner to trade energy.\n\n00:15:03 Kalyan\nSo one day you, your house may have guests and you might need a little more electricity than my house needs, so I'll sell electricity to you. So then at the end of the day, we all consolidate the bills and the energy consumption and everything.\n\n00:15:17 Kalyan\nSomebody wins and somebody doesn't have to pay as much as they would if they were to pay to the grid directly. So it becomes a passive income source as well.\n\n00:15:27 Kalyan\nThat's just a beautiful innovation I felt, and it's a the solution looked like a hack built in one of the hacker spaces, you know?\n\n00:15:38 Bilal Ghalib\nI'm sure could have started.\n\n00:15:39 Kalyan\nLike that, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n00:15:43 Kalyan\nSo.\n\n00:15:45 Bilal Ghalib\nOne of the other elements that I've been doing some research on is not not just like how do you bring more energy in, but just lowering the energy costs and the it's, it's sort of like this upfront cost and design leads to lower long term costs. But in, in the Middle East and even in, in Muslim, in this area, what they used to have quite often is very, very narrow streets, not a lot of exposure to the sun.\n\n00:16:15 Bilal Ghalib\nBut what they would have is a courtyard with trees and water in the middle and rooms all around it, right? And so if you're walking in the city, you don't see anything.\n\n00:16:24 Bilal Ghalib\nYou just basically see mud walls like this, right? Like, like you're in a tunnel.\n\n00:16:28 Bilal Ghalib\nBut once you go into one of the doors, you're in a garden. So already, you know, water and trees are gonna lower the temperature.\n\n00:16:37 Bilal Ghalib\nThe, the, the area on the top might be covered with a partial mesh and, and then all the, all the rooms are actually in on the circle on the, on the outskirts. And this type of design usually also has like religious reasons for it because of privacy concerns.\n\n00:16:55 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd also families in the Middle East love to stay together. Like this is one of the things.\n\n00:16:59 Bilal Ghalib\nSo you, you know, you have your, the family on the 1st floor, maybe extended family on the top floor and things like this, but that's not how they're building anymore because I don't know who's bringing in the bad ideas, you know where.\n\n00:17:14 Kalyan\nYeah.\n\n00:17:15 Bilal Ghalib\nWho's who's bringing in the cinder blocks?\n\n00:17:18 Kalyan\nYeah, I I'm told it's all the best, Yeah.\n\n00:17:21 Bilal Ghalib\nReally. But how do you do that?\n\n00:17:22 Bilal Ghalib\nHow do you say, OK well I have a better idea. How about we like put you on a hill exposed on all sides and build it completely out of this like massive thermal sink?\n\n00:17:32 Kalyan\nYeah, yeah, I don't Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n00:17:37 Kalyan\nThey, they ignore the native intelligence, right. I mean.\n\n00:17:41 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah.\n\n00:17:42 Kalyan\nYeah.\n\n00:17:44 Bilal Ghalib\nThis is this is super cool, man. I'm glad to see that this educational component is done.\n\n00:17:48 Bilal Ghalib\nYou mentioned that it was your hope that they could then propagate it, but how would they be able to propagate it? And what did they take it to villages and train like an elder on on something about matching the curriculum with the framework or or how how were you thinking that it would be get propagated?\n\n00:18:10 Kalyan\nAnd so the framework for our district, we have contextualised that framework and we'll train people in how to contextualise it to their terrain, training terrain. So that's the idea.\n\n00:18:27 Kalyan\nAnd I'm thinking of starting a fellowship sometime next year. It will be a fellowship for the Special Forces veterans who retired pretty early in their life, like in their 30s, mid 30s and all.\n\n00:18:43 Kalyan\nYeah, yeah, yeah, babe. And they're at their at the peak of their physical and mental agility.\n\n00:18:48 Kalyan\nAnd so and they're always looking for a second purpose in their life. And so I was thinking instead of training civilians to, you know, believe in brotherhood, which is impossible, I thought we could take a bunch of these Special Forces guys and then we don't have to train them in any of these.\n\n00:19:11 Kalyan\nThey are mission focused. They have a sense of brotherhood.\n\n00:19:16 Kalyan\nThey are really gritty. They don't give up all the right things and then train them in this framework and train them in the economic model.\n\n00:19:30 Kalyan\nSo on one hand, the education tells them what ought to be done and how to do it, and economy tells them if you do it, I'll incentivize you.\n\n00:19:45 Bilal Ghalib\nInteresting. What's the economic?\n\n00:19:47 Kalyan\nModel, economic model is like this design question I very clearly remember asking myself is that how do we build an economic system that incentivizes us to work on what really matters to us, like preserving what keeps us alive? And and building what makes our life meaningful.\n\n00:20:17 Kalyan\nSo what keeps us alive is nature, the natural ecosystems. And what makes our life meaningful is a sense of community, right?\n\n00:20:29 Kalyan\nSo how can an economy be designed to incentivize us if we work to build healthy ecosystems and happy communities?\n\n00:20:40 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, that's a great question. I'd love to see what you've, yeah, come up with in terms of an answer to this question.\n\n00:20:47 Kalyan\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, now we have a model we we fail 11 times in answering this question completely.\n\n00:20:54 Kalyan\nIf it worked on economic benefit, it wasn't working on ecosystem. If it worked on, you know, economic benefit and ecosystem, then it will not work on social cohesion.\n\n00:21:06 Kalyan\nAnd now the 12th iteration is what seems to work and all so and we're working on it right now. We're hitting the market with that economic model.\n\n00:21:20 Kalyan\nAnd this year my goal is to get the women from one whole village to participate in this economic model and then show that as a proof of concept.\n\n00:21:30 Bilal Ghalib\nThat would be. That's really, really amazing.\n\n00:21:32 Bilal Ghalib\nThis is actually another branch of my thinking. I'm actually taking a, a bunch of classes and courses on they call it Islamic gift economics and trying to think, you know, similar questions that around around these things that you've mentioned.\n\n00:21:50 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd there's a, a story about this guy. Just to give you like an example of where my, my mind is going around these things, this idea of Baraka, you know, you can have stuff, but unless God places Baraka or blessings in it, it, it will not satisfy, right?\n\n00:22:09 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so there's a story about this person who came to a chef and was like, listen, my job doesn't pay me enough. They only pay me 55 dinars.\n\n00:22:21 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd the chef was like, go back and ask for four. And he's like, but I can't make it on five.\n\n00:22:25 Bilal Ghalib\nHow am I going to make it on four? He's like, go.\n\n00:22:26 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so he goes and then he comes back. It's like, I told you, I can't make it on five.\n\n00:22:30 Bilal Ghalib\nI'm not making it on four. The chef has like, go back, ask for three.\n\n00:22:34 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so he goes back and he asks for three. And then he comes back and he says, thank you chef.\n\n00:22:41 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd then he walks away and somebody seeing this asks him like, but he wasn't making it on five. How is he now thanking you for only getting 3 dinars?\n\n00:22:50 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd the chef says when it was five, there was some inequity. I know the value of his work wasn't 5 dinars.\n\n00:22:58 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so God wasn't blessing him with what he had because he was trying to get more than he was actually providing. And once it was a good match, then I knew it would be good.\n\n00:23:09 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so this idea of like, this is one of the, the ways that I think about it is like all of the different ways that we're blocking blessings from entering into the economic system. And this is, you remember, in my Newark creative studios, like the oil business, you know, This is why we like visit the land, visit the farmers, visit these people.\n\n00:23:27 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd yeah, I'm thinking a lot about this economic model as well. And this, this makes me think that we should have a call.\n\n00:23:34 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I'd loved it. I don't know if it's weird, but if I could just get a presentation on both of these things, the framework and the economic model and I can like do a screen recording or something.\n\n00:23:48 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd maybe I can share some of it with the UN somehow. Maybe there's some pieces that that make sense.\n\n00:23:53 Bilal Ghalib\nBut also, I just would love to learn and you can pick a time that works and it'll be awesome to see you again, yeah.\n\n00:24:01 Kalyan\nYeah, yeah, I'd be happy to do it. I'll send a little video on my talk on the education model.\n\n00:24:12 Kalyan\nYeah, I look stupid in that because I had shaved my head and it was just a couple of days after my dad had passed. It was a commitment that I had made.\n\n00:24:22 Kalyan\nSo I recorded it at 2:00 AM in the morning, and I'll share that with you. And I see that.\n\n00:24:34 Kalyan\nI mean, you're you're talking about a city and bringing people together in a city and, you know, forming them into a community. I'm talking about a village.\n\n00:24:43 Kalyan\nIt's like the same design question holds, but the scale is different. Yeah, right.\n\n00:24:52 Kalyan\nUltimately we are dealing with humans who are getting separated and we want them to bind together with a, with a, some kind of a common thread, right. And that, that that sustains.\n\n00:25:05 Kalyan\nSo I wonder if I'll share that.\n\n00:25:09 Bilal Ghalib\nWe can consider neighbourhoods and sub neighbourhoods, micro villages. Like I have a very different vision for what could be awesome to do, but I'm not sure it's it's at all.\n\n00:25:21 Kalyan\nYou wouldn't really like it.\n\n00:25:22 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. But this idea of like, yeah, little Oasis, like permaculture villages that are self-sufficient even like with the agriculture and like urban farming, but just yeah, like clusters in within the city limits, like how cool would that be?\n\n00:25:38 Bilal Ghalib\nWe have the opportunity to try again, like to make a city absolutely different.\n\n00:25:43 Kalyan\nAbsolutely, absolutely. Even I'm thinking there is no reason why Proto Village should be about a village, right?\n\n00:25:52 Kalyan\nIt could be a little little neighbourhoods which are reasonably self reliant, but they're porous enough to be interdependent because no entity can be self-sufficient on its own. Completely.\n\n00:26:05 Kalyan\nNothing is, even the planet isn't. So the idea would be that how can we take the strengths of each community and get them to become very self reliant and get get them to also be humble enough to depend on their neighbor neighboring community.\n\n00:26:25 Kalyan\nSo then there is cohesion.\n\n00:26:27 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, yeah, that builds the meaning aspect as well and builds the the the connection.\n\n00:26:34 Kalyan\nYeah, yeah. So very exciting.\n\n00:26:40 Kalyan\nYeah, very.\n\n00:26:40 Bilal Ghalib\nExciting and I'm glad I'm glad to be chatting with you and I'm glad to yeah, be working more on the physical stuff again. You know, I was working a lot more on on training and digital, but but yeah.\n\n00:26:55 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd you got me inspired to, to think about this idea of celebrating people and making sure that every time they're learning, they're contributing no matter what it is. And I think that's, that's already a huge insight for me.\n\n00:27:09 Bilal Ghalib\nSo I, I've taken away a lot and thank you so much for your time, man. And hopefully hey.\n\n00:27:14 Kalyan\nThanks, Bilal. Anytime, anytime.\n\n00:27:16 Bilal Ghalib\nSoon I get the. Just let me know when is a good time for you to to go over the frameworks.\n\n00:27:20 Bilal Ghalib\nI'd love to do that someday soon.\n\n00:27:25 Kalyan\nHow about the 15th evening?\n\n00:27:31 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, I think that works. I fly on the 16th to Iraq, so it's perfect timing.\n\n00:27:38 Kalyan\nOK, if that works, then what I could do is I could in the meantime send whatever I have. Yeah, the written part and the spoken part and everything.\n\n00:27:48 Kalyan\nWe could just go over the discussion so that you can we can consolidate a few silver bullets for you.\n\n00:27:54 Bilal Ghalib\nThat sounds thank you so much man big hugs, say hi to.\n\n00:27:58 Kalyan\nHey, big hug and lots of love.\n\n00:28:01 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd the family. And I hope I get to sleep and the honeycomb soon.\n\n00:28:09 Kalyan\nSoon. Soon, yeah.\n\n00:28:11 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah.\n\n00:28:13 Kalyan\nYeah. Hey, I just wanted to ask you, what was the word that you said God's blessing?\n\n00:28:19 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's called Baraka.\n\n00:28:21 Kalyan\nHow do you spell it in English if you have to spell it in English?\n\n00:28:24 Bilal Ghalib\nBARAKA.\n\n00:28:28 Kalyan\nOh, there's a movie by that name.\n\n00:28:30 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, I think it might be Baraka. I'm not sure.\n\n00:28:34 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, but yeah, Baraka, Baraka is, is about blessings. And you know, you can ask for blessings in your time, in your relationships, in your money and your food.\n\n00:28:45 Bilal Ghalib\nThey say if you don't bless your food before you eat it, it's not nourishing, right? And it's just this different way of seeing the world.\n\n00:28:51 Bilal Ghalib\nYou know, you can have all the things that you think you need, but unless you're satisfied and unless your body is able to like absorb the food, unless you're doing things in a way that's ethical and right, things will be off, something will be off. And so this idea of like a better care based economy, or at least the way that I, I frame it.\n\n00:29:12 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I was thinking even as simple as I'll give you an example of a business that I think is filled with Vertica. It's called Tunic.\n\n00:29:18 Bilal Ghalib\nThey work with a cooperative of women, shepherds and Tunis and they make beautiful objects. And I like they're very explicit about their values.\n\n00:29:30 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I'm just excited to find businesses like that. And I, I want to find more.\n\n00:29:34 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I was thinking about making a catalogue and calling it like Vertica businesses. When you shop here, things are better.\n\n00:29:42 Bilal Ghalib\nSomething like that.\n\n00:29:43 Kalyan\nAwesome. Awesome, yeah.\n\n00:29:45 Bilal Ghalib\nAlright man, super, send me the resources and let's talk again on the 16th inshallah.\n\n00:29:52 Kalyan\nYeah, 15th, 15th, 15th, 15th. I fly.\n\n00:29:53 Bilal Ghalib\n16th I fly. Yes.\n\n00:29:55 Bilal Ghalib\nOK Yeah. Yeah.\n\n00:29:56 Bilal Ghalib\nBye. Alright.\n\n00:29:57 Kalyan\nBye bye, bye bye, take care.\n\n\n\n"

            "extracted_content": "Please review the following context and identify my goals, themes, and needs for a 2 day 2.5 hour workshop. Ask me 10 questions to help you create a smooth workshop flow. I will add the context and then the current slides for my session:\nContext: \"\"\"Below is a revised structure and narrative flow that integrates the iterative loops of design thinking seamlessly into the workshop, using “How might we” questions and emphasizing closeness with the communities involved. The idea is to show that the design thinking process is not a sudden pivot, but rather a natural extension of the reflective storytelling and values exploration done earlier.\n\nTitle of the Session (Day 2):\nPrototyping With/In Marginalized Communities - Workshop Day 2\n\nOverarching Theme:\nMoving from stories and values (Day 1) to structured creativity and tangible prototypes, while maintaining closeness, empathy, and authenticity with marginalized communities.\n\nIntroduction (5–10 minutes)\nContextual Bridge From Day 1:\n\nRecap the Stories & Values: Begin by reminding participants of the stories they shared the previous day and the values they uncovered. Emphasize that these stories revealed where their attention naturally goes, what brings them alive, and what they truly care about.\n\nLink to Design Thinking: Introduce the concept that these stories and values now serve as the raw material for the next steps in the design thinking cycle. Emphasize that design thinking is not a sudden departure from reflection and storytelling, but a structured way of building on them. It’s a way to translate emotional resonance and intimate understanding into meaningful action.\n\nKey Message:\n“We’ve discovered what matters to us and to those we care about. Now, we’ll use design thinking loops—empathy, defining the problem, ideation, prototyping, and iteration—to turn those insights into meaningful interventions.”\n\nHow Might We…? Framing (15–20 minutes)\nIntroducing the “How Might We” Question:\n\nPurpose of HMW: Explain that “How might we” questions are a key design thinking tool. They transform insights, pain points, or aspirations into open-ended invitations for solutions. “How might we” questions help keep the door open to creativity while staying closely tied to the human needs uncovered in stories.\n\nConnecting Back to Values & Attention: Remind participants that the values and attention points identified the day before can guide the framing of these questions. For example, if a participant’s story revealed their community’s struggle with accessing clean water and the joy they feel when neighbors help each other, their “How might we” question might reflect both needs and values: “How might we create a sustainable, community-driven way to ensure clean water access, building on our tradition of mutual care?”\n\nActivity:\n\nFrom Story to HMW: In small breakout groups, have participants revisit the values and pain points they uncovered. Ask them to transform these insights into at least one “How might we” question.\nExample Prompts:\nConsider the story of living closely with a marginalized community (like Kalayan did in Protovillage). What core need emerged from that relationship?\nHow might we capture the spirit of closeness, co-creation, and cultural wisdom within a single question that guides our next steps?\nGroup Share (Plenary): Volunteers share their “How might we” questions and receive feedback to ensure the question remains open, hopeful, and grounded in empathy.\n\nCloseness, Creativity, and Innovation (15–20 minutes)\nFraming Closeness as a Catalyst:\n\nHighlight the Importance of Empathy & Immersion: Remind participants that creativity and innovation don’t happen in a vacuum. They arise from being genuinely close to the people and contexts we aim to serve.\nKalayan’s Story (Protovillage): Revisit Kalayan’s story. Emphasize how living among marginalized farmers for two years unlocked insights no secondhand research could replicate. This closeness fueled more meaningful “How might we” questions and deeper empathy in the design process.\nReflection Prompt:\n“In light of your ‘How might we’ question, what actions or steps can you take to get closer—physically, virtually, or emotionally—to the communities you’re designing for? Even if you can’t live among them, how can you connect more authentically to ensure your solutions emerge from shared understanding?”\n\nIntegrating the Design Thinking Loop (20–30 minutes)\nExplain the Iterative Nature:\n\nEmpathy → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test & Iterate: Show a simple visual of the design thinking loop, highlighting that we’ve already done an in-depth empathy phase through storytelling and reflection.\nWe’re Now in the ‘Define & Ideate’ Stages: The “How might we” framing serves as a bridge to the ideation stage. This makes the transition feel organic, since we are simply moving from insight to inquiry, and from inquiry to possibility.\nActivity - Quick Ideation Session:\n\nBrainstorm in Breakouts: Now that each participant has a “How might we” question, spend 10–15 minutes in small groups brainstorming solutions. Encourage wild ideas, and remind participants that their solutions should resonate with the values and attention points identified in Day 1.\nIterate and Refine: After the initial brainstorm, participants pick one idea they find promising and refine it slightly by asking themselves: “Does this idea align with the values we identified? Does it reflect our closeness and respect for the community?”\nPrototyping as a Natural Next Step (20–30 minutes)\nSeamless Transition to Prototyping:\n\nFrom Ideas to Prototypes: Emphasize that prototyping is not a separate, abrupt step. It’s simply taking the best ideas that emerged from the “How might we” phase and giving them form—even if it’s just a rough sketch, storyboard, or role-play scenario.\nWhy Prototype With/In Communities?: Reiterate that by involving community members in early prototypes, participants can ensure solutions are culturally relevant, respectful, and genuinely meet local needs. The prototype becomes a conversation piece, a way to invite deeper dialogue and co-creation.\nHands-On Prototype Exercise:\n\nParticipants create a low-fidelity prototype—something as simple as a sketch or a concept map—of one idea they brainstormed.\nThey share these prototypes in breakout groups, receive feedback, and consider how they might refine them further. Encourage them to think: “If I showed this to the community I care about, what feedback would they give me?”\nClosing Reflection (10–15 minutes)\nLooking Back and Ahead:\n\nRevisit the Quotes and Themes: Reflect on the guiding quotes:\n“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive...” (Howard Thurman)\n“The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” (Mahatma Gandhi)\nCelebrate the Integration: Acknowledge the journey participants took—from personal stories and values to “How might we” questions, idea generation, and early prototypes. Stress that design thinking is a loop: as they engage with communities, they’ll return to empathy, redefine challenges, ideate anew, and prototype again, continuously improving and deepening the closeness of their relationship to those they serve.\nFinal Prompt:\n“What is one next step you can take to bring your prototype closer to the community you serve, ensuring that your process remains alive, values-driven, and grounded in genuine human connection?”\n\nBy integrating the “How might we” questions, emphasizing closeness, and illustrating the iterative loops of design thinking, the workshop flows naturally from deep personal reflection to actionable design steps. The participants’ stories and values are not left behind; they are carried forward as the foundation for each subsequent design stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nhow can we include some of the school for social design content about values from joe edelman into our content? \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIncluding Joe Edelman's School for Social Design content about values can add depth and clarity to your workshop. Edelman’s approach emphasizes designing for what people value—what they care about most deeply—and creating systems and designs that align with those values. Here’s how you can incorporate his ideas into your workshop:\n\n1. Frame the Workshop Around Value-Driven Design\nIntroduce Edelman’s Concept of Values:\n\nStart with a brief introduction: “In design, values are the things people care about deeply. They are not preferences or goals but the qualities of life that make experiences meaningful.”\nShare examples of values (from Edelman’s framework): community, connection, autonomy, belonging, growth, creativity, joy.\nKey Quote for Framing: “We don’t design for outcomes; we design for the kinds of experiences and relationships people value.”\n\nActivity:\n\nAsk participants to reflect on the values driving their own projects:\n“What does your community truly value? What do you value in your work?”\nUse a values mapping exercise: List values that resonate with their projects and communities. Provide a sheet with examples of values from Edelman’s work to inspire them.\n2. Use Value Propositions as a Bridge to Design Thinking\nIntroduce Value Propositions:\n\nExplain that before jumping to “How might we” questions, we first need to understand the specific values we aim to nurture through our designs.\nExample: If the value is \"connection,\" the “How might we” question might become:\n\"How might we create spaces that strengthen meaningful connections within the community?\"\nActivity:\n\nPair participants in breakout rooms and have them work on defining the core values behind their “How might we” question.\nPrompt: “For whom are you designing? What values will your solution aim to honor or amplify?”\nShare Examples:\n\nUse stories that highlight values-based design, such as Joe Edelman’s focus on creating systems that support authentic relationships (e.g., social media platforms that prioritize connection over engagement metrics).\n3. Incorporate Edelman’s Concept of “Attention”\nEdelman emphasizes that what we pay attention to reflects and shapes our values. Help participants explore how attention can guide their design process.\n\nMini-Lecture:\n\nExplain that attention is the gateway to values: “Where people focus their attention reveals what matters to them. Design can either amplify this focus or distract from it.”\nActivity: Mapping Attention to Values\n\nAsk participants to map where attention naturally flows in their communities:\nExample: In a farming community, attention might be on water access, social gatherings, or crop cycles.\nHave participants connect these attentional focal points to values (e.g., water access = security, social gatherings = connection).\nDiscuss how designs can either support or disrupt these attentional flows.\n4. Add a Module on Designing Systems for Values\nInteractive Lecture:\n\nShare Edelman’s idea of designing systems that align with values rather than optimizing for specific outcomes.\nExample: Instead of designing an app to increase time spent on education, design for values like curiosity and autonomy in learning.\nActivity:\n\nHave participants critique an existing system or service in their community:\nDoes it align with community values?\nWhere does it fall short?\nPrompt them to redesign or tweak the system to better reflect shared values.\n5. Use Value Prototypes\nIntroduce Value Prototypes:\n\nEdelman emphasizes rapid prototyping to test whether a design honors the intended values.\nTeach participants to test not just usability but whether their designs evoke the right values.\nActivity:\n\nDuring the prototyping phase, ask participants to sketch or build low-fidelity prototypes with a focus on values.\nUse questions like:\n“Does this prototype foster the values you’ve identified?”\n“How does it feel to interact with this design? Does it evoke connection, joy, or growth?”\n6. Reflection and Closing with Values\nEnd the session with a reflection on how values shape design and life.\n\nPrompt:\n\n“Reflect on the values you discovered during this workshop. How can you ensure your work continues to amplify those values for yourself, your community, and the people you design for?”\nQuote to Close:\n“When we design with values in mind, we create systems that not only solve problems but also enrich lives.”\n\nAdditional Materials to Include:\nValues Worksheet: Include a worksheet listing examples of values and a space for participants to define their own.\nCase Studies: Share examples from Edelman’s work or similar projects that illustrate values-driven design.\nFeedback Loop: Build time for participants to test whether their designs align with the values they identified.\nBy grounding your workshop in Edelman’s ideas, you not only teach participants to design effective solutions but also help them create systems that truly resonate with human experiences. Would you like help designing specific materials, like a values worksheet or slide deck?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nCan you make a problem feeling story gathering values worksheet think about how it can be simple in language because these are youth from around the world and easy to do and matches the tone and attitude in our design thinking workshop, we do not want to diverge too much from design thinking, it should still be the core\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a simple and engaging Problem-Feeling-Story Gathering Worksheet designed to align with the tone and structure of your design thinking workshop. It’s focused on youth, uses simple language, and smoothly integrates values discovery into the design thinking framework.\n\nProblem-Feeling-Story Gathering Worksheet\nName: _______________________\nProject/Community: _______________________\n\nStep 1: The Problem\nThink about the main challenge or problem you are trying to solve in your project or community.\nQuestion: What’s one big problem that people in your community (or the people you care about) face?\n\nWrite a sentence or two about it:\nFollow-Up Question:\n\nWhy is this problem important to you?\nStep 2: The Feeling\nEvery problem comes with feelings. These feelings can tell us what values matter most.\nQuestion: How do people feel when they experience this problem?\n\nWrite some words that describe these feelings:\nFollow-Up Questions:\n\nHow does this problem make you feel?\nWhy do you think these feelings are so strong?\nStep 3: The Story\nStories can help us understand why this problem matters.\nQuestion: Can you think of a real example of this problem?\n\nWrite a short story or example:\nFollow-Up Questions:\n\nWhat values do you think are hidden in this story? For example, values like fairness, connection, creativity, or safety?\nCircle the ones that fit:\nFairness\nConnection\nCreativity\nSafety\nGrowth\nJoy\nOther: ________________________\nStep 4: Connecting to Design Thinking\nDesign thinking is about creating solutions that honor what people care about.\nQuestion:\n\nBased on your answers above, what is one value you want your solution to honor?\nQuestion:\n\nWhat’s one way you can design a solution that reflects this value?\nStep 5: How Might We?\nNow let’s turn this into a design question!\n\nQuestion:\n\nBased on your problem, feelings, and values, create a “How might we” question.\nHow might we _____________________ (do what?) for _____________________ (who?) so that _____________________ (value)?\n\nTips for Workshop Facilitators:\nKeep It Flexible: Encourage participants to share as much or as little as they are comfortable with, especially when discussing feelings or personal stories.\nUse Examples: Give participants a quick example from your own experience to make it relatable. For instance:\nProblem: “My community struggles with clean water.”\nFeeling: “It makes people feel frustrated and unsafe.”\nStory: “Last year, my family had to spend a week without clean water because the local pipes broke.”\nValues: “Safety, fairness.”\nHow Might We: “How might we make clean water access fair and reliable for everyone?”\nGroup Sharing: If time permits, let participants share their worksheet answers in small groups to inspire each other.\nThis worksheet stays grounded in design thinking while gently introducing values through personal stories and emotions. It’s easy to fill out, supports reflection, and seamlessly integrates into the flow of your workshop. Would you like me to create a visual design or printable version for this worksheet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nContent we can add from protovillage.org's founder kalayan: This conversation with Kalyan reveals several profound insights about community-based education, sustainable development, and authentic motivation. Here are the key insights and notable quotes:\nKey Themes & Insights:\n\nValidation vs. Motivation\n\n\n\"Motivation is an effort, whereas it should work like gravity... it should be as effortless as a snowflake falling on the ground\"\nThe idea that learning should be validated by community impact rather than external motivation\n\n\nEducation & Community Connection\n\n\nThe problem of education causing youth to \"fall out of love with their village\"\nVillages as \"lighthouses of indigenous wisdom\"\nThe importance of maintaining cultural knowledge and local solutions\n\n\nApplied Learning & Immediate Impact\n\n\nThe example of students using thermal physics to create better water bottles for shepherds\n\"Everything that they're learning here immediately serves a purpose\"\nSmall solutions leading to bigger ambitions\n\nNotable Quotes:\n\nOn Indigenous Wisdom:\n\"Villages have that indigenous wisdom... through culture leaves that wisdom of how to thrive in coexistence\"\nOn Community Validation:\n\"If 1000 farmers benefit by my knowledge of physics... that motivates me to learn more without the facilitators having to motivate the kids\"\nOn Purpose:\n\"Otherwise, I spend years learning calculus without knowing why the hell am I learning it\"\nOn Community Design:\n\"How can we take the strengths of each community and get them to become very self reliant and get them to also be humble enough to depend on their neighboring community\"\n\nPractical Examples:\n\nThe Water Bottle Innovation:\n\n\nStudents used simple materials (Pepsi bottles and rock wool)\nApplied thermal physics knowledge\nCreated immediate community impact\nLed to continued innovation interest\n\n\nEconomic Model Goals:\n\"How do we build an economic system that incentivizes us to work on what really matters to us, like preserving what keeps us alive?

When the only tool you have every problem looks like a nail, that's why people so often make an \"app for that\" and today it will be AI solutions for that. Let's think more deeply and diversely and I'd like people to know what skills they have in the room from their cohorts to learn from and get support from - not only do they need to knjow the problem deeply, they need to get out of their own heads so they see they have more than a hammer to solve the problem \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIncorporating Kalyan’s insights and the idea of diverse problem-solving approaches into your workshop can add depth, practicality, and community-based relevance. Below is a detailed plan for integrating these elements seamlessly into the design thinking framework.\n\nEnhanced Workshop Content: Prototyping With/In Marginalized Communities\nCore Themes to Weave In:\n\nCommunity Validation as Motivation: Learning and design should feel effortless when driven by real-world impact.\nIndigenous Wisdom: Highlight the value of cultural knowledge and local solutions as a foundation for sustainable development.\nApplied, Purposeful Learning: Focus on immediate community relevance to make abstract ideas meaningful.\nDiverse Problem-Solving: Encourage participants to avoid defaulting to familiar solutions and leverage the skills and perspectives of their peers.\nProposed Additions:\n1. Introduce Kalyan’s Framework (10–15 minutes)\nSet the stage with an overview of Kalyan’s philosophy and its relevance to design thinking.\n\nKey Quotes to Share:\n\n\"Motivation should work like gravity... as effortless as a snowflake falling on the ground.\"\n\"If 1000 farmers benefit from my knowledge of physics... that motivates me to learn more.\"\n\"How do we build an economic system that incentivizes us to work on what keeps us alive and build what makes life meaningful?\"\nInteractive Prompt:\n\nAsk participants: \"What motivates you in your work? How can community impact validate and sustain your motivation?\"\nUse this as a reflective lead-in to the prototyping session.\n2. Expand the Empathy Phase: Skills & Perspectives Mapping (20 minutes)\nEmpathy isn’t just about understanding the community—it’s also about understanding the resources within your cohort.\n\nActivity: Skills & Tools Exchange\n\nParticipants create a skills inventory by sharing their expertise with the group:\nExample skills: coding, storytelling, grassroots organizing, cultural knowledge, graphic design, etc.\nUse a collaborative tool like Google Jamboard or a shared Miro board to map the skills visually.\nHighlight that diverse skills lead to diverse solutions and help avoid the “hammer and nail” problem.\nReflection Prompt:\n\n“What skills or perspectives in this group could help you see your challenge differently?”\n3. Explore Alternative Solutions Through Community Wisdom (30 minutes)\nIncorporate indigenous and diverse problem-solving approaches to expand thinking.\n\nActivity: Problem-Solving Perspectives\n\nBreakout Groups: Each group tackles the same problem (e.g., water scarcity) but must generate solutions inspired by:\n\nIndigenous wisdom (e.g., using cultural traditions or natural materials).\nHigh-tech approaches (e.g., AI, IoT).\nSimple, low-tech innovations (e.g., the water bottle project).\nPresentation: Groups present their solutions and discuss how their chosen approach reflects specific values (e.g., sustainability, equity, innovation).\n\nFacilitator Reflection: Compare the solutions, showing that problems can be addressed creatively from many angles, and encourage participants to combine approaches.\n\n4. Prototyping for Immediate Impact (30 minutes)\nBuild on Kalyan’s principle of designing for immediate community relevance.\n\nActivity: Design for Community Validation\n\nAsk participants to choose one “How might we” question and design a low-fidelity prototype for their community.\nChallenge them to answer:\n“How can we test this idea quickly with our community?”\n“How will the community benefit immediately, even from the prototype?”\nExamples to Inspire:\n\nShare Kalyan’s water bottle project story, emphasizing:\nSimplicity (materials were cheap and accessible).\nCommunity validation (shepherds could immediately see the value).\n5. Closing with Reflection: Building Together (15 minutes)\nEnd the session by fostering an attitude of humility, interdependence, and collective learning.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\n“How did thinking about community validation change the way you designed your solution?”\n“What did you learn from the skills and perspectives in this room?”\n“How can you stay connected to your community to refine and test your ideas?”\nKey Quote to Close:\n\n“How can we take the strengths of each community and get them to become very self-reliant, while also being humble enough to depend on their neighboring communities?”\nWhy These Additions Work\nAligns With Design Thinking: These activities emphasize empathy, ideation, and prototyping while rooting them in community and cultural relevance.\nValues-Centric: They directly incorporate Kalyan’s focus on values, community validation, and sustainability.\nEncourages Creative Problem-Solving: By exploring diverse approaches, participants are less likely to default to tech-centric solutions.\nPromotes Collaboration: The skills inventory builds peer-to-peer learning and a supportive cohort dynamic.\nWould you like this outline translated into specific workshop materials, like a slide deck, activity guides, or worksheets?

Here are five international examples where less action resulted in positive outcomes:\n\nRewilding Projects:\n\nExample: The Knepp Estate in the UK transitioned from intensive farming to a rewilding approach, allowing natural processes to restore ecosystems without human interference.\nOutcome: This hands-off method led to the resurgence of native species and improved biodiversity.\nSource: Knepp Wildland\nNo-Till Farming:\n\nExample: Farmers worldwide adopt no-till agriculture, refraining from plowing to preserve soil structure.\nOutcome: This practice enhances soil health, reduces erosion, and increases carbon sequestration.\nSource: FAO on Conservation Agriculture\nPassive Cooling Architecture:\n\nExample: Traditional Middle Eastern wind catchers (Badgirs) utilize natural ventilation to cool buildings without mechanical systems.\nOutcome: These structures provide sustainable cooling by harnessing natural airflow.\nSource: ArchNet on Badgirs\nMarine Protected Areas (MPAs):\n\nExample: The creation of MPAs involves restricting human activities in certain ocean regions.\nOutcome: Limiting intervention allows marine ecosystems to recover, leading to increased biodiversity and fish populations.\nSource: NOAA on MPAs\nLetting Forests Regenerate Naturally:\n\nExample: In Costa Rica, areas previously used for agriculture were left to regenerate without active reforestation efforts.\nOutcome: Natural forest regrowth led to the return of native flora and fauna, restoring ecological balance.\nSource: Rewilding Costa Rica\nThese cases demonstrate that strategic inaction or minimal intervention can effectively address environmental challenges, promoting sustainability and ecological restoration.\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nThe 'Lazy' Farmer: Masanobu Fukuoka is interesting, what does his book about one straw revolution mean? \n\n\nmaybe we can also include the 8 forms of capital - \nCapital\n\nSocial Capital\n\nMaterial Capital\n\nFinancial Capital\n\nLiving Capital\n\nIntellectual Capital\n\nExperiential Capital\n\nSpiritual Capital\n\nCultural Capital Currency\n\nConnections\n\nMaterials; \"natural\" resources\n\nMoney\n\nCarbon, Nitrogen, Water\n\nIdeas, Knowledge\n\nAction\n\nPrayer, intention, faith, karma\n\nSong, Story, Ritual\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMasanobu Fukuoka’s The One-Straw Revolution and the 8 Forms of Capital align beautifully to emphasize holistic approaches to sustainability and community-building. Let’s unpack these ideas and integrate them into your framework:\n\nMasanobu Fukuoka and The One-Straw Revolution\nCore Ideas:\n\nNatural Farming: Fukuoka promotes a philosophy of \"do-nothing\" farming, which minimizes human intervention and works with natural processes rather than against them.\n\nNo plowing, no fertilization, no weeding, and no pesticides.\nInstead, he trusts in nature’s ability to balance itself.\nPhilosophy of Simplicity: The book argues that modern agriculture and lifestyles complicate life unnecessarily. By stripping back to essentials, humans can live more harmoniously with nature.\n\nKey Themes:\n\nEffortlessness: True solutions should feel natural and flow like nature itself.\n“The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings.”\nSmall Actions, Big Impact: A single straw of rice may seem insignificant, but understanding its role in the ecosystem transforms its value.\nRelevance to Your Framework:\n\nFukuoka’s methods embody living capital (soil health, biodiversity) and spiritual capital (working in harmony with nature).\nHis approach resonates with transforming problems into solutions, like weeds becoming natural fertilizer or pests balancing themselves through biodiversity.\nThe 8 Forms of Capital\nThe 8 Forms of Capital, introduced by Ethan Roland and Gregory Landua, provide a holistic lens for understanding wealth beyond financial metrics. They’re an excellent addition to encourage participants to think about multidimensional impacts of their work.\n\nForms of Capital and Examples:\n\nSocial Capital\n\nDefinition: Relationships, networks, trust, and cooperation.\nWorkshop Example: Building trust within marginalized communities to co-create solutions.\nFukuoka Link: His farming practices foster collaboration among local farmers by valuing shared wisdom.\nMaterial Capital\n\nDefinition: Physical objects, resources, and infrastructure.\nWorkshop Example: Prototyping with locally available materials.\nFukuoka Link: His use of straw and natural materials reduces dependency on external inputs.\nFinancial Capital\n\nDefinition: Money, investments, and financial systems.\nWorkshop Example: Designing financially viable yet community-driven solutions.\nFukuoka Link: His method is cost-effective, reducing reliance on expensive modern inputs.\nLiving Capital\n\nDefinition: Natural systems like soil, water, and biodiversity.\nWorkshop Example: Ensuring sustainability by preserving natural resources.\nFukuoka Link: The core of his philosophy revolves around soil health and ecosystem balance.\nIntellectual Capital\n\nDefinition: Knowledge, innovation, and ideas.\nWorkshop Example: Sharing design thinking principles and indigenous wisdom.\nFukuoka Link: His methods challenge conventional agricultural wisdom, introducing innovative simplicity.\nExperiential Capital\n\nDefinition: Hands-on experience and skills.\nWorkshop Example: Participants engage in prototyping and feedback loops.\nFukuoka Link: Farmers learn by observing and interacting with the land directly.\nSpiritual Capital\n\nDefinition: Beliefs, values, and intentions that guide actions.\nWorkshop Example: Reflecting on the values driving community-centered design.\nFukuoka Link: His methods reflect deep spiritual harmony with the land.\nCultural Capital\n\nDefinition: Stories, rituals, and shared cultural practices.\nWorkshop Example: Incorporating local cultural practices into design solutions.\nFukuoka Link: His practices draw from traditional Japanese farming wisdom.\nIntegrating These Ideas into Your Workshop\nIntroducing the 8 Forms of Capital (10 minutes):\n\nBriefly explain each form, linking them to real-world examples (like Fukuoka’s farming methods).\nActivity: Ask participants to map which forms of capital their projects currently address and brainstorm ways to integrate more.\nReflecting on Fukuoka’s Philosophy (10 minutes):\n\nQuote: “In nature, there is no waste. Everything has a role.”\nDiscussion Prompt: “How can we take a ‘do-nothing’ or minimalist approach to our challenges? What role might beauty or harmony play in our solutions?”\nActivity: Capital Inventory for Prototyping (20 minutes):\n\nParticipants identify:\nSocial capital: Who in the community can they work with?\nLiving capital: How does the local environment inform their design?\nSpiritual capital: What values drive their project?\nTransforming Problems Into Solutions:\n\nPresent examples where minimal intervention turned problems into resources:\nTurning waste into products (e.g., Fukuoka’s use of straw as fertilizer).\nRestoring ecosystems by doing less (e.g., rewilding).\nConclusion\nIntegrating The One-Straw Revolution and the 8 Forms of Capital into your workshop shifts the focus from purely action-oriented solutions to holistic, values-driven approaches. This mindset encourages participants to design solutions that are not only impactful but also harmonious, sustainable, and deeply connected to the communities they serve.\n\nWould you like help creating visuals or worksheets to integrate these concepts into your session?\"\"\"\n\nSession slides as text:\n\"\"\"\nPrototyping In/With Marginalized Communities\n\nAlbert Einstein\nThe Problem\nIf I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.\n\nSteve Jobs\nIf you define the problem correctly, you almost have the solution.\n\nAnthony de \nMello\nYou have to understand, my dears, that the shortest distance between truth and a human being is a story.\n\nHoward Thurman\nDon’t ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come alive.

We were formed on January 9, 2015 with a 2-fold mission. The first is to help design some useful solutions for our practitioner, City Growers. The second is to connect City Growers with relevant resources and skills so they can later innovate their own solutions. \n\nTeam Wasabi consists of \nBecca  \nNse\nMuffin\nTed\nDoug\nLuvena\n\nBasically, we’re a team with a very diverse set of skills. Over the past month, we’ve been working with local community organizers - City Growers to try to solve some of the problems they face in urban farming in Boston. City Growers is a great organization that works to convert unused lots into urban farms in order to grow local, nutritious food for the community.\n\nAs you might imagine, small scale farming can be quite challenging in Boston where land is expensive, many restrictions are in place, and winters are harsh. But, we hope to be able to improve their processes. \n\nCity Growers\nOver the past month, we’ve been working with local community organizers - City Growers to try to solve some of the problems they face in urban farming in Boston. City Growers is a great organization that works to convert unused lots into urban farms in order to grow local, nutritious food for the community.\n\nCity Growers’ mission is to transform vacant lots in Boston into intensive urban farms that are economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe combine the resources of community organizations, neighborhood associations and local markets for fresh produce to accomplish our major goals:\nCreating employment for community members at livable wages\nAddressing food security issues by increasing local agricultural production capacity\nIncreasing local access to affordable, nutrient-rich foods\nCity Growers is contributing to the new green economy in communities where economic revitalization is needed most.  In the coming years, we will create a checkerboard of productive green space in Boston’s inner city (more than twenty acres of 1/4 to 1-acre lots) where local growing talent thrives.\n\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\nSome of the challenges they presented were:\ndecreasing time spent on weeding\nreducing costs associated with seedlings\nincreasing crop yields\nimproving efficiency of wash station\nincreasing compost (access)\n\nThe ideas/desires Bobby and Nataka voiced included: \nGreenhouse \nBetter wash station\nImproved watering systems (appropriate for different vegetables, convenient)\nTools/devices to make composting, harvesting and weeding easier\nBike/harvesting/mobile farm stand\nVirtual farm tour\n\n\nProblem Framing\nUltimately, we prioritized three potential problems: \n\nDecreasing weeds\nImproving watering systems\nImproving washing stations\n\nIn further conversations with City Growers, we realized that the biggest problem, by a significant margin, was weed control. Out of this, our problem statement was born:  \n\nHow can we decrease the time spent weeding? \n\n\n\nOnce we arrived at the problem statement, we spent some time brainstorming methods of overcoming this - including whether a solution needed to focus more on preventing the growth of weeds or improving the weed removal process. After proposing a few ideas and talking with Bobby, we learned more about City Growers’ current process. They remove weeds manually and with hand tools. This process is slow and time-consuming. However, because the farm plots are so small (around ¼ acre, roughly twice the size of a basketball court), it is often easier to do things by hand than with machines.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the commercially available hand tools are not optimal for their processes. Ideally, they would have some double-headed tools and/or interchangeable tools to make the weeding process easier.  \n\nThrough discussions with City Growers, we realized that a potential solution is to design a workshop for the associated Urban Farming Institute program to teach urban farmers how to make their own tools. Such a workshop will not only allow for farmers to obtain customized tools but will also empower and provide these small scale farmers with skills to later prototype and build their own equipment. \n\nThese tools will address each of the following problems:\n\nErgonomics - Existing commercially available tools are fairly standard in size. As a result, they may not be optimal in weight, height, or shape/angle of the tool for best maneuverability.\nCustomizability - Small scale farmers often have limited land space, so crops are planted in very close proximity. As a result, many of the commercially available weeding tools are too large for their needs (they’re too large to fit between individual seedlings or rows). Additionally, they lack modularity. Farmers can potentially also innovate new designs for more rapid/efficient work. \nEconomics - A big factor for small scale farms is cost. The operating budget is relatively small, so any achievable savings will help. City Growers currently has fewer tools than they have workers, and more specialized tools can be expensive if purchased from a distributor\n\n\nInitial Ideas\nHandle\nAttachment Point\nHead\nWe first focused on interchangeable attachment points.  The advantages of having tools that are easily attached to and detached from their handles are (a) workers who are using multiple tools have less to carry around, and (b) each worker can use a handle length that’s appropriate for his/her needs.  We prototyped 4 models: \nScrew\nClamp\nPin\nSpring-tensioned\n\n\n\n\nUser Feedback\nAfter receiving feedback in favor of the pin option from Bobby and Trist, we narrowed our focus to the pin design and improving its usability. \n\nAdditionally, we did some cardboard prototyping with Bobby and Trist to create tool-heads. Four different tools were designed:\nNarrow Action Hoe\nDouble-headed Common Hoe and Cultivator\nDouble-headed Collinear Hoe and Spade\nSeeding Plate\n\nPrototyping\n\nAttachment for tool testing\nprototyping with off-the-shelf parts, final tools welded\n\nAttachment for long-term use\n\nMore feedback from City Growers\nRefine attachment mechanism, prototype tools with City Growers\nPlans posted on Instructables\nTool-building workshop with full farming group \nNext Steps and Recommendations\n\nDesign Thinking\nA process for progress.\n\nStart with why?\nIntroductions\n\nWhy are we here?\nWhy are you doing your work?\n\nIce Breaker\n(Director / Zip Zap Zoop / Global Village)\nLet's play \"Imagination in Action\"! \nForm a circle: We'll stand in a circle, and one by one, each person gets to be the \"director.\" \nShare a scene: Share a fun scene from your imagination, It could be anything – silly, magical, or totally out there!  \nAct it out: The rest of us have a minute to bring it to life using just our bodies and creativity. \nHave fun!

Quick Welcome & Paperclip Challenge (10 mins)\n- 10 ideas in 2 minutes: \"What can you do with a paperclip?\"\n- Share most creative ideas in chat\n- Links to: creativity under constraints, reframing problems\n\n2. Breakout Storytelling (20 mins)\n- Groups of 3-4\n- Share a story of gratitude from your community\n- Listen for: values, attention points, what makes people come alive\n- Return and share key insights\n\nRedefining Margins & Resources (45 mins):\n1. Community Asset Mapping (25 mins)\n- Use 8 forms of capital framework\n- In breakouts: \"What resources do we have?\"\n- Challenge assumption of \"marginalized\"\n- Where is the center? Who decides?\n\n2. Collective Skills Inventory (20 mins)\n- What knowledge exists in our group?\n- Create shared document of expertise\n- Include non-traditional skills and wisdom\n\nAlternative Solutions Framework (45 mins):\nPresent and explore three solution types with examples:\n1. Beautiful Solutions\n- Salsabils & courtyards\n- Design that serves multiple purposes\n- Beauty as functionality\n\n2. Problem as Solution\n- Waste to resource examples\n- Local success stories\n- Finding value in challenges\n\n3. Do-Nothing Solutions\n- Fukuoka's natural farming\n- Traditional wisdom examples\n- When less is more\n\nApplying Frameworks (45 mins):\nBreakout Activity:\n- Each group takes one community challenge\n- Generate solutions using all three frameworks\n- Share and get feedback\n- Focus on storytelling and practical application\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Detail any specific section?\n2. Develop specific prompts for the breakouts?\n3. Create a visual flow for the session?\n4. Add more examples for any framework?\n\nThis structure emphasizes:\n- Starting with connection\n- Challenging assumptions\n- Multiple ways of seeing solutions\n- Practical application\n- Community wisdom\n- Group learning\n\nHow does this align with your vision?",
