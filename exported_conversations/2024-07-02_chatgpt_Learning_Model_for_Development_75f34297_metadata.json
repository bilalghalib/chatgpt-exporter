We want to represent this in an easy way to visualize so they can see their self representation being developed as the conversation grows. what i'd like to do is help them be able to see what you think their goals/intentions are so clicking into \"what's known to the LLM\" which includes your theory of mind of the person - this is the place where the LLM is working from to help them as their assisstant and is brought into the context every time the LLM responds so we need to develop a system prompt that includes referncing the theory of mind before responding. can you think with me about this idea and come up with a plan I'd like to come up with a 3 page document describing this idea and the model clearly, and why we want to do it and how it can inform how LLMs should interact with people in the future, yet I need you to first summarize your understanding and then ask me 5 questions to clarify my thinking and deepen the concept",
