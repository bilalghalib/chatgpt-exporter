Dec 27 shows BURST of reflection tool design: Visionary Framework (morning 9:58), Streamlined Tool (late night 00:08), Creating Personal Values (late night 00:12). METHODOLOGICAL EVOLUTION: From dual-agent (2 perspectives) to multi-persona (6 perspectives) within same day - experimenting with thinking frameworks. SPIRITUAL+PRACTICAL INTEGRATION: Rumi quotes embedded in business model discussions. CONNECTION TO JOE EDELMAN: Attentional Policies framework central to values articulation method, showing sustained influence from earlier conversations. TIME PATTERN: Late night (00:08) = deep conceptual work, contrasts with afternoon technical bugfixes. BUSINESS THINKING: Free viral tool + paid premium (workshops, coaching) = sustainable model. Same philosophy as Barakanomics (relationship + economics)."
