      "content": "Okay, so I'm thinking, after a long period of time, I've been working with my co-founder Guniel at Voom since 2016, and we've always had this vertical tension, where I make things more connected to community and grounded, and he pulls on the scale and tries to get contracts. And just more recently, I've been wondering if we are as aligned as we need to be to be co-founders. He's moved to Silicon Valley and is now working on opening new projects and programs there, and he's feeling kind of constrained because I'm not bought in on the new vision, and he wants to bring in new energy and new co-founders. And yeah, I haven't met any of them, and there's this sort of tension. I'm living in France, our work used to be in the Middle East, and that's what we've been doing for a while now. And so, given all of that, I've started to think that it's time to give him ownership or just return my co-founder position and move on to the board. I'm, I think, 35%, 25% shareholder. He's 65-ish, something like that. We're supposed to be 50-50 decision-making, so I'll return my decision-making and a portion of my shares so that he can bring on new people. And I'm wondering, what is the process for this, and what should I tell him, and what should I send him? And also, what is the process for dividing up assets? I don't even want to say dividing up assets because he's going to be doing Bloom. I'm going to be a part of it. I'm going to be on the board, and I'm going to be, inshallah, still a shareholder. And I want to be a part of the projects. If there's success in them, inshallah, I get a part of the benefit. And I also want to be able to leverage the Bloom community and the relationships and the database and our Airtable, our software, our Google Drive, my email. I want to keep all that active, but not be an active co-founder anymore. Maybe, like on the board, plus a available consultant for hire at a specific rate. If they need me to facilitate or do something, I can come on board with them, something like that. And I'm wondering, what are the questions that I need to ask in terms of my co-founder? What do I need to share or ask or do? And do I need to have a contract or a formal agreement? What is the thing that I'm doing? How do I start a new organization? Do I just need to make a new business? I sometimes wonder if I should make a new name or if I should ask him not to use the name. I don't mind. He can keep the name because I think if he keeps the name and keeps me on the board and lets it keep going, then I can do my own thing while still benefiting from the possibility of this organization. What are some questions I need to be asking and what are some methods that I'm not really thinking about? This is not the first time this has happened in the world, and I'm wondering what other people do at this point in parting ways with co-founders and moving on to the board. What's the name of that process?",

      "content": "What you’re describing is actually a **classic founder transition** — moving from an *operational co-founder* role into a *governance/board/advisory* role while preserving your equity stake and voice in the organization. The broad term for this is often:  \n\n- **Founder transition** (sometimes “founder exit,” but yours is a “soft exit”)  \n- **Equity restructuring** or **cap table adjustment** (if you change your shareholding)  \n- **Role transition agreement** or **separation agreement** (the formal contract)  \n\nIt’s not unusual. Many early founders step back when the company grows or pivots in a different direction, while still staying on as a shareholder, advisor, or board member.\n\n---\n\n### The Process (High-Level)\n1. **Clarify Intentions with Your Co-Founder**\n   - What role do you want going forward? (Board member, consultant, occasional facilitator)\n   - What role does he see for you? (Honorary, strategic, hands-on advisory)\n   - Do you both want you to retain shares? If yes, at what percentage?\n\n2. **Define Roles & Responsibilities**\n   - **Operational**: You’d step back, no longer day-to-day decisions.\n   - **Governance**: You’d be on the board (formal oversight, strategy, values).\n   - **Consulting**: Available to be hired for facilitation/work at a clear rate.\n\n3. **Equity/Ownership Adjustments**\n   - Decide if you’re keeping your current shares, selling/gifting part, or restructuring.  \n   - If new co-founders join, equity dilution usually comes from the existing pool (often both you and him together, unless you step down significantly).\n\n4. **Formal Agreement**\n   - Draft a **Founder Transition Agreement** or **Shareholder Amendment** that specifies:\n     - Your new role (board seat, advisory, consultant availability).\n     - Your remaining equity.\n     - Any vesting/unlocking of shares if not already settled.\n     - Rights you keep (access to Airtable, relationships, branding use).\n     - Rights you give up (daily ops, contracts, signing authority).\n\n5. **Governance / Assets**\n   - **Company accounts (Airtable, Google Drive, email)**: Decide what’s personal vs. company-owned.  \n   - **Community/contacts**: Agree on shared usage. Often codified as “intellectual property and data remain company-owned, but you retain right of use for Bloom-aligned projects.”  \n   - **Brand/name**: Clarify whether he keeps “Voom” name exclusively, or whether you can spin up something new without conflict.  \n\n6. **Board & Consulting Role**\n   - Board: You’ll need a **board resolution** that names you as a board member if you aren’t already.  \n   - Consultant: Draft a **framework agreement** (“we can contract Bilal at $X/day for facilitation or strategy”).  \n\n7. **New Organization Option**\n   - If you want a new initiative, you can register a new entity under a different name, but **there’s no requirement** unless you want to differentiate.  \n   - Since you don’t mind him keeping the name, you could let Voom continue and create a new entity for your own next chapter.\n\n---\n\n### Questions to Ask Him (and Yourself)\n1. **Equity & Shares**\n   - Do I keep my current equity?  \n   - Will I transfer/sell any shares so new co-founders can come in?  \n   - How do we handle dilution?\n\n2. **Board & Governance**\n   - Do I stay on the board officially?  \n   - How often do board meetings happen, and what decisions come to the board?  \n   - What voting power do I retain?\n\n3. **Assets & Tools**\n   - What happens to shared tools (Airtable, databases, community lists, email accounts)?  \n   - Do I retain personal access, or is it “company only”?  \n   - Can I use Bloom’s infrastructure independently?\n\n4. **Brand & Identity**\n   - Do I care if he keeps “Voom”?  \n   - Do we need a non-compete or non-conflict clause?  \n   - If I start something new, do we define “overlap” boundaries?\n\n5. **Consulting Relationship**\n   - Am I available at a fixed day rate?  \n   - Do I get right of first refusal for facilitation gigs?  \n   - How do we handle conflicts of time/interest?\n\n6. **Legal Formalities**\n   - Do we need to amend incorporation docs?  \n   - Does a lawyer draft the transition agreement, or can we use a template?  \n   - How do we handle taxes if shares are transferred?\n\n---\n\n### What Others Do in This Situation\n- **Equity Retention**: Many founders step back but keep their equity.  \n- **Board Seat**: Often they remain on the board to preserve vision/values influence.  \n- **Advisory Role**: Some codify an “Advisor Agreement” with compensation in shares or cash for X hours per month.  \n- **Clean Split**: A few founders cash out entirely (sell their shares back or to new investors).  \n- **Soft Exit**: What you’re describing — keep some equity, keep board role, step back from ops, remain available as consultant.\n\n---\n\n📌 **First Step for You:**  \nWrite a short, clear note to Guniel saying something like:  \n\n> “I’ve been reflecting on where we are, and I think it’s time for me to step back from day-to-day co-founder duties and take on a board and advisory role. I’d like to stay a shareholder, and remain available as a consultant/facilitator. I’m open to adjusting equity to make space for new co-founders, and I’d like to clarify together what access and involvement I’ll retain with our tools, brand, and community. Let’s work toward a transition agreement that makes this clean for both of us.”  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to draft for you a **Founder Transition Checklist / Agreement Template** (like a one-pager you can send him as a first conversation tool), so you both see what needs to be decided?",

      "content": "Great — let’s slow it down and walk through this like a founder transition coaching session. I’ll throw you the questions you might want to reflect on, so you can clarify what matters most to you before anything gets formalized. Think of this as surfacing your **hidden levers** (equity, role, access, influence, time, reputation, values).  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Equity & Shares\n- What do your shares represent to you — **reward for past work**, **voice in the future**, or **financial upside**?  \n- Do you want to keep your full shares regardless of whether you’re operationally active?  \n- How would you feel if new co-founders came in and got equity without you reducing yours (i.e., dilution affects both you and Guniel equally)?  \n- Do you want the option to sell some shares back later if you need liquidity?  \n- Are there conditions under which you’d willingly part with shares now (e.g., if they’re earmarked specifically for new co-founders who add real value)?  \n\n👉 If you keep your shares: nothing changes — you’re still an owner, even if you’re not day-to-day. You don’t *have* to give up shares unless you want to create space for others.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Role & Voice\n- As a **board member**, what powers do you want?  \n   - Voting rights?  \n   - Veto power on certain types of decisions (mission, brand, major asset sale)?  \n   - Or simply advisory voice, no blocking rights?  \n- Do you want **visibility** into finances, major deals, and strategy — or are you happy being informed at a high level?  \n- How much **time** are you realistically willing to commit as a board member (quarterly meetings? ad-hoc calls?)  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Consulting & Involvement\n- Do you want a **standing consulting agreement** (e.g., they can hire you at $X/day without renegotiation each time)?  \n- Do you want to specialize in certain contributions (facilitation, pedagogy, strategy, donor relations) rather than general ops?  \n- Do you want **first right of refusal** for Bloom opportunities that fit your expertise (so they can’t bypass you for work you’d want)?  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Brand & Name\n- How important is the **Bloom/Voom name** to you personally and your identity?  \n- Are you okay with them using it freely, while you build something new under a different name?  \n- Do you want to ensure the **mission/values** remain attached to the name (e.g., “community-first, regenerative, trauma-aware”)?  \n- Would you ever want to spin up your own initiative under the same umbrella (like Bloom France or Bloom Europe)?  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Assets & Infrastructure\n- Which tools/assets matter to you most for your ongoing work (Airtable CRM, Google Drive archive, Bloom community contacts, domain/email)?  \n- Do you want **personal access rights** even if you’re not staff?  \n- Should there be a clause that says you can **leverage the Bloom community** for your projects (with transparency, not competition)?  \n- Are there any shared IPs (curricula, slides, tools you personally developed) where you want **joint ownership** or at least **usage rights** outside Bloom?  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Financial Rights\n- Do you want dividends/distributions if Bloom ever makes profit, or are you okay with being an “impact shareholder” who benefits only if there’s an exit/grant overhead?  \n- Do you want clarity on how **future investment or grants** might dilute your shares?  \n- Do you want the right to **sell shares** later if someone wants to buy in?  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Reputation & Relationships\n- How do you want your role described publicly? (“Co-founder emeritus,” “Founding Board Member,” “Advisor”?)  \n- Do you want your **founder story** to still be associated with Bloom (for credibility, book, consulting gigs)?  \n- Do you want an agreement that your contribution always gets acknowledged in Bloom communications/history?  \n\n---\n\n## 8. Contingencies & Safeguards\n- What if Bloom pivots in a way you don’t agree with — do you want the right to exit (sell your shares, leave the board)?  \n- What if it dissolves — do you want protection to keep using the IP/community in another format?  \n- Do you want to protect against your name being attached to something that contradicts your values (e.g., Bloom working with a military funder or extractive corporate partner)?  \n\n---\n\n## 9. Future Direction\n- Do you want to start a new org with your own flavor, or keep incubating your work *inside* Bloom?  \n- Do you see yourself being more aligned with Bloom-as-Guniel-envisions-it, or is this really about creating your **own house** while staying connected?  \n\n---\n\n### Why Would You Give Up Shares?\nYou wouldn’t **have to**. The only reasons to part with shares are:\n- To **make space for new co-founders** (symbolically or practically).  \n- To **reset the cap table** so Guniel feels empowered to bring in new talent.  \n- To **sell for liquidity** if you want cash now instead of long-term upside.  \n\nOtherwise, you can simply **transition your role** and keep your equity. That’s perfectly normal.  \n\n---\n\n👉 So the heart of it is:  \nDo you want to be a **silent owner who gets upside**, a **guardian on the board**, a **paid advisor/consultant**, or some blend?  \n\nWould you like me to turn these questions into a **Founder Transition Worksheet** (like a fill-in doc you can go through and then send a summarized version to Guniel)?",
