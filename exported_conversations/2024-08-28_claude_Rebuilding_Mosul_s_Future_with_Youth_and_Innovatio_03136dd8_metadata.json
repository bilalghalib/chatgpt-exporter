Keep my style. Ask me 3 questions to help you edit and then return the post:\n\nMosul is full of invisible innovators. This city and it's people have learned over the years the importance of sustainability, moderation and recycling. You can find evidence of it in the past, as exemplified by using damaged pottery as building insulation: IMG_0258.HEIC and in the present with Mosul Youth building solar powered water distillers, walking powered cellphone chargers based on energy harvesting principles, and smart home temperature control devices. CleanShot 2024-08-28 at 17.25.50@2x.png All these are being built by young people in Middle School.\nMy time in Mosul was spent learning about it's beautiful culture and history. To learn about what is happening to inform the development of a sustainability curriculum. And I feel the insights I've taken away from Mosul are going to last me a lifetime. Mosul has a lot to teach the world about sustainability based on their lived experience over generations, and I am optimistic and I look forward to the BEIT project unlocking the power of the youth, MSMEs and innovation to take the best of the past and Mosul's heritage, to build a brighter more sustainable future for Mosul, for Iraq, and as an example, for the world.",
