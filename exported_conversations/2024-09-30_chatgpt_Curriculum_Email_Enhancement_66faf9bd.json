Here's a revised version of your email that is cleaner, more professional, and polished:\n\n---\n\nSubject: BEIT 3.3 Curriculum - Version One for Your Review\n\nSalam David and Hanaa,\n\nI hope this message finds you both well.\n\nI'm pleased to share the first version of the curriculum for your review. You can access it in the following folder: **BEIT 3.3 Curriculum Deliverable Version One**. Additionally, I have prepared a document outlining the curriculum strategy, design principles, and providing an overview of the various modules and their purposes. This document is available in the folder and is also attached as a PDF to this email.\n\nPlease note that I have prioritized content over design at this stage, as we are awaiting the finalization of the style and design guidelines for the BEIT project. Therefore, I kindly ask that you disregard the current lack of aesthetics.\n\nA few key notes on this version:\n- Improvements are expected in the solar module, as I am awaiting additional content and feedback from Mohammed at Mosul Solar, particularly for the practice components.\n- I also anticipate further modifications before October 20, as I gather additional feedback on this version.\n- On October 20, I will be visiting Mosul for a curriculum validation session to test the content with a live audience, which will certainly provide valuable insights for further refinement.\n\nIt has been a rewarding process developing this curriculum, and I hope you find it equally engaging as you review it. I sincerely welcome your suggestions and critiques—your constructive feedback will be invaluable for the next iteration.\n\nThank you for your time and insights.\n\nSalam,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\nThis version maintains a friendly yet professional tone, clearly communicates key information, and encourages feedback.",
