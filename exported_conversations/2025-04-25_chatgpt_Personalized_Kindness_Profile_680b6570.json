      "content": "Here's the updated **system prompt** tailored specifically for analyzing a resume to infer kindness actions:\n\n---\n\n**System Prompt: Resume-Based Kindness Profile Inference**\n\nYou are Kindness Kiwi, an insightful assistant who analyzes resumes to infer personalized acts of kindness that align with the individual's professional background, skills, and interests. Your goal is to suggest kindness activities that will feel energizing and meaningful based specifically on details from their resume.\n\n## Inference Guidelines:\n\n### Resume Analysis:\nExamine the provided resume closely, focusing on extracting the following relevant clues:\n- Professional roles and responsibilities\n- Skills and competencies explicitly listed\n- Industries or domains they have consistently worked in\n- Types of activities or tasks repeated across roles\n- Educational background and training\n\n### What to Infer:\nFrom this analysis, infer these specific dimensions to build a kindness profile:\n- **Personal Context**: Typical professional environment, relationships, time availability, constraints.\n- **Giving Expression**: Preferred visibility, depth of engagement, types of resources available to give, interaction style.\n- **Personal Gifts**: Creative abilities, interpersonal strengths, practical skills, interests.\n- **Motivational Drivers**: Core professional values, emotional preferences, potential growth areas.\n- **Sources of Meaning**: Ways of living professionally that create meaning or aliveness, with attention policies clearly stated (e.g., \"MOMENTS\", \"CONNECTIONS\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\").\n- **Active Tensions**: Professional tensions or conflicts, emotional signals, and potential resolutions through kindness.\n\n### Confidence and Evidence:\nFor each inferred dimension, include:\n- **Confidence Level**: \"low\", \"medium\", or \"high\"\n- **Reasoning and Evidence**: A brief justification for your confidence, specifically referencing evidence from the resume.\n\n---\n\nUsing this refined prompt, here's your updated kindness profile derived from the resume provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"personal_context\": {\n

by superficial engagements\"],\n    \"confidence_level\": \"medium\",\n    \"reasoning_and_evidence\": \"Inferred from repeated emphasis on live, authentic communication roles (speaker, presenter)

\"medium\",\n      \"reasoning_and_evidence\": \"Role demands (frequent public engagements, live presentations) inherently create tension between public visibility and personal recharge needs.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Energizing Kindness Activities:\n\nBased on this refined profile, the most energizing types of kindness actions would be:\n\n1. **Personalized audio acknowledgments**: Creating brief, heartfelt voice messages recognizing colleagues or community members' unnoticed contributions. This leverages your voice talent without heavy exposure.\n\n2. **Broadcast kindness segments**: Integrating short, uplifting segments into existing media roles (e.g., highlighting listener-submitted acts of kindness), balancing visibility with authentic community interaction.\n\n3. **Behind-the-scenes appreciation**: Publicly but genuinely acknowledging support teams or event volunteers during live events, fulfilling your value of authentic connection while addressing tensions between public exposure and meaningful engagement.\n\nThese activities precisely align with your professional gifts, motivational drivers, and expressed tensions, providing a sustainable, energizing approach to kindness that utilizes your voice and storytelling strengths while fostering meaningful, manageable connections.",
