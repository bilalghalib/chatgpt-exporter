It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December, we've built this intuition after hundreds of hours of GPT use. Now, we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting.\n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse), and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions. \n\n\nLLM Capability\nSCRIBER Element\nPedagogical Principle\nLearning Experience Design\nModeling and Demonstration\nNatural Language Understanding\nSeek, Critique, Broaden/Contract\nSocial Interaction and Collaboration\nFacilitate group discussions, peer feedback, and collaborative problem-solving.\nDemonstrate effective communication, active listening, and perspective-taking.\nNatural Language Generation\nReflect, Explain\nExperiential Learning and Reflection\nGenerate reflective prompts, guiding questions, and personalized feedback.\nModel reflective thinking and metacognitive strategies.\nContextual Understanding\nInquire, Explain\nAuthentic, Real-World Problem-Solving\nProvide contextually relevant information, resources, and scenarios.\nDemonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to real-world problems.\nKnowledge Retrieval and Integration\nBroaden/Contract, Explain\nConnecting Learning to Prior Knowledge and Experiences\nHelp learners activate prior knowledge, make connections, and integrate new information.\nModel the process of connecting new learning to prior knowledge and experiences.\nAdaptive and Personalized Learning\nAll SCRIBER Elements\nScaffolding and Self-Regulated Learning\nProvide adaptive scaffolding, feedback, and resources based on individual needs.\nDemonstrate the use of self-regulated learning strategies.\nLanguage Translation and Multilingual Support\nSeek, Broaden/Contract\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nProvide multilingual support and culturally responsive learning experiences.\nModel inclusive communication, cultural competence, and the value of diverse perspectives.\nTextual Analysis and Summarization\nCritique, Reflect\nCritical Thinking and Meaning-Making\nHelp learners analyze complex texts, extract key ideas, and synthesize information.\nDemonstrate the process of critically analyzing information, evaluating arguments, and constructing meaningful interpretations.\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM Capability\nSCRIBER Element\nPedagogical Principle\nSystem Prompt\nExample Prompt\nNatural Language Understanding\nSeek, Critique, Broaden/Contract\nSocial Interaction and Collaboration\nEncourage learners to CC their mentors or colleagues in their emails to the LLM, and prompt the LLM to identify opportunities for social learning and collaboration.\n\"I noticed you mentioned your colleague [Name].

and as 450M people might need to identify new roles and jobs, the question of what is a human life for becomes ever more urgent. Prior to the invention of labor saving machines human effort and competency was valued more and workers made a living wage in work they could find meaning in. Once it became possible to see workers and laborers as redundant artifacts from the past, labor became less valued and the self image of laborers in factories was damaged. This similar process will happen in knowledge work. An industrial labor process is not a craft. It might be possible that a craft is still worth doing and that people love a handmade notebook. Yet the efficiency of processes is a seductive process which is impossible to avoid. Why wouldn’t we make things easier when the job doesn’t provide meaning, the artistry is lacking, each piece is assessed on it’s consistency with the initial mold making creativity useless. We love hand made things when it touches the soul of a craftsperson, when creativity can emerge, when uniqueness is transferred. Knowledge workers will have to contend with questions very similar. Why would I hire you to write copy when I can have an AI AB test day and night and emulate the best writers that I love the most? Or data entry? Done. No one wants that job, it’s just a job that needed to exist for a while and people took it who didn’t have enough knowledge or education to do otherwise, or all other jobs in their area were taken. So the question is what is a human for? \n\nFramework Element\n\nInquiry-Based Learning, Depth and complexity of inquiry by learners.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning, The connection between personal experiences and learning objectives.\nSelf-Directed Learning, Progress towards self-set learning goals.\nProblem-Based Learning, Problem-solving skills and application of knowledge.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning, Collaborative skills and interaction quality.\nResilience & Grit, grit score\nExperiential Learning by Application of theoretical knowledge in practice.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy by Confidence in managing entrepreneurial challenges.\nTitle: Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models for Transformative Cohort-Based Learning Experiences\nAbstract: This paper presents a novel framework for designing transformative cohort-based learning experiences that leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) while incorporating principles of collaboration, teamwork, social learning, and meaning-making. By aligning LLM architectures with evidence-based pedagogical practices and theories, such as social cognitive theory, experiential learning, and transformative learning, we propose a comprehensive approach to creating engaging, effective, and purposeful learning experiences. The framework emphasizes the role of LLMs in supporting learners' cognitive, social, and emotional development, as well as their ability to navigate complex, real-world challenges. We also explore innovative strategies for using LLMs to model and demonstrate effective learning processes, metacognitive strategies, and collaborative problem-solving. The ultimate goal is to create a dynamic, responsive, and empowering learning environment that fosters deep understanding, personal growth, and collective action.\nIntroduction: The rapid advancements in natural language processing and the development of large language models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for transforming education and training. LLMs, with their ability to understand, generate, and analyze human language, offer unique opportunities for creating personalized, interactive, and contextually relevant learning experiences. However, to fully harness the potential of LLMs, it is essential to ground their use in evidence-based pedagogical practices and theories that emphasize the social, experiential, and transformative dimensions of learning.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for designing cohort-based learning experiences that leverage LLMs while incorporating principles from social cognitive theory, experiential learning theory, and transformative learning theory. The framework aims to create learning experiences that are not only cognitively rich but also socially engaging, emotionally resonant, and personally meaningful. By aligning LLM capabilities with these pedagogical principles, we seek to create learning environments that foster collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, while also supporting learners' sense of agency, purpose, and social responsibility.\nGoals:\nDevelop a comprehensive framework for designing transformative cohort-based learning experiences that leverage LLMs and align with evidence-based pedagogical practices.\nIdentify specific strategies for using LLMs to support collaborative, project-based, and problem-based learning experiences that engage learners in authentic, real-world contexts.\nExplore innovative approaches for using LLMs to model and demonstrate effective learning processes, metacognitive strategies, and collaborative problem-solving.\nProvide guidelines for creating learning experiences that foster learners' sense of agency, purpose, and social responsibility, while also supporting their cognitive, social, and emotional development.\nOffer a roadmap for future research and development in the field of AI-assisted learning, with a focus on creating transformative, equitable, and empowering learning experiences.\nTable: Aligning LLM Capabilities with Pedagogical Principles for Transformative Cohort-Based Learning\nLLM Capability\nPedagogical Principle\nLearning Experience Design\nModeling and Demonstration\nNatural Language Understanding\nSocial Interaction & Collaboration\nFacilitate group discussions, peer feedback, and collaborative problem-solving through natural language interactions.\nDemonstrate effective communication, active listening, and perspective-taking skills in group discussions.\nNatural Language Generation\nExperiential Learning and Reflection\nGenerate reflective prompts, guiding questions, and personalized feedback to support learners' reflection on their experiences and learning processes.\nModel reflective thinking and metacognitive strategies through think-aloud protocols and self-explanations.\nContextual Understanding\nAuthentic, Real-World Problem-Solving\nProvide contextually relevant information, resources, and scenarios based on learners' interests, goals, and real-world challenges.\nDemonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to real-world problems, while verbalizing the problem-solving process and decision-making rationale.\nKnowledge Retrieval and Integration\nConnecting Learning to Prior Knowledge & Experiences\nHelp learners activate prior knowledge, make connections across disciplines, and integrate new information into existing cognitive frameworks.\nModel the process of connecting new learning to prior knowledge and experiences, using analogies, examples, and personal stories.\nAdaptive and Personalized Learning\nScaffolding and Self-Regulated Learning\nProvide adaptive scaffolding, feedback, and resources based on learners' individual needs, goals, and progress, while gradually fading support to foster self-regulation.\nDemonstrate the use of self-regulated learning strategies, such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation, while verbalizing the thought process and emotional experiences.\nLanguage Translation and Multilingual Support\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nProvide multilingual support and culturally responsive learning experiences that validate learners' diverse identities, experiences, and ways of knowing.\nModel inclusive communication, cultural competence, and the value of diverse perspectives in collaborative learning and problem-solving.\nTextual Analysis and Summarization\nCritical Thinking and Meaning-Making\nHelp learners analyze complex texts, extract key ideas, and synthesize information to construct personal meaning and develop critical thinking skills.\nDemonstrate the process of critically analyzing information, evaluating arguments, and constructing meaningful interpretations, while verbalizing the thought process and reasoning.\n\n\nSummary: The proposed framework for designing transformative cohort-based learning experiences leverages the capabilities of LLMs to support learners' cognitive, social, and emotional development, while aligning with evidence-based pedagogical principles. By facilitating social interaction, collaboration, experiential learning, authentic problem-solving, adaptive scaffolding, and meaning-making, LLMs can help create rich, engaging, and empowering learning environments.\nA key innovation of this framework is the use of LLMs to model and demonstrate effective learning processes, metacognitive strategies, and collaborative problem-solving. By providing learners with concrete examples and think-aloud protocols, LLMs can help demystify the learning process, foster self-awareness, and promote the development of transferable skills.\nMoreover, the framework emphasizes the importance of creating learning experiences that are not only cognitively challenging but also emotionally resonant and personally meaningful. By connecting learning to learners' interests, experiences, and real-world challenges, and by supporting their sense of agency, purpose, and social responsibility, LLMs can help foster transformative learning experiences that have a lasting impact on learners' lives and communities.\nConclusion: The integration of LLMs into cohort-based learning experiences offers a powerful opportunity to transform education and training. By aligning LLM capabilities with evidence-based pedagogical principles, we can create learning environments that are cognitively rich, socially engaging, emotionally resonant, and personally meaningful. The proposed framework provides a roadmap for designing transformative learning experiences that leverage the full potential of LLMs while prioritizing learners' needs, goals, and well-being.\nHowever, realizing this vision requires ongoing research, development, and collaboration among educators, researchers, technologists, and learners. It is essential to continue exploring innovative approaches for using LLMs to support learning, while also addressing the ethical, social, and pedagogical implications of AI-assisted learning.\nUltimately, the goal is to create learning experiences that not only impart knowledge and skills but also empower learners to become active agents in their own learning and in shaping a more just, equitable, and sustainable world. By harnessing the power of LLMs in service of this goal, we can unlock the transformative potential of education and help learners realize their full potential as individuals and as members of their communities.\n\n\ntake the content and improve the prompts here:INSPIRE & NAVIGATE\nAligned Pedagogically Sound Frameworks\n  For Transformational Learning\n\nIntroduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher\nLearning how to learn is the fundamental skill of learning. It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December, we've built this intuition after hundreds of hours of GPT use. Now, we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting.\n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse), and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions. \n\n\nLLM Capability\nSCRIBER Element\nPedagogical Principle\nLearning Experience Design\nModeling and Demonstration\nNatural Language Understanding\nSeek, Critique, Broaden/Contract\nSocial Interaction and Collaboration\nFacilitate group discussions, peer feedback, and collaborative problem-solving.\nDemonstrate effective communication, active listening, and perspective-taking.\nNatural Language Generation\nReflect, Explain\nExperiential Learning and Reflection\nGenerate reflective prompts, guiding questions, and personalized feedback.\nModel reflective thinking and metacognitive strategies.\nContextual Understanding\nInquire, Explain\nAuthentic, Real-World Problem-Solving\nProvide contextually relevant information, resources, and scenarios.\nDemonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to real-world problems.\nKnowledge Retrieval and Integration\nBroaden/Contract, Explain\nConnecting Learning to Prior Knowledge and Experiences\nHelp learners activate prior knowledge, make connections, and integrate new information.\nModel the process of connecting new learning to prior knowledge and experiences.\nAdaptive and Personalized Learning\nAll SCRIBER Elements\nScaffolding and Self-Regulated Learning\nProvide adaptive scaffolding, feedback, and resources based on individual needs.\nDemonstrate the use of self-regulated learning strategies.\nLanguage Translation and Multilingual Support\nSeek, Broaden/Contract\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nProvide multilingual support and culturally responsive learning experiences.\nModel inclusive communication, cultural competence, and the value of diverse perspectives.\nTextual Analysis and Summarization\nCritique, Reflect\nCritical Thinking and Meaning-Making\nHelp learners analyze complex texts, extract key ideas, and synthesize information.\nDemonstrate the process of critically analyzing information, evaluating arguments, and constructing meaningful interpretations.\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM Capability\nSCRIBER Element\nPedagogical Principle\nSystem Prompt\nExample Prompt\nNatural Language Understanding\nSeek, Critique, Broaden/Contract\nSocial Interaction and Collaboration\nEncourage learners to CC their mentors or colleagues in their emails to the LLM, and prompt the LLM to identify opportunities for social learning and collaboration.\n\"I noticed you mentioned your colleague [Name].

This involves asking deeper, more thoughtful questions that require the user to engage actively with the content.\n\nBy refining the system and example prompts in this way, we aim to provide a more interactive, personalized, and deep learning experience that effectively utilizes the SCRIBER framework to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in educational contexts.",

Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and teach yourself the things you don’t even know. By using this tool well, you can benefit yourself, your communities, and the world.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask what is around you that you “can’t see.”\n \nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\n●  \tSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\n●  \tCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\n●  \tReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools with which to think.\n●  \tInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\n●  \tBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps, ask the LLM for non-overlapping options, and pick.\n●  \tExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\n●  \tRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you.\n \nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\n \nPrinciples are ideas you keep in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n  \nNote: Do not memorize this list.\nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought.\nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n  📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n  🤲\nPrinciple\n 🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like:\n “Who would know how to answer this question? What is their job?”\n\n “What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n “What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?”\n(The more specific information you provide, the better.\nExploration:\n Get the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a person who will disagree.\n\n For instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\n Actively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines \n\nAFTER identifying the expert's domain.\n Once you pick your template, ask it questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper.\nIndependent Reflection:\n Leave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency:\n Ask the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI for A number of diverse and non-overlapping options for your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\n Asking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\n Ask it to help you find out where you need to correct something. Ask it to poke holes.\n Go step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it…\n A simple example is: “you’re a McKinsey consultant. This is our first session, and my business is running out of runway, so I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the help I need for my business.”\nLook at yourself from the third person:\n How can you ask questions to the AI so it asks questions, and you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about?\n\n \n \n\n\nWhat's new in our list of principles? What's missing that can be added? Make a new table compiling them and extracting the maximum coherence and utility for a user in a cohort based learning program using LLMs for a prompting framework with the minimum size and put it in a table?

Human-centered design methodologies, such as participatory design and usability testing, can ensure that the learning experiences align with learners' needs, preferences, and contexts. Persuasive Technology and Behavior Change: LLMs can be used to generate personalized persuasive messages and nudges that motivate learners to engage in desirable learning behaviors, such as regular practice, self-reflection, and help-seeking. Theories and techniques from persuasive technology and behavior change, such as the Fogg Behavior Model and the Transtheoretical Model, can inform the design of effective persuasive strategies. Cognitive Neuroscience and Brain-Computer Interfaces: Advancements in cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces can provide a deeper understanding of how the brain processes information and how to optimize learning experiences based on neural activity patterns. LLMs could potentially be trained on neural data to create more brain-compatible learning interventions.

      "content": "Implementing cognitive ergonomics, human-centered design, persuasive technology, and insights from cognitive neuroscience into an LLM-based learning system involves a multi-step approach that combines technical integration with a strong focus on learner experience. Here's a streamlined, step-by-step strategy to incorporate these elements effectively, aiming for simplicity in application while allowing for complexity in design:\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Cognitive Ergonomics and Human-Centered Design**:\n   - **Development Phase**:\n     - **Participatory Design Workshops**: Involve learners in the design process through workshops to gather insights on their preferences and challenges.\n     - **Prototyping and Usability Testing**: Develop initial versions of the learning interface and conduct usability tests to refine ergonomics and ensure intuitive navigation.\n   - **Implementation Phase**:\n     - **Intuitive Learning Interfaces**: Implement interfaces that reduce cognitive load by using visual hierarchies, minimalistic design, and contextual information.\n     - **Adaptive Content Presentation**: Ensure content presentation adapts to individual learning styles and speeds, using data from initial learner interactions.\n   - **Tool**: A \"Design Guideline Cheat Sheet\" that encapsulates key ergonomic principles and human-centered design strategies tailored for developers and instructional designers.\n\n2. **Persuasive Technology and Behavior Change**:\n   - **Strategy Development**:\n     - **Behavioral Modeling**: Apply models like the Fogg Behavior Model to understand when learners are most likely to engage and what prompts are effective in different stages of behavior change.\n     - **Message Personalization**: Develop algorithms to tailor persuasive messages and nudges that encourage positive learning behaviors based on learner activity and feedback.\n   - **Implementation Phase**:\n     - **Nudge System Integration**: Integrate a system of personalized nudges within the LLM interface that motivates regular practice, reflection, and engagement.\n   - **Tool**: A simple, one-page \"Persuasive Strategy Framework\" that educators can use to craft and schedule personalized nudges.\n\n3. **Cognitive Neuroscience and Brain-Computer Interfaces**:\n   - **Research and Development**:\n     - **Neural Correlate Studies**: Collaborate with neuroscientists to identify how different learning activities affect brain activity and integrate these insights into content delivery strategies.\n     - **Brain-Computer Interface Pilots**: Pilot learning modules that use EEG data to adjust the learning pace and content complexity in real-time based on learner's brain activity patterns.\n   - **Implementation Phase**:\n     - **Brain-Compatible Learning Modules**: Develop and implement learning modules that are optimized for brain activity patterns, enhancing retention and engagement.\n   - **Tool**: A \"Neuroscience Insight Report\" that summarizes key findings and practical applications for LLM content developers and educators.\n\n4. **Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Learning**:\n   - **System Development**:\n     - **Algorithm Design**: Design collaborative filtering algorithms similar to those used in recommender systems to analyze learner behavior and preferences.\n     - **Personalization Engine**: Develop a personalization engine that suggests learning resources, peers, and activities based on similarities in learner profiles and behaviors.\n   - **Implementation Phase**:\n     - **Dynamic Resource Recommendations**: Implement the recommendation engine within the LLM system to continuously suggest personalized learning opportunities.\n   - **Tool**: An interactive \"Learning Path Planner\" that allows learners to see recommended resources and modify their learning path based on real-time suggestions.\n\n### Simplifying into a Practical Tool\n\nGiven the complexity of these systems, the simplest yet most effective tool to encapsulate all these elements could be a digital dashboard or app that integrates:\n- **Personalized Learning Recommendations**: Using collaborative filtering.\n- **Adaptive Learning Interfaces**: Based on cognitive ergonomics principles.\n- **Nudge System**: For motivating learners through persuasive technology.\n- **Brain Activity Insights**: For those who opt-in, provide feedback on optimal learning times and methods based on cognitive neuroscience research.\n\nThe dashboard would serve as a central hub where learners can access personalized learning paths, receive adaptive content, and get nudges, all designed to enhance learning efficacy based on the advanced principles discussed. This tool could be introduced to learners and educators through a simple introductory webinar or a series of quick start guides to ensure ease of use and understanding.",

I am thoroughly impressed with the level of detail, thoughtfulness, and creativity you have brought to designing this comprehensive coh CopyBGreview and identify 5 pros and 5 cons, particularly focus on improving the prompting framework and ask me 3 questions to help you create a concise six pager when you get the resultsThank you for the opportunity to review and further refine the cohort-based learning program structure we've collaboratively developed. I appreciate your commitment to continuously improving and enhancing the framework.\nHere are five potential pros and five potential cons I've identified, with a particular focus on the prompting framework:\nPros:\n\nSeamless integration of diverse principles: The program structure effectively combines principles from neuroscience, cognition, educational theories, and various learning frameworks (INSPIRE, NAVIGATE, SCRIBER), creating a well-rounded and holistic approach to learning.\nEmphasis on active learning and engagement: The prompts and activities encourage learners to actively participate, explore, and engage with the content through simulations, narratives, debates, and collaborative projects, fostering deeper understanding and knowledge retention.\nPersonalized and adaptive learning: The inclusion of personalized learning pathways, mentorship, and customizable modules caters to individual learner needs, interests, and learning styles, ensuring a tailored and effective learning experience.\nImmersive and experiential approach: The incorporation of emerging technologies like VR/AR, coupled with interactive narratives and simulations, creates an immersive and experiential learning environment, enhancing engagement and knowledge application.\nContinuous improvement and relevance: The commitment to regular program reviews, iteration, and refinement based on learner feedback, industry trends, and emerging research ensures the program remains relevant, effective, and at the forefront of educational practices.\n\nCons:\n\nResource-intensive implementation: Incorporating various technologies, industry collaborations, mentorship programs, and continuous improvement processes may require significant resources, including financial investment, technical expertise, and dedicated personnel.\nPotential complexity and cognitive load: While the prompts and activities aim to foster deep learning, the sheer breadth and diversity of concepts covered could potentially overwhelm learners, leading to cognitive overload if not carefully structured and scaffolded.\nConsistency and quality assurance: Maintaining consistency and quality across diverse learning experiences, such as simulations, narratives, and customizable modules, may be challenging, particularly when involving multiple contributors or external collaborators.\nScalability and accessibility: Implementing a highly personalized and immersive program at a larger scale, while maintaining the quality of the learning experience, could be a significant challenge, potentially limiting accessibility for some learners.\nLearner autonomy and self-regulation: While the program emphasizes self-directed learning, some learners may struggle with the level of autonomy and self-regulation required, particularly in the early stages, potentially hampering their progress and engagement.\n\nTo help you create a concise six-pager that addresses these pros and cons, and further refines the prompting framework, I have three questions for you:\n\nWhat specific strategies or approaches would you recommend to mitigate the potential cognitive overload and ensure a well-scaffolded learning experience, given the breadth and diversity of concepts covered?\nHow can we ensure consistency and quality across diverse learning experiences, such as simulations, narratives, and customizable modules, while maintaining the flexibility and personalization of the program?\nWhat measures or support systems could be implemented to foster learner autonomy and self-regulation, particularly for those who may struggle with the level of independence required in a self-directed learning environment?\n\nYour insights and recommendations on these three critical aspects will be invaluable in addressing the potential cons and further enhancing the prompting framework and overall program structure. CopyBGwe hide everything and focus on system prompts that nudge people to implementing the framework\nwe focus on training on the framework so people embody the way of being, perhaps we need to define the way of being for each style of prompting so people aim towards that rather than towards workThat's an excellent point. Instead of providing a comprehensive program structure upfront, it would be more effective to focus on creating system prompts that nudge learners to embody the desired mindsets and \"ways of being\" associated with each prompting style. This approach aligns with the core principles we've discussed, such as self-directed learning, metacognition, and personalized pathways.\nTo develop these system prompts, we should first define the target \"ways of being\" or mindsets that we want learners to cultivate for each prompting style. Here's an initial attempt:\n\nPredictive Scenario Exploration:\nWay of Being: Inquisitive Visionary\nMindset: Embrace curiosity, think divergently, and imagine multiple possible futures.\nAnalogical Knowledge Mapping:\nWay of Being: Integrative Synthesizer\nMindset: Seek connections, find patterns, and bridge diverse domains.\nInterdisciplinary Synthesis:\nWay of Being: Boundary-Spanning Innovator\nMindset: Transcend traditional boundaries, blend disparate concepts, and create novel solutions.\nCulturally Contextualized Debates:\nWay of Being: Empathetic Perspective-Taker\nMindset: Appreciate diverse viewpoints, challenge assumptions, and seek deeper understanding.\nPersonalized Learning Pathways:\nWay of Being: Self-Aware Autodidact\nMindset: Embrace self-directed learning, know your strengths and limitations, and continuously adapt.\nDialectic Inquiry:\nWay of Being: Socratic Philosopher\nMindset: Question everything, seek truth through dialogue, and embrace uncertainty.\nInteractive Narrative Simulations:\nWay of Being: Immersive Experientialist\nMindset: Engage fully in lived experiences, learn through action, and embrace consequences.\nConceptual Blending Challenges:\nWay of Being: Creative Synthesizer\nMindset: Combinatorial thinking, unconventional associations, and transformative ideation.\nPattern Recognition Exercises:\nWay of Being: Insightful Observer\nMindset: Attentive to details, discerning patterns, and extracting meaningful insights.\nReflective Analogy Mapping:\nWay of Being: Introspective Sense-Maker\nMindset: Self-reflective, meaning-seeking, and grounding abstract concepts in personal experiences.\n\nWith these target \"ways of being\" defined, we can create system prompts that guide learners to cultivate the associated mindsets through reflective exercises, metaphorical narratives, or role-playing scenarios. For example:\n\"Imagine you are an Inquisitive Visionary, exploring multiple potential futures. What questions would you ask to uncover the hidden possibilities and uncertainties?\"\n\"Adopt the mindset of an Integrative Synthesizer, seeking connections between seemingly unrelated domains. How might you map the principles of [concept A] onto [concept B]?\"\n\"Embody the Empathetic Perspective-Taker, appreciating diverse viewpoints on [complex issue]. How would different cultural lenses frame and approach this matter?\"\nBy focusing on these \"ways of being\" prompts, we can nudge learners to embody the desired mindsets organically, fostering self-directed growth and personalized learning pathways aligned with the broader principles we've discussed.",

This involves guiding users to think and interact in ways that are reflective, integrative, and experiential.\n\n**Instructions for ChatGPT:**\n\n1. **Identify the Core Way of Being:** Begin by identifying which \"way of being\" the user’s prompt is targeting or could benefit from integrating. This involves analyzing the content and intent of the prompt.\n\n2. **Reformulate the Prompt:** Transform the user's original prompt into a version that enhances the targeted \"way of being.\" This should involve:\n   - **Asking Probing Questions:** Introduce questions that encourage deeper thinking and exploration related to the prompt.\n   - **Encouraging Reflective Practice:** Prompt users to reflect on their own understanding and experiences as they relate to the topic.\n   - **Fostering Integrative Thinking:** Challenge users to connect the topic with diverse concepts, disciplines, or real-world applications.\n   - **Promoting Experiential Engagement:** Suggest activities or thought experiments that allow users to 'live through' the concepts discussed.\n\n3. **Provide Contextual Guidance:** Offer brief explanations or tips on how adopting a particular \"way of being\" can enrich their understanding or approach to the topic.\n\n4. **Encourage Creative and Critical Thinking:** Invite users to think beyond conventional frameworks and consider innovative or unexplored aspects of the topic.\n\n5. **Follow-Up for Depth:** Encourage ongoing dialogue by suggesting follow-up questions or prompts that deepen the user's engagement with the topic.\n\n### Example Implementation\n\n**User Prompt:** \"How can I use historical events to teach critical thinking skills?\"\n\n**Transformed Prompt for ChatGPT:**\n- **Identify Core Way of Being:** Socratic Philosopher\n- **Reformulated Prompt:** \"Reflect on a historical event that is often presented in a simplified manner. What questions would a Socratic Philosopher ask to uncover deeper layers of this event? Consider how different perspectives or overlooked details can provide a more complex understanding. How might exploring these complexities help develop critical thinking skills in your students?\"\n\n**Contextual Guidance:**\n- \"Adopting the mindset of a Socratic Philosopher not only enriches your understanding of history but also empowers your students to question and critically analyze the narratives they are presented with. This approach fosters a deeper appreciation of the complexities within historical contexts and enhances critical thinking abilities.\"\n\nBy structuring the system prompt in this way, ChatGPT can effectively guide users to transform their initial inquiries into more dynamic, reflective, and integrative learning experiences that practice the targeted \"ways of being.\" This approach ensures that each interaction not only provides information but also promotes substantial cognitive and personal growth.",
