[{text}] =‘Introduction\nThe 2022 HerMeNow Accelerator is a short program that brought training support to 30+ women-led social enterprises in MENA & Africa in the sprint phase (September 2022) and technical, financial, and mentorship support to 10 women-led social enterprises in the accelerator phase (October 2022 to February 2023). \nDuring the first cycle of the HerMeNow Accelerator program, ten women-led social enterprises were supported in the accelerator phase and accompanied by ten high-profile and experienced mentors during their learning journey. To evaluate the program’s success in providing successful mentorship support, we conducted a program evaluation, the main findings of which are detailed in the following report.\nProgram Evaluation\nThe program evaluation relied on several data sources to assess program effectiveness, including feedback forms and meetings with mentees and mentors. A summary of the findings from these data is provided in this section.\nBased on surveys and one-on-one meetings with participants, participants' perceptions of the program were extremely positive. Nearly all survey respondents agreed that they like their mentors and feel comfortable talking to their mentors. One-on-one meetings revealed that participants appreciated their mentors' emotional and technical support and valued mentors who were more relatable with similar professional experiences. Surveys also showed that nearly all respondents reported positive relationships with their mentors and provided high ratings for performance.\nData and Methods\nThe following section summarizes the data collection process and methodologies used to evaluate the mentorship component of the HerMeNow program.\nTo assess participant perceptions of the program and document the frequency and quality of mentor-mentee contact, one-on-one meetings and surveys were used. \nOne-on-one meetings were held, and feedback forms were shared at the mid-program point. A total of 10 one-on-one meetings were conducted with 10 participants between December 2022 and January 2023. These meetings ranged in length from 30 to 45 minutes. The program manager recorded detailed notes in the organizational development plan throughout the sessions. Feedback forms were also shared with mentees and mentors during this period.\nResults\nEvaluation findings are detailed in the following section.\nQuality of Mentor-Mentee Contact\nBoth the surveys and one-on-one meetings provide insight into mentees’ perceptions of their mentors. Based on the surveys, mentees' perceptions of their mentors are overwhelmingly positive. \nThe following table provides the percentages of the nine feedback forms mentee respondents who strongly agreed or agreed with each statement.\nSurvey Item from Mentees respondents\n% Strongly Agree or Agree\nThe goals were clearly set by the mentor\n77.78%\nThe mentor had a wide knowledge of his field of expertise\n88.89%\nThe mentor had new tools shared with the mentee\n66.67%\nThe mentor connected me with external parties related to my project\n22.22%\nThe relationship with the mentor was very positive and constructive\n100.00%\nThe mentor contributed giving advice to my project\n100.00%\nThe mentor strengthened my skills\n66.67%\nThe mentor provided consistent feedback throughout the set period.\n66.67%\n\n\nThe following table provides the percentages of the eight feedback forms of mentor respondents who strongly agreed or agreed with each statement.\nSurvey Item from Mentors respondents\n% Strongly Agree or Agree\nThe mentee meets with the mentor as scheduled\n100.00%\nThe mentee handles feedback well\n100.00%\nThe mentee is well prepared for mentorship sessions\n100.00%\nThe mentee is open to growth and learning\n100.00%\nThe mentee behaves professionally\n100.00%\nThe mentee accumulates and interprets information relevantly\n100.00%\nThe mentee understands goals, follows instructions, and takes initiative\n100.00%\nThe mentee works independently and is mentally alert\n100.00%\nThe mentee has the ability to come up with innovative solutions\n100.00%\nThe mentee shows creativity\n100.00%\nThe mentee is committed to their project\n100.00%\n’",
