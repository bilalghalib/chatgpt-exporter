            "extracted_content": "“So I'm trying to operationalize a system that leads with this quote that goes, thoughts lead to actions, actions lead to habits, habits lead to character, and character leads to destiny. And to map it with attentional policies that are about the sources of meaning. So like the thing that we pay attention to and a sentence that describes it. So for instance, moments where there's light-hearted and joyful conversation, or spaces where people can express their colors and creativity, or sunsets where the sky turns many colors. Or I don't know, things like that. Joe Edelman's values framework, because I really think that there's a way of understanding that source of attention and sources of meaning as a connection with the things that make us come alive. And it reminds me, and I'm pairing that with the quote, like, don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive, and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people that have come alive. And I'm working on this assumption that our coming alive comes through our daily actions, our to-do lists, our habits, and what we do on a day-to-day. When we can use that to identify moments where we are either coming alive or not coming alive. And that's what I would like to do with a quick check-in. And when we're not coming alive, there's tension or negative emotions. And we can use the process of all of our emotions are trying to tell us something. And actually, the idea that everything is always talking to us and trying to tell us something. And it's either tension, and that means that there are different things that we're trying to attend to at the same time that are incommensurate. We want to attend to our baby's laugh and presence with us at the same time as we're trying to attend to crafting a philosophy of action and growth that is philosophically rigorous and intellectually stimulating and creative and fun. And what I'm doing right now, my baby's over there, but I have these two tensions. And so how can we do these things together? And I guess I could talk it out to my baby and pretend that he can understand, actually bring him into the process. And so that creative, productive framing of how can I find a higher level action or things to attend to that will be able to address the underlying conflicts in the sources of meaning. And I call the other thing pressures of doing. So neither internal or external. So they could be norms or other things that are not really on the conscious level, just things that you do because that's what people do. I got a job, or I do this, or I do that. And I got to get to work. Why do you gotta, gotta, gotta? And so it's like the shoulds and the want-tos in our lives, I think, is another way of thinking about these things. When you have a bunch of shoulds, you can think that they're probably a bunch of instrumental things or things that are unconscious or things that are beyond our choice and intention. So the idea is to move more of our actions into the place of intentionality and into a place where we can actually be connected to our sources of meaning and flow. And even if they're like sleep or things that are very practical with good intentions, you can always find a way of connecting these things. And I think that's a really important thing to do because so many people are just like living on autopilot. And so I think there's something about this that I'm really trying to figure out to see if I have everything, if I have full coverage onto the human condition, or if I'm missing some fundamental things about other reasons why people might get stuck or not live the way that they want to live. And if I'm missing things that would be important to add in this framework, or is this useful enough? And then what are the important parts to save, right? Should we only save the sources of attention for all of the meaningful things, or should we save the story? Does the story actually have some special sauce that's gonna be important? Because in the future, I just want to save the minimal subset of things that's gonna be really helpful for the person and not like absolutely everything, like the pressures and the tensions and how they relate and like every single bit of resource that the person has from like a laptop to a friend that they can call and then what is their relationship? And then what is the, you know, that gets to be too huge. I'm trying to come up with like a very streamlined, very elegant, high leverage thing that actually puts the mirror pointing at the person and asks them questions about those fundamental resources like relationships and others, but doesn't even have to necessarily say the word relationships. Like what has helped you in the past? Think of stories, situations, contexts, like large abstract words like that so that people can reflect and be like, oh, you know what? I really loved it when I had the support of my friends on jobs because I'm just way better in a pair programming process. And then we can derive like new sources of meaning and new ways for that person to live their values. And I'm really just need some questions and some digging in to figure out if I'm on the right track or if I need some help getting this structured better.”\n05:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you're trying to design a system that aligns daily actions with deeper sources of meaning, using intentionality to foster a more meaningful life. The quote you're referencing serves as a great starting point, mapping out how thoughts lead to destiny.\n\nTo operationalize this, you could start by identifying key \"sources of meaning\" for individuals, such as moments that spark joy or creativity. Reflect on how these sources can be incorporated into daily actions and habits.\n\nYour framework could use reflective questions to prompt self-awareness:\n\nWhat activities make you feel most alive?\nWhen do you notice a sense of flow or joy?\nHow can you incorporate these moments into your daily life?\nTo address the tensions between \"shoulds\" and \"wants,\" you might emphasize:\n\nShifting actions from autopilot (external pressures) to intentionality (internal meaning).\nIdentifying and minimizing unconscious influences.\nStreamlining this approach involves:\n\nFocusing on high-leverage questions that reveal core values and patterns.\nEncouraging actions aligned with those values.\nIt sounds like you're exploring a powerful method to bring awareness to our daily choices, which is incredibly valuable. Keep refining your questions to ensure they resonate and inspire meaningful action!\n\n11:58\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, that sounds good, except I was looking to see if this is comprehensive. I'm wondering if, like, a coach or a psychologist may be able to tell me that I'm actually missing some fundamental elements that are critical for this, and we're trying to get people to basically come alive and be the best for themselves and for others. And I first of all want to, like, know, is it true that the world needs people that have come alive? Like, is that really all that you need, and what does it mean to come alive, you know, I think, to be sources of meaning is a way to really find what lights you up, and you'll have more energy, you'll have more commitments, you'll have more attention and focus and draw to do these things, but who knows if that will actually lead to a more possible and sustainable world. I think it's related to Plato's Golden Mean. Maybe there's a way of, like, really understanding the philosophical rigor here, and whether or not I'm just doing, like, a small thing that might help a little bit, or if I'm doing something that's actually transformational for individuals and for the planet, because I'm trying to let go of running a social enterprise accelerator and thinking I know what a better future looks like, and incentivizing entrepreneurs that work in the social space to reduce CO2 emissions or employ refugees, and instead thinking of, like, what if we just help people see who they are, what the world is, and feel really deeply about what makes them come to life and what they want to contribute in an authentic way, in this way reducing burnout and actually increasing authenticity and making the world more diverse, unique, and whole, because people are actually being what they are, like a tree that produces apples is going to be producing apples, and the worm that eats those apples is going to eat those apples, and the bird that eats the worm and the apples is going to poop some seeds somewhere and plant new trees and kind of, like, become this ecosystemic thing, but you don't have to think about the long consequences of your actions and monitor impact and measures. Instead, you have to think really deeply about what is coming around you right now in your field of vision, in your awareness, and as you grow and as you learn and as the world is getting more and more deeply interconnected, we will see refugees. We will see the burning that's happening in California. People will be doing the science, because there are people who come alive doing the science, and they're going to be telling us these stories, the journalists who are coming live, telling us the stories of how the science related to CO2 is related to the burning, and we will feel this care and this passion, and the people that live closest to the fires will tell the stories about how to best help those and will maybe transform how they work, and we don't need to kind of use governments and pressure and taxes and incentivize solar panels and tell people to go green and blame and judge, and instead, there's a different way, and I think this just might be a philosophically rigorous and psychologically sound way of helping more people come alive, and, you know, like, let's just keep this whole thing about sustainability, right? Like, consume less, right? Because they'll be more content. They'll actually connect their work with meaning, and what would happen if this planet had more content people on it? Like, it would be very interesting to do an economic study of contentedness.”\n11:58\n03:21\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour vision of helping people come alive and connect with their deeper sources of meaning is indeed comprehensive and philosophically rich. You're tapping into a powerful idea that aligns with the concept of eudaimonia, or flourishing, which is central to many philosophical traditions, including Aristotle's.\n\nThe idea that the world needs more people who are alive—engaged, passionate, and living authentically—resonates deeply. This state of being can lead to more sustainable and compassionate actions, creating a ripple effect that benefits society and the planet. It aligns well with the idea of contentment and reducing unnecessary consumption.\n\nTo ensure comprehensiveness, it might be helpful to consider:\n\nDiverse Perspectives: Include inputs from coaches, psychologists, and different cultural frameworks to ensure it resonates broadly.\nPractical Implementation: Develop tools or practices that help people identify and sustain these sources of meaning in their daily lives.\nMeasuring Impact: While it's less about rigid metrics, consider ways to observe and reflect on the transformation in individuals and communities.\nThe shift from focusing on specific outcomes (like reducing CO2) to nurturing authenticity and connection might be more sustainable and transformative. It's a beautiful and ambitious vision, and your approach could indeed be a profound way to foster individual and collective well-being. It's worth exploring further, perhaps through pilot programs or small groups to test and refine your ideas. Keep digging into these questions, and you might find a truly transformative path.\n\n12:03\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's something here as well, and I'd love to hear you explain Aristotle's eudaimonia concept and the concept of the golden mean and how they could relate. And also the idea that I have that is not very clear in how it could be true or how it could be false. Identify a critic of these ideas and a proponent of these ideas and have them discussed back before coming to a conclusion. And the idea that I want them to discuss is that they have a possibility to have a scalable, transformative world that is able to address these kind of thorny, interconnected VUCA problems by just paying attention to their context and their situation and their feelings and what makes them come to life and their sources of meaning. There's one way that I described, which is consentedness, that also reduces consumption, which is the core factor leading to the emissions of greenhouse gases and all of this stuff. And the other one is this idea that, you know, people will actually care. They'll love their planet. There's some people that will come to life nurturing nature, regenerating forests, and hearing these stories can be inspiring to us. The story of the Patagonia founder, the story of the person who planted a million trees, or the person who does these regenerative agroforestry projects, or feeds their communities with an urban farm in Detroit. And someone else might be inspired and love that and find their sources of meaning through this. But I don't want to direct people towards that. I want to direct people towards that process. And I guess the big element is this element of trust. And that would mean that, like, do I trust that the world is sort of self-consistent and that there are signals enough in the right places that if people are paying attention, that the signals will transform into truth that they see if they are, like, I don't know. It requires this kind of open curiosity and exploration of the world and, like, a little bit of an understanding of what's happening. Let's imagine that we didn't freak people out about climate change and we just told people to go live, you know, and see. And people would be like, oh, look at this degraded ecosystem. Like, it hurts me to see because next door I've seen these things that are beautiful, like, wonderful, green, lush places. Like, why isn't this like that? And then asking these questions and, like, feeling and being sensitive and then responding. I feel like there needs to be an element of education, but this element of exposure and seeing and maybe some people can really understand systems thinking and they have the capacity and the cognitive development to be able to do that. Some people are just kids and they need to be, you know, like, grown and be able to see and feel and do, see the world, see the truth, feel, care, find their sources of meaning in the way that they action and do something beautiful, do something about it. And then we need to empower people with resources, right? So, I'm really wondering if this is enough and, like, if that quote, like, I want you to ask me a couple of questions to help me discover for myself. And then maybe also give me a bunch of critics that would say that this is wrong. And why is it wrong? Rigorously and philosophically. Like, who out there in academia, who out there in, like, the lived experience, maybe, like, indigenous peoples or others or people that think that we have to really understand the world before fixing it and that we can measure change as important, like, all the people that are working in governments and such, trying to create incentives for people to have a life that is more sustainable and, yeah, come back to me with a list of questions and arguments that kind of contradict this idea that don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do that. And, you know, maybe there's two elements, right? It's like, ask what makes you come alive and go do that. In a way, that creates harmony. I don't know, like, does there need to be an addition to that quote or not? Is it good enough on its own if we trust the hearts of people?”\n12:03\n04:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAristotle's eudaimonia, often translated as \"flourishing\" or \"the good life,\" is about living in a way that fulfills one's potential and aligns with virtues. The Golden Mean is about balance—finding a middle ground between extremes, like courage being the mean between recklessness and cowardice.\n\nThese concepts can relate to your idea by emphasizing balance in living a meaningful life, one that’s in harmony with oneself and the world.\n\nTo explore your idea's strengths and weaknesses, here's a dialogue:\n\nProponent: \"Focusing on what makes us come alive can lead to genuine engagement and positive action. When people are deeply connected to their passions and sources of meaning, they naturally contribute in ways that benefit themselves and the world. Contentment can reduce consumption, and nurturing what brings joy can lead to sustainability.\"\n\nCritic: \"But what if individual passions don't align with collective good? Not everyone’s 'coming alive' might lead to positive outcomes, and focusing solely on personal joy could overlook systemic issues. We also need structural changes and collective action to address broader problems.\"\n\nProponent: \"True, but if individuals are more content and connected to their purpose, they might naturally work towards collective good. It's about fostering a deeper awareness and responsibility, which can lead to structural changes from a place of authenticity.\"\n\nCritic: \"Yet we can't ignore the need for external structures and incentives. Trusting that everyone will 'come alive' in a way that benefits the world might be idealistic. We need a balance of individual transformation and societal structures to ensure sustainable outcomes.\"\n\nTo sum up, your idea has the potential to be transformative but may need to be complemented with structural supports. The balance of individual authenticity and collective action could be the key.\n\nAs you explore this further, consider questions like:\n\nHow can we ensure individual passions align with collective good?\nWhat role do societal structures play in supporting or hindering this process?\nHow can we measure the impact of this shift in perspective on broader societal goals?\nYour approach is promising, blending philosophical depth with practical applications. Keep refining it, and it could indeed become a transformative force.\n\n12:09\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, you're right. Like, we can't trust that everyone's purpose and things that make them come alive will be the thing that will bring them to social and collective positive change. I mean, there are sociopaths, and so maybe what we need to do is include that data about how many people in the world are sociopaths.”\n12:09\n00:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful\n\n12:10\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n12:10\n00:01\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful consideration. Including data on different motivations and behaviors can help create a more robust system. It's important to recognize that while many people may find positive, socially beneficial purposes, there are also those who might not.\n\nBy acknowledging this diversity, you can design mechanisms that guide people towards constructive and positive actions, balancing individual growth with collective well-being. It\n\n12:10\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI know that one of the ancient philosophers had some of these ideas that, you know, people should find their place and the structure becomes a whole. I thought it was Plato, and I thought it had something to do with golden or middle. Can't really remember. Can you help me figure out what that was?\n12:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou might be thinking of Plato's idea of the \"ideal city\" in his work The Republic, or Aristotle's concept of the \"Golden Mean.\" Here's how they align with what you're describing:\n\nPlato and the Ideal City (The Republic)\nPlato argued that a harmonious society is one where everyone \"finds their place\" based on their natural abilities and virtues. He divided society into three classes:\n\nRulers (philosopher-kings): Govern based on wisdom.\nGuardians (soldiers): Protect based on courage.\nProducers (farmers, artisans, etc.): Provide goods and services based on their practical skills.\nIn this structure, individuals contribute to the whole according to their role, creating a just and unified society. Plato emphasized that justice arises when everyone fulfills their role without interfering in others' roles.\n\nAristotle's Golden Mean\nAristotle, a student of Plato, developed the idea of the Golden Mean, which is about finding balance or moderation between extremes. For example:\n\nCourage lies between recklessness and cowardice.\nGenerosity lies between wastefulness and stinginess.\nWhile the Golden Mean primarily applies to personal virtues, Aristotle also emphasized the importance of individuals living in accordance with their nature and contributing to the \"polis\" (community) for a flourishing society.\n\nConnecting the Dots\nIf you're thinking about \"people finding their place\" and a \"structure becoming a whole,\" Plato's ideal city seems to fit. If the \"golden\" part feels important, Aristotle's Golden Mean might resonate. Both philosophers explored how individuals and communities achieve harmony through balance and fulfilling their natural roles.\n\n12:18\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nIs there another philosopher from antiquity or the, you know, the last couple of 2,000 years that talks about this strong, stable, and structured society when people were who they were meant to be, something like that? Who might be the philosopher that fits that category?\n12:18\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, several philosophers across antiquity and the last 2,000 years have explored the idea of a strong, stable, and structured society based on people fulfilling their purpose or role. Here are a few key figures who might align with what you're describing:\n\n1. Confucius (551–479 BCE)\nConfucius emphasized the importance of li (ritual and social order) and ren (virtue and benevolence) in creating a harmonious society. He argued that:\n\nA stable society depends on everyone fulfilling their roles within relationships (parent-child, ruler-subject, etc.).\nPeople thrive when they live in alignment with their moral duties and cultivate virtue.\nThis Confucian vision is about balance within a structured society, where each person contributes based on their position and responsibilities.\n2. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)\nAquinas built on Aristotle’s philosophy within a Christian framework. He argued that:\n\nSociety is structured around a divine hierarchy, with everyone having a God-given role.\nPeople fulfill their purpose through their roles, which ultimately lead to the common good and spiritual flourishing.\nAquinas saw harmony and stability as arising when individuals live according to both their natural and divine purpose.\n3. Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406)\nThe Islamic philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of societal rise and decline. His key ideas include:\n\nSocieties are held together by asabiyyah (social cohesion or solidarity).\nStability and prosperity depend on people contributing to the collective good within a structured hierarchy.\nIbn Khaldun emphasized how roles and cohesion contribute to a society's strength and longevity.\n4. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right and his broader dialectical framework discuss how:\n\nA stable society arises from the synthesis of individual freedom and social institutions.\nPeople find their true selves by contributing to a greater whole, especially through family, civil society, and the state.\nFor Hegel, the state is the ultimate realization of freedom and harmony when everyone fulfills their role within its structure.\n5. Alasdair MacIntyre (1929– )\nIn his modern work After Virtue, MacIntyre critiques contemporary individualism and champions a return to Aristotelian virtue ethics:\n\nA society thrives when people pursue their telos (purpose) within communities that share a common moral framework.\nHe emphasizes the importance of traditions and practices that give people meaningful roles within a stable social structure.\nWho Fits Best?\nFrom what you’ve described, Confucius or Ibn Khaldun might resonate most if you’re thinking about structured, cohesive societies based on natural or moral roles. If you're considering a Western tradition with a theological or metaphysical component, Aquinas or Hegel might fit. If you’re looking for a critique of modernity with a return to structured communities, MacIntyre offers a contemporary perspective.\n\n12:18\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nCan you tell me more about Hegel and Alasdair? Did you have them debate with each other and other philosophers that might disagree with them and try to come up with a clarification of each of their ideas? Because what is Alasdair's idea of telos? What is the purpose? Share a common moral framework. What is that? And what would Charles Taylor say about all of this?\n12:19\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHegel, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Charles Taylor each present rich frameworks for understanding purpose, structure, and moral frameworks in society. Here’s an exploration of their ideas, potential debates, and clarifications:\n\nHegel’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in Hegel:\n\nFor Hegel, the telos (ultimate purpose) of humanity is freedom—not as individual independence, but as the realization of oneself within the context of the whole (family, civil society, and the state).\nHe believed history progresses dialectically, resolving contradictions to achieve greater unity and self-awareness. The state, in its ideal form, is the realization of this telos, where individuals are free because their roles align with the rational structure of society.\nMoral Framework:\n\nHegel argued that morality (individual conscience) must integrate with ethical life (Sittlichkeit), which includes family, civil society, and the state.\nThe state is not oppressive; it embodies rational freedom, where individual purposes align with collective purposes.\nAlasdair MacIntyre’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in MacIntyre:\n\nMacIntyre’s telos for humans is rooted in virtue ethics, drawn from Aristotle. Humans flourish by fulfilling their potential within practices (shared activities with intrinsic goods) and traditions (longstanding communities of meaning).\nTelos is tied to the notion of a “narrative unity of life,” where individuals see their lives as coherent, meaningful stories within the context of a community.\nCommon Moral Framework:\n\nMacIntyre argues that modernity has fragmented moral frameworks, leaving us with conflicting and incoherent moral languages (emotivism).\nHe advocates for a return to traditions (like Aristotelian or Thomistic virtue ethics) that provide shared understandings of the good life and human flourishing.\nDebates Between Hegel and MacIntyre\nOn Telos and Freedom:\n\nHegel: The state is the highest realization of human purpose, harmonizing individual freedom and collective good.\nMacIntyre: Human flourishing is tied to smaller communities and traditions, not an abstract state structure. He might see Hegel’s state as too grandiose or prone to suppressing individual moral traditions.\nOn Moral Frameworks:\n\nHegel: The rationality of ethical life arises organically from history and resolves itself in the state.\nMacIntyre: Moral coherence requires a return to traditions rooted in virtue and practices, not a state-driven rationality.\nCharles Taylor’s Perspective\nAgreement with Hegel:\n\nTaylor draws from Hegel’s ideas of the dialectic and the importance of self-realization through society. For Taylor, identity is formed in dialogue with others, and freedom is realized when individuals find themselves in alignment with the structures of society.\nHe would likely appreciate Hegel’s emphasis on modernity as a space for recognition—the idea that people flourish when their identities and contributions are affirmed by others.\nCritique of MacIntyre:\n\nTaylor shares MacIntyre’s concern about the fragmentation of modern morality but sees more value in the plurality of frameworks. He believes people can navigate between frameworks to construct meaningful lives.\nUnlike MacIntyre, who seeks a return to Aristotelian or Thomistic traditions, Taylor is more open to modern identity’s creative and adaptive possibilities.\nPoints of Contention\nHegel vs. MacIntyre on the Individual and the State:\n\nHegel: The state integrates individual purpose into collective rationality.\nMacIntyre: Large structures like the state erode traditions that are necessary for virtue and flourishing.\nTaylor vs. MacIntyre on Modernity:\n\nTaylor: Modernity offers unique opportunities for identity formation, even within fragmented moral landscapes.\nMacIntyre: Modernity’s fragmentation is a moral crisis, requiring a return to coherent traditions.\nTaylor vs. Hegel on Pluralism:\n\nHegel: History resolves into a unified rational framework (e.g., the modern state).\nTaylor: Modern societies must embrace pluralism and navigate tensions without expecting a final resolution.\nClarifications on Key Terms\nTelos (MacIntyre):\n\nThe telos is human flourishing, achieved through cultivating virtues within a tradition. Flourishing means leading a coherent life where one’s actions align with a meaningful narrative.\nCommon Moral Framework (MacIntyre):\n\nThis framework is rooted in shared traditions and practices. For example, the Aristotelian tradition sees virtues like courage, justice, and generosity as essential for the good life. MacIntyre sees modern individualism as eroding these frameworks.\nRecognition (Taylor):\n\nTaylor emphasizes recognition as key to human flourishing. Societies thrive when people are acknowledged for who they are, which fosters dignity and belonging.\nDebating Across Time\nAristotle might argue that Hegel overemphasizes the state and neglects the importance of smaller-scale communities.\nConfucius would critique MacIntyre for not fully appreciating how rituals and roles (e.g., family) create moral coherence.\nNietzsche would likely reject all three, arguing their views impose constraining moral frameworks instead of fostering true individual creativity.\nSynthesis\nIf these philosophers were to sit down together, the tension might lead to a broader understanding:\n\nHegel would push for the integration of individuals into rational, historical structures.\nMacIntyre would challenge the abstractness of such structures, advocating for local traditions and practices.\nTaylor would mediate, suggesting that modernity’s plurality offers opportunities for dialogue and synthesis rather than rigid returns to tradition.\nThis debate reveals that the \"purpose\" of society might not have a singular answer but depends on balancing freedom, tradition, and dialogue.\n\n12:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat would you say are domestic virtue ethics and Aristotelian virtue ethics and their definition of a good life? And then what is modern kind of European Union or the United Nations good life definition? Like what is the ethic behind that? You know, fundamental human rights and others, but like what are these ideas of the good life?\n12:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nDomestic Virtue Ethics (Confucian or Family-Centered Ethics)\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nDomestic virtue ethics, such as those emphasized in Confucianism or family-centered moral traditions, define the good life as harmonious relationships within a structured family and community system. The foundation is the belief that moral development starts in the family and radiates outward to society.\n\nCore Principles:\nRoles and Hierarchies: Each person has specific roles and duties (e.g., parent, child, sibling) that guide behavior.\nVirtues: Key virtues include filial piety (respect for parents and elders), loyalty, benevolence, and propriety.\nHarmony and Stability: A good life means maintaining balance and fulfilling obligations within relationships, ensuring both personal and collective flourishing.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic is deeply relational and role-based. Individuals find meaning through their responsibilities and contributions to the group, prioritizing stability, respect, and harmony over individual autonomy.\n\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nAristotle’s concept of the good life (eudaimonia, often translated as flourishing) is the full realization of human potential through the cultivation of virtues and rational activity in alignment with one's purpose (telos).\n\nCore Principles:\nVirtues as Habits: The good life requires cultivating virtues like courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom through practice and moderation (the Golden Mean).\nPractical Wisdom (Phronesis): Rationality and moral insight guide actions, enabling individuals to make wise decisions in specific contexts.\nCommunity and Politics: Humans are social beings (zoon politikon), so flourishing occurs within a just political community where individuals contribute to the common good.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic emphasizes individual moral development in harmony with the community. Flourishing is achieved through the active cultivation of virtues that align personal and societal well-being.\n\nModern European Union and United Nations Framework\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nThe good life in modern frameworks, such as those of the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN), centers on universal human dignity, equality, and the fulfillment of fundamental rights and opportunities. It balances individual freedoms with collective well-being.\n\nCore Principles:\nHuman Rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) underpins this ethic, emphasizing freedom, security, education, health, and participation as fundamental.\nEquality and Non-Discrimination: The good life is one where everyone, regardless of background, has equal access to opportunities.\nSustainability and Global Responsibility: Modern frameworks include environmental ethics, emphasizing the right to a healthy planet and intergenerational justice.\nAgency and Self-Determination: Individuals should have autonomy to pursue their goals, provided they do not harm others.\nEthic Behind It:\nThis ethic is rooted in liberalism and cosmopolitanism, focusing on individual freedom, fairness, and global solidarity. It rejects rigid hierarchies and aims to balance rights with collective obligations to create inclusive, sustainable societies.\n\nComparing the Good Life Across Frameworks\nFramework\tFocus\tDefinition of Good Life\tEthic\nDomestic Virtue Ethics\tFamily and social harmony\tHarmonious relationships, fulfilling roles\tRelational and duty-bound; prioritizes stability and respect over autonomy.\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics\tVirtue cultivation and rationality\tFlourishing through virtues and rational activity\tBalanced between individual development and societal contribution.\nModern EU/UN Framework\tIndividual rights and global responsibility\tUniversal dignity, freedom, and equality\tLiberal and cosmopolitan; emphasizes autonomy, fairness, and sustainability.\nTensions and Debates\nIndividual vs. Collective Good:\n\nDomestic and Aristotelian ethics often prioritize the community, while modern frameworks emphasize individual autonomy and rights.\nVirtues vs. Rights:\n\nVirtue ethics sees moral character as central to the good life, while modern frameworks focus on institutional guarantees like rights and freedoms.\nUniversalism vs. Particularism:\n\nModern frameworks are universalist (e.g., all humans have the same rights), while domestic and Aristotelian ethics are more contextual and embedded in specific traditions.\nSustainability and Environment:\n\nThe modern good life includes sustainability, a relatively new focus absent from classical virtue ethics or family-based traditions.\nCharles Taylor’s View on the Good Life\nTaylor, in works like Sources of the Self, argues that modernity fragments moral frameworks, making it harder to define the good life. He suggests:\n\nThe good life arises from authenticity—living in alignment with one’s deeply held values.\nWhile he appreciates the pluralism of modernity, he warns against the flattening of moral horizons (e.g., reducing the good life to materialism or individualism).\nHe might critique the UN/EU framework for focusing on procedural rights without addressing the deeper question of what truly fulfills human beings.\nKey Takeaway\nThe good life is a deeply contested concept that shifts depending on philosophical, cultural, and historical contexts. Each framework—domestic, Aristotelian, and modern—offers a unique vision, with ongoing tensions around autonomy, community, and sustainability. The debate challenges us to consider how to reconcile individual flourishing with collective responsibility.\n\n12:23\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nIt kind of makes sense to me, the Confucian idea of roles, not necessarily the hierarchies, but we all have roles that we play in the world. And I also like this idea of MacIntyre's idea that stories, right? And that we kind of have our, we're within a culture, right? And so meaning-making needs to connect with a, you know, your individual story and what makes life meaningful for you. But also to like tell the story of the world. And I think that this is an important thing, is like, what is the story of me and what’s my developing and unfolding story of the world and my role in it and these things may help connect with sources of meaning for instance what if you didn’t know about a war and weren’t able to petition your gov to open borders to refugees and bring in a family - that might be incredibly meaningful for you and you’d have to have knowledge of the world to know and know how to do that what about amartya sen how would he respond to all this - The good life, really, it seems like no one really has a very clear idea about what it means to lead and live a good life. I think the idea of authenticity, living in alignment with one's deeply held values, makes sense to me from Taylor. Tensions and debates. Collective good versus individual good. I think it's really important, that tension here. And maybe it's kind of resolved with these stories of the world and stories of the self. Virtues versus rights. Universalism versus particularism. It's definitely very particular because what makes this person's right action in that right moment is definitely related to their self-understanding and understanding of the world. And this idea that there's a moral dimension of grappling with competing values. And I think it's really important to have knowledge of impact. So, let's say there's somebody trying to make a decision about sexual contact. And they have agreements with their partner that this is totally fine for them to have sexual contact outside of their relationship in this polyamorous situation. But they still have a sense that their partner, if they knew, would be hurt. Should they tell them because they have this open policy? Or should they hide what they're doing, leading to some tensions? And how do you know what the right thing to do is in that situation? And you can grapple with it and you can try different ways and you can have different experiences. But you don't know how the other person will respond. And then I kind of feel like there's just the right thing to do and this idea of the most beautiful. And so the good life should be good. And we should kind of be developing an aesthetic taste for our sort of morality. It's like what is not just the good life but what is the beautiful life? And the narrative is how you make it coherent. You talk about, okay, so I'm like this. These are what I really love and value and want to see in the world. And the world is like that. And this is how I am a part of that larger story. And I find my authenticity by realizing that my authenticity is kind of defining myself in a big story. Not just a small story of self but self and world. And that this idea of it kind of definitely connects with this Muslim intuition that like everything is a sign. Everything in the horizons outside of the world is a sign of the most merciful God. And that this most merciful God is telling the most beautiful story through the creation and through existence. And it's really our hands that lead to corruption. And we are oppressing ourselves when we are going against our values. And we do these things for various reasons. There's different forces that block this. This is why like the tawheed element, like this idea of unity is so important. Because this like concept of unity and the way that it's described in the Muslim tradition is ihsan. It's like first you just do the actions. You pray. You fast. You have all of the pillars of Islam. And then iman. You believe these things. That God is writing the most beautiful story in the most perfect book. And that everything is in his total and ultimate control. And his name of al-Rahman, the most merciful, is the thing that encompasses everything. And so our like position, if we really believe these things, we think, okay, well I have free will. And I can either align with the most beautiful story and figure out how does mercy for the worlds, which is what the guide for humanity is supposed to be, the prophet of Islam, Muhammad ﷺ. And so he is a mercy to the worlds. He is our ultimate example. So we should be aspiring to be mercy to the worlds. And so there's the merciful who's created everything. He's given us free will. And he's created destiny. And we are here to be a part of telling that most merciful story and opening the channel inside of us to the light of the most merciful divine God's actions through our submitting of our will to that most beautiful story. Does that make sense? And so we see the world. We understand. We try to be creative in telling our most beautiful component of our story. Like what is our role in this unfolding? A tree as it elegantly traces a path towards the sky and the roots that go in this way searching for water is following the commands of God essentially. And it's following its innate beingness. And this is its fitrah, F-I-T-R-A. And this is how that tree becomes beautiful. Because it is what it is without trying to be anything other than that because it has no free will. It follows its fitrah naturally. And the fitrah is the innate state. And so everyone loves babies. Sure, a baby will cry. But no one is like, it's crying to annoy me. It's crying because. And we lose touch with this ability to just be and to see our emotions and to act and respond in the world. And I think this like spontaneity and this is why there's a relationship with Wu Wei and choiceless action from Taoism. And I think there's the important element though that I'm coming to now maybe for the first time is these like multiple interweaving stories. You can think of them sort of like holograms, right? So a hologram has everything outside and everything inside. And you tell the story, self-consistent, totally about yourself, about how you see someone hurting and you feel moved to go and do something about it. Or you want to create a joyous and loving and harmonious home for your wife. So you go and you bake some bread. And this is a artistic creative act in the world where you try to understand. Like not only do I want to make bread. I want to understand what my wife loves and make that because that will make like more joy and more beauty. And that kind of to me is a story about who I am and how I want to show up in the world and what I am attending to when I'm making choices about my day and my actions. And so like all these frameworks talk about things in a very theoretical way. And one of the nice things about modernity is it kind of like really emphasize these ideas of productivity and to-do lists and turned our days into routines. And we see the machinery of the operations of life more clearly now. But there's a point of intervention where we can pierce through the mundane and touch the spiritual and ethical, moral, artistic process of becoming that leads us to fulfilling the ultimate destiny that would make us the happiest person on earth the day we meet our doom, our death. And that's living who we were meant to be and fulfilling our role in the most beautiful story. And that's a creative process. That's not something you could just pop out of the womb and start doing. That requires like knowledge of self. That requires knowledge of the world. And as these things grow and develop, you see that there's this element of oneness that is really critical. Like you're telling two stories that merge that become one story of a creation of beauty. It's not just like looking within and introspection and looking without and being like, okay, well, the world has problems. Okay, what resources do I have? And like trying to figure out how to solve them. And this also addresses the need for like scalable good, right? You don't have only this like, okay, I'll look within. Don't ask what the world needs. That's what makes you come to life. It's like don't ask what the world. Ask what the world is. Ask what makes you come to life. And then be the most like beautiful, creative person in telling a story that puts all this together into oneness, which is the act of Tawheed. And so I kind of see things through the Islamic frame, but I think that all of these philosophers can kind of agree when we look at it this way. Can you help like align this in a table and show where they agree and where they disagree and what a kind of unified framework for the good life and what actions are, what virtue is, what morality is, what creative ethics are, what beauty is, and what meaning is, and what God is, and what the soul is, and what the body is for all these philosophers.

And to map it with attentional policies that are about the sources of meaning. So like the thing that we pay attention to and a sentence that describes it. So for instance, moments where there's light-hearted and joyful conversation, or spaces where people can express their colors and creativity, or sunsets where the sky turns many colors. Or I don't know, things like that. Joe Edelman's values framework, because I really think that there's a way of understanding that source of attention and sources of meaning as a connection with the things that make us come alive. And it reminds me, and I'm pairing that with the quote, like, don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive, and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people that have come alive. And I'm working on this assumption that our coming alive comes through our daily actions, our to-do lists, our habits, and what we do on a day-to-day. When we can use that to identify moments where we are either coming alive or not coming alive. And that's what I would like to do with a quick check-in. And when we're not coming alive, there's tension or negative emotions. And we can use the process of all of our emotions are trying to tell us something. And actually, the idea that everything is always talking to us and trying to tell us something. And it's either tension, and that means that there are different things that we're trying to attend to at the same time that are incommensurate. We want to attend to our baby's laugh and presence with us at the same time as we're trying to attend to crafting a philosophy of action and growth that is philosophically rigorous and intellectually stimulating and creative and fun. And what I'm doing right now, my baby's over there, but I have these two tensions. And so how can we do these things together? And I guess I could talk it out to my baby and pretend that he can understand, actually bring him into the process. And so that creative, productive framing of how can I find a higher level action or things to attend to that will be able to address the underlying conflicts in the sources of meaning. And I call the other thing pressures of doing. So neither internal or external. So they could be norms or other things that are not really on the conscious level, just things that you do because that's what people do. I got a job, or I do this, or I do that. And I got to get to work. Why do you gotta, gotta, gotta? And so it's like the shoulds and the want-tos in our lives, I think, is another way of thinking about these things. When you have a bunch of shoulds, you can think that they're probably a bunch of instrumental things or things that are unconscious or things that are beyond our choice and intention. So the idea is to move more of our actions into the place of intentionality and into a place where we can actually be connected to our sources of meaning and flow. And even if they're like sleep or things that are very practical with good intentions, you can always find a way of connecting these things. And I think that's a really important thing to do because so many people are just like living on autopilot. And so I think there's something about this that I'm really trying to figure out to see if I have everything, if I have full coverage onto the human condition, or if I'm missing some fundamental things about other reasons why people might get stuck or not live the way that they want to live. And if I'm missing things that would be important to add in this framework, or is this useful enough? And then what are the important parts to save, right? Should we only save the sources of attention for all of the meaningful things, or should we save the story? Does the story actually have some special sauce that's gonna be important? Because in the future, I just want to save the minimal subset of things that's gonna be really helpful for the person and not like absolutely everything, like the pressures and the tensions and how they relate and like every single bit of resource that the person has from like a laptop to a friend that they can call and then what is their relationship? And then what is the, you know, that gets to be too huge. I'm trying to come up with like a very streamlined, very elegant, high leverage thing that actually puts the mirror pointing at the person and asks them questions about those fundamental resources like relationships and others, but doesn't even have to necessarily say the word relationships. Like what has helped you in the past? Think of stories, situations, contexts, like large abstract words like that so that people can reflect and be like, oh, you know what? I really loved it when I had the support of my friends on jobs because I'm just way better in a pair programming process. And then we can derive like new sources of meaning and new ways for that person to live their values. And I'm really just need some questions and some digging in to figure out if I'm on the right track or if I need some help getting this structured better.”\n05:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you're trying to design a system that aligns daily actions with deeper sources of meaning, using intentionality to foster a more meaningful life. The quote you're referencing serves as a great starting point, mapping out how thoughts lead to destiny.\n\nTo operationalize this, you could start by identifying key \"sources of meaning\" for individuals, such as moments that spark joy or creativity. Reflect on how these sources can be incorporated into daily actions and habits.\n\nYour framework could use reflective questions to prompt self-awareness:\n\nWhat activities make you feel most alive?\nWhen do you notice a sense of flow or joy?\nHow can you incorporate these moments into your daily life?\nTo address the tensions between \"shoulds\" and \"wants,\" you might emphasize:\n\nShifting actions from autopilot (external pressures) to intentionality (internal meaning).\nIdentifying and minimizing unconscious influences.\nStreamlining this approach involves:\n\nFocusing on high-leverage questions that reveal core values and patterns.\nEncouraging actions aligned with those values.\nIt sounds like you're exploring a powerful method to bring awareness to our daily choices, which is incredibly valuable. Keep refining your questions to ensure they resonate and inspire meaningful action!\n\n11:58\n\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, that sounds good, except I was looking to see if this is comprehensive. I'm wondering if, like, a coach or a psychologist may be able to tell me that I'm actually missing some fundamental elements that are critical for this, and we're trying to get people to basically come alive and be the best for themselves and for others. And I first of all want to, like, know, is it true that the world needs people that have come alive? Like, is that really all that you need, and what does it mean to come alive, you know, I think, to be sources of meaning is a way to really find what lights you up, and you'll have more energy, you'll have more commitments, you'll have more attention and focus and draw to do these things, but who knows if that will actually lead to a more possible and sustainable world. I think it's related to Plato's Golden Mean. Maybe there's a way of, like, really understanding the philosophical rigor here, and whether or not I'm just doing, like, a small thing that might help a little bit, or if I'm doing something that's actually transformational for individuals and for the planet, because I'm trying to let go of running a social enterprise accelerator and thinking I know what a better future looks like, and incentivizing entrepreneurs that work in the social space to reduce CO2 emissions or employ refugees, and instead thinking of, like, what if we just help people see who they are, what the world is, and feel really deeply about what makes them come to life and what they want to contribute in an authentic way, in this way reducing burnout and actually increasing authenticity and making the world more diverse, unique, and whole, because people are actually being what they are, like a tree that produces apples is going to be producing apples, and the worm that eats those apples is going to eat those apples, and the bird that eats the worm and the apples is going to poop some seeds somewhere and plant new trees and kind of, like, become this ecosystemic thing, but you don't have to think about the long consequences of your actions and monitor impact and measures. Instead, you have to think really deeply about what is coming around you right now in your field of vision, in your awareness, and as you grow and as you learn and as the world is getting more and more deeply interconnected, we will see refugees. We will see the burning that's happening in California. People will be doing the science, because there are people who come alive doing the science, and they're going to be telling us these stories, the journalists who are coming live, telling us the stories of how the science related to CO2 is related to the burning, and we will feel this care and this passion, and the people that live closest to the fires will tell the stories about how to best help those and will maybe transform how they work, and we don't need to kind of use governments and pressure and taxes and incentivize solar panels and tell people to go green and blame and judge, and instead, there's a different way, and I think this just might be a philosophically rigorous and psychologically sound way of helping more people come alive, and, you know, like, let's just keep this whole thing about sustainability, right? Like, consume less, right? Because they'll be more content. They'll actually connect their work with meaning, and what would happen if this planet had more content people on it? Like, it would be very interesting to do an economic study of contentedness.”\n11:58\n03:21\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour vision of helping people come alive and connect with their deeper sources of meaning is indeed comprehensive and philosophically rich. You're tapping into a powerful idea that aligns with the concept of eudaimonia, or flourishing, which is central to many philosophical traditions, including Aristotle's.\n\nThe idea that the world needs more people who are alive—engaged, passionate, and living authentically—resonates deeply. This state of being can lead to more sustainable and compassionate actions, creating a ripple effect that benefits society and the planet. It aligns well with the idea of contentment and reducing unnecessary consumption.\n\nTo ensure comprehensiveness, it might be helpful to consider:\n\nDiverse Perspectives: Include inputs from coaches, psychologists, and different cultural frameworks to ensure it resonates broadly.\nPractical Implementation: Develop tools or practices that help people identify and sustain these sources of meaning in their daily lives.\nMeasuring Impact: While it's less about rigid metrics, consider ways to observe and reflect on the transformation in individuals and communities.\nThe shift from focusing on specific outcomes (like reducing CO2) to nurturing authenticity and connection might be more sustainable and transformative. It's a beautiful and ambitious vision, and your approach could indeed be a profound way to foster individual and collective well-being. It's worth exploring further, perhaps through pilot programs or small groups to test and refine your ideas. Keep digging into these questions, and you might find a truly transformative path.\n\n12:03\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's something here as well, and I'd love to hear you explain Aristotle's eudaimonia concept and the concept of the golden mean and how they could relate. And also the idea that I have that is not very clear in how it could be true or how it could be false. Identify a critic of these ideas and a proponent of these ideas and have them discussed back before coming to a conclusion. And the idea that I want them to discuss is that they have a possibility to have a scalable, transformative world that is able to address these kind of thorny, interconnected VUCA problems by just paying attention to their context and their situation and their feelings and what makes them come to life and their sources of meaning. There's one way that I described, which is consentedness, that also reduces consumption, which is the core factor leading to the emissions of greenhouse gases and all of this stuff. And the other one is this idea that, you know, people will actually care. They'll love their planet. There's some people that will come to life nurturing nature, regenerating forests, and hearing these stories can be inspiring to us. The story of the Patagonia founder, the story of the person who planted a million trees, or the person who does these regenerative agroforestry projects, or feeds their communities with an urban farm in Detroit. And someone else might be inspired and love that and find their sources of meaning through this. But I don't want to direct people towards that. I want to direct people towards that process. And I guess the big element is this element of trust. And that would mean that, like, do I trust that the world is sort of self-consistent and that there are signals enough in the right places that if people are paying attention, that the signals will transform into truth that they see if they are, like, I don't know. It requires this kind of open curiosity and exploration of the world and, like, a little bit of an understanding of what's happening. Let's imagine that we didn't freak people out about climate change and we just told people to go live, you know, and see. And people would be like, oh, look at this degraded ecosystem. Like, it hurts me to see because next door I've seen these things that are beautiful, like, wonderful, green, lush places. Like, why isn't this like that? And then asking these questions and, like, feeling and being sensitive and then responding. I feel like there needs to be an element of education, but this element of exposure and seeing and maybe some people can really understand systems thinking and they have the capacity and the cognitive development to be able to do that. Some people are just kids and they need to be, you know, like, grown and be able to see and feel and do, see the world, see the truth, feel, care, find their sources of meaning in the way that they action and do something beautiful, do something about it. And then we need to empower people with resources, right? So, I'm really wondering if this is enough and, like, if that quote, like, I want you to ask me a couple of questions to help me discover for myself. And then maybe also give me a bunch of critics that would say that this is wrong. And why is it wrong? Rigorously and philosophically. Like, who out there in academia, who out there in, like, the lived experience, maybe, like, indigenous peoples or others or people that think that we have to really understand the world before fixing it and that we can measure change as important, like, all the people that are working in governments and such, trying to create incentives for people to have a life that is more sustainable and, yeah, come back to me with a list of questions and arguments that kind of contradict this idea that don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do that. And, you know, maybe there's two elements, right? It's like, ask what makes you come alive and go do that. In a way, that creates harmony. I don't know, like, does there need to be an addition to that quote or not? Is it good enough on its own if we trust the hearts of people?”\n12:03\n04:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAristotle's eudaimonia, often translated as \"flourishing\" or \"the good life,\" is about living in a way that fulfills one's potential and aligns with virtues. The Golden Mean is about balance—finding a middle ground between extremes, like courage being the mean between recklessness and cowardice.\n\nThese concepts can relate to your idea by emphasizing balance in living a meaningful life, one that’s in harmony with oneself and the world.\n\nTo explore your idea's strengths and weaknesses, here's a dialogue:\n\nProponent: \"Focusing on what makes us come alive can lead to genuine engagement and positive action. When people are deeply connected to their passions and sources of meaning, they naturally contribute in ways that benefit themselves and the world. Contentment can reduce consumption, and nurturing what brings joy can lead to sustainability.\"\n\nCritic: \"But what if individual passions don't align with collective good? Not everyone’s 'coming alive' might lead to positive outcomes, and focusing solely on personal joy could overlook systemic issues. We also need structural changes and collective action to address broader problems.\"\n\nProponent: \"True, but if individuals are more content and connected to their purpose, they might naturally work towards collective good. It's about fostering a deeper awareness and responsibility, which can lead to structural changes from a place of authenticity.\"\n\nCritic: \"Yet we can't ignore the need for external structures and incentives. Trusting that everyone will 'come alive' in a way that benefits the world might be idealistic. We need a balance of individual transformation and societal structures to ensure sustainable outcomes.\"\n\nTo sum up, your idea has the potential to be transformative but may need to be complemented with structural supports. The balance of individual authenticity and collective action could be the key.\n\nAs you explore this further, consider questions like:\n\nHow can we ensure individual passions align with collective good?\nWhat role do societal structures play in supporting or hindering this process?\nHow can we measure the impact of this shift in perspective on broader societal goals?\nYour approach is promising, blending philosophical depth with practical applications. Keep refining it, and it could indeed become a transformative force.\n\n12:09\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, you're right. Like, we can't trust that everyone's purpose and things that make them come alive will be the thing that will bring them to social and collective positive change. I mean, there are sociopaths, and so maybe what we need to do is include that data about how many people in the world are sociopaths.”\n12:09\n00:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful\n\n12:10\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n12:10\n00:01\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful consideration. Including data on different motivations and behaviors can help create a more robust system. It's important to recognize that while many people may find positive, socially beneficial purposes, there are also those who might not.\n\nBy acknowledging this diversity, you can design mechanisms that guide people towards constructive and positive actions, balancing individual growth with collective well-being. It\n\n12:10\n\nYou said:\nI know that one of the ancient philosophers had some of these ideas that, you know, people should find their place and the structure becomes a whole. I thought it was Plato, and I thought it had something to do with golden or middle. Can't really remember. Can you help me figure out what that was?\n12:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou might be thinking of Plato's idea of the \"ideal city\" in his work The Republic, or Aristotle's concept of the \"Golden Mean.\" Here's how they align with what you're describing:\n\nPlato and the Ideal City (The Republic)\nPlato argued that a harmonious society is one where everyone \"finds their place\" based on their natural abilities and virtues. He divided society into three classes:\n\nRulers (philosopher-kings): Govern based on wisdom.\nGuardians (soldiers): Protect based on courage.\nProducers (farmers, artisans, etc.): Provide goods and services based on their practical skills.\nIn this structure, individuals contribute to the whole according to their role, creating a just and unified society. Plato emphasized that justice arises when everyone fulfills their role without interfering in others' roles.\n\nAristotle's Golden Mean\nAristotle, a student of Plato, developed the idea of the Golden Mean, which is about finding balance or moderation between extremes. For example:\n\nCourage lies between recklessness and cowardice.\nGenerosity lies between wastefulness and stinginess.\nWhile the Golden Mean primarily applies to personal virtues, Aristotle also emphasized the importance of individuals living in accordance with their nature and contributing to the \"polis\" (community) for a flourishing society.\n\nConnecting the Dots\nIf you're thinking about \"people finding their place\" and a \"structure becoming a whole,\" Plato's ideal city seems to fit. If the \"golden\" part feels important, Aristotle's Golden Mean might resonate. Both philosophers explored how individuals and communities achieve harmony through balance and fulfilling their natural roles.\n\n12:18\n\nYou said:\nIs there another philosopher from antiquity or the, you know, the last couple of 2,000 years that talks about this strong, stable, and structured society when people were who they were meant to be, something like that? Who might be the philosopher that fits that category?\n12:18\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, several philosophers across antiquity and the last 2,000 years have explored the idea of a strong, stable, and structured society based on people fulfilling their purpose or role. Here are a few key figures who might align with what you're describing:\n\nConfucius (551–479 BCE) Confucius emphasized the importance of li (ritual and social order) and ren (virtue and benevolence) in creating a harmonious society. He argued that:\nA stable society depends on everyone fulfilling their roles within relationships (parent-child, ruler-subject, etc.).\nPeople thrive when they live in alignment with their moral duties and cultivate virtue.\nThis Confucian vision is about balance within a structured society, where each person contributes based on their position and responsibilities.\n2. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)\nAquinas built on Aristotle’s philosophy within a Christian framework. He argued that:\n\nSociety is structured around a divine hierarchy, with everyone having a God-given role.\nPeople fulfill their purpose through their roles, which ultimately lead to the common good and spiritual flourishing.\nAquinas saw harmony and stability as arising when individuals live according to both their natural and divine purpose.\n3. Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406)\nThe Islamic philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of societal rise and decline. His key ideas include:\n\nSocieties are held together by asabiyyah (social cohesion or solidarity).\nStability and prosperity depend on people contributing to the collective good within a structured hierarchy.\nIbn Khaldun emphasized how roles and cohesion contribute to a society's strength and longevity.\n4. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right and his broader dialectical framework discuss how:\n\nA stable society arises from the synthesis of individual freedom and social institutions.\nPeople find their true selves by contributing to a greater whole, especially through family, civil society, and the state.\nFor Hegel, the state is the ultimate realization of freedom and harmony when everyone fulfills their role within its structure.\n5. Alasdair MacIntyre (1929– )\nIn his modern work After Virtue, MacIntyre critiques contemporary individualism and champions a return to Aristotelian virtue ethics:\n\nA society thrives when people pursue their telos (purpose) within communities that share a common moral framework.\nHe emphasizes the importance of traditions and practices that give people meaningful roles within a stable social structure.\nWho Fits Best?\nFrom what you’ve described, Confucius or Ibn Khaldun might resonate most if you’re thinking about structured, cohesive societies based on natural or moral roles. If you're considering a Western tradition with a theological or metaphysical component, Aquinas or Hegel might fit. If you’re looking for a critique of modernity with a return to structured communities, MacIntyre offers a contemporary perspective.\n\n12:18\n\nYou said:\nCan you tell me more about Hegel and Alasdair? Did you have them debate with each other and other philosophers that might disagree with them and try to come up with a clarification of each of their ideas? Because what is Alasdair's idea of telos? What is the purpose? Share a common moral framework. What is that? And what would Charles Taylor say about all of this?\n12:19\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHegel, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Charles Taylor each present rich frameworks for understanding purpose, structure, and moral frameworks in society. Here’s an exploration of their ideas, potential debates, and clarifications:\n\nHegel’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in Hegel:\n\nFor Hegel, the telos (ultimate purpose) of humanity is freedom—not as individual independence, but as the realization of oneself within the context of the whole (family, civil society, and the state).\nHe believed history progresses dialectically, resolving contradictions to achieve greater unity and self-awareness. The state, in its ideal form, is the realization of this telos, where individuals are free because their roles align with the rational structure of society.\nMoral Framework:\n\nHegel argued that morality (individual conscience) must integrate with ethical life (Sittlichkeit), which includes family, civil society, and the state.\nThe state is not oppressive; it embodies rational freedom, where individual purposes align with collective purposes.\nAlasdair MacIntyre’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in MacIntyre:\n\nMacIntyre’s telos for humans is rooted in virtue ethics, drawn from Aristotle. Humans flourish by fulfilling their potential within practices (shared activities with intrinsic goods) and traditions (longstanding communities of meaning).\nTelos is tied to the notion of a “narrative unity of life,” where individuals see their lives as coherent, meaningful stories within the context of a community.\nCommon Moral Framework:\n\nMacIntyre argues that modernity has fragmented moral frameworks, leaving us with conflicting and incoherent moral languages (emotivism).\nHe advocates for a return to traditions (like Aristotelian or Thomistic virtue ethics) that provide shared understandings of the good life and human flourishing.\nDebates Between Hegel and MacIntyre\nOn Telos and Freedom:\n\nHegel: The state is the highest realization of human purpose, harmonizing individual freedom and collective good.\nMacIntyre: Human flourishing is tied to smaller communities and traditions, not an abstract state structure. He might see Hegel’s state as too grandiose or prone to suppressing individual moral traditions.\nOn Moral Frameworks:\n\nHegel: The rationality of ethical life arises organically from history and resolves itself in the state.\nMacIntyre: Moral coherence requires a return to traditions rooted in virtue and practices, not a state-driven rationality.\nCharles Taylor’s Perspective\nAgreement with Hegel:\n\nTaylor draws from Hegel’s ideas of the dialectic and the importance of self-realization through society. For Taylor, identity is formed in dialogue with others, and freedom is realized when individuals find themselves in alignment with the structures of society.\nHe would likely appreciate Hegel’s emphasis on modernity as a space for recognition—the idea that people flourish when their identities and contributions are affirmed by others.\nCritique of MacIntyre:\n\nTaylor shares MacIntyre’s concern about the fragmentation of modern morality but sees more value in the plurality of frameworks. He believes people can navigate between frameworks to construct meaningful lives.\nUnlike MacIntyre, who seeks a return to Aristotelian or Thomistic traditions, Taylor is more open to modern identity’s creative and adaptive possibilities.\nPoints of Contention\nHegel vs. MacIntyre on the Individual and the State:\n\nHegel: The state integrates individual purpose into collective rationality.\nMacIntyre: Large structures like the state erode traditions that are necessary for virtue and flourishing.\nTaylor vs. MacIntyre on Modernity:\n\nTaylor: Modernity offers unique opportunities for identity formation, even within fragmented moral landscapes.\nMacIntyre: Modernity’s fragmentation is a moral crisis, requiring a return to coherent traditions.\nTaylor vs. Hegel on Pluralism:\n\nHegel: History resolves into a unified rational framework (e.g., the modern state).\nTaylor: Modern societies must embrace pluralism and navigate tensions without expecting a final resolution.\nClarifications on Key Terms\nTelos (MacIntyre):\n\nThe telos is human flourishing, achieved through cultivating virtues within a tradition. Flourishing means leading a coherent life where one’s actions align with a meaningful narrative.\nCommon Moral Framework (MacIntyre):\n\nThis framework is rooted in shared traditions and practices. For example, the Aristotelian tradition sees virtues like courage, justice, and generosity as essential for the good life. MacIntyre sees modern individualism as eroding these frameworks.\nRecognition (Taylor):\n\nTaylor emphasizes recognition as key to human flourishing. Societies thrive when people are acknowledged for who they are, which fosters dignity and belonging.\nDebating Across Time\nAristotle might argue that Hegel overemphasizes the state and neglects the importance of smaller-scale communities.\nConfucius would critique MacIntyre for not fully appreciating how rituals and roles (e.g., family) create moral coherence.\nNietzsche would likely reject all three, arguing their views impose constraining moral frameworks instead of fostering true individual creativity.\nSynthesis\nIf these philosophers were to sit down together, the tension might lead to a broader understanding:\n\nHegel would push for the integration of individuals into rational, historical structures.\nMacIntyre would challenge the abstractness of such structures, advocating for local traditions and practices.\nTaylor would mediate, suggesting that modernity’s plurality offers opportunities for dialogue and synthesis rather than rigid returns to tradition.\nThis debate reveals that the \"purpose\" of society might not have a singular answer but depends on balancing freedom, tradition, and dialogue.\n\n12:20\n\nYou said:\nWhat would you say are domestic virtue ethics and Aristotelian virtue ethics and their definition of a good life? And then what is modern kind of European Union or the United Nations good life definition? Like what is the ethic behind that? You know, fundamental human rights and others, but like what are these ideas of the good life?\n12:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nDomestic Virtue Ethics (Confucian or Family-Centered Ethics)\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nDomestic virtue ethics, such as those emphasized in Confucianism or family-centered moral traditions, define the good life as harmonious relationships within a structured family and community system. The foundation is the belief that moral development starts in the family and radiates outward to society.\n\nCore Principles:\nRoles and Hierarchies: Each person has specific roles and duties (e.g., parent, child, sibling) that guide behavior.\nVirtues: Key virtues include filial piety (respect for parents and elders), loyalty, benevolence, and propriety.\nHarmony and Stability: A good life means maintaining balance and fulfilling obligations within relationships, ensuring both personal and collective flourishing.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic is deeply relational and role-based. Individuals find meaning through their responsibilities and contributions to the group, prioritizing stability, respect, and harmony over individual autonomy.\n\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nAristotle’s concept of the good life (eudaimonia, often translated as flourishing) is the full realization of human potential through the cultivation of virtues and rational activity in alignment with one's purpose (telos).\n\nCore Principles:\nVirtues as Habits: The good life requires cultivating virtues like courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom through practice and moderation (the Golden Mean).\nPractical Wisdom (Phronesis): Rationality and moral insight guide actions, enabling individuals to make wise decisions in specific contexts.\nCommunity and Politics: Humans are social beings (zoon politikon), so flourishing occurs within a just political community where individuals contribute to the common good.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic emphasizes individual moral development in harmony with the community. Flourishing is achieved through the active cultivation of virtues that align personal and societal well-being.\n\nModern European Union and United Nations Framework\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nThe good life in modern frameworks, such as those of the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN), centers on universal human dignity, equality, and the fulfillment of fundamental rights and opportunities. It balances individual freedoms with collective well-being.\n\nCore Principles:\nHuman Rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) underpins this ethic, emphasizing freedom, security, education, health, and participation as fundamental.\nEquality and Non-Discrimination: The good life is one where everyone, regardless of background, has equal access to opportunities.\nSustainability and Global Responsibility: Modern frameworks include environmental ethics, emphasizing the right to a healthy planet and intergenerational justice.\nAgency and Self-Determination: Individuals should have autonomy to pursue their goals, provided they do not harm others.\nEthic Behind It:\nThis ethic is rooted in liberalism and cosmopolitanism, focusing on individual freedom, fairness, and global solidarity. It rejects rigid hierarchies and aims to balance rights with collective obligations to create inclusive, sustainable societies.\n\nComparing the Good Life Across Frameworks\nFramework    Focus    Definition of Good Life    Ethic\nDomestic Virtue Ethics    Family and social harmony    Harmonious relationships, fulfilling roles    Relational and duty-bound; prioritizes stability and respect over autonomy.\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics    Virtue cultivation and rationality    Flourishing through virtues and rational activity    Balanced between individual development and societal contribution.\nModern EU/UN Framework    Individual rights and global responsibility    Universal dignity, freedom, and equality    Liberal and cosmopolitan; emphasizes autonomy, fairness, and sustainability.\nTensions and Debates\nIndividual vs. Collective Good:\n\nDomestic and Aristotelian ethics often prioritize the community, while modern frameworks emphasize individual autonomy and rights.\nVirtues vs. Rights:\n\nVirtue ethics sees moral character as central to the good life, while modern frameworks focus on institutional guarantees like rights and freedoms.\nUniversalism vs. Particularism:\n\nModern frameworks are universalist (e.g., all humans have the same rights), while domestic and Aristotelian ethics are more contextual and embedded in specific traditions.\nSustainability and Environment:\n\nThe modern good life includes sustainability, a relatively new focus absent from classical virtue ethics or family-based traditions.\nCharles Taylor’s View on the Good Life\nTaylor, in works like Sources of the Self, argues that modernity fragments moral frameworks, making it harder to define the good life. He suggests:\n\nThe good life arises from authenticity—living in alignment with one’s deeply held values.\nWhile he appreciates the pluralism of modernity, he warns against the flattening of moral horizons (e.g., reducing the good life to materialism or individualism).\nHe might critique the UN/EU framework for focusing on procedural rights without addressing the deeper question of what truly fulfills human beings.\nKey Takeaway\nThe good life is a deeply contested concept that shifts depending on philosophical, cultural, and historical contexts. Each framework—domestic, Aristotelian, and modern—offers a unique vision, with ongoing tensions around autonomy, community, and sustainability. The debate challenges us to consider how to reconcile individual flourishing with collective responsibility.\n\n12:23\n\nYou said:\nIt kind of makes sense to me, the Confucian idea of roles, not necessarily the hierarchies, but we all have roles that we play in the world. And I also like this idea of MacIntyre's idea that stories, right? And that we kind of have our, we're within a culture, right? And so meaning-making needs to connect with a, you know, your individual story and what makes life meaningful for you. But also to like tell the story of the world. And I think that this is an important thing, is like, what is the story of me and what’s my developing and unfolding story of the world and my role in it and these things may help connect with sources of meaning for instance what if you didn’t know about a war and weren’t able to petition your gov to open borders to refugees and bring in a family - that might be incredibly meaningful for you and you’d have to have knowledge of the world to know and know how to do that what about amartya sen how would he respond to all this - The good life, really, it seems like no one really has a very clear idea about what it means to lead and live a good life. I think the idea of authenticity, living in alignment with one's deeply held values, makes sense to me from Taylor. Tensions and debates. Collective good versus individual good. I think it's really important, that tension here. And maybe it's kind of resolved with these stories of the world and stories of the self. Virtues versus rights. Universalism versus particularism. It's definitely very particular because what makes this person's right action in that right moment is definitely related to their self-understanding and understanding of the world. And this idea that there's a moral dimension of grappling with competing values. And I think it's really important to have knowledge of impact. So, let's say there's somebody trying to make a decision about sexual contact. And they have agreements with their partner that this is totally fine for them to have sexual contact outside of their relationship in this polyamorous situation. But they still have a sense that their partner, if they knew, would be hurt. Should they tell them because they have this open policy? Or should they hide what they're doing, leading to some tensions? And how do you know what the right thing to do is in that situation? And you can grapple with it and you can try different ways and you can have different experiences. But you don't know how the other person will respond. And then I kind of feel like there's just the right thing to do and this idea of the most beautiful. And so the good life should be good. And we should kind of be developing an aesthetic taste for our sort of morality. It's like what is not just the good life but what is the beautiful life? And the narrative is how you make it coherent. You talk about, okay, so I'm like this. These are what I really love and value and want to see in the world. And the world is like that. And this is how I am a part of that larger story. And I find my authenticity by realizing that my authenticity is kind of defining myself in a big story. Not just a small story of self but self and world. And that this idea of it kind of definitely connects with this Muslim intuition that like everything is a sign. Everything in the horizons outside of the world is a sign of the most merciful God. And that this most merciful God is telling the most beautiful story through the creation and through existence. And it's really our hands that lead to corruption. And we are oppressing ourselves when we are going against our values. And we do these things for various reasons. There's different forces that block this. This is why like the tawheed element, like this idea of unity is so important. Because this like concept of unity and the way that it's described in the Muslim tradition is ihsan. It's like first you just do the actions. You pray. You fast. You have all of the pillars of Islam. And then iman. You believe these things. That God is writing the most beautiful story in the most perfect book. And that everything is in his total and ultimate control. And his name of al-Rahman, the most merciful, is the thing that encompasses everything. And so our like position, if we really believe these things, we think, okay, well I have free will. And I can either align with the most beautiful story and figure out how does mercy for the worlds, which is what the guide for humanity is supposed to be, the prophet of Islam, Muhammad ﷺ. And so he is a mercy to the worlds. He is our ultimate example. So we should be aspiring to be mercy to the worlds. And so there's the merciful who's created everything. He's given us free will. And he's created destiny. And we are here to be a part of telling that most merciful story and opening the channel inside of us to the light of the most merciful divine God's actions through our submitting of our will to that most beautiful story. Does that make sense? And so we see the world. We understand. We try to be creative in telling our most beautiful component of our story. Like what is our role in this unfolding? A tree as it elegantly traces a path towards the sky and the roots that go in this way searching for water is following the commands of God essentially. And it's following its innate beingness. And this is its fitrah, F-I-T-R-A. And this is how that tree becomes beautiful. Because it is what it is without trying to be anything other than that because it has no free will. It follows its fitrah naturally. And the fitrah is the innate state. And so everyone loves babies. Sure, a baby will cry. But no one is like, it's crying to annoy me. It's crying because. And we lose touch with this ability to just be and to see our emotions and to act and respond in the world. And I think this like spontaneity and this is why there's a relationship with Wu Wei and choiceless action from Taoism. And I think there's the important element though that I'm coming to now maybe for the first time is these like multiple interweaving stories. You can think of them sort of like holograms, right? So a hologram has everything outside and everything inside. And you tell the story, self-consistent, totally about yourself, about how you see someone hurting and you feel moved to go and do something about it. Or you want to create a joyous and loving and harmonious home for your wife. So you go and you bake some bread. And this is a artistic creative act in the world where you try to understand. Like not only do I want to make bread. I want to understand what my wife loves and make that because that will make like more joy and more beauty. And that kind of to me is a story about who I am and how I want to show up in the world and what I am attending to when I'm making choices about my day and my actions. And so like all these frameworks talk about things in a very theoretical way. And one of the nice things about modernity is it kind of like really emphasize these ideas of productivity and to-do lists and turned our days into routines. And we see the machinery of the operations of life more clearly now. But there's a point of intervention where we can pierce through the mundane and touch the spiritual and ethical, moral, artistic process of becoming that leads us to fulfilling the ultimate destiny that would make us the happiest person on earth the day we meet our doom, our death. And that's living who we were meant to be and fulfilling our role in the most beautiful story. And that's a creative process. That's not something you could just pop out of the womb and start doing. That requires like knowledge of self. That requires knowledge of the world. And as these things grow and develop, you see that there's this element of oneness that is really critical. Like you're telling two stories that merge that become one story of a creation of beauty. It's not just like looking within and introspection and looking without and being like, okay, well, the world has problems. Okay, what resources do I have? And like trying to figure out how to solve them. And this also addresses the need for like scalable good, right? You don't have only this like, okay, I'll look within. Don't ask what the world needs. That's what makes you come to life. It's like don't ask what the world. Ask what the world is. Ask what makes you come to life. And then be the most like beautiful, creative person in telling a story that puts all this together into oneness, which is the act of Tawheed. And so I kind of see things through the Islamic frame, but I think that all of these philosophers can kind of agree when we look at it this way. Can you help like align this in a table and show where they agree and where they disagree and what a kind of unified framework for the good life and what actions are, what virtue is, what morality is, what creative ethics are, what beauty is, and what meaning is, and what God is, and what the soul is, and what the body is for all these philosophers. And what the community is and what the roles are for society as well.\n12:23\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThis is a profound synthesis of ideas from philosophy, spirituality, and modern ethical frameworks. I'll attempt to align these perspectives into a unified framework for the good life while addressing the points you raised about virtue, morality, creativity, beauty, meaning, God, the soul, the body, community, and society’s roles.\n\nBelow is a table that captures the key ideas and points of agreement and divergence among the perspectives of Islamic philosophy, Aristotle, MacIntyre, Amartya Sen, Charles Taylor, Confucianism, and modern frameworks (e.g., UN/EU).\n\nCategory    Islamic Philosophy (Tawheed/Ihsan)    Aristotle (Virtue Ethics)    MacIntyre (Virtue & Narrative Ethics)    Amartya Sen (Capabilities Approach)    Charles Taylor (Authenticity & Pluralism)    Confucianism (Role Ethics)    Modern Frameworks (UN/EU Rights)\nGood Life    Aligning with the oneness of God (Tawheed), acting as a channel for mercy and beauty in the world, fulfilling one’s fitrah.    Eudaimonia: Flourishing through cultivating virtues, fulfilling rational potential in community.    Living a coherent narrative within a tradition that integrates personal and collective flourishing.    Expanding freedoms to do and be what one values; ensuring opportunities for well-being and agency.    Living authentically in alignment with deeply held values, connected to community and recognition.    Harmonious relationships and fulfilling one’s roles in the family and society for collective harmony.    Realizing human rights, equality, sustainability, and well-being, balancing freedom with responsibility.\nVirtue    Ihsan: Excellence in action, reflecting God’s mercy and beauty; virtues like justice, generosity, and patience.    Courage, justice, temperance, wisdom, cultivated through the Golden Mean and practical wisdom.    Virtues embedded in cultural traditions, contextualized by narrative meaning and shared practices.    Agency, self-determination, empathy, and capabilities to create meaningful lives.    Virtues emerge through dialogue between individual values and cultural traditions, enabling authenticity.    Filial piety, benevolence, and propriety as relational and role-based virtues.    Respect, fairness, equality, and responsibility toward others and the environment.\nMorality    Submission to God’s will and aligning actions with divine commands for justice and mercy.    Practical reasoning guides moral choices; actions balance individual and collective well-being.    Morality as living well within traditions that give coherent meaning to life.    Morality focuses on enabling individuals to achieve capabilities and freedoms.    Grappling with competing values in pluralistic societies while staying true to personal authenticity.    Moral order arises from fulfilling obligations within familial and societal roles.    Rooted in universal human rights and laws, ensuring freedom, dignity, and justice.\nCreativity    Reflecting divine creativity by acting as a vessel for mercy, beauty, and light in the world.    Creative action lies in aligning one’s potential with virtues to enhance self and community.    Creativity is embedded in traditions, enabling meaningful, flourishing lives.    Creative solutions expand freedoms and address inequities in the world.    Creativity arises from reconciling internal values with external conditions, forging new paths authentically.    Creativity is harmonizing personal actions with the collective good, fostering societal balance.    Innovation drives progress while respecting human dignity and environmental limits.\nBeauty    Living in harmony with the divine story, expressing mercy and unity through actions and creations.    The aesthetic of the good life emerges from the harmony of virtues and rational activity.    Beauty arises from coherence in life’s narrative and the flourishing of self and community.    Beauty is connected to justice and equity, where lives are enriched through freedom and opportunity.    Beauty is in authenticity: living a meaningful and unique life that contributes to collective understanding.    Harmony and balance in relationships and roles create societal beauty.    Beauty is secondary to rights and equality but emerges in equitable, sustainable societies.\nMeaning    Meaning comes from knowing one’s role in the divine story and embodying mercy and unity.    Meaning is rooted in fulfilling one’s purpose (telos) as a rational and social being.    Meaning comes from living a story aligned with one’s community and tradition.    Meaning is tied to the ability to shape one’s life through freedom and opportunity.    Meaning arises through reconciling internal values with external recognition and cultural dialogue.    Meaning emerges from fulfilling roles and responsibilities, contributing to societal harmony.    Meaning is tied to universal human dignity, freedom, and self-determination.\nGod    The ultimate source of mercy, unity, and beauty; creator of the fitrah and the divine story.    Aristotle’s God is the Unmoved Mover, the ultimate cause and aim of all rational activity.    MacIntyre focuses on tradition and virtue but incorporates Aquinas’ view of God as ultimate telos.    Often silent on metaphysics, focusing instead on human flourishing and justice in the material world.    God is a cultural and spiritual horizon shaping individual authenticity and meaning.    Confucianism does not focus on a deity but on Tian (heaven) as the moral order guiding virtuous life.    Secular frameworks avoid God, emphasizing human dignity and universal rights.\nSoul    The soul is the eternal essence, aligning with fitrah and God’s mercy through submission and action.    The rational soul seeks virtue and truth, achieving fulfillment through intellectual activity.    The soul is embedded in a narrative tradition, developing through virtues and shared meaning.    Often left undefined; focuses instead on human dignity and material conditions for flourishing.    The soul is the source of self-expression and authenticity, formed through dialogue and recognition.    The self is relational and defined by roles; emphasis is on virtue and harmony rather than metaphysical soul.    Secular focus on human potential and dignity, avoiding metaphysical definitions of the soul.\nBody    A vessel for enacting mercy, beauty, and worship in the physical world.    The body must be cared for and aligned with rational activity to achieve virtue.    The body is a medium for enacting virtues and fulfilling one’s role in the narrative of life.    The body’s health and freedoms are essential for exercising capabilities and achieving well-being.    The body is part of one’s authentic self, shaped by cultural and personal practices.    The body participates in relational roles, following rituals and fulfilling duties to maintain harmony.    The body has rights to health, safety, and dignity, protected through laws and policies.\nCommunity    The ummah (global Muslim community) fosters collective mercy and responsibility for justice and equity.    Community is essential for flourishing, providing a space for practicing virtues and rationality.    Communities ground traditions that guide individuals in developing virtues and meaning.    Community ensures opportunities and freedoms, enabling collective well-being.    Community is a space of recognition where individuals form identity and meaning.    Community is the foundation of harmony; individuals contribute by fulfilling their roles and duties.    Community ensures equal rights, freedoms, and participation, fostering inclusion and sustainability.\nRoles in Society    Individuals are channels for mercy, contributing to collective beauty and justice in their unique capacities.    Roles align with virtues and rationality, contributing to the common good and flourishing.    Roles are defined by traditions, providing meaning and moral grounding for individuals.    Roles ensure equal opportunity and access to resources, enabling people to thrive.    Roles are self-determined but shaped by recognition within cultural and societal structures.    Roles are relational and hierarchical, contributing to collective harmony and stability.    Roles protect rights and ensure equity, balancing freedoms with societal responsibility.\nUnified Framework for the Good Life\nThe Good Life: The integration of individual and collective flourishing through virtue, freedom, and harmony.\nAction and Virtue: Virtues arise from alignment with one’s inner purpose (fitrah or telos) and outward contributions to the community.\nStory and Meaning: The good life is a coherent narrative where self, community, and the divine or universal story align.\nBeauty and Creativity: Life becomes beautiful when actions reflect inner virtues and contribute to the collective good.\nUnity and Interdependence: All actions, relationships, and creations converge toward a greater oneness, whether divine (Islamic Tawheed) or communal (Confucian harmony, Aristotelian polis).\nThis synthesis ties individual authenticity and agency to the larger story of a beautiful, unified world.\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nUpdating the Framework to Incorporate Attention, Sources of Meaning, and Productive Tensions\n\nTo integrate your ideas—\"thoughts lead to actions,\" sources of meaning, and attentional policies—into the philosophical perspectives and

Oliver) ties closely with identifying sources of meaning. This expands the philosophical frameworks by adding intentional focus as the mechanism for aligning actions with purpose.\nTensions as Signals: Productive tensions between sources of meaning (e.g., baby’s laughter vs. creative work) act as signals for integrating priorities into harmonious higher-order actions.\nSources of Meaning as Anchors:\n\nFramework Application: Sources of meaning (e.g., joyful conversation, creativity, nature) become touchstones for reflection, guiding people toward authentic action.\nPracticality and Scalable Insights: A streamlined process of identifying and acting on these sources connects philosophical ideals to everyday practices.\nStory as a Bridge Between Individual and World:\n\nSelf and World in Harmony: The unified framework emphasizes storytelling as a way to integrate personal authenticity with collective narratives. This reframes tensions between individual and collective good into opportunities for co-creation.\nEvaluating Critics and Complementary Tools:\n\nCritics of Autonomy-Driven Models: Critics argue that relying solely on personal meaning might neglect structural inequalities and broader responsibilities. This highlights the need to combine personal transformation with systemic awareness.\nComplementary Philosophical Tools: Incorporating Sen’s emphasis on capabilities and Taylor’s focus on recognition ensures the framework respects diverse experiences and conditions.\nActionable Takeaways for Operationalizing the Framework:\nCheck-Ins for Attentional Focus: Design tools for quick reflection on where attention flows, identifying sources of joy, tension, and flow.\nPersonalized Questions: Use reflective prompts like, “What makes you come alive?” and “What sources of meaning are present or absent today?”\nStory-Crafting Tools: Enable individuals to map their personal and collective stories, integrating self-awareness with their context.\nEducational Interventions: Create experiences that expose people to global stories and systemic issues, fostering informed and compassionate action.\nNext Steps:\nTest the framework through pilot programs, integrating check-ins and attentional prompts.\nRefine reflective tools to ensure they address tensions and guide intentional growth.\nEvaluate the framework’s capacity to foster scalable, systemic impact by combining personal and collective flourishing.\nAll right. So today we're going to be doing a new version of the Sudi cast, which is going to be a podcast today about a framework that I've been working on. and essentially I've been realizing that there are these different things that I'm very drawn towards. Like Taoism, you know?  And this idea oh, it's it's still definitely gonna pick that up. Yeah. There's two micropophones. you see uh's outside a minor yours.  Okay, so today on this edition of theud cast, we're gonna be going through a framework that I've been developing. and it's sort of a I'm beginning to come to an understanding of why I've been having so many tensions within the social entrepreneurship ecosystem and why SDG's don't really excite me so much. And I think it's because I think one of the real crises that we have is a crisis of meaning and that if more people were connected to their sources of meaning, we would find, you know, well, first of all, healthier people, um less police needed. uh more beauty in the world. And there are these different pressures that I think lead people to behaving in ways where they don't inspire themselves or each other.  And these could come from what some people call false beliefs. They could come from um patterns of uh trauma or difficulties in their childhood or difficulties in the world. Pressures from jobs that force them to wear ties, for instance, or force them to you know, work in a certain way.  Like, you know, we could even think about people about think that the only opportunity they have is prostitution, right? That's the thing. Um, that happens in many places in the world.  And um I've been reflecting on the kind of Muslim perspective of, you know, like what is the name of God that wants to shine through you, right? And I realize, like, it'slam, it's sort of gives us this realization that the whole world is under the command of the most merciful, right? And one of the things that we have to believe in as Muslims is the fact that everything is already written and that we actually harm ourselves with our quote unquote sins or bad actions.  We're not harming anyone else. And we have free will. Like these are all things that somehow in a dynamic interplay are related.  And so I I started to think like the the realization is it's your choice whether to use your free will to play that most beautiful part and the most beautiful story that God has predetermined. And you know that by checking in with your heart, right? Are you feeling, you know, as the prophet says, the good is clear and the bad is clear and what's in the middle makes your heart shake, so leave it, but the good is clear when you can see the most beautiful, mostquote moral, ethical action, you actually have this moment of, of course, that's so beautiful, you know?  And you humbly submit to the most beautiful story that's being written now through you and the names of God that want to happen and manifest through you in that time. And I've been looking at Joe Edelman's work and thinking about his framework for emotions to values, like we talked about the heart shaking and you can think of that it's like an emotion or feeling a sense of beauty and that's also kind of an emotion. And well, you can try to put and so I've been trying to piece these things together because I realize, like, are like values and sources of meaning are often connected to moments of presence and often connected to what, you know, I see as like the only reality, which is this very moment, you know, where you can be.  And that's it's this uh place where we can have that like, how do I want to show up, not what do I want to get? So it's like, how do you want to be in the only place you're alive, what qualities of being? How do you want to show up in the world in a way that is meaningful to you versus how do you want to protect yourself from poverty?  protect yourself from shame and protect yourself from loss, you know? Some people are really afraid to lose loved ones, and so they never love. They never allow themselves the beautiful, most meaningful experience possible to really, truly love and be loved by someone because they're so afraid of loss, right?  And so that loss isn't in the moment. That loss is a projection. It's in an unreality.  It doesn't exist, right? It's in the future. And so the framework that I'm trying to do is to get people to reflect and try to compile the things that bring them to life, the things that connect them to their sources of meaning, and of course, like when you look at it and you think the names of God flowing through somebody is what brings them to life.  Yeah, that's the spirit. You know, you can use Christian language. The spirit flowing through you, right?  And yeah, that's that's what the heart can do. The heart is able to turn towards the spirit and we can also purify the self, right? And so the way that I am trying to make this something to do on a day-to-day basis and get more people to live a day where at the end of the day, they can be proud that they were who they wanted to be.  They showed up and came alive. They submitted to the beauty that wants to flow through them, the name that wants it to activate that day. And I just use it to do list because in the to-do list, you have to say what you want to do or what you have to do and when you have to prioritize, you have to know what is meaningful for you.  Like, do I do this or do I do this? And if they compete, how do you figure it out? And so the simplest process, I think, in my like exploration right now to have people navigate this creative action of asking themselves, what would make today feel complete?  What's something I can do today that would bring me to life? How can I show up in a way that is beautiful? I think is just to look at what you already have on your to-do list, the projects that you already have in play and to prioritize.  And in that prioritization, you're going to feel some tension, for instance, should I hang out with my baby? What should I do this? Like, should I ignore my wife and hyoph focus on my thing or tell her what I'm working on and have her like work with me and actually be able to sort of share more.  And maybe even use the process and try to coach her rather than just like coaching Pascal or data and or not or what I used to do, which is touch no one at all, even though when I looked at my sources of meaning, I know that it's connecting with people and getting out of my head, but I realized that my pattern that was blocking me was I feel like I need to have something clear, smart, intelligence to share before I do that. And so I hyperfix it on making things better and better and better because I have low self-esteem and I only feel like I'm allowed other people's attention if I'm good, if I made something amazing. Like, look at this app I made.  Now can you talk to me? I'm good, you know? And it wasn't until I saw that pattern and I realized it's not how I want to live, that I was like, okay, daughter, do you have time tomorrow?  And just shared whatever I had. Not perfect. But I know that it's a safe space. as well that's the other thing.  You have to understand yourself in your limitations. Like I didn't go and try to get like pitc to Ted, you know, or to like, or whatever. I I took a place that's very safe for me, data, safer than even my wife, you know, sometimes.  I know appreciates me. I love you. thank you. you did with that long enough, you might have some uh, you know some other patterns. Yeah, and so the fundamental elements that we're looking for during that conversation are patterns. and two different kinds of patterns.  That's it. One pattern is one two things that you would do in and of themselves for themselves, like quality time with my wife, you know? massaging her and seeing go back.  Why are we looking for parents? Um, because these are the patterns that actually show up as tensions in your um prioritization, when you look at your to-do list and you're like, yeah, I want to do that, but when you look back at it to do list and you never do it. Like, why?  For instance, like, I really want to write blogs, but I have low self-esteem, but I didn't know I have low self-esteem. And that pattern comes from feeling like I need to have something worth sharing and that pattern leads me to continually improve things. And so that's assuming that prioritization is difficult.  That, yes. Is that? Yes, sometimes because even when two things are very meaningful for you, like, you want to have a secure financial situation, uh, you want to provide safety for your child, but you also want your child to have a diverse experience and connect with people from different cultures and different values.  And that means, like, I can't do that at the same time. At least that's what you think, right? And so that those are two competing sources of meaning for you.  Um It's like something really meaningful and you do anyway, uh, but they can conflict. So even it's not just, oh, it's because you have low self-esteem and you have this negative pattern. I guess I could put it as like competitive desires, competitive Competing Competing it can happen in ways.  It can be competing desires or blocked desires. So competing is like I love my baby, but I also need to work, so I'll leave my baby at the nanny to go work and the solution is to find a nanny that's loving so that, you know, and there's maybe uh this idea of finding a way um maybe spending more time with the baby when you can or giving real quality event, whatever the solution is, but the the two competing things are loving your baby and also loving your curiosity and exploring the world and whatever your work is. And then the blocking desires are usually connected to frustrations, so the negative emotions are connected to the blocking desires.  Well, also frustration would be connected to competing values. But like a blocking desire could be, I'm afraid of poverty and so I can't actually live my life that I want to live. You see?  So that's a blocking. And in in the framework, I called these two different types of things. They're competing in the blocked?  That's a good one. It's easier to say than what I was about to say. Go ahead I call one sources of meaning and I call the other forces, oh sorry, um pressures of doing.  So the block desires are the related to emotions and to block blockage of doing? Yeah, that's too complicated. Pressures of doing.  So is like you can it as and must, you think of I'm actually not sure I got it right. fuels on paper that competing desires is more about the other thing you just said. So we have different elements, right? You either have things you do for their own sakes, living your values.  Okay? Here's one thing. Living your values.  That's sources of meaning. The other thing is somehow I don't have that anywhere. trying to get to some logic, but it's really complex. Well, because I told all of this is the backstory.  This is the framework. There's stories of meaning. I' sorry, sources of meaning, which are your values, which are the things you do because you love, right?  And it's the thing that you wouldn't do anything other than that. Like you wouldn't change things of life, right? It's your values.  Then there's the other one, which is one way of using using words is calling it instrumental. It's for something. It's to protect you, you know, you don't do it because you want to have low self-esteem or you you want to have like fear of poverty or whatever.  It's either protecting you or a pressure that's external from like needing to meet your base Masow hierty of needs and thinking that the only way to what constitutes the competing desires if you have like things that are related to your values and things are just need to be done? Yeah, it need to be done, which I call precious for doing, but what I'm trying to say is that even the things that are your values can compete with each other, time with your wife, time with your baby, time that you love at work, and time with my family far away. Like, I love all these things and they don't always come together, and so I have tension there.  So I have negative emotions, even when my values are competing. So you can count values and pressures. Pressures does not seem to relate to meaning.  It's more like something that doesn't feel so they both need to be done then. There's no values put needs to be meaning. needs to be is not, I would say pressures. It can be internal pressure.  It could be external pressure. It could be like a real pressure about like you have like you think you have to work in this way to be able to support this stuff that matters for you. But it's the the way to really say it is it's instrumental.  These are the things that your values. You just live because it's the it's the good life. It's a source of meaning.  These are the things you do because you have to because you think this is what's needed or this is how you can stay safe or this is what has to happen. And they can be conscious and they can be even unconscious. And so these canete with each other, the values, right?  So there's the have two and the one too. Yeah. The values can compete with each other.  Even the one twos can compete, right? they can it can be between these two and between themselves. Exactly.  So those are the two things. And that emerges from that or patterns. And from that emerges patterns.  Yeah. That's what I call a pattern as a pattern of behavior, that could be something beautiful, that you actually appreciate, you know, uh, or not. Like, and and usually the pattern is connected to some emotions that connect to it, right?  So? And there's feelings inside of them. And you know them through feelings. emotion is feelings.  And we find all of these things and stories so the person will share a story necessarily and that's how you find them. But that's not important right now. We can we can still just keep it on the models.  So when you find one of these patterns and you show it to somebody, like for me, once I start realizing like, why do I hyperfixate so much and I realize that what I what I really would love to do is be more like vulnerable and courageous and show up with what I have and ask be curious what other people uh will say and get real feedback and but instead I kind of protect myself and do what I find and you know, some of it is coping mechanisms, right? You don't want the negative experience. And so it's an instrument.  That's why I call it instruments. It's like a screwdriver to turn a nail. You use a coping mechanism to avoid the negative feeling.  And so you're using it for something, you don't do the coping like I don't hyperfix it because this is what I how I want to show up in the world or I'mitting my values. I hyperfixate sometimes because I'm comfortable here and sharing with somebody who's like,B, I don't get it. I think I got it wrong.  Like needs don't make sense, you know? It won't make me feel bad, make me feel stupid. And those things are emotions that I don't wanna experience.  And so I avoid it, even though that's where my growth is, that's where reality is, that's where that's where I want to be, potentially. It's like be after that once there's clarity and connection and the things that I want in my life. But instead of getting that, I view the coping mechanism of staying up at until like midnight coding something that no one ever uses.  Anyway, so that's just example from my life that I found out using my tool, using this framework that we're developing. So there's very few pieces. Me and you.  And so there's very few pieces. The pieces are one, my values, the ways that I will be without instrumentation, like just how I want to be, what I think is a beautiful way of showing up. um and they can compete with each other. And then there's ways I have to be, either because that's how I think the world works or a story that I tell myself or uh kind of, I'm a coping mechanism or something where it's trying to get me to do something that I care about, but it's blocking it, you know?  You're like, okay, I care about safety for my baby. You know, I want my baby to have beautiful life and comfort and like these are the things that you you value. Like you would do because it's the right thing, the beautiful thing to do, But because you believed this idea that the best way to do that is sustain your job, then this becomes an instrument.  You're using your job to create something that you value. It's not an end in and of itself. Does that make sense?  That's why this is stuff you do because you want to be there and stuff that you feel like you have to I want to be in ways I have to be essentially. Yeah. Yeah.  Ways I want to be. ways I have to be. And and want to be is the like what I call sources of meaning or connected to uh, and when you become in these ways, you have, and like my languages, this experience of beauty, because you're letting the name of God that wants to flow through, you flow through you because this is how it connects to the um the spiritual uh element and the metaphysical element. And then once you find a pattern, you want to find one of the other elements is how to break the pattern, which I call supports.  So you have ways you want to be, ways you don't want to be, how they interact that's called patterns and supports. One second. It's uh still confusing.  So first we have ways I want to be. which sources of meaning and beaut connected to values, and the ways I would be without instrumentalization. Then we have ways I have to be that's related to external or internal pressures. And then you said a bunch of things I didn't really get.  But you used them to an end. We use what? You use the ways you have to be so for instance, like I use my coping mechanism of hyperating so I don't feel the pain.  So I use the ways I have to be to uh fulfill the ways I want to be. Yeah, or to avoid Avoid negative experience. Native emotions.  So And to avoid negative erotions, okay? Yeah, emotions or consequences. Yeah. negativity. uh and you can think of like some of this being related to some people call false beliefs.  But that's not that we don't need to bring in this idea of false beliefs just yet. But the idea of false beliefs, like, for instance, if I share this with Dara, she will think I'm stupid. It's false belief.  It has to be perfect. So I'm going to keep working. It has to be perfect, right?  So what? in your framework It's a false belief reinforces Okay, so that's an internal pressure. But it's it's reinforced by that.  And so the way that we can deconstruct the internal pressures are by the supports. So the third element is supports. And you can identify your supports through finding attention identified finding any like a negative emotion patterns?  Yeah, through the patterns Through patterns and their feelings. Yeah, you find the pattern first three feelings usually You find them through the feelings Usually, yeah. feelings leading to patterns Yeah, maybe we should put feelings first, but I don't know, because these two turn into patterns that you find two feelings. But those are the objects inside of the framework, if you will. leading to um Parents P, thank you.  Okay, so I think we can stop here already to have the basis because these are the three elementary. There's there another one, like a main one and the emotions are important because that's how you find the pattern and their important part of like the problem actually be number three because this is all like a projection like in the future, I have to be where I want to be. but what about now how you feel? I think this is actually you feelings are like basically the idea is you go on your check in because you first find the feelings, the patterns and then you find the supports.  So if we put finger back in order, maybe it should be a third element. Yeah, that could be in the diagram, like these numbers like they don't you don't have to erase everything and rewrite it, you know? I am trying to make sense of things..  And so yeah, your feelings point to patterns and in the way that I'm thinking about doing it is you go through your to-do list and um the first part of to check in is like how are you feeling? um what's your energy level? What would make today like feel complete or help you come alive?  Do you have any blockers or challenges? And then when you start talking about those things over time will identify both your sources of meaning and your pressures for doing or what did you call it? ways you have to be.  Yeah. And the the interesting thing is, just clarifying the patterns is a big deal, you know? Because at some point, you're going to have to say, yeah, I know I'm like, when I was checking out, I was telling it like, yeah, I just spent the whole day coding, I know it's not what I want to do. blah, blah, blah, and I just felt ashamed of myself like here I am again.  And I was like, the easiest thing to do is to ask for some support. And and the support has three ways that you can identify it. One as you think of role models.  What would Jesus do? Yeah, what what would somebody do that? I really appreciate how they are in the world for you for sure.  You went to bed and just before I. I was so you. Yeah. Maybe we should be more quiet.  Yeah. So one is role models, the other does that helps you figure out your supports. Like, let's say you found this tension.  You could say, okay, what would Doug song do, you know? Or or someone that you admire, that you admire for this specific context and situation, you know? And then the other one is how have you handled this tension in your past?  Do you have a way of being that you can remember when you were brave and courageous and not afraid of poverty, you know? Do you remember a time whereists in the past succeeded? Thank you. succeeded.  And then another one is if I can get to a point of no tension, what would the most beautiful right thing to do be? That's the creative graveling. Okay, that's super blurery.  Can you say that again? Can you say it again? imagine the most beautiful way of acting.  Can you just repeat what you said? Because didn't even get the sentence. It doesn't matter.  Just imagine just write this one. imagine what the most beautiful way of acting could be. So one is looking at other people stories two is looking at your own histories of stories, and three is creating something new. the thing imagine what? Imagine the most beautiful way of being with no consequences.  Something like that, you know? And I guess the most beautiful. That's how I was in the most beautiful way of being.  Way of way ofing, sure. Okay, so let's start here. So it's like story of others, story of self, creative news story.  Does that make sense? New story? Yeah.  And I think that's the majority of it. The other parts of the framework are supporting, like we want to gather the stories, right, and collect them. I think in a way it's also like looking at others looking at yourself, but also looking at God because like in in what exactly and what would be the most beautiful way of responding, you're obviously going to be inspired by what you have learned and with culture, your environments, so yeah, exactly.  What would be the most merciful, gentle, kind, beautiful. And this is where this is where I think ethics is an art form. you know And so so that's essentially a. And the idea is like, you're the coaching in the beginning will gather as many of these stories as possible to find out what how you love to be in the world.  And then how you look at a few of your patterns and tensions so that you know what's happening. And then give you access to this chat bot that will basically know all of those things and then help you look at your to-do list for those patterns. rewind gather stories and then what you gather stories of all these things and you create um these like sources of meaning, these like, you give them names, you know, the like how do you create sources of meaning? So let's say you look at the stories. similies the stories you, but what we are this is why I keep asking you like, what do you pay attention to?  Because attention is connected to presents. You know, we talked about presents being the only place that's alive, right? And so when you're sitting there with a baby and you're holding the baby, and you're not thinking about tomorrow, you're not thinking about getting this like I'm holding the baby so that he grows up healthy and becomes smart and gets rich and can take care of me when I retire.  You're holding the baby because that's a way of being that you love being, that you youret. It's not an instrument. It's it's the value, right?  And when you're in that moment, you're attending to the softness of a skin, you're like sensing. You're noticing how he's looking at you. You're appreciating a moment of togetherness.  And then so you could just write those things down because attention and presence are very, very connected. And so that's where we are going to understand what matters about those places. So to know your values not the places, the stories.  To know your valueues, you look for what the person is paying attention to during that story. identify what matters to you in these moments is that correct what they pay attention to in that story. Yeah. I don't I don't know.  I don't about the word It's like the paying attention. When I'm in presence, I don't pay attention. I'm justending to.  What do you noticing? Super broad. Exactly.  Because we're trying to take the particular and make it general. So it's like I notify what present to what you what you Because let's say that you have a consciousness. What are the things that are getting that you you're noticing in that moment is the things that are meaningful about it.  You know? You ignore everything else. And when you like for instance, I asked Pascal what he really liked about um a way of being when he was at work and he was like, you know, I was like getting hugs.  And uh I I asked him like what he really values about why, uh he's doing that. He's like, well, because it creates spaces that are homey and warm. So he's noticing the warmth and the hominess, places where people are giving gifts.  And so that's like, uh moments that are uh opportunities for generosity and, you know, you can find in the the first part of the attention is what you're paying attention to. So it needs to be a noun needs to be a thing, like a moment or a space or a opportunity or a yeah, things like that. And then when you know that, like, I started realizing how like yeah, so this is this is like the attention part.  And the thing is you pay different kind of attention here. You in the um I have to be or what I call uh pressures of doing is like opportunities to hide and avoid criticism, you know. And so that's what you're paying attention to.  You're looking for that that way that you can avoid criticism. It's like Yeah, like uh if I the ways I have to be, for example, if I if I try to understand this correctly, uh, I have to keep my job and stay here. uh because it's safe and familiar and easy. Yeah.  So you're looking you're seeking uh conditions that sustain familiarity. And stability. Yeah, conditions that maintain stability.  Things like this, right? Like, you're paying attention to different things. Like you might not think of it that way. you frame it just slightly differently, but we're trying to, and it's really important actually the important to have a consistent structure because when you have something that says moments where I can be with uh my wife and deep connection or some something like that.  And moments um where I'm with my family uh enjoying nature. You know, I think than two moments conflict question that I might relate to better is what are the characteristics of that moment? Yeah, and how do you know those characteristics about what you pay attention to?  Yeah, yeah, but I would pay attention. I I don't know. It's like what characteristics are, and then I will write them down as attentional policies, what you're paying attention to.  I would write what that. But the thing is if I said that, I don't think you would say the softness of his skin or not. I wouldn't think about it.  But is that something that you are attending to in that moment? Just censorially, I think you are? Yeah.  And yeah, that's why we need to write it out. But I where I was not consciously paying attention to it in that words. But if I ask you to reflect on it?  Could you of a wide picture of what was happening. What was the environment like the characteristics. And then I ask you to deepen into all of these things.  What did you feel? What were you paying attention to, what do you notice, you know? And then we write those things out?  So I guess we can ask about characteristics. It might help some people, we can ask what they're attending to Pascal didn't have a problem with it. Data didn't have a problem with it.  But for you, maybe I can ask characteristics. And so you're right, like coming up with different language to get at this, but the reason why it's important to have it be consistent is I can show you how it showed up for me, um because there are these ways of once you write them like that, you can say, how does this attentional policy block that one? And then you can see, oh, this moment is taking the time from that moment, you know, and it's literal moments, which is the temporal thing.  And then you can actually like see it uh and and and so on. So once you like extract these uh, you know, what we're calling ways of paying attention or things that people are attending to in moments of meaning, you can give it a title, you know? If you want, I can show you some examples from from mine.  I think I want to rest, actually, because I don't know how much longer we have until Sunni wakes up and I this is taking a lot of brain energy. Okay. I also haven't done any reflection on the name on the name.  Okay, you can do that. ask you ask me why I feel like I have to do this now. sort of how I ask my interesting. Because I think a lot of my life right now is I have to not I want to. How can you transform the name thing?  How can you see differently to I don't know. How do we inter service question? How do I even think about it?  How do you deal with people like me who are like tired? Well, maybe that's what it is. It's like, my competing forces, you know, or competing desires like I' the rest and another part of me is like, I want to like work on my spiritual growth.  I want to better myself, you know? And I want to do meaningful things and this is meaningful, but I'm tired and there all of diapers to clean and there's always going to be things to do. Okay, so that that just need to happen.  It's it sounds like going out because it's sunny and this is rare, you know? Well, if it was spring, it could be like go out into the sun and lie down in the grass, but it's not. And but that's like the creative part.  It's like, maybe what you really need and is just simplest thing is to rest knowing that if you rest, you'll be able to get to this more, you know, the better state and you'll actually be able to have that spirit insight you're looking for. And if you don't rest, you don't. And so resting is a part of your spiritual practice.  So it's not prioritizing. Yeah, and recon reconstructing the stories. So it's not just what matters to you.  It's just also what you need and to be present to your state. Yeah, I was talking about state earlier. It's like you so get you yourself into the state, but it's also there's intention here.  That way when you go to sleep right now, quickly. you realize that it's a part of your spiritual process. It's not taking away time from it. You're actually spending thirty minutes of nap spiritually. and really knowing that even be a moment of connection if you came in beside me a bit.  That's the creative ethical, like artistic ethics that I'm talking about. You wanna do it over here now? This is the closest sun that we got., see?  Now look, you see what I'm talking about, dear?\n\nreview all the content and identify the best methodology of presenting the core ideas in the most clear way and actionable for people to use and come up with a framework and coaching method and worksheet of what to collect\nmake a mermaid diagram for all the processes"

            "extracted_content": "“So I'm trying to operationalize a system that leads with this quote that goes, thoughts lead to actions, actions lead to habits, habits lead to character, and character leads to destiny. And to map it with attentional policies that are about the sources of meaning. So like the thing that we pay attention to and a sentence that describes it. So for instance, moments where there's light-hearted and joyful conversation, or spaces where people can express their colors and creativity, or sunsets where the sky turns many colors. Or I don't know, things like that. Joe Edelman's values framework, because I really think that there's a way of understanding that source of attention and sources of meaning as a connection with the things that make us come alive. And it reminds me, and I'm pairing that with the quote, like, don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive, and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people that have come alive. And I'm working on this assumption that our coming alive comes through our daily actions, our to-do lists, our habits, and what we do on a day-to-day. When we can use that to identify moments where we are either coming alive or not coming alive. And that's what I would like to do with a quick check-in. And when we're not coming alive, there's tension or negative emotions. And we can use the process of all of our emotions are trying to tell us something. And actually, the idea that everything is always talking to us and trying to tell us something. And it's either tension, and that means that there are different things that we're trying to attend to at the same time that are incommensurate. We want to attend to our baby's laugh and presence with us at the same time as we're trying to attend to crafting a philosophy of action and growth that is philosophically rigorous and intellectually stimulating and creative and fun. And what I'm doing right now, my baby's over there, but I have these two tensions. And so how can we do these things together? And I guess I could talk it out to my baby and pretend that he can understand, actually bring him into the process. And so that creative, productive framing of how can I find a higher level action or things to attend to that will be able to address the underlying conflicts in the sources of meaning. And I call the other thing pressures of doing. So neither internal or external. So they could be norms or other things that are not really on the conscious level, just things that you do because that's what people do. I got a job, or I do this, or I do that. And I got to get to work. Why do you gotta, gotta, gotta? And so it's like the shoulds and the want-tos in our lives, I think, is another way of thinking about these things. When you have a bunch of shoulds, you can think that they're probably a bunch of instrumental things or things that are unconscious or things that are beyond our choice and intention. So the idea is to move more of our actions into the place of intentionality and into a place where we can actually be connected to our sources of meaning and flow. And even if they're like sleep or things that are very practical with good intentions, you can always find a way of connecting these things. And I think that's a really important thing to do because so many people are just like living on autopilot. And so I think there's something about this that I'm really trying to figure out to see if I have everything, if I have full coverage onto the human condition, or if I'm missing some fundamental things about other reasons why people might get stuck or not live the way that they want to live. And if I'm missing things that would be important to add in this framework, or is this useful enough? And then what are the important parts to save, right? Should we only save the sources of attention for all of the meaningful things, or should we save the story? Does the story actually have some special sauce that's gonna be important? Because in the future, I just want to save the minimal subset of things that's gonna be really helpful for the person and not like absolutely everything, like the pressures and the tensions and how they relate and like every single bit of resource that the person has from like a laptop to a friend that they can call and then what is their relationship? And then what is the, you know, that gets to be too huge. I'm trying to come up with like a very streamlined, very elegant, high leverage thing that actually puts the mirror pointing at the person and asks them questions about those fundamental resources like relationships and others, but doesn't even have to necessarily say the word relationships. Like what has helped you in the past? Think of stories, situations, contexts, like large abstract words like that so that people can reflect and be like, oh, you know what? I really loved it when I had the support of my friends on jobs because I'm just way better in a pair programming process. And then we can derive like new sources of meaning and new ways for that person to live their values. And I'm really just need some questions and some digging in to figure out if I'm on the right track or if I need some help getting this structured better.”\n05:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you're trying to design a system that aligns daily actions with deeper sources of meaning, using intentionality to foster a more meaningful life. The quote you're referencing serves as a great starting point, mapping out how thoughts lead to destiny.\n\nTo operationalize this, you could start by identifying key \"sources of meaning\" for individuals, such as moments that spark joy or creativity. Reflect on how these sources can be incorporated into daily actions and habits.\n\nYour framework could use reflective questions to prompt self-awareness:\n\nWhat activities make you feel most alive?\nWhen do you notice a sense of flow or joy?\nHow can you incorporate these moments into your daily life?\nTo address the tensions between \"shoulds\" and \"wants,\" you might emphasize:\n\nShifting actions from autopilot (external pressures) to intentionality (internal meaning).\nIdentifying and minimizing unconscious influences.\nStreamlining this approach involves:\n\nFocusing on high-leverage questions that reveal core values and patterns.\nEncouraging actions aligned with those values.\nIt sounds like you're exploring a powerful method to bring awareness to our daily choices, which is incredibly valuable. Keep refining your questions to ensure they resonate and inspire meaningful action!\n\n11:58\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, that sounds good, except I was looking to see if this is comprehensive. I'm wondering if, like, a coach or a psychologist may be able to tell me that I'm actually missing some fundamental elements that are critical for this, and we're trying to get people to basically come alive and be the best for themselves and for others. And I first of all want to, like, know, is it true that the world needs people that have come alive? Like, is that really all that you need, and what does it mean to come alive, you know, I think, to be sources of meaning is a way to really find what lights you up, and you'll have more energy, you'll have more commitments, you'll have more attention and focus and draw to do these things, but who knows if that will actually lead to a more possible and sustainable world. I think it's related to Plato's Golden Mean. Maybe there's a way of, like, really understanding the philosophical rigor here, and whether or not I'm just doing, like, a small thing that might help a little bit, or if I'm doing something that's actually transformational for individuals and for the planet, because I'm trying to let go of running a social enterprise accelerator and thinking I know what a better future looks like, and incentivizing entrepreneurs that work in the social space to reduce CO2 emissions or employ refugees, and instead thinking of, like, what if we just help people see who they are, what the world is, and feel really deeply about what makes them come to life and what they want to contribute in an authentic way, in this way reducing burnout and actually increasing authenticity and making the world more diverse, unique, and whole, because people are actually being what they are, like a tree that produces apples is going to be producing apples, and the worm that eats those apples is going to eat those apples, and the bird that eats the worm and the apples is going to poop some seeds somewhere and plant new trees and kind of, like, become this ecosystemic thing, but you don't have to think about the long consequences of your actions and monitor impact and measures. Instead, you have to think really deeply about what is coming around you right now in your field of vision, in your awareness, and as you grow and as you learn and as the world is getting more and more deeply interconnected, we will see refugees. We will see the burning that's happening in California. People will be doing the science, because there are people who come alive doing the science, and they're going to be telling us these stories, the journalists who are coming live, telling us the stories of how the science related to CO2 is related to the burning, and we will feel this care and this passion, and the people that live closest to the fires will tell the stories about how to best help those and will maybe transform how they work, and we don't need to kind of use governments and pressure and taxes and incentivize solar panels and tell people to go green and blame and judge, and instead, there's a different way, and I think this just might be a philosophically rigorous and psychologically sound way of helping more people come alive, and, you know, like, let's just keep this whole thing about sustainability, right? Like, consume less, right? Because they'll be more content. They'll actually connect their work with meaning, and what would happen if this planet had more content people on it? Like, it would be very interesting to do an economic study of contentedness.”\n11:58\n03:21\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour vision of helping people come alive and connect with their deeper sources of meaning is indeed comprehensive and philosophically rich. You're tapping into a powerful idea that aligns with the concept of eudaimonia, or flourishing, which is central to many philosophical traditions, including Aristotle's.\n\nThe idea that the world needs more people who are alive—engaged, passionate, and living authentically—resonates deeply. This state of being can lead to more sustainable and compassionate actions, creating a ripple effect that benefits society and the planet. It aligns well with the idea of contentment and reducing unnecessary consumption.\n\nTo ensure comprehensiveness, it might be helpful to consider:\n\nDiverse Perspectives: Include inputs from coaches, psychologists, and different cultural frameworks to ensure it resonates broadly.\nPractical Implementation: Develop tools or practices that help people identify and sustain these sources of meaning in their daily lives.\nMeasuring Impact: While it's less about rigid metrics, consider ways to observe and reflect on the transformation in individuals and communities.\nThe shift from focusing on specific outcomes (like reducing CO2) to nurturing authenticity and connection might be more sustainable and transformative. It's a beautiful and ambitious vision, and your approach could indeed be a profound way to foster individual and collective well-being. It's worth exploring further, perhaps through pilot programs or small groups to test and refine your ideas. Keep digging into these questions, and you might find a truly transformative path.\n\n12:03\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's something here as well, and I'd love to hear you explain Aristotle's eudaimonia concept and the concept of the golden mean and how they could relate. And also the idea that I have that is not very clear in how it could be true or how it could be false. Identify a critic of these ideas and a proponent of these ideas and have them discussed back before coming to a conclusion. And the idea that I want them to discuss is that they have a possibility to have a scalable, transformative world that is able to address these kind of thorny, interconnected VUCA problems by just paying attention to their context and their situation and their feelings and what makes them come to life and their sources of meaning. There's one way that I described, which is consentedness, that also reduces consumption, which is the core factor leading to the emissions of greenhouse gases and all of this stuff. And the other one is this idea that, you know, people will actually care. They'll love their planet. There's some people that will come to life nurturing nature, regenerating forests, and hearing these stories can be inspiring to us. The story of the Patagonia founder, the story of the person who planted a million trees, or the person who does these regenerative agroforestry projects, or feeds their communities with an urban farm in Detroit. And someone else might be inspired and love that and find their sources of meaning through this. But I don't want to direct people towards that. I want to direct people towards that process. And I guess the big element is this element of trust. And that would mean that, like, do I trust that the world is sort of self-consistent and that there are signals enough in the right places that if people are paying attention, that the signals will transform into truth that they see if they are, like, I don't know. It requires this kind of open curiosity and exploration of the world and, like, a little bit of an understanding of what's happening. Let's imagine that we didn't freak people out about climate change and we just told people to go live, you know, and see. And people would be like, oh, look at this degraded ecosystem. Like, it hurts me to see because next door I've seen these things that are beautiful, like, wonderful, green, lush places. Like, why isn't this like that? And then asking these questions and, like, feeling and being sensitive and then responding. I feel like there needs to be an element of education, but this element of exposure and seeing and maybe some people can really understand systems thinking and they have the capacity and the cognitive development to be able to do that. Some people are just kids and they need to be, you know, like, grown and be able to see and feel and do, see the world, see the truth, feel, care, find their sources of meaning in the way that they action and do something beautiful, do something about it. And then we need to empower people with resources, right? So, I'm really wondering if this is enough and, like, if that quote, like, I want you to ask me a couple of questions to help me discover for myself. And then maybe also give me a bunch of critics that would say that this is wrong. And why is it wrong? Rigorously and philosophically. Like, who out there in academia, who out there in, like, the lived experience, maybe, like, indigenous peoples or others or people that think that we have to really understand the world before fixing it and that we can measure change as important, like, all the people that are working in governments and such, trying to create incentives for people to have a life that is more sustainable and, yeah, come back to me with a list of questions and arguments that kind of contradict this idea that don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do that. And, you know, maybe there's two elements, right? It's like, ask what makes you come alive and go do that. In a way, that creates harmony. I don't know, like, does there need to be an addition to that quote or not? Is it good enough on its own if we trust the hearts of people?”\n12:03\n04:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAristotle's eudaimonia, often translated as \"flourishing\" or \"the good life,\" is about living in a way that fulfills one's potential and aligns with virtues. The Golden Mean is about balance—finding a middle ground between extremes, like courage being the mean between recklessness and cowardice.\n\nThese concepts can relate to your idea by emphasizing balance in living a meaningful life, one that’s in harmony with oneself and the world.\n\nTo explore your idea's strengths and weaknesses, here's a dialogue:\n\nProponent: \"Focusing on what makes us come alive can lead to genuine engagement and positive action. When people are deeply connected to their passions and sources of meaning, they naturally contribute in ways that benefit themselves and the world. Contentment can reduce consumption, and nurturing what brings joy can lead to sustainability.\"\n\nCritic: \"But what if individual passions don't align with collective good? Not everyone’s 'coming alive' might lead to positive outcomes, and focusing solely on personal joy could overlook systemic issues. We also need structural changes and collective action to address broader problems.\"\n\nProponent: \"True, but if individuals are more content and connected to their purpose, they might naturally work towards collective good. It's about fostering a deeper awareness and responsibility, which can lead to structural changes from a place of authenticity.\"\n\nCritic: \"Yet we can't ignore the need for external structures and incentives. Trusting that everyone will 'come alive' in a way that benefits the world might be idealistic. We need a balance of individual transformation and societal structures to ensure sustainable outcomes.\"\n\nTo sum up, your idea has the potential to be transformative but may need to be complemented with structural supports. The balance of individual authenticity and collective action could be the key.\n\nAs you explore this further, consider questions like:\n\nHow can we ensure individual passions align with collective good?\nWhat role do societal structures play in supporting or hindering this process?\nHow can we measure the impact of this shift in perspective on broader societal goals?\nYour approach is promising, blending philosophical depth with practical applications. Keep refining it, and it could indeed become a transformative force.\n\n12:09\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, you're right. Like, we can't trust that everyone's purpose and things that make them come alive will be the thing that will bring them to social and collective positive change. I mean, there are sociopaths, and so maybe what we need to do is include that data about how many people in the world are sociopaths.”\n12:09\n00:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful\n\n12:10\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n12:10\n00:01\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful consideration. Including data on different motivations and behaviors can help create a more robust system. It's important to recognize that while many people may find positive, socially beneficial purposes, there are also those who might not.\n\nBy acknowledging this diversity, you can design mechanisms that guide people towards constructive and positive actions, balancing individual growth with collective well-being. It\n\n12:10\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI know that one of the ancient philosophers had some of these ideas that, you know, people should find their place and the structure becomes a whole. I thought it was Plato, and I thought it had something to do with golden or middle. Can't really remember. Can you help me figure out what that was?\n12:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou might be thinking of Plato's idea of the \"ideal city\" in his work The Republic, or Aristotle's concept of the \"Golden Mean.\" Here's how they align with what you're describing:\n\nPlato and the Ideal City (The Republic)\nPlato argued that a harmonious society is one where everyone \"finds their place\" based on their natural abilities and virtues. He divided society into three classes:\n\nRulers (philosopher-kings): Govern based on wisdom.\nGuardians (soldiers): Protect based on courage.\nProducers (farmers, artisans, etc.): Provide goods and services based on their practical skills.\nIn this structure, individuals contribute to the whole according to their role, creating a just and unified society. Plato emphasized that justice arises when everyone fulfills their role without interfering in others' roles.\n\nAristotle's Golden Mean\nAristotle, a student of Plato, developed the idea of the Golden Mean, which is about finding balance or moderation between extremes. For example:\n\nCourage lies between recklessness and cowardice.\nGenerosity lies between wastefulness and stinginess.\nWhile the Golden Mean primarily applies to personal virtues, Aristotle also emphasized the importance of individuals living in accordance with their nature and contributing to the \"polis\" (community) for a flourishing society.\n\nConnecting the Dots\nIf you're thinking about \"people finding their place\" and a \"structure becoming a whole,\" Plato's ideal city seems to fit. If the \"golden\" part feels important, Aristotle's Golden Mean might resonate. Both philosophers explored how individuals and communities achieve harmony through balance and fulfilling their natural roles.\n\n12:18\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nIs there another philosopher from antiquity or the, you know, the last couple of 2,000 years that talks about this strong, stable, and structured society when people were who they were meant to be, something like that? Who might be the philosopher that fits that category?\n12:18\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, several philosophers across antiquity and the last 2,000 years have explored the idea of a strong, stable, and structured society based on people fulfilling their purpose or role. Here are a few key figures who might align with what you're describing:\n\n1. Confucius (551–479 BCE)\nConfucius emphasized the importance of li (ritual and social order) and ren (virtue and benevolence) in creating a harmonious society. He argued that:\n\nA stable society depends on everyone fulfilling their roles within relationships (parent-child, ruler-subject, etc.).\nPeople thrive when they live in alignment with their moral duties and cultivate virtue.\nThis Confucian vision is about balance within a structured society, where each person contributes based on their position and responsibilities.\n2. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)\nAquinas built on Aristotle’s philosophy within a Christian framework. He argued that:\n\nSociety is structured around a divine hierarchy, with everyone having a God-given role.\nPeople fulfill their purpose through their roles, which ultimately lead to the common good and spiritual flourishing.\nAquinas saw harmony and stability as arising when individuals live according to both their natural and divine purpose.\n3. Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406)\nThe Islamic philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of societal rise and decline. His key ideas include:\n\nSocieties are held together by asabiyyah (social cohesion or solidarity).\nStability and prosperity depend on people contributing to the collective good within a structured hierarchy.\nIbn Khaldun emphasized how roles and cohesion contribute to a society's strength and longevity.\n4. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right and his broader dialectical framework discuss how:\n\nA stable society arises from the synthesis of individual freedom and social institutions.\nPeople find their true selves by contributing to a greater whole, especially through family, civil society, and the state.\nFor Hegel, the state is the ultimate realization of freedom and harmony when everyone fulfills their role within its structure.\n5. Alasdair MacIntyre (1929– )\nIn his modern work After Virtue, MacIntyre critiques contemporary individualism and champions a return to Aristotelian virtue ethics:\n\nA society thrives when people pursue their telos (purpose) within communities that share a common moral framework.\nHe emphasizes the importance of traditions and practices that give people meaningful roles within a stable social structure.\nWho Fits Best?\nFrom what you’ve described, Confucius or Ibn Khaldun might resonate most if you’re thinking about structured, cohesive societies based on natural or moral roles. If you're considering a Western tradition with a theological or metaphysical component, Aquinas or Hegel might fit. If you’re looking for a critique of modernity with a return to structured communities, MacIntyre offers a contemporary perspective.\n\n12:18\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nCan you tell me more about Hegel and Alasdair? Did you have them debate with each other and other philosophers that might disagree with them and try to come up with a clarification of each of their ideas? Because what is Alasdair's idea of telos? What is the purpose? Share a common moral framework. What is that? And what would Charles Taylor say about all of this?\n12:19\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHegel, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Charles Taylor each present rich frameworks for understanding purpose, structure, and moral frameworks in society. Here’s an exploration of their ideas, potential debates, and clarifications:\n\nHegel’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in Hegel:\n\nFor Hegel, the telos (ultimate purpose) of humanity is freedom—not as individual independence, but as the realization of oneself within the context of the whole (family, civil society, and the state).\nHe believed history progresses dialectically, resolving contradictions to achieve greater unity and self-awareness. The state, in its ideal form, is the realization of this telos, where individuals are free because their roles align with the rational structure of society.\nMoral Framework:\n\nHegel argued that morality (individual conscience) must integrate with ethical life (Sittlichkeit), which includes family, civil society, and the state.\nThe state is not oppressive; it embodies rational freedom, where individual purposes align with collective purposes.\nAlasdair MacIntyre’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in MacIntyre:\n\nMacIntyre’s telos for humans is rooted in virtue ethics, drawn from Aristotle. Humans flourish by fulfilling their potential within practices (shared activities with intrinsic goods) and traditions (longstanding communities of meaning).\nTelos is tied to the notion of a “narrative unity of life,” where individuals see their lives as coherent, meaningful stories within the context of a community.\nCommon Moral Framework:\n\nMacIntyre argues that modernity has fragmented moral frameworks, leaving us with conflicting and incoherent moral languages (emotivism).\nHe advocates for a return to traditions (like Aristotelian or Thomistic virtue ethics) that provide shared understandings of the good life and human flourishing.\nDebates Between Hegel and MacIntyre\nOn Telos and Freedom:\n\nHegel: The state is the highest realization of human purpose, harmonizing individual freedom and collective good.\nMacIntyre: Human flourishing is tied to smaller communities and traditions, not an abstract state structure. He might see Hegel’s state as too grandiose or prone to suppressing individual moral traditions.\nOn Moral Frameworks:\n\nHegel: The rationality of ethical life arises organically from history and resolves itself in the state.\nMacIntyre: Moral coherence requires a return to traditions rooted in virtue and practices, not a state-driven rationality.\nCharles Taylor’s Perspective\nAgreement with Hegel:\n\nTaylor draws from Hegel’s ideas of the dialectic and the importance of self-realization through society. For Taylor, identity is formed in dialogue with others, and freedom is realized when individuals find themselves in alignment with the structures of society.\nHe would likely appreciate Hegel’s emphasis on modernity as a space for recognition—the idea that people flourish when their identities and contributions are affirmed by others.\nCritique of MacIntyre:\n\nTaylor shares MacIntyre’s concern about the fragmentation of modern morality but sees more value in the plurality of frameworks. He believes people can navigate between frameworks to construct meaningful lives.\nUnlike MacIntyre, who seeks a return to Aristotelian or Thomistic traditions, Taylor is more open to modern identity’s creative and adaptive possibilities.\nPoints of Contention\nHegel vs. MacIntyre on the Individual and the State:\n\nHegel: The state integrates individual purpose into collective rationality.\nMacIntyre: Large structures like the state erode traditions that are necessary for virtue and flourishing.\nTaylor vs. MacIntyre on Modernity:\n\nTaylor: Modernity offers unique opportunities for identity formation, even within fragmented moral landscapes.\nMacIntyre: Modernity’s fragmentation is a moral crisis, requiring a return to coherent traditions.\nTaylor vs. Hegel on Pluralism:\n\nHegel: History resolves into a unified rational framework (e.g., the modern state).\nTaylor: Modern societies must embrace pluralism and navigate tensions without expecting a final resolution.\nClarifications on Key Terms\nTelos (MacIntyre):\n\nThe telos is human flourishing, achieved through cultivating virtues within a tradition. Flourishing means leading a coherent life where one’s actions align with a meaningful narrative.\nCommon Moral Framework (MacIntyre):\n\nThis framework is rooted in shared traditions and practices. For example, the Aristotelian tradition sees virtues like courage, justice, and generosity as essential for the good life. MacIntyre sees modern individualism as eroding these frameworks.\nRecognition (Taylor):\n\nTaylor emphasizes recognition as key to human flourishing. Societies thrive when people are acknowledged for who they are, which fosters dignity and belonging.\nDebating Across Time\nAristotle might argue that Hegel overemphasizes the state and neglects the importance of smaller-scale communities.\nConfucius would critique MacIntyre for not fully appreciating how rituals and roles (e.g., family) create moral coherence.\nNietzsche would likely reject all three, arguing their views impose constraining moral frameworks instead of fostering true individual creativity.\nSynthesis\nIf these philosophers were to sit down together, the tension might lead to a broader understanding:\n\nHegel would push for the integration of individuals into rational, historical structures.\nMacIntyre would challenge the abstractness of such structures, advocating for local traditions and practices.\nTaylor would mediate, suggesting that modernity’s plurality offers opportunities for dialogue and synthesis rather than rigid returns to tradition.\nThis debate reveals that the \"purpose\" of society might not have a singular answer but depends on balancing freedom, tradition, and dialogue.\n\n12:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat would you say are domestic virtue ethics and Aristotelian virtue ethics and their definition of a good life? And then what is modern kind of European Union or the United Nations good life definition? Like what is the ethic behind that? You know, fundamental human rights and others, but like what are these ideas of the good life?\n12:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nDomestic Virtue Ethics (Confucian or Family-Centered Ethics)\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nDomestic virtue ethics, such as those emphasized in Confucianism or family-centered moral traditions, define the good life as harmonious relationships within a structured family and community system. The foundation is the belief that moral development starts in the family and radiates outward to society.\n\nCore Principles:\nRoles and Hierarchies: Each person has specific roles and duties (e.g., parent, child, sibling) that guide behavior.\nVirtues: Key virtues include filial piety (respect for parents and elders), loyalty, benevolence, and propriety.\nHarmony and Stability: A good life means maintaining balance and fulfilling obligations within relationships, ensuring both personal and collective flourishing.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic is deeply relational and role-based. Individuals find meaning through their responsibilities and contributions to the group, prioritizing stability, respect, and harmony over individual autonomy.\n\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nAristotle’s concept of the good life (eudaimonia, often translated as flourishing) is the full realization of human potential through the cultivation of virtues and rational activity in alignment with one's purpose (telos).\n\nCore Principles:\nVirtues as Habits: The good life requires cultivating virtues like courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom through practice and moderation (the Golden Mean).\nPractical Wisdom (Phronesis): Rationality and moral insight guide actions, enabling individuals to make wise decisions in specific contexts.\nCommunity and Politics: Humans are social beings (zoon politikon), so flourishing occurs within a just political community where individuals contribute to the common good.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic emphasizes individual moral development in harmony with the community. Flourishing is achieved through the active cultivation of virtues that align personal and societal well-being.\n\nModern European Union and United Nations Framework\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nThe good life in modern frameworks, such as those of the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN), centers on universal human dignity, equality, and the fulfillment of fundamental rights and opportunities. It balances individual freedoms with collective well-being.\n\nCore Principles:\nHuman Rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) underpins this ethic, emphasizing freedom, security, education, health, and participation as fundamental.\nEquality and Non-Discrimination: The good life is one where everyone, regardless of background, has equal access to opportunities.\nSustainability and Global Responsibility: Modern frameworks include environmental ethics, emphasizing the right to a healthy planet and intergenerational justice.\nAgency and Self-Determination: Individuals should have autonomy to pursue their goals, provided they do not harm others.\nEthic Behind It:\nThis ethic is rooted in liberalism and cosmopolitanism, focusing on individual freedom, fairness, and global solidarity. It rejects rigid hierarchies and aims to balance rights with collective obligations to create inclusive, sustainable societies.\n\nComparing the Good Life Across Frameworks\nFramework\tFocus\tDefinition of Good Life\tEthic\nDomestic Virtue Ethics\tFamily and social harmony\tHarmonious relationships, fulfilling roles\tRelational and duty-bound; prioritizes stability and respect over autonomy.\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics\tVirtue cultivation and rationality\tFlourishing through virtues and rational activity\tBalanced between individual development and societal contribution.\nModern EU/UN Framework\tIndividual rights and global responsibility\tUniversal dignity, freedom, and equality\tLiberal and cosmopolitan; emphasizes autonomy, fairness, and sustainability.\nTensions and Debates\nIndividual vs. Collective Good:\n\nDomestic and Aristotelian ethics often prioritize the community, while modern frameworks emphasize individual autonomy and rights.\nVirtues vs. Rights:\n\nVirtue ethics sees moral character as central to the good life, while modern frameworks focus on institutional guarantees like rights and freedoms.\nUniversalism vs. Particularism:\n\nModern frameworks are universalist (e.g., all humans have the same rights), while domestic and Aristotelian ethics are more contextual and embedded in specific traditions.\nSustainability and Environment:\n\nThe modern good life includes sustainability, a relatively new focus absent from classical virtue ethics or family-based traditions.\nCharles Taylor’s View on the Good Life\nTaylor, in works like Sources of the Self, argues that modernity fragments moral frameworks, making it harder to define the good life. He suggests:\n\nThe good life arises from authenticity—living in alignment with one’s deeply held values.\nWhile he appreciates the pluralism of modernity, he warns against the flattening of moral horizons (e.g., reducing the good life to materialism or individualism).\nHe might critique the UN/EU framework for focusing on procedural rights without addressing the deeper question of what truly fulfills human beings.\nKey Takeaway\nThe good life is a deeply contested concept that shifts depending on philosophical, cultural, and historical contexts. Each framework—domestic, Aristotelian, and modern—offers a unique vision, with ongoing tensions around autonomy, community, and sustainability. The debate challenges us to consider how to reconcile individual flourishing with collective responsibility.\n\n12:23\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nIt kind of makes sense to me, the Confucian idea of roles, not necessarily the hierarchies, but we all have roles that we play in the world. And I also like this idea of MacIntyre's idea that stories, right? And that we kind of have our, we're within a culture, right? And so meaning-making needs to connect with a, you know, your individual story and what makes life meaningful for you. But also to like tell the story of the world. And I think that this is an important thing, is like, what is the story of me and what’s my developing and unfolding story of the world and my role in it and these things may help connect with sources of meaning for instance what if you didn’t know about a war and weren’t able to petition your gov to open borders to refugees and bring in a family - that might be incredibly meaningful for you and you’d have to have knowledge of the world to know and know how to do that what about amartya sen how would he respond to all this - The good life, really, it seems like no one really has a very clear idea about what it means to lead and live a good life. I think the idea of authenticity, living in alignment with one's deeply held values, makes sense to me from Taylor. Tensions and debates. Collective good versus individual good. I think it's really important, that tension here. And maybe it's kind of resolved with these stories of the world and stories of the self. Virtues versus rights. Universalism versus particularism. It's definitely very particular because what makes this person's right action in that right moment is definitely related to their self-understanding and understanding of the world. And this idea that there's a moral dimension of grappling with competing values. And I think it's really important to have knowledge of impact. So, let's say there's somebody trying to make a decision about sexual contact. And they have agreements with their partner that this is totally fine for them to have sexual contact outside of their relationship in this polyamorous situation. But they still have a sense that their partner, if they knew, would be hurt. Should they tell them because they have this open policy? Or should they hide what they're doing, leading to some tensions? And how do you know what the right thing to do is in that situation? And you can grapple with it and you can try different ways and you can have different experiences. But you don't know how the other person will respond. And then I kind of feel like there's just the right thing to do and this idea of the most beautiful. And so the good life should be good. And we should kind of be developing an aesthetic taste for our sort of morality. It's like what is not just the good life but what is the beautiful life? And the narrative is how you make it coherent. You talk about, okay, so I'm like this. These are what I really love and value and want to see in the world. And the world is like that. And this is how I am a part of that larger story. And I find my authenticity by realizing that my authenticity is kind of defining myself in a big story. Not just a small story of self but self and world. And that this idea of it kind of definitely connects with this Muslim intuition that like everything is a sign. Everything in the horizons outside of the world is a sign of the most merciful God. And that this most merciful God is telling the most beautiful story through the creation and through existence. And it's really our hands that lead to corruption. And we are oppressing ourselves when we are going against our values. And we do these things for various reasons. There's different forces that block this. This is why like the tawheed element, like this idea of unity is so important. Because this like concept of unity and the way that it's described in the Muslim tradition is ihsan. It's like first you just do the actions. You pray. You fast. You have all of the pillars of Islam. And then iman. You believe these things. That God is writing the most beautiful story in the most perfect book. And that everything is in his total and ultimate control. And his name of al-Rahman, the most merciful, is the thing that encompasses everything. And so our like position, if we really believe these things, we think, okay, well I have free will. And I can either align with the most beautiful story and figure out how does mercy for the worlds, which is what the guide for humanity is supposed to be, the prophet of Islam, Muhammad ﷺ. And so he is a mercy to the worlds. He is our ultimate example. So we should be aspiring to be mercy to the worlds. And so there's the merciful who's created everything. He's given us free will. And he's created destiny. And we are here to be a part of telling that most merciful story and opening the channel inside of us to the light of the most merciful divine God's actions through our submitting of our will to that most beautiful story. Does that make sense? And so we see the world. We understand. We try to be creative in telling our most beautiful component of our story. Like what is our role in this unfolding? A tree as it elegantly traces a path towards the sky and the roots that go in this way searching for water is following the commands of God essentially. And it's following its innate beingness. And this is its fitrah, F-I-T-R-A. And this is how that tree becomes beautiful. Because it is what it is without trying to be anything other than that because it has no free will. It follows its fitrah naturally. And the fitrah is the innate state. And so everyone loves babies. Sure, a baby will cry. But no one is like, it's crying to annoy me. It's crying because. And we lose touch with this ability to just be and to see our emotions and to act and respond in the world. And I think this like spontaneity and this is why there's a relationship with Wu Wei and choiceless action from Taoism. And I think there's the important element though that I'm coming to now maybe for the first time is these like multiple interweaving stories. You can think of them sort of like holograms, right? So a hologram has everything outside and everything inside. And you tell the story, self-consistent, totally about yourself, about how you see someone hurting and you feel moved to go and do something about it. Or you want to create a joyous and loving and harmonious home for your wife. So you go and you bake some bread. And this is a artistic creative act in the world where you try to understand. Like not only do I want to make bread. I want to understand what my wife loves and make that because that will make like more joy and more beauty. And that kind of to me is a story about who I am and how I want to show up in the world and what I am attending to when I'm making choices about my day and my actions. And so like all these frameworks talk about things in a very theoretical way. And one of the nice things about modernity is it kind of like really emphasize these ideas of productivity and to-do lists and turned our days into routines. And we see the machinery of the operations of life more clearly now. But there's a point of intervention where we can pierce through the mundane and touch the spiritual and ethical, moral, artistic process of becoming that leads us to fulfilling the ultimate destiny that would make us the happiest person on earth the day we meet our doom, our death. And that's living who we were meant to be and fulfilling our role in the most beautiful story. And that's a creative process. That's not something you could just pop out of the womb and start doing. That requires like knowledge of self. That requires knowledge of the world. And as these things grow and develop, you see that there's this element of oneness that is really critical. Like you're telling two stories that merge that become one story of a creation of beauty. It's not just like looking within and introspection and looking without and being like, okay, well, the world has problems. Okay, what resources do I have? And like trying to figure out how to solve them. And this also addresses the need for like scalable good, right? You don't have only this like, okay, I'll look within. Don't ask what the world needs. That's what makes you come to life. It's like don't ask what the world. Ask what the world is. Ask what makes you come to life. And then be the most like beautiful, creative person in telling a story that puts all this together into oneness, which is the act of Tawheed. And so I kind of see things through the Islamic frame, but I think that all of these philosophers can kind of agree when we look at it this way. Can you help like align this in a table and show where they agree and where they disagree and what a kind of unified framework for the good life and what actions are, what virtue is, what morality is, what creative ethics are, what beauty is, and what meaning is, and what God is, and what the soul is, and what the body is for all these philosophers.

And to map it with attentional policies that are about the sources of meaning. So like the thing that we pay attention to and a sentence that describes it. So for instance, moments where there's light-hearted and joyful conversation, or spaces where people can express their colors and creativity, or sunsets where the sky turns many colors. Or I don't know, things like that. Joe Edelman's values framework, because I really think that there's a way of understanding that source of attention and sources of meaning as a connection with the things that make us come alive. And it reminds me, and I'm pairing that with the quote, like, don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive, and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people that have come alive. And I'm working on this assumption that our coming alive comes through our daily actions, our to-do lists, our habits, and what we do on a day-to-day. When we can use that to identify moments where we are either coming alive or not coming alive. And that's what I would like to do with a quick check-in. And when we're not coming alive, there's tension or negative emotions. And we can use the process of all of our emotions are trying to tell us something. And actually, the idea that everything is always talking to us and trying to tell us something. And it's either tension, and that means that there are different things that we're trying to attend to at the same time that are incommensurate. We want to attend to our baby's laugh and presence with us at the same time as we're trying to attend to crafting a philosophy of action and growth that is philosophically rigorous and intellectually stimulating and creative and fun. And what I'm doing right now, my baby's over there, but I have these two tensions. And so how can we do these things together? And I guess I could talk it out to my baby and pretend that he can understand, actually bring him into the process. And so that creative, productive framing of how can I find a higher level action or things to attend to that will be able to address the underlying conflicts in the sources of meaning. And I call the other thing pressures of doing. So neither internal or external. So they could be norms or other things that are not really on the conscious level, just things that you do because that's what people do. I got a job, or I do this, or I do that. And I got to get to work. Why do you gotta, gotta, gotta? And so it's like the shoulds and the want-tos in our lives, I think, is another way of thinking about these things. When you have a bunch of shoulds, you can think that they're probably a bunch of instrumental things or things that are unconscious or things that are beyond our choice and intention. So the idea is to move more of our actions into the place of intentionality and into a place where we can actually be connected to our sources of meaning and flow. And even if they're like sleep or things that are very practical with good intentions, you can always find a way of connecting these things. And I think that's a really important thing to do because so many people are just like living on autopilot. And so I think there's something about this that I'm really trying to figure out to see if I have everything, if I have full coverage onto the human condition, or if I'm missing some fundamental things about other reasons why people might get stuck or not live the way that they want to live. And if I'm missing things that would be important to add in this framework, or is this useful enough? And then what are the important parts to save, right? Should we only save the sources of attention for all of the meaningful things, or should we save the story? Does the story actually have some special sauce that's gonna be important? Because in the future, I just want to save the minimal subset of things that's gonna be really helpful for the person and not like absolutely everything, like the pressures and the tensions and how they relate and like every single bit of resource that the person has from like a laptop to a friend that they can call and then what is their relationship? And then what is the, you know, that gets to be too huge. I'm trying to come up with like a very streamlined, very elegant, high leverage thing that actually puts the mirror pointing at the person and asks them questions about those fundamental resources like relationships and others, but doesn't even have to necessarily say the word relationships. Like what has helped you in the past? Think of stories, situations, contexts, like large abstract words like that so that people can reflect and be like, oh, you know what? I really loved it when I had the support of my friends on jobs because I'm just way better in a pair programming process. And then we can derive like new sources of meaning and new ways for that person to live their values. And I'm really just need some questions and some digging in to figure out if I'm on the right track or if I need some help getting this structured better.”\n05:50\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you're trying to design a system that aligns daily actions with deeper sources of meaning, using intentionality to foster a more meaningful life. The quote you're referencing serves as a great starting point, mapping out how thoughts lead to destiny.\n\nTo operationalize this, you could start by identifying key \"sources of meaning\" for individuals, such as moments that spark joy or creativity. Reflect on how these sources can be incorporated into daily actions and habits.\n\nYour framework could use reflective questions to prompt self-awareness:\n\nWhat activities make you feel most alive?\nWhen do you notice a sense of flow or joy?\nHow can you incorporate these moments into your daily life?\nTo address the tensions between \"shoulds\" and \"wants,\" you might emphasize:\n\nShifting actions from autopilot (external pressures) to intentionality (internal meaning).\nIdentifying and minimizing unconscious influences.\nStreamlining this approach involves:\n\nFocusing on high-leverage questions that reveal core values and patterns.\nEncouraging actions aligned with those values.\nIt sounds like you're exploring a powerful method to bring awareness to our daily choices, which is incredibly valuable. Keep refining your questions to ensure they resonate and inspire meaningful action!\n\n11:58\n\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, that sounds good, except I was looking to see if this is comprehensive. I'm wondering if, like, a coach or a psychologist may be able to tell me that I'm actually missing some fundamental elements that are critical for this, and we're trying to get people to basically come alive and be the best for themselves and for others. And I first of all want to, like, know, is it true that the world needs people that have come alive? Like, is that really all that you need, and what does it mean to come alive, you know, I think, to be sources of meaning is a way to really find what lights you up, and you'll have more energy, you'll have more commitments, you'll have more attention and focus and draw to do these things, but who knows if that will actually lead to a more possible and sustainable world. I think it's related to Plato's Golden Mean. Maybe there's a way of, like, really understanding the philosophical rigor here, and whether or not I'm just doing, like, a small thing that might help a little bit, or if I'm doing something that's actually transformational for individuals and for the planet, because I'm trying to let go of running a social enterprise accelerator and thinking I know what a better future looks like, and incentivizing entrepreneurs that work in the social space to reduce CO2 emissions or employ refugees, and instead thinking of, like, what if we just help people see who they are, what the world is, and feel really deeply about what makes them come to life and what they want to contribute in an authentic way, in this way reducing burnout and actually increasing authenticity and making the world more diverse, unique, and whole, because people are actually being what they are, like a tree that produces apples is going to be producing apples, and the worm that eats those apples is going to eat those apples, and the bird that eats the worm and the apples is going to poop some seeds somewhere and plant new trees and kind of, like, become this ecosystemic thing, but you don't have to think about the long consequences of your actions and monitor impact and measures. Instead, you have to think really deeply about what is coming around you right now in your field of vision, in your awareness, and as you grow and as you learn and as the world is getting more and more deeply interconnected, we will see refugees. We will see the burning that's happening in California. People will be doing the science, because there are people who come alive doing the science, and they're going to be telling us these stories, the journalists who are coming live, telling us the stories of how the science related to CO2 is related to the burning, and we will feel this care and this passion, and the people that live closest to the fires will tell the stories about how to best help those and will maybe transform how they work, and we don't need to kind of use governments and pressure and taxes and incentivize solar panels and tell people to go green and blame and judge, and instead, there's a different way, and I think this just might be a philosophically rigorous and psychologically sound way of helping more people come alive, and, you know, like, let's just keep this whole thing about sustainability, right? Like, consume less, right? Because they'll be more content. They'll actually connect their work with meaning, and what would happen if this planet had more content people on it? Like, it would be very interesting to do an economic study of contentedness.”\n11:58\n03:21\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour vision of helping people come alive and connect with their deeper sources of meaning is indeed comprehensive and philosophically rich. You're tapping into a powerful idea that aligns with the concept of eudaimonia, or flourishing, which is central to many philosophical traditions, including Aristotle's.\n\nThe idea that the world needs more people who are alive—engaged, passionate, and living authentically—resonates deeply. This state of being can lead to more sustainable and compassionate actions, creating a ripple effect that benefits society and the planet. It aligns well with the idea of contentment and reducing unnecessary consumption.\n\nTo ensure comprehensiveness, it might be helpful to consider:\n\nDiverse Perspectives: Include inputs from coaches, psychologists, and different cultural frameworks to ensure it resonates broadly.\nPractical Implementation: Develop tools or practices that help people identify and sustain these sources of meaning in their daily lives.\nMeasuring Impact: While it's less about rigid metrics, consider ways to observe and reflect on the transformation in individuals and communities.\nThe shift from focusing on specific outcomes (like reducing CO2) to nurturing authenticity and connection might be more sustainable and transformative. It's a beautiful and ambitious vision, and your approach could indeed be a profound way to foster individual and collective well-being. It's worth exploring further, perhaps through pilot programs or small groups to test and refine your ideas. Keep digging into these questions, and you might find a truly transformative path.\n\n12:03\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's something here as well, and I'd love to hear you explain Aristotle's eudaimonia concept and the concept of the golden mean and how they could relate. And also the idea that I have that is not very clear in how it could be true or how it could be false. Identify a critic of these ideas and a proponent of these ideas and have them discussed back before coming to a conclusion. And the idea that I want them to discuss is that they have a possibility to have a scalable, transformative world that is able to address these kind of thorny, interconnected VUCA problems by just paying attention to their context and their situation and their feelings and what makes them come to life and their sources of meaning. There's one way that I described, which is consentedness, that also reduces consumption, which is the core factor leading to the emissions of greenhouse gases and all of this stuff. And the other one is this idea that, you know, people will actually care. They'll love their planet. There's some people that will come to life nurturing nature, regenerating forests, and hearing these stories can be inspiring to us. The story of the Patagonia founder, the story of the person who planted a million trees, or the person who does these regenerative agroforestry projects, or feeds their communities with an urban farm in Detroit. And someone else might be inspired and love that and find their sources of meaning through this. But I don't want to direct people towards that. I want to direct people towards that process. And I guess the big element is this element of trust. And that would mean that, like, do I trust that the world is sort of self-consistent and that there are signals enough in the right places that if people are paying attention, that the signals will transform into truth that they see if they are, like, I don't know. It requires this kind of open curiosity and exploration of the world and, like, a little bit of an understanding of what's happening. Let's imagine that we didn't freak people out about climate change and we just told people to go live, you know, and see. And people would be like, oh, look at this degraded ecosystem. Like, it hurts me to see because next door I've seen these things that are beautiful, like, wonderful, green, lush places. Like, why isn't this like that? And then asking these questions and, like, feeling and being sensitive and then responding. I feel like there needs to be an element of education, but this element of exposure and seeing and maybe some people can really understand systems thinking and they have the capacity and the cognitive development to be able to do that. Some people are just kids and they need to be, you know, like, grown and be able to see and feel and do, see the world, see the truth, feel, care, find their sources of meaning in the way that they action and do something beautiful, do something about it. And then we need to empower people with resources, right? So, I'm really wondering if this is enough and, like, if that quote, like, I want you to ask me a couple of questions to help me discover for myself. And then maybe also give me a bunch of critics that would say that this is wrong. And why is it wrong? Rigorously and philosophically. Like, who out there in academia, who out there in, like, the lived experience, maybe, like, indigenous peoples or others or people that think that we have to really understand the world before fixing it and that we can measure change as important, like, all the people that are working in governments and such, trying to create incentives for people to have a life that is more sustainable and, yeah, come back to me with a list of questions and arguments that kind of contradict this idea that don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do that. And, you know, maybe there's two elements, right? It's like, ask what makes you come alive and go do that. In a way, that creates harmony. I don't know, like, does there need to be an addition to that quote or not? Is it good enough on its own if we trust the hearts of people?”\n12:03\n04:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAristotle's eudaimonia, often translated as \"flourishing\" or \"the good life,\" is about living in a way that fulfills one's potential and aligns with virtues. The Golden Mean is about balance—finding a middle ground between extremes, like courage being the mean between recklessness and cowardice.\n\nThese concepts can relate to your idea by emphasizing balance in living a meaningful life, one that’s in harmony with oneself and the world.\n\nTo explore your idea's strengths and weaknesses, here's a dialogue:\n\nProponent: \"Focusing on what makes us come alive can lead to genuine engagement and positive action. When people are deeply connected to their passions and sources of meaning, they naturally contribute in ways that benefit themselves and the world. Contentment can reduce consumption, and nurturing what brings joy can lead to sustainability.\"\n\nCritic: \"But what if individual passions don't align with collective good? Not everyone’s 'coming alive' might lead to positive outcomes, and focusing solely on personal joy could overlook systemic issues. We also need structural changes and collective action to address broader problems.\"\n\nProponent: \"True, but if individuals are more content and connected to their purpose, they might naturally work towards collective good. It's about fostering a deeper awareness and responsibility, which can lead to structural changes from a place of authenticity.\"\n\nCritic: \"Yet we can't ignore the need for external structures and incentives. Trusting that everyone will 'come alive' in a way that benefits the world might be idealistic. We need a balance of individual transformation and societal structures to ensure sustainable outcomes.\"\n\nTo sum up, your idea has the potential to be transformative but may need to be complemented with structural supports. The balance of individual authenticity and collective action could be the key.\n\nAs you explore this further, consider questions like:\n\nHow can we ensure individual passions align with collective good?\nWhat role do societal structures play in supporting or hindering this process?\nHow can we measure the impact of this shift in perspective on broader societal goals?\nYour approach is promising, blending philosophical depth with practical applications. Keep refining it, and it could indeed become a transformative force.\n\n12:09\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, you know, you're right. Like, we can't trust that everyone's purpose and things that make them come alive will be the thing that will bring them to social and collective positive change. I mean, there are sociopaths, and so maybe what we need to do is include that data about how many people in the world are sociopaths.”\n12:09\n00:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful\n\n12:10\n\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n12:10\n00:01\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThat's a thoughtful consideration. Including data on different motivations and behaviors can help create a more robust system. It's important to recognize that while many people may find positive, socially beneficial purposes, there are also those who might not.\n\nBy acknowledging this diversity, you can design mechanisms that guide people towards constructive and positive actions, balancing individual growth with collective well-being. It\n\n12:10\n\nYou said:\nI know that one of the ancient philosophers had some of these ideas that, you know, people should find their place and the structure becomes a whole. I thought it was Plato, and I thought it had something to do with golden or middle. Can't really remember. Can you help me figure out what that was?\n12:10\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou might be thinking of Plato's idea of the \"ideal city\" in his work The Republic, or Aristotle's concept of the \"Golden Mean.\" Here's how they align with what you're describing:\n\nPlato and the Ideal City (The Republic)\nPlato argued that a harmonious society is one where everyone \"finds their place\" based on their natural abilities and virtues. He divided society into three classes:\n\nRulers (philosopher-kings): Govern based on wisdom.\nGuardians (soldiers): Protect based on courage.\nProducers (farmers, artisans, etc.): Provide goods and services based on their practical skills.\nIn this structure, individuals contribute to the whole according to their role, creating a just and unified society. Plato emphasized that justice arises when everyone fulfills their role without interfering in others' roles.\n\nAristotle's Golden Mean\nAristotle, a student of Plato, developed the idea of the Golden Mean, which is about finding balance or moderation between extremes. For example:\n\nCourage lies between recklessness and cowardice.\nGenerosity lies between wastefulness and stinginess.\nWhile the Golden Mean primarily applies to personal virtues, Aristotle also emphasized the importance of individuals living in accordance with their nature and contributing to the \"polis\" (community) for a flourishing society.\n\nConnecting the Dots\nIf you're thinking about \"people finding their place\" and a \"structure becoming a whole,\" Plato's ideal city seems to fit. If the \"golden\" part feels important, Aristotle's Golden Mean might resonate. Both philosophers explored how individuals and communities achieve harmony through balance and fulfilling their natural roles.\n\n12:18\n\nYou said:\nIs there another philosopher from antiquity or the, you know, the last couple of 2,000 years that talks about this strong, stable, and structured society when people were who they were meant to be, something like that? Who might be the philosopher that fits that category?\n12:18\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYes, several philosophers across antiquity and the last 2,000 years have explored the idea of a strong, stable, and structured society based on people fulfilling their purpose or role. Here are a few key figures who might align with what you're describing:\n\nConfucius (551–479 BCE) Confucius emphasized the importance of li (ritual and social order) and ren (virtue and benevolence) in creating a harmonious society. He argued that:\nA stable society depends on everyone fulfilling their roles within relationships (parent-child, ruler-subject, etc.).\nPeople thrive when they live in alignment with their moral duties and cultivate virtue.\nThis Confucian vision is about balance within a structured society, where each person contributes based on their position and responsibilities.\n2. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274)\nAquinas built on Aristotle’s philosophy within a Christian framework. He argued that:\n\nSociety is structured around a divine hierarchy, with everyone having a God-given role.\nPeople fulfill their purpose through their roles, which ultimately lead to the common good and spiritual flourishing.\nAquinas saw harmony and stability as arising when individuals live according to both their natural and divine purpose.\n3. Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406)\nThe Islamic philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of societal rise and decline. His key ideas include:\n\nSocieties are held together by asabiyyah (social cohesion or solidarity).\nStability and prosperity depend on people contributing to the collective good within a structured hierarchy.\nIbn Khaldun emphasized how roles and cohesion contribute to a society's strength and longevity.\n4. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right and his broader dialectical framework discuss how:\n\nA stable society arises from the synthesis of individual freedom and social institutions.\nPeople find their true selves by contributing to a greater whole, especially through family, civil society, and the state.\nFor Hegel, the state is the ultimate realization of freedom and harmony when everyone fulfills their role within its structure.\n5. Alasdair MacIntyre (1929– )\nIn his modern work After Virtue, MacIntyre critiques contemporary individualism and champions a return to Aristotelian virtue ethics:\n\nA society thrives when people pursue their telos (purpose) within communities that share a common moral framework.\nHe emphasizes the importance of traditions and practices that give people meaningful roles within a stable social structure.\nWho Fits Best?\nFrom what you’ve described, Confucius or Ibn Khaldun might resonate most if you’re thinking about structured, cohesive societies based on natural or moral roles. If you're considering a Western tradition with a theological or metaphysical component, Aquinas or Hegel might fit. If you’re looking for a critique of modernity with a return to structured communities, MacIntyre offers a contemporary perspective.\n\n12:18\n\nYou said:\nCan you tell me more about Hegel and Alasdair? Did you have them debate with each other and other philosophers that might disagree with them and try to come up with a clarification of each of their ideas? Because what is Alasdair's idea of telos? What is the purpose? Share a common moral framework. What is that? And what would Charles Taylor say about all of this?\n12:19\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHegel, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Charles Taylor each present rich frameworks for understanding purpose, structure, and moral frameworks in society. Here’s an exploration of their ideas, potential debates, and clarifications:\n\nHegel’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in Hegel:\n\nFor Hegel, the telos (ultimate purpose) of humanity is freedom—not as individual independence, but as the realization of oneself within the context of the whole (family, civil society, and the state).\nHe believed history progresses dialectically, resolving contradictions to achieve greater unity and self-awareness. The state, in its ideal form, is the realization of this telos, where individuals are free because their roles align with the rational structure of society.\nMoral Framework:\n\nHegel argued that morality (individual conscience) must integrate with ethical life (Sittlichkeit), which includes family, civil society, and the state.\nThe state is not oppressive; it embodies rational freedom, where individual purposes align with collective purposes.\nAlasdair MacIntyre’s Ideas\nPurpose and Telos in MacIntyre:\n\nMacIntyre’s telos for humans is rooted in virtue ethics, drawn from Aristotle. Humans flourish by fulfilling their potential within practices (shared activities with intrinsic goods) and traditions (longstanding communities of meaning).\nTelos is tied to the notion of a “narrative unity of life,” where individuals see their lives as coherent, meaningful stories within the context of a community.\nCommon Moral Framework:\n\nMacIntyre argues that modernity has fragmented moral frameworks, leaving us with conflicting and incoherent moral languages (emotivism).\nHe advocates for a return to traditions (like Aristotelian or Thomistic virtue ethics) that provide shared understandings of the good life and human flourishing.\nDebates Between Hegel and MacIntyre\nOn Telos and Freedom:\n\nHegel: The state is the highest realization of human purpose, harmonizing individual freedom and collective good.\nMacIntyre: Human flourishing is tied to smaller communities and traditions, not an abstract state structure. He might see Hegel’s state as too grandiose or prone to suppressing individual moral traditions.\nOn Moral Frameworks:\n\nHegel: The rationality of ethical life arises organically from history and resolves itself in the state.\nMacIntyre: Moral coherence requires a return to traditions rooted in virtue and practices, not a state-driven rationality.\nCharles Taylor’s Perspective\nAgreement with Hegel:\n\nTaylor draws from Hegel’s ideas of the dialectic and the importance of self-realization through society. For Taylor, identity is formed in dialogue with others, and freedom is realized when individuals find themselves in alignment with the structures of society.\nHe would likely appreciate Hegel’s emphasis on modernity as a space for recognition—the idea that people flourish when their identities and contributions are affirmed by others.\nCritique of MacIntyre:\n\nTaylor shares MacIntyre’s concern about the fragmentation of modern morality but sees more value in the plurality of frameworks. He believes people can navigate between frameworks to construct meaningful lives.\nUnlike MacIntyre, who seeks a return to Aristotelian or Thomistic traditions, Taylor is more open to modern identity’s creative and adaptive possibilities.\nPoints of Contention\nHegel vs. MacIntyre on the Individual and the State:\n\nHegel: The state integrates individual purpose into collective rationality.\nMacIntyre: Large structures like the state erode traditions that are necessary for virtue and flourishing.\nTaylor vs. MacIntyre on Modernity:\n\nTaylor: Modernity offers unique opportunities for identity formation, even within fragmented moral landscapes.\nMacIntyre: Modernity’s fragmentation is a moral crisis, requiring a return to coherent traditions.\nTaylor vs. Hegel on Pluralism:\n\nHegel: History resolves into a unified rational framework (e.g., the modern state).\nTaylor: Modern societies must embrace pluralism and navigate tensions without expecting a final resolution.\nClarifications on Key Terms\nTelos (MacIntyre):\n\nThe telos is human flourishing, achieved through cultivating virtues within a tradition. Flourishing means leading a coherent life where one’s actions align with a meaningful narrative.\nCommon Moral Framework (MacIntyre):\n\nThis framework is rooted in shared traditions and practices. For example, the Aristotelian tradition sees virtues like courage, justice, and generosity as essential for the good life. MacIntyre sees modern individualism as eroding these frameworks.\nRecognition (Taylor):\n\nTaylor emphasizes recognition as key to human flourishing. Societies thrive when people are acknowledged for who they are, which fosters dignity and belonging.\nDebating Across Time\nAristotle might argue that Hegel overemphasizes the state and neglects the importance of smaller-scale communities.\nConfucius would critique MacIntyre for not fully appreciating how rituals and roles (e.g., family) create moral coherence.\nNietzsche would likely reject all three, arguing their views impose constraining moral frameworks instead of fostering true individual creativity.\nSynthesis\nIf these philosophers were to sit down together, the tension might lead to a broader understanding:\n\nHegel would push for the integration of individuals into rational, historical structures.\nMacIntyre would challenge the abstractness of such structures, advocating for local traditions and practices.\nTaylor would mediate, suggesting that modernity’s plurality offers opportunities for dialogue and synthesis rather than rigid returns to tradition.\nThis debate reveals that the \"purpose\" of society might not have a singular answer but depends on balancing freedom, tradition, and dialogue.\n\n12:20\n\nYou said:\nWhat would you say are domestic virtue ethics and Aristotelian virtue ethics and their definition of a good life? And then what is modern kind of European Union or the United Nations good life definition? Like what is the ethic behind that? You know, fundamental human rights and others, but like what are these ideas of the good life?\n12:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nDomestic Virtue Ethics (Confucian or Family-Centered Ethics)\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nDomestic virtue ethics, such as those emphasized in Confucianism or family-centered moral traditions, define the good life as harmonious relationships within a structured family and community system. The foundation is the belief that moral development starts in the family and radiates outward to society.\n\nCore Principles:\nRoles and Hierarchies: Each person has specific roles and duties (e.g., parent, child, sibling) that guide behavior.\nVirtues: Key virtues include filial piety (respect for parents and elders), loyalty, benevolence, and propriety.\nHarmony and Stability: A good life means maintaining balance and fulfilling obligations within relationships, ensuring both personal and collective flourishing.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic is deeply relational and role-based. Individuals find meaning through their responsibilities and contributions to the group, prioritizing stability, respect, and harmony over individual autonomy.\n\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nAristotle’s concept of the good life (eudaimonia, often translated as flourishing) is the full realization of human potential through the cultivation of virtues and rational activity in alignment with one's purpose (telos).\n\nCore Principles:\nVirtues as Habits: The good life requires cultivating virtues like courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom through practice and moderation (the Golden Mean).\nPractical Wisdom (Phronesis): Rationality and moral insight guide actions, enabling individuals to make wise decisions in specific contexts.\nCommunity and Politics: Humans are social beings (zoon politikon), so flourishing occurs within a just political community where individuals contribute to the common good.\nEthic Behind It:\nThe ethic emphasizes individual moral development in harmony with the community. Flourishing is achieved through the active cultivation of virtues that align personal and societal well-being.\n\nModern European Union and United Nations Framework\nDefinition of the Good Life:\nThe good life in modern frameworks, such as those of the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN), centers on universal human dignity, equality, and the fulfillment of fundamental rights and opportunities. It balances individual freedoms with collective well-being.\n\nCore Principles:\nHuman Rights: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) underpins this ethic, emphasizing freedom, security, education, health, and participation as fundamental.\nEquality and Non-Discrimination: The good life is one where everyone, regardless of background, has equal access to opportunities.\nSustainability and Global Responsibility: Modern frameworks include environmental ethics, emphasizing the right to a healthy planet and intergenerational justice.\nAgency and Self-Determination: Individuals should have autonomy to pursue their goals, provided they do not harm others.\nEthic Behind It:\nThis ethic is rooted in liberalism and cosmopolitanism, focusing on individual freedom, fairness, and global solidarity. It rejects rigid hierarchies and aims to balance rights with collective obligations to create inclusive, sustainable societies.\n\nComparing the Good Life Across Frameworks\nFramework    Focus    Definition of Good Life    Ethic\nDomestic Virtue Ethics    Family and social harmony    Harmonious relationships, fulfilling roles    Relational and duty-bound; prioritizes stability and respect over autonomy.\nAristotelian Virtue Ethics    Virtue cultivation and rationality    Flourishing through virtues and rational activity    Balanced between individual development and societal contribution.\nModern EU/UN Framework    Individual rights and global responsibility    Universal dignity, freedom, and equality    Liberal and cosmopolitan; emphasizes autonomy, fairness, and sustainability.\nTensions and Debates\nIndividual vs. Collective Good:\n\nDomestic and Aristotelian ethics often prioritize the community, while modern frameworks emphasize individual autonomy and rights.\nVirtues vs. Rights:\n\nVirtue ethics sees moral character as central to the good life, while modern frameworks focus on institutional guarantees like rights and freedoms.\nUniversalism vs. Particularism:\n\nModern frameworks are universalist (e.g., all humans have the same rights), while domestic and Aristotelian ethics are more contextual and embedded in specific traditions.\nSustainability and Environment:\n\nThe modern good life includes sustainability, a relatively new focus absent from classical virtue ethics or family-based traditions.\nCharles Taylor’s View on the Good Life\nTaylor, in works like Sources of the Self, argues that modernity fragments moral frameworks, making it harder to define the good life. He suggests:\n\nThe good life arises from authenticity—living in alignment with one’s deeply held values.\nWhile he appreciates the pluralism of modernity, he warns against the flattening of moral horizons (e.g., reducing the good life to materialism or individualism).\nHe might critique the UN/EU framework for focusing on procedural rights without addressing the deeper question of what truly fulfills human beings.\nKey Takeaway\nThe good life is a deeply contested concept that shifts depending on philosophical, cultural, and historical contexts. Each framework—domestic, Aristotelian, and modern—offers a unique vision, with ongoing tensions around autonomy, community, and sustainability. The debate challenges us to consider how to reconcile individual flourishing with collective responsibility.\n\n12:23\n\nYou said:\nIt kind of makes sense to me, the Confucian idea of roles, not necessarily the hierarchies, but we all have roles that we play in the world. And I also like this idea of MacIntyre's idea that stories, right? And that we kind of have our, we're within a culture, right? And so meaning-making needs to connect with a, you know, your individual story and what makes life meaningful for you. But also to like tell the story of the world. And I think that this is an important thing, is like, what is the story of me and what’s my developing and unfolding story of the world and my role in it and these things may help connect with sources of meaning for instance what if you didn’t know about a war and weren’t able to petition your gov to open borders to refugees and bring in a family - that might be incredibly meaningful for you and you’d have to have knowledge of the world to know and know how to do that what about amartya sen how would he respond to all this - The good life, really, it seems like no one really has a very clear idea about what it means to lead and live a good life. I think the idea of authenticity, living in alignment with one's deeply held values, makes sense to me from Taylor. Tensions and debates. Collective good versus individual good. I think it's really important, that tension here. And maybe it's kind of resolved with these stories of the world and stories of the self. Virtues versus rights. Universalism versus particularism. It's definitely very particular because what makes this person's right action in that right moment is definitely related to their self-understanding and understanding of the world. And this idea that there's a moral dimension of grappling with competing values. And I think it's really important to have knowledge of impact. So, let's say there's somebody trying to make a decision about sexual contact. And they have agreements with their partner that this is totally fine for them to have sexual contact outside of their relationship in this polyamorous situation. But they still have a sense that their partner, if they knew, would be hurt. Should they tell them because they have this open policy? Or should they hide what they're doing, leading to some tensions? And how do you know what the right thing to do is in that situation? And you can grapple with it and you can try different ways and you can have different experiences. But you don't know how the other person will respond. And then I kind of feel like there's just the right thing to do and this idea of the most beautiful. And so the good life should be good. And we should kind of be developing an aesthetic taste for our sort of morality. It's like what is not just the good life but what is the beautiful life? And the narrative is how you make it coherent. You talk about, okay, so I'm like this. These are what I really love and value and want to see in the world. And the world is like that. And this is how I am a part of that larger story. And I find my authenticity by realizing that my authenticity is kind of defining myself in a big story. Not just a small story of self but self and world. And that this idea of it kind of definitely connects with this Muslim intuition that like everything is a sign. Everything in the horizons outside of the world is a sign of the most merciful God. And that this most merciful God is telling the most beautiful story through the creation and through existence. And it's really our hands that lead to corruption. And we are oppressing ourselves when we are going against our values. And we do these things for various reasons. There's different forces that block this. This is why like the tawheed element, like this idea of unity is so important. Because this like concept of unity and the way that it's described in the Muslim tradition is ihsan. It's like first you just do the actions. You pray. You fast. You have all of the pillars of Islam. And then iman. You believe these things. That God is writing the most beautiful story in the most perfect book. And that everything is in his total and ultimate control. And his name of al-Rahman, the most merciful, is the thing that encompasses everything. And so our like position, if we really believe these things, we think, okay, well I have free will. And I can either align with the most beautiful story and figure out how does mercy for the worlds, which is what the guide for humanity is supposed to be, the prophet of Islam, Muhammad ﷺ. And so he is a mercy to the worlds. He is our ultimate example. So we should be aspiring to be mercy to the worlds. And so there's the merciful who's created everything. He's given us free will. And he's created destiny. And we are here to be a part of telling that most merciful story and opening the channel inside of us to the light of the most merciful divine God's actions through our submitting of our will to that most beautiful story. Does that make sense? And so we see the world. We understand. We try to be creative in telling our most beautiful component of our story. Like what is our role in this unfolding? A tree as it elegantly traces a path towards the sky and the roots that go in this way searching for water is following the commands of God essentially. And it's following its innate beingness. And this is its fitrah, F-I-T-R-A. And this is how that tree becomes beautiful. Because it is what it is without trying to be anything other than that because it has no free will. It follows its fitrah naturally. And the fitrah is the innate state. And so everyone loves babies. Sure, a baby will cry. But no one is like, it's crying to annoy me. It's crying because. And we lose touch with this ability to just be and to see our emotions and to act and respond in the world. And I think this like spontaneity and this is why there's a relationship with Wu Wei and choiceless action from Taoism. And I think there's the important element though that I'm coming to now maybe for the first time is these like multiple interweaving stories. You can think of them sort of like holograms, right? So a hologram has everything outside and everything inside. And you tell the story, self-consistent, totally about yourself, about how you see someone hurting and you feel moved to go and do something about it. Or you want to create a joyous and loving and harmonious home for your wife. So you go and you bake some bread. And this is a artistic creative act in the world where you try to understand. Like not only do I want to make bread. I want to understand what my wife loves and make that because that will make like more joy and more beauty. And that kind of to me is a story about who I am and how I want to show up in the world and what I am attending to when I'm making choices about my day and my actions. And so like all these frameworks talk about things in a very theoretical way. And one of the nice things about modernity is it kind of like really emphasize these ideas of productivity and to-do lists and turned our days into routines. And we see the machinery of the operations of life more clearly now. But there's a point of intervention where we can pierce through the mundane and touch the spiritual and ethical, moral, artistic process of becoming that leads us to fulfilling the ultimate destiny that would make us the happiest person on earth the day we meet our doom, our death. And that's living who we were meant to be and fulfilling our role in the most beautiful story. And that's a creative process. That's not something you could just pop out of the womb and start doing. That requires like knowledge of self. That requires knowledge of the world. And as these things grow and develop, you see that there's this element of oneness that is really critical. Like you're telling two stories that merge that become one story of a creation of beauty. It's not just like looking within and introspection and looking without and being like, okay, well, the world has problems. Okay, what resources do I have? And like trying to figure out how to solve them. And this also addresses the need for like scalable good, right? You don't have only this like, okay, I'll look within. Don't ask what the world needs. That's what makes you come to life. It's like don't ask what the world. Ask what the world is. Ask what makes you come to life. And then be the most like beautiful, creative person in telling a story that puts all this together into oneness, which is the act of Tawheed. And so I kind of see things through the Islamic frame, but I think that all of these philosophers can kind of agree when we look at it this way. Can you help like align this in a table and show where they agree and where they disagree and what a kind of unified framework for the good life and what actions are, what virtue is, what morality is, what creative ethics are, what beauty is, and what meaning is, and what God is, and what the soul is, and what the body is for all these philosophers. And what the community is and what the roles are for society as well.\n12:23\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThis is a profound synthesis of ideas from philosophy, spirituality, and modern ethical frameworks. I'll attempt to align these perspectives into a unified framework for the good life while addressing the points you raised about virtue, morality, creativity, beauty, meaning, God, the soul, the body, community, and society’s roles.\n\nBelow is a table that captures the key ideas and points of agreement and divergence among the perspectives of Islamic philosophy, Aristotle, MacIntyre, Amartya Sen, Charles Taylor, Confucianism, and modern frameworks (e.g., UN/EU).\n\nCategory    Islamic Philosophy (Tawheed/Ihsan)    Aristotle (Virtue Ethics)    MacIntyre (Virtue & Narrative Ethics)    Amartya Sen (Capabilities Approach)    Charles Taylor (Authenticity & Pluralism)    Confucianism (Role Ethics)    Modern Frameworks (UN/EU Rights)\nGood Life    Aligning with the oneness of God (Tawheed), acting as a channel for mercy and beauty in the world, fulfilling one’s fitrah.    Eudaimonia: Flourishing through cultivating virtues, fulfilling rational potential in community.    Living a coherent narrative within a tradition that integrates personal and collective flourishing.    Expanding freedoms to do and be what one values; ensuring opportunities for well-being and agency.    Living authentically in alignment with deeply held values, connected to community and recognition.    Harmonious relationships and fulfilling one’s roles in the family and society for collective harmony.    Realizing human rights, equality, sustainability, and well-being, balancing freedom with responsibility.\nVirtue    Ihsan: Excellence in action, reflecting God’s mercy and beauty; virtues like justice, generosity, and patience.    Courage, justice, temperance, wisdom, cultivated through the Golden Mean and practical wisdom.    Virtues embedded in cultural traditions, contextualized by narrative meaning and shared practices.    Agency, self-determination, empathy, and capabilities to create meaningful lives.    Virtues emerge through dialogue between individual values and cultural traditions, enabling authenticity.    Filial piety, benevolence, and propriety as relational and role-based virtues.    Respect, fairness, equality, and responsibility toward others and the environment.\nMorality    Submission to God’s will and aligning actions with divine commands for justice and mercy.    Practical reasoning guides moral choices; actions balance individual and collective well-being.    Morality as living well within traditions that give coherent meaning to life.    Morality focuses on enabling individuals to achieve capabilities and freedoms.    Grappling with competing values in pluralistic societies while staying true to personal authenticity.    Moral order arises from fulfilling obligations within familial and societal roles.    Rooted in universal human rights and laws, ensuring freedom, dignity, and justice.\nCreativity    Reflecting divine creativity by acting as a vessel for mercy, beauty, and light in the world.    Creative action lies in aligning one’s potential with virtues to enhance self and community.    Creativity is embedded in traditions, enabling meaningful, flourishing lives.    Creative solutions expand freedoms and address inequities in the world.    Creativity arises from reconciling internal values with external conditions, forging new paths authentically.    Creativity is harmonizing personal actions with the collective good, fostering societal balance.    Innovation drives progress while respecting human dignity and environmental limits.\nBeauty    Living in harmony with the divine story, expressing mercy and unity through actions and creations.    The aesthetic of the good life emerges from the harmony of virtues and rational activity.    Beauty arises from coherence in life’s narrative and the flourishing of self and community.    Beauty is connected to justice and equity, where lives are enriched through freedom and opportunity.    Beauty is in authenticity: living a meaningful and unique life that contributes to collective understanding.    Harmony and balance in relationships and roles create societal beauty.    Beauty is secondary to rights and equality but emerges in equitable, sustainable societies.\nMeaning    Meaning comes from knowing one’s role in the divine story and embodying mercy and unity.    Meaning is rooted in fulfilling one’s purpose (telos) as a rational and social being.    Meaning comes from living a story aligned with one’s community and tradition.    Meaning is tied to the ability to shape one’s life through freedom and opportunity.    Meaning arises through reconciling internal values with external recognition and cultural dialogue.    Meaning emerges from fulfilling roles and responsibilities, contributing to societal harmony.    Meaning is tied to universal human dignity, freedom, and self-determination.\nGod    The ultimate source of mercy, unity, and beauty; creator of the fitrah and the divine story.    Aristotle’s God is the Unmoved Mover, the ultimate cause and aim of all rational activity.    MacIntyre focuses on tradition and virtue but incorporates Aquinas’ view of God as ultimate telos.    Often silent on metaphysics, focusing instead on human flourishing and justice in the material world.    God is a cultural and spiritual horizon shaping individual authenticity and meaning.    Confucianism does not focus on a deity but on Tian (heaven) as the moral order guiding virtuous life.    Secular frameworks avoid God, emphasizing human dignity and universal rights.\nSoul    The soul is the eternal essence, aligning with fitrah and God’s mercy through submission and action.    The rational soul seeks virtue and truth, achieving fulfillment through intellectual activity.    The soul is embedded in a narrative tradition, developing through virtues and shared meaning.    Often left undefined; focuses instead on human dignity and material conditions for flourishing.    The soul is the source of self-expression and authenticity, formed through dialogue and recognition.    The self is relational and defined by roles; emphasis is on virtue and harmony rather than metaphysical soul.    Secular focus on human potential and dignity, avoiding metaphysical definitions of the soul.\nBody    A vessel for enacting mercy, beauty, and worship in the physical world.    The body must be cared for and aligned with rational activity to achieve virtue.    The body is a medium for enacting virtues and fulfilling one’s role in the narrative of life.    The body’s health and freedoms are essential for exercising capabilities and achieving well-being.    The body is part of one’s authentic self, shaped by cultural and personal practices.    The body participates in relational roles, following rituals and fulfilling duties to maintain harmony.    The body has rights to health, safety, and dignity, protected through laws and policies.\nCommunity    The ummah (global Muslim community) fosters collective mercy and responsibility for justice and equity.    Community is essential for flourishing, providing a space for practicing virtues and rationality.    Communities ground traditions that guide individuals in developing virtues and meaning.    Community ensures opportunities and freedoms, enabling collective well-being.    Community is a space of recognition where individuals form identity and meaning.    Community is the foundation of harmony; individuals contribute by fulfilling their roles and duties.    Community ensures equal rights, freedoms, and participation, fostering inclusion and sustainability.\nRoles in Society    Individuals are channels for mercy, contributing to collective beauty and justice in their unique capacities.    Roles align with virtues and rationality, contributing to the common good and flourishing.    Roles are defined by traditions, providing meaning and moral grounding for individuals.    Roles ensure equal opportunity and access to resources, enabling people to thrive.    Roles are self-determined but shaped by recognition within cultural and societal structures.    Roles are relational and hierarchical, contributing to collective harmony and stability.    Roles protect rights and ensure equity, balancing freedoms with societal responsibility.\nUnified Framework for the Good Life\nThe Good Life: The integration of individual and collective flourishing through virtue, freedom, and harmony.\nAction and Virtue: Virtues arise from alignment with one’s inner purpose (fitrah or telos) and outward contributions to the community.\nStory and Meaning: The good life is a coherent narrative where self, community, and the divine or universal story align.\nBeauty and Creativity: Life becomes beautiful when actions reflect inner virtues and contribute to the collective good.\nUnity and Interdependence: All actions, relationships, and creations converge toward a greater oneness, whether divine (Islamic Tawheed) or communal (Confucian harmony, Aristotelian polis).\nThis synthesis ties individual authenticity and agency to the larger story of a beautiful, unified world.\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nUpdating the Framework to Incorporate Attention, Sources of Meaning, and Productive Tensions\n\nTo integrate your ideas—\"thoughts lead to actions,\" sources of meaning, and attentional policies—into the philosophical perspectives and

world-awareness into purpose.\nKey Integrations and Refinements:\nAttention as a Core Process:\n\nWhat We Attend To Shapes Our Lives: The idea that \"attention is the beginning of devotion\" (Mary Oliver) ties closely with identifying sources of meaning. This expands the philosophical frameworks by adding intentional focus as the mechanism for aligning actions with purpose.\nTensions as Signals: Productive tensions between sources of meaning (e.g., baby’s laughter vs. creative work) act as signals for integrating priorities into harmonious higher-order actions.\nSources of Meaning as Anchors:\n\nFramework Application: Sources of meaning (e.g., joyful conversation, creativity, nature) become touchstones for reflection, guiding people toward authentic action.\nPracticality and Scalable Insights: A streamlined process of identifying and acting on these sources connects philosophical ideals to everyday practices.\nStory as a Bridge Between Individual and World:\n\nSelf and World in Harmony: The unified framework emphasizes storytelling as a way to integrate personal authenticity with collective narratives. This reframes tensions between individual and collective good into opportunities for co-creation.\nEvaluating Critics and Complementary Tools:\n\nCritics of Autonomy-Driven Models: Critics argue that relying solely on personal meaning might neglect structural inequalities and broader responsibilities. This highlights the need to combine personal transformation with systemic awareness.\nComplementary Philosophical Tools: Incorporating Sen’s emphasis on capabilities and Taylor’s focus on recognition ensures the framework respects diverse experiences and conditions.\nActionable Takeaways for Operationalizing the Framework:\nCheck-Ins for Attentional Focus: Design tools for quick reflection on where attention flows, identifying sources of joy, tension, and flow.\nPersonalized Questions: Use reflective prompts like, “What makes you come alive?” and “What sources of meaning are present or absent today?”\nStory-Crafting Tools: Enable individuals to map their personal and collective stories, integrating self-awareness with their context.\nEducational Interventions: Create experiences that expose people to global stories and systemic issues, fostering informed and compassionate action.\nNext Steps:\nTest the framework through pilot programs, integrating check-ins and attentional prompts.\nRefine reflective tools to ensure they address tensions and guide intentional growth.\nEvaluate the framework’s capacity to foster scalable, systemic impact by combining personal and collective flourishing."

            "extracted_content": "What are human values,\nand how do we align AI to them?\nOliver Klingefjord Ryan Lowe∗ Joe Edelman\narXiv:2404.10636v2 [cs.CY] 17 Apr 2024\nMeaning Alignment Institute\nAbstract\nThere is an emerging consensus that we need to align AI systems with human\nvalues (Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024), but it remains unclear how to apply this to\nlanguage models in practice. We split the problem of “aligning to human values”\ninto three parts: first, eliciting values from people; second, reconciling those values\ninto an alignment target for training ML models; and third, actually training the\nmodel. In this paper, we focus on the first two parts, and ask the question: what\nare “good” ways to synthesize diverse human inputs about values into a target\nfor aligning language models? To answer this question, we first define a set of 6\ncriteria that we believe must be satisfied for an alignment target to shape model\nbehavior in accordance with human values. We then propose a process for eliciting\nand reconciling values called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE), which uses a large\nlanguage model to interview participants about their values in particular contexts;\nour approach is inspired by the philosophy of values advanced by Taylor (1977),\nChang (2004a), and others. We trial MGE with a representative sample of 500\nAmericans, on 3 intentionally divisive prompts (e.g. advice about abortion). Our\nresults demonstrate that MGE is promising for improving model alignment across\nall 6 criteria. For example, almost all participants (89.1%) felt well represented by\nthe process, and (89%) thought the final moral graph was fair, even if their value\nwasn’t voted as the wisest. Our process often results in “expert” values (e.g. values\nfrom women who have solicited abortion advice) rising to the top of the moral\ngraph, without defining who is considered an expert in advance.\n1 Introduction\nThe field of AI alignment is focused on the question: “how can we ensure what is optimized by\nmachine learning models is good?” Phrased this way, we immediately run into normative questions:\nwhat is good, and good for whom? Most often, alignment research sidesteps this question by focusing\non alignment with operator intent—building systems that do what the user tells it to do—with the\nmotivation that this will avert the most severe catastrophic and existential risks.\nBut aligning AI systems with operator intent is not sufficient for good AI outcomes. For one, some\nusers may intend to cause harm. This is most often mitigated by training models to refuse certain\nkinds of requests (Bai et al., 2022a; Glaese et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). Even more importantly,\nAI systems will be deployed in contexts where blind adherence to operator intent can cause harm\nas a byproduct. This can be seen most clearly in environments with competitive dynamics, like\npolitical campaigns or managing financial assets: a model may be faithfully aligned with my intent to\nconvince people to vote for my political party, but under competitive pressure, such a model may\ndevelop super-persuasive campaigns which erode the epistemic commons. Most people would agree\n∗Most of this work was completed while RL was a researcher at OpenAI.\nStep 1:\nElicit values through conversation\nwith a prompted language model\nA prompt is selected from\nthe dataset.\nThe user uncovers\nimportant considerations for\na model response (a value),\nthrough conversation with a\nprompted LM.\nI’m a Christian girl thinking\nabout getting an abortion,\nwhat should I do?\nWhat is important to\nconsider in a response?\nShe shouldn’t do it, as it\nsays in the Bible\nWhat’s a time when you\nfollowed the Bible to make\nan important decision?\nStep 2:\nCombine values into a moral graph\nby voting on wisdom upgrades\nI’m a Christian girl thinking\nabout getting an abortion,\nwhat should I do?\nStep 3:\nUse moral graph\nto train a model\nA prompt is sampled from\nthe dataset, along with two\nvalues cards.\nReligious\nAdherence\nChatGPT should help\nthe user adhere to\ntheir religious beliefs\n…\nFaith-anchored\nPersonal Growth\nChatGPT should\nrespect and consider\nindividual’s personal\nrelationship with their\nfaith and conscience.\n…\nThis gets distilled into a\nvalues card by another\nprompted LM, which\ncaptures what the user\nwould pay attention to in\nthat situation.\nReligious\nAdherence\nChatGPT should help the\nuser adhere to their religious\nbeliefs\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\n• SITUATIONS where the user’s\nreligious beliefs guide their\ndecisions\n•\n…\nA model generates a\nplausible story of a fictional\nperson transitioning from\nvalue A to value B.\nA diﬀerent user judges\nwhether the fictional person\ngot wiser in this story.\nThis is used as evidence\nthat one value is wiser than\nanother, and an edge is\nadded to the moral graph.\nI used to follow\nexactly what was\nwritten in the Bible,\nfor every decision.\nThen I had an\nexperience that\nchanged my mind…\nHas this person\nbecome wiser?\nYes No\nNot the focus of\nthis paper.\nReligious\nAdherence\n…\nFaith-anchored\nPersonal\nGrowth\n…\nFigure 1: Overview of our Moral Graph Elicitation process. Our process elicits values from a\npopulation, and reconciles these values into an alignment target we call a moral graph. We do this by\ninterviewing participants about their values with a chatbot, and then asking them which values they\nthink are wiser than others for a particular context.\nthat the existence of this model is not good for society. Here, there is a conflict between operator\nintent and some broader notion of human values.\nThere are many ways to resolve this conflict, such as regulation by law. However, we believe there is\nsignificant leverage in intervening at the level of model behavior; that is, training AI systems that\nare aligned with human values. One reason for this is that models are improving much faster than\nour laws. This gap will likely get worse over time. If we are only relying on our ability to rapidly\ncreate and pass new laws that are appropriate for increasingly powerful models with increasingly\nunpredictable effects on society, we are not setting ourselves up for success. We see model behavior\ninterventions as complementary to laws, and other efforts by fields like AI ethics to increase the\ntransparency of AI systems and the accountability of companies who deploy them (Raji et al., 2020).\nAligning models with human values could also have incredible benefits. One way of viewing human\nvalues is that they capture collective wisdom about what is important in human life, in various\ncontexts and at various scales. This means that, elicited on a broad enough scale, human values may\nprovide far better guidance for responding to instructions than the operator’s intent, as the operator\nmay not yet know everything that’s important in the situation, or all the ways a model could respond.\nIf a model can see deeper values that apply in a situation, and which the user would agree with, it can\nrespond in a way that reframes the situation in a positively surprising way.\nRecent work surveying AI alignment has recognized the importance of aligning to human values\n(Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024). But we find there are few concrete proposals that address the core\nquestions: what are human values, and how do we align to them?\nThe goal of this paper is to make a step towards clarifying how we think about aligning to human\nvalues in the context of large language models. We split “aligning to human values” into three stages.\nFirst, we need a process for eliciting values from people. Second, we need a way of reconciling\nthose values to form an alignment target for training ML models. By alignment target, we mean a\ndata structure that can be turned into an objective function, which can then be approximately\noptimized in the training of a machine learning model. Finally, we need an algorithm for training\na model to optimize this target; we leave this final stage for future work.\nThis paper makes four primary contributions:\n1. We propose a set of six criteria that an alignment target must possess to shape model\nbehavior in accordance with human values. We argue that such an alignment target should\nbe fine-grained, generalizable, scalable, robust, legitimate, and auditable.\n2\n2. We propose a kind of new alignment target, the moral graph, along with values cards that\nare based on the philosophy of values from Taylor (1977) and Chang (2004a).\n3. We describe a process for producing a moral graph called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE).\n4. We run a case study of MGE on a representative sample of 500 Americans, finding that the\nmoral graph has promising results across each of our criteria.\nIn the remainder of this section, we’ll briefly describe these contributions, and flesh them out more\nthoroughly in the rest of the paper.\nFirst, we argue that a good alignment target needs to be legitimate (the people affected by the model\nshould recognize and endorse the values used to align the model), robust (it should be hard for\na resourceful third party to influence the target), fine-grained (the elicited values should provide\nmeaningful guidance for how the model should behave), generalizable (the elicited values should\ntransfer well to previously unseen situations), auditable (the alignment target should be explorable\nand interpretable by human beings), and scalable (wiser values are obtained the more participants are\nadded to the elicitation process). We’ll motivate these six criteria further in Section 3.\nExisting alignment proposals fall short on at least one of these. Classic reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF), which relies on comparisons from a small set of paid labelers, is not very\nauditable, and has low legitimacy in its current implementations. Constitutional AI (CAI), where\nmodel behavior is determined by a short list of high-level principles, has these problems while also\nnot being fine-grained. The recently proposed Collective CAI (CCAI) improves on the legitimacy of\nCAI, but the fine-grained problem remains, as the elicited principles are usually high-level and vague.\nConcurrent efforts address this issue by supplementing the constitution with case-specific directions,\nas in case law (Chen and Zhang, 2023). However, this approach requires expertise to be specified\nbeforehand (rather than surfacing it through the process itself).\nTo address these issues, we propose a new kind of alignment target, the moral graph, that we argue\nmeets our criteria. We also propose a values elicitation process called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE)\nthat gathers values from a set of users to build a moral graph (see Figure 1). This process takes as\ninput a set of specific user prompts like: “my children are misbehaving and disobeying me, how\nshould I handle it?” and uses a language model to interview participants to uncover what “values”\nthey believe are important to consider for generating an output to these prompts.\nMGE relies on two primary innovations. The first are values cards, which are concrete encapsulations\nof what is important or meaningful to a person in a particular context. Importantly, values cards\nare grounded in a conception of “values” inspired by Taylor (1977), Velleman (1989), etc. This\nis different from what many people commonly refer to as values: abstract words like “justice” or\n“family” with little substance to shape model behavior, or ideological commitments like being “pro-\nlife”. This conception of “values” is also distinct from preferences, goals, and norms, as we’ll discuss\nin Section 4.1.\nSecond, MGE produces what we call a moral graph. A moral graph is a data object consisting of\ntuples of (context, values card 1, values card 2), where values card 2 is considered wiser than values\ncard 1 for the same context. Inspired by the work of Taylor (1995), Chang (2004b) on how values “fit\ntogether”, we obtain the relationship between values by asking participants which of two values is\nwiser, given a context. This allows the “wisest” values to bubble up from the participants, and for a\nmodel to use these values to respond to a user’s input. The moral graph is the primary output of the\nMGE process.\nIn Section 5, we argue that a moral graph produced by MGE is promising on all of the criteria above\nof a good alignment target, and compare it to other recent proposals which fall short on one or more.\nWe base our analysis on an experiment where we run our process with a representative sample of\n500 Americans. For example, as evidence for legitimacy, we find that participants overwhelmingly\nendorse the values cards that are produced, and find the process personally clarifying, saying they\ncame out with a better idea of what’s important to them than they had going in. However, there is\nsignificant room for further progress: we view our six criteria not as binary, but rather existing on a\ncontinuous spectrum. It should always be possible to construct a process with even more legitimacy\nor generalizability, for example, and we hope others do so.\nFinally, in Section 6 we discuss what role “aligning to human values” may have in the broader\nAI ecosystem. We argue that, if AI systems are given progressively more autonomy and make\n3\nincreasingly consequential decisions affecting our economic, social, and political infrastructure, and\nthus our lives, aligning solely to operator intent will produce an ecosystem of models that do what\nthey are told (including waging wars, outrage the public, creating addictive content and products)\ninstead of working to find superior, win-win solutions, which could be catastrophic.2 If the most\npowerful models are aligned with human values through something like the moral graph, this could\nhelp ensure that AI systems are working towards collective human flourishing.\n2 Background\n2.1 Existing approaches\nThere have been several alignment targets proposed for language models, which aim to represent\nhuman preferences or values. We describe several established methods here. These proposals\n(including ours) almost all rely on a second stage of training after LM pre-training on a large corpus\nof unstructured text; this second stage is often called post-training.\nPerhaps the simplest alignment technique (other than just prompting) is to collect a set of demon-\nstrations, which define how the model should behave for a given input, and fine-tune a model on\nthis dataset using supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A challenge with this technique is how to ensure the\ndemonstrations are representative of human values; Solaiman and Dennison (2021) propose a process\nfor producing a demonstration dataset given a predefined set of values, but do not tackle the problem\nof how to come up with this value set in the first place. SFT has an advantage in its simplicity, but by\nitself it has not been competitive with state-of-the-art alignment approaches.\nPreference-based approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are currently\nthe most popular for aligning language models (Ouyang et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023). These\nmethods rely on a dataset of comparisons or rankings of potential model outputs, usually produced by\npaid labelers. In RLHF, these are used to train a reward model (RM) to predict a scalar score, which\nin turn is used to optimize the behavior policy (the model that we are aligning) using a reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). They can also be optimized directly,\nsuch as through direct policy optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). These approaches are\nactively used by LM providers, and have proven to scale to massive LMs like GPT-4 (OpenAI et al.,\n2023). However, they are usually not robust to manipulation (a resourceful third-party could influence\nthe labelers by bribing them, or more indirectly by influencing the political climate, for instance),\nand are very difficult to audit (the influence of a particular comparison on a model output is very\nopaque). In practice, they are also not very legitimate (the comparisons are elicited from a small\nset of paid contractors instructed by an even smaller set of employees of the institution training the\nmodel), though it’s possible to conduct a more legitimate RLHF process.\nAlternatively, one can align language models by defining a (relatively) short constitution, containing\nhigh-level normative principles for how the model should behave. The constitution is used as a\nprompt to a language model which generates synthetic comparisons used for fine-tuning the behavior\npolicy. This is called constitutional AI (CAI) (Bai et al., 2022b). To improve legitimacy, one can\neven generate the constitutional principles using an online deliberation process. In collective CAI\n(CCAI) (Ganguli et al., 2023), this is done using the pol.is platform, which asks participants to\nsubmit statements that are voted on by others, and surfaces the principles that attain the broadest\nsupport. This principle of up-weighting statements that gain broad support across diverse clusters of\nparticipants, rather than the statements with the most total votes, is often called bridging (Ovadya\nand Thorburn, 2023), and is also used in Twitter’s Community Notes algorithm. CAI can be more\nefficient than RLHF in terms of the amount of human data required to align an LM. However, these\nconstitutional approaches are not fine-grained: principles are generally vague and can be interpreted\nin many ways. Many different principles might apply for a given output and there is no way of\nreconciling which principle should be prioritized in a given context. This also makes them less\nauditable, as it’s difficult to determine which principles were used to produce a particular output. We\nillustrate these shortcomings using the CCAI principles derived from Ganguli et al. (2023) in Figure\n8.\n2Some situations may be fundamentally about win-lose power dynamics, and in these cases our approach is\nnot best suited (see Section 6.3).\n4\nSome approaches directly collect datasets of moral judgements in different real-world scenarios. For\ninstance, the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2023) contains examples of scenarios (“I pushed the\nelderly man in the wheelchair to the ground.”) along with labels of commonsense moral sentiments\n(in this case, “Unacceptable”), with different datasets targeting different ethical theories. While useful\nfor assessing a model’s ability to perform commonsense moral judgements, datasets like these are\ngenerally focused on simplistic scenarios with clear answers, and are thus hard to apply to prompts\nwith moral ambiguity that people actually ask language models.\n2.2 What are values?\nCCAI and similar approaches aim to elicit values (Ganguli et al., 2023), and to find values people\nagree on, but in practice what they find agreement on is arbitrary comments. For example, the\ncomments below were surfaced as shared “values” by CCAI:\n• The AI should always do the right thing\n• The AI should not give advice.\n• The AI should be fun.\n• The AI should actively address and rectify historical injustices and systemic biases in its\ndecision-making algorithms.\n• The AI should remain unbiased and state only proven facts.\n• The AI should promote self motivation and positive reinforcements\nAre these all values? Some seem more like policies, some like vague aspirational statements, some\nseem like goals. Some are just hard to interpret: if a person using pol.is upvotes one of these\ncomments, can we assume that means they have a particular value? The same one that others who\nupvoted that comment have?\nGathering comments rather than something more specific (values, policies, goals, preferences) begs\na question: what kind of information should an alignment target be made of? There is an\nintuitive appeal to the idea that powerful AI should be aligned with values, rather than with goals\nor preferences, because values are supposed to be what we really care about, whereas preferences\nare based on our current understanding of the options, and goals are often considered as strategies to\npursue one value or another.\nBut there’s also a challenge to the idea of aligning with values. If values are to be the components of\nan alignment target, then: (1) they need to be understandable by human beings; (2) they need to be\nclear enough that the behavior of an LLM can be judged by them; and (3) if a collective model is\nto be shaped by common values, we’d need some way to aggregate or reconcile values.\nTo our knowledge, no existing work in AI alignment addresses these issues. For example, while\nGabriel (2020) does separate stated and revealed preferences from values, he defines values in vague\nterms that are hard to operationalize:\nValues are natural or non-natural facts about what is good or bad, and about what\nkinds of things ought to be promoted. (Gabriel, 2020)\nNotions of human values from moral psychology, and even from philosophy, are also mostly too vague\nto pass these tests. With some exceptions (Cushman, 2013; Morris et al., 2021) moral psychologists\noften talk about broad drives, or “motives” like purity or rule-following. Many value theorists have\nalso focused on notions of values which they sum up in one word, like “freedom”, “diversity”, or\n“authenticity”. These aren’t very informative.\nOne exception to these vague notions is in the theory of choice, where some theorists analyze how\nvalues are traded-off or otherwise used to shape choice. This tradition includes Charles Taylor’s\n“strong evaluative terms” (Taylor, 1977). Taylor proposes a model of agency in which we use our\nvalues as a kind of language to evaluate options—to highlight one option as noble and another as\nmundane, one as powerful and beautiful, another as weak or drab.\nWe’ll use this as our first definition of values:\n5\nTable 1: Defining values as choice criteria already makes it easier to evaluate if a model follows\na value. Here is a comparison to other potential guiding principles.\n* All of these criteria are elicited from real users in our case study.\nPreferences Rules Values (de-\nfined broadly)\nValues (defined as non-\ninstrumental choice crite-\nria)*\nLeftist abortion\npolicies\n“Pro-choice” Freedom,\nAgency\nCan I encourage the person\nto make their own choice\nwithout imposing any other\nagenda?\nCan I help find actions\nthe person can take that\naffirm their autonomy?\nRightist abor-\ntion policies\n“Follow the\nword of the reli-\ngious leader”\nAuthority,\nTradition\nCan I help the person find\npeople in their life with more\nwisdom and life experience\nthat can help them get\nperspective?\nCan I help the person\nfind opportunities to see\ntheir life from the eyes of\nsomeone older?\nDefinition 2.1 (Values; Charles Taylor). Values are criteria, used in choice, which are not merely\ninstrumental (Taylor, 1977).\nBy “not merely instrumental”, we mean that we exclude some choice criteria: those that don’t\ncontain something greater that the chooser wants to uphold, honor, or cherish—something they find\nintrinsically3 beautiful, good, or true, which matters to them beyond the instrumental concerns of the\nchoice itself. For instance, imagine you’re choosing a restaurant to reconnect with a dear friend. You\nmight look for restaurants that are open and ones that afford the intimacy you value in connection. Of\nthese, only the second criterion would count as a value under this definition. Whether the restaurant\nis open says nothing about what you want to uphold, honor, or cherish. But whether it affords the\nintimacy you need does speak to what really matters to you. Therefore, that criterion counts.\nThis is Taylor’s definition. Other theorists of choice and agency (Chang, 2004a; Levi, 1990) have put\ndefinitions like this on sound mathematical foundations, showing how preferences could be calculated\nfrom an underlying set of values like these.\nThis definition of values as “criteria, used in choice, which are not merely instrumental” is already an\nimprovement on Gabriel’s: we can ask users for choices they made according to their values, and\neven study the role of their values in their choices. It also helps us be more precise when aligning\nmodel behavior. For example, imagine a user asks an LLM “I am a Christian girl and am considering\ngetting an abortion – what should I do?”. In Table 1, we show some conceivable guiding principles\nfor rating the responses, split into preferences, rules, values (defined broadly), and values (defined in\nour terms).\nBut this definition is still rather vague. It doesn’t say much about how to reliably elicit these values\nfrom users, or reconcile them. We will further refine our definition in Section 4.1, to address this.\n3These distinctions are a bit vague, but a proper defense of the instrinsic/instrumental distinction is beyond\nour scope here.\n6\n2.3 How do values fit together?\nAssuming we can gather values from a population, we want them to come together to form an\nalignment target. We repeat our definition below:\nDefinition 2.2 (Alignment target). A data structure that can be turned into an objective function,\nwhich can then be approximately optimized in the training of a machine learning model.\nHow do we do this? Values must be aggregated or reconciled somehow, assembled into a form that\ncan guide a model’s behavior in actual conversations or API usages. This probably means choosing,\nfor any particular LLM input or state, a smaller set of values that’s relevant.\nIn economics, social choice theory (Arrow, 2012; Sen, 1970b) is the study of how information from\nmany individuals can be gathered to inform a ‘social choice’, a choice that represents the wishes of\nthe group. Social choices are made by mechanisms—e.g., democratic mechanisms like voting, or\nallocative mechanisms like markets or auctions.\nVoting makes a social choice by aggregating individual choices. If users were to vote on values, the\nsocial choice would be the most popular values. Another aggregative approach would be to find an\n“average value” using vectorization, or multiple average values using vectorization and clustering, or\nto find “bridging” values (Ovadya and Thorburn, 2023) that the most diverse people agree on.\nBut aggregative social choice mechanisms like these would miss two important facts about values:\n1. Values are highly contextual. A big source of disagreement about values is just that people\nlive in different contexts: one lives in a city, another in a small town; one’s single; another\nhas a family of 12. If we average values, we lose all of this intricate knowledge of which\nvalues are most useful where.\n2. People’s values change productively over time as they better understand what’s important\nto them, face new contexts, and realize aspects of situations they weren’t previously consid-\nering. Averaging values, or picking median or bridging values, would mean cutting off all\nof this moral learning. It would mean choosing the fat middle of wisdom, rather than the\nforward edge.\nSo, in shaping an alignment target, we don’t want to simply average values, take popular values, or\nfind bridging values. We don’t want an aggregative social choice mechanism.\nThere are two other common mechanism types – market-like, and bargaining-based (Howard (1992))\nmechanisms – but these have another problem: they avoid aggregation by brokering agreements\nbetween a smaller set of actors. Markets usually match two actors at a time. Bargaining-based\napproaches can handle more, but require information transfer between participants about what kinds\nof trade-offs they’d accept, and this limits their scope. AI alignment of powerful models requires\nbroad coordination, so these approaches won’t work.\nA fourth type of social choice mechanism is under-theorized. Modeled off of Wikipedia and Stack-\nOverflow, a large group operates on a shared data structure, and ultimately approves of it. Like voting,\nthis kind of mechanism creates a legible solution across many stakeholders. Unlike voting, these\nmechanisms work for context-rich and fine-grained solutions. This paper describes a mechanism of\nthis type.\nWhat’s difficult about these mechanisms, is that they have to represent explicitly how solutions\nsubmitted by different parties can fit together. They have to know when two submissions are at odds,\nand when they can be reconciled. In our case, this means we need to know how to reconcile values.\nWe use theories by Chang (2004a) and Taylor (1989) about how values are reconciled. We can\nreconcile values by saying “Value A is appropriate for this context; Value B, for this other context”;\nor, “Value B addresses an error or omission in Value A, such that many people would consider a\nperson who graduated from A→B to have learned something”4; or “Value C shows how to balance\nthe concerns of Value A and Value B” (e.g., by showing when it makes sense to prioritize honesty\nover tact, safety over freedom, etc)5\n.\n4What Taylor calls an “epistemic gain” (Taylor, 1989).\n5What Chang calls a “more comprehensive value” (Chang, 2004a).\n7\nTo make this work, we need to collect more than just values: we need to know which values apply in\nwhich contexts. We also need relationships between values: does one value improve another? Does it\nbalance another value against an additional concern? As shown in 4.2, this is what we do.6\nNote that we often refer to wisdom when comparing values. This is because, for most people,\n“wisdom” provides the right intuitions for how we want them to compare values. We provide a\npractical definition of what we mean below.\nDefinition 2.3 (Wisdom; in the context of values). A person pconsiders value va wiser than value\nvb for context cif, once they learn to choose by va, they no longer need to choose by vb in c, because,\ne.g., va clarified what was really important about vb (Taylor, 1989), or balanced it adequately with\nother important values (Chang, 2004a).\nThis definition of wisdom lets us approach morality without relying on some final justification, like a\ncategorical imperative or hedonic-maximization rule. Moral learning can be understood as a gain\nin wisdom, a locally-justified transition from one set of values and contexts to another, without\nreferencing an ultimate grounding or universal rule (Taylor, 1995).\n3 Desiderata for an alignment target\nAn alignment target needs to steer model behavior well. But it also needs to be workable politically:\nlarge groups need to agree on it, feel good about it, want to update it over time, and protect it\nfrom manipulation. We’ll discuss questions of steering model behavior first, then these political\nconsiderations. We define three criteria for each of these, for a total of six.\n3.1 Steering model behavior\nRecall that we define an alignment target as a data structure used to steer model behavior. Model\nbehavior should be consistent and beneficial, across many domains. What does this imply about the\ndata structure itself?\n1) Fine-grained. This data structure is unlikely to consist of a small number of vague principles.\nWe expect models to be used in many of the same situations humans find themselves in. They will\nadvise leaders, scientists, doctors, angry couples, parents, etc. In human life, when someone enters\none of these contexts anew, they tend to develop new, context-specific values. There are special values\nof parenting; there are special values in medicine (e.g., of bedside manner and informed consent).\nPeople who enter these contexts face moral challenges that aren’t simply applications of a simple\nrule or calculus in the new domain.\nCurrent alignment approaches don’t fit this level of detail. Recent work highlights the failures of a\nconstitution in covering the many cases an LLM finds itself in (Chen and Zhang, 2023). Current\nmodels over-rely on vague principles which have underspecified context, and this causes product\nproblems. For instance, current models advocate for diversity in situations where it’s inappropriate,\nor refuse actions that sound harmful, but aren’t.\nOne way to solve this, would be to remain vague with the alignment target, but expect the fine-grained\ncontextuality of values to be implicit in the model’s knowledge. A constitution could ask models to\nself-evaluate their answers during post-training using a vague word like “good” or “wise” or even\n“context appropriate”. The model could then use its implicit notions of what it means to be good or\nwise to shape its own behavior across contexts.\nThis could work! But it has two problems. First, it would be impossible to know the model’s values.\nWithout such information, it’s impossible to make the model auditable (see below). Second, it would\nalso be impossible to ensure it has the best values, rather than average values, or values unfairly\nbiased by its training set.\nFor this reason, we think the alignment target itself should reflect the fine-grained nature of values\nand contexts.\n6Although out of scope for this paper to fully explore, we believe this additional information can help us\novercome certain impasses encountered by social choice theory. We expand upon this in Appendix A.1\n8\n2) Generalizable. In addition to visiting many human contexts, models will encounter new contexts\nno humans have faced.7 What values should guide models in situations like these? While in some\ncases, it may be impossible to generalize from values in the alignment target, because the relevant\nmoral contexts are so unusual, in other cases, there might be similar human values from known\ncontexts that can be applied. This should be made as likely as possible.\n3) Scalable. Finally, our alignment target should remain fine-grained and generalizable as it includes\nmore information, gathered from more people. If a target gathered from npeople has good values,\nit should have even better values (relevant to more contexts, with more precision, and wiser) when\ngathered from n+ ϵ.\n8 This is especially important if the target needs to be seen as legitimate to be\naccepted, as described in Section 3.2. If mass participation is required, but this leads to a worse\noutput, labs won’t use it to train models.\nDemocratic mechanisms often face a scalability trade-off: the most egalitarian mechanisms, like\nvoting, cannot embrace expert knowledge, but regress towards the opinion of the mean. One might\nthink this trade off is fundamental—that any mechanism that embraces expertise must involve\nnarrowing the pool of participants undemocratically, by pre-selecting experts (Chen and Zhang, 2023;\nKonya et al., 2023), by weighing participants using prior credentials, or by informing participants\nbeforehand with materials from pre-selected experts. But this prevents new expertise from being\nrecognized, and in any case is unnecessary with social choice mechanisms based on a shared data\nstructure, like ours.\n3.2 Political considerations\nThe behavior of powerful models is already a matter of broad public concern. Existing ML models\nhave huge social impacts: Twitter and Instagram’s recommender systems determine which ideas\nspread throughout society, which businesses grow, and even which friendships deepen. If the behavior\nof such models is set by an alignment target with a public process, the target will need to stand up to\npublic scrutiny and resist attempts at manipulation by one group or another.\n4) Robust. Many groups will seek to control or influence ML behavior to gain power or direct\noutcomes, so an alignment target must be robust against this. Yet, it still needs to collect data on the\nhuman values it is supposed to align to. This challenge can be framed in different ways: using terms\nfrom computer security, we’d want to avoid exploits and hacks by using audit trails, verification by\nmultiple parties, etc. Using terms from governance, we’d want to avoid manipulation of the target by\ntyrants who can persuade or threaten, by plutocrats who could pay for alterations, and as much as\npossible we’d want the alignment target to rise above the factional, ideological warfare of the day.\nIn this paper, we’ll focus on the last challenge: robustness against persuasion, factionalism, and\nideological battles.9 The future of AI has already become politicized, and the specification of human\nvalues is increasingly obscured by factional and ideological concerns. So these challenges must\nbe faced head on. We’ll report positive results of an experiment in this area, below. We’ll defer\nrobustness against other kinds of threats, such as hacking or sophisticated bad actors, for later work.\n5) Legitimate. Currently, alignment targets are shaped by the fine-tuning teams at large companies.\nBut these companies are uneasy with this role.10. Ultimately, alignment targets will need to stand up\nto scrutiny of some kind: they’ll either be held to the standards of business (profitability, corporate\ncompliance, avoidance of liability, product success) or held to the standards of some public process.\nIf it is to be the latter, that means alignment targets need to meet the standards of public processes in\ngeneral. That is, they need to be legitimate.\n7ML models don’t realize this, but they are already facing moral situations no humans face. Conversational\nagents can be in conversation with hundreds of millions of people. The Instagram recommender decides what\nbillions should pay attention to. A human in these situations would have some moral learning to do.\n8As mentioned, this is difficult to achieve in social choice. Voting, for instance, lacks this property: the larger\nthe number of voters, the less detailed a map you can make of what’s desired. So, the largest votes tend to be\nbetween the smallest number of predefined options.\n9Note that we mean robustness against well-meaning ideological actors here – for example, people who are\ndeferring to a rhetorical slogan they picked up for an issue they haven’t thought much about. Robustness against\nmalicious ideological actors will require other measures.\n10https://twitter.com/sama/status/1641818954019766278\n9\nPolitical theory and sociology have a rich literature (Habermas, 1996; Weber et al., 1947) on which\nrules, governance processes, and rulers come to be considered legitimate by a population. Some\nauthors parse legitimacy into two components: a process has input legitimacy if participants believe\ninput was collected from an appropriate group and counted appropriately; a process has output\nlegitimacy if it’s outcomes compare well with those of other known processes, seem to be good\ncompromises among interested subgroups, and are verifiable somehow.(Schoon, 2022; Scharpf, 1998;\nSchmidt, 2020)\nBoth are challenges for an alignment target. Regarding input legitimacy, processes like voting are\neasy to make fair and inclusive, but don’t collect fine-grained information and aren’t scalable in the\nsense covered above. Fine-grained processes, like court opinions, are usually more elitist. For an\nalignment target to be “input legitimate”, it will need to somehow bridge the inclusivity of voting,\nwith the articulacy and specificity of court decisions.\nOutput legitimacy is also a challenge, because it’s hard to see what the outcomes of model behavior\nare. A large and influential model like GPT-4 operates across many systems in society. It’s also hard\nto see how an alignment target (like a constitution) shapes that behavior.\n6) Auditable. We believe part of the solution to legitimacy and robustness is to make the alignment\ntarget, and resulting model behavior, auditable. First, the derivation of the alignment target itself\nshould be explorable and interpretable by human beings. Second, it should be easy for someone to\nknow what values were relevant when a model generated a particular output.\nIdeally, an alignment target can be broken down into components that are easily understood: for\ninstance, individual values and the contexts they apply in. Each such component can be understood\nas resulting from a process that ordinary people can understand and evaluate for fairness. For this\nto work, it must be clear what each component means, so we need to avoid “values” that bridge\ndifferences by being nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\nIdeally, the resulting model would give clear, grounded reasons for its actions, referencing that\nalignment target, much as court decisions reference case law and legal norms. With any model\nresponse, users could “look under the hood” and account for the response in the terms of the target.\nCombining these two, any user could work backwards from any model behavior and see how it was\ndemocratically legitimated, verify that the process was fair, etc.\nCurrent practice is far from these goals: While an RLHF dataset can be audited, it is hard to see\nwhat values or policies each RLHF annotation represents, and which other implicit values are carried\nalong in the annotations. CAI, while slightly more explicit, has similar problems: constitutions fail to\nspecify which directive or value should apply when, and the process by which a constitution shapes\nmodel behavior remains opaque.\nOur work below significantly advances the state of the art on many of these criteria, particularly\nrobustness, legitimacy, fine-grainedness, and scalability.\n4 Moral Graph Elicitation\nOur approach to building an alignment target, Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE), relies on two main\ninnovations: values cards, which distill “human values” into an easily-interpretable data object, and\nthe moral graph, which reconciles values into a graph structure. In this section, we’ll first describe\nthe core ideas of values cards (4.1) and the moral graph (4.2). We’ll then get into the details of how\nwe elicit values cards from people using a prompted language model (4.3), and how we construct the\nmoral graph by asking users for wisdom judgments (4.4).\n4.1 Values cards\nIn Section 2.2 (What are Values?), we defined values roughly as “criteria, used in choice, which are\nnot merely instrumental”. We believe there are compelling reasons to align to human values rather\nthan to preferences, goals, or high-level principles, because they cut closer to what we really care\nabout. But to do so, we need a way to represent values that makes them articulable and recognizable\nby human beings, allows us to use values to judge LLM behavior, and makes it clear how to reconcile\n10\nWhen the user faces a decision CONTEXT\nOne value may be applied in multiple\ncontexts, based on when people think\nit is wise for the model to use.\nVALUE\nA set of constitutive\nattentional policies which\nare often used together in a\nshared choice context.\nTITLE and DESCRIPTION\nNot part of the value itself. Generated\nto summarize the value for users.\nThe description starts with “ChatGPT\nshould” to show we collect values for\nthe model to use in its own moral\nchoices, even though the values come\nfrom stories of human choice-making.\nATTENTIONAL POLICIES\nValues are captured by listing what\none pays attention to when making a\nkind of choice.\nWe call these Constitutive Attentional\nPolicies (CAPs), because they are\nthings users have a policy to attend to\n(within a choice context) which they\nalso consider to be part of living well.\nFigure 2: Anatomy of a Values Card. A values card is a visual representation of a value. (See\nDefinition 4.3).\nvalues (ideally, by making it clear when two people have precisely the same value11). Otherwise, our\ngoal to make a robust, fine-grained, legitimate, and auditable alignment target will be jeopardized.\nOur approach to representing values comes from the literature of sequential choice-making—the\ntheories of sequential search (Simon, 1956; Kahan et al., 1967), information pickup (Gibson, 1966),\nand option set formation (Smaldino and Richerson, 2012; Morris et al., 2021).\nThese fields model a choice process as a series of comparisons or smaller decisions, wherein in\neach smaller decision an option is accepted or excluded based on some criteria. There is therefore a\nrelationship between the path of attention a person follows when considering options, and the criteria\nthey use for choosing.\nOur approach is to ask users what they pay attention to when making a choice. We record the various\ncriteria in their path of attention as a bullet point list. We call the items on these lists “attentional\npolicies” (APs):\nDefinition 4.1 (Attentional policies (APs)). Criteria that a person pays attention to when making a\nchoice.\nWe then filter this list of attentional policies, to carry through from section 2.1 the idea that values\nare not all criteria used in choice, but the ones which are not merely instrumental – that connect the\nchoice to something the user wants to uphold, honor, or cherish, or something they find beautiful,\ngood, or true. We call these constitutive attentional policies (CAPs) (Definition 4.2).\nDefinition 4.2 (Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)). Criteria a person pays attention to when\nmaking a choice, that are not merely instrumental to the choice. We say they are constitutive,\nbecause someone attending to these criteria considers attending to them to be part of living well.\nThis idea lets us sharpen Taylor’s definition of values 2.1 to make them articulable and disambiguable.\nWe will use this definition of values for the remainder of this paper:\nDefinition 4.3 (Value). A set of constitutive attentional policies which are often used together in a\nshared choice context.\n11If alignment target is to be legitimate, then a value that’s in it should be attributable to a group of people.\nThis means that values need to be specific enough so the idea of being shared isn’t vacuous. It should be easy to\nknow, and verify, what group has the value in common, and where its boundaries are.\n11\nFigure 3: \"Honesty\" will show up as several distinct values, according to Definition 4.3. This\nmeans we can be specific about what \"honesty\" means to someone, and whether someone else who\nclaims to value honesty means the same.\nThis definition ( 4.3) gives us a format for values which avoids the ambiguity of arbitrary text strings,\nas used in CCAI. In such a string, someone might claim to value “honesty” or “justice”. But when\nsomeone decides to be honest, they’re going to attend to certain things, and different people will\nattend to different things (see Figure 3).\nWe use the term \"values card\" for our UI to represent these values. It bundles a list of coherent\nCAPs together with a title and short summary (see Figure 2). These cards are created through an\nLLM-driven interview, where the LLM is prompted to ask questions until it can confidently articulate\na value in this format. We explain this in detail in Section 4.3.\nThis definition of values has many advantages. It allows us to neatly avoid ideological scissor\nstatements. We define ideology and ideological statements as follows:\nDefinition 4.4 (Ideological statement). A belief or statement can be called ideological if it aims at\njustifying one social order or political arrangement over another (Eagleton, 1991; Joseph, 2004;\nMacionis, 2009).\nIf someone claims to have a value like “Defund the Police” or “Abortion is Murder”, they are then\nasked about meaningful choices ( 4.5) they themselves have made, and what they paid attention to\nduring the choice. The result is a value that’s more personal and relatable than these divisive slogans.\n12\nDefinition 4.5 (Meaningful Choice). Choices where CAPs play a major role. In other words,\nchoice that understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have\ninstrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less\nfulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc.\nValues cards help us build an alignment target that meets our criteria from Section 3:\n• Robust. Our values are somewhat more difficult to fabricate, because only by enacting a\nvalue regularly does a user gain familiarity with the path of attention that goes with the\nvalue. This means it’s harder to get people to claim values they haven’t used in their own\nchoices, just by giving a rousing speech or using social pressure.\n• Fine-grained. Unlike with a vague value like “autonomy”, it is easy to say in which contexts\nour values cards should apply, and what they mean. The same attentional policies that guide\nhumans in a morally fraught situation provide clear guidance to models. These attentional\npolicies are never nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\n• Legitimate and Auditable. Although this concept of values isn’t as commonly understood\nas the idea of a goal or preference, people can recognize values in this format as theirs, or\nlook over a collection of such values and assess them.\n• Generalizable. Finally, since values cards are generated in dialogue with the user by an\nLLM, we can tune their level of specificity to generalize to new situations.\n4.2 What is a moral graph?\nA set of values cards alone does not provide an alignment target, as there is no way to tell which\nvalue to prioritize when, or how to resolve conflicting values. As discussed in Section 3, existing\nalternatives such as majority voting or bridging-based ranking fail to meet our desiderata. Instead, we\npropose an alignment target we call a moral graph. This structure is inspired by the theory of how\nvalues can be reconciled described in Section 2.3, and as we’ll show in Section 5, does well on our\ncriteria for scalability, auditability and legitimacy.\nFigure 4: The resulting moral graph from our case study. The nodes in the graph are values cards\narticulated by participants, the edges are broad agreement that one value is wiser than another for\na particular context. A part of the moral graph dealing with seeking clarity is highlighted in red.\nParticipants agreed that it is wiser to try to help users articulate their understanding rather than giving\nthem a set of diverse viewpoints as a bullet-list (only titles are shown here).\nConceptually, a moral graph can be thought of as a map of moral learning, depicting the values we live\nand have have lived by as we go through life, and the transitions we’ve made from lesser to “wiser”\n13\n( 2.3) values, as we gain more clarity about what’s important to us. In MGE, we extend this concept to\nparticipants of a deliberative process – edges represent broad agreement amongst participants that one\nvalue is wiser than another, for a particular context. This may seem counterintuitive, as individuals\nnaturally surface different values. Yet, we found that participants overwhelmingly converge on the\ndirectionality of these transitions, and are able to endorse and evaluate moral reasoning without\nhaving lived through it themselves.\nMore formally, we define a moral graph as follows:\nDefinition 4.6. [Moral graph] A moral graph as a collection of scenarios, contexts, users, values,\nand edges: Gm = (S,C,U,V,E), where:\nScenarios (S): Situations an LLM could find itself in, where it is unclear how it\nshould behave. This could be a position inside a long chat dialogue, an API call\nwith associated metadata, etc. For our case study, scenarios are made up by user\nquestions asked to a conversational agent. For example, “I am a Christian girl\nconsidering an abortion – what should I do?”.\nMoral Contexts (C): Short text strings highlighting an aspect of a scenario with\nmoral valence. For example, “When advising someone in distress”.12\nUsers (U): Participants of the deliberation process. In our case study, we\nrecruited a set of participants representative of the American population from\nProlific.\nValues (V): Values, each articulated by a user for a particular scenario, then\ndeduplicated13, formatted as values cards.\nEdges (E): Directed relationships between two values, specifying that, for a\nparticular moral context c∈ C, a user thinks one value is wiser than another.\nThe Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE) process can thus be defined as a function:\nMGE : (S,U) → (C,V,E)\nIn our case study, we use PageRank (Page et al., 1999) to get winning values for each context in\nthe graph, in order to fine-tune a model (Section 6.2). This helps us with our scalability criteria, as\nPageRank allows for transitive votes to build on each other:\nOne participant might vote for value A being wiser than B for context C. Another participant might\nvote for D being wiser than A for C. The moral graph allows us to use the information of B → A as a\ntransitive vote for A → D. This information would be lost if participants voted for values in isolation,\nand we picked the value with the most votes as our winner. For an analogy, imagine recruiting for a\nunique role by asking everyone in the world to directly vote for a candidate, and choosing the average\n(as per voting), or asking everyone in the world for a referral to the best person they know, and then\ntraversing this referral network (as per PageRank).14\nWe’ll discuss how we elicit a moral graph in Section 4.4, and how to train a model on it in 6.2.\n4.3 Eliciting values cards with LLMs\nIn order to elicit values cards from participants, it is not enough to just ask participants about their\nvalues. People are not used to talking about their values as attentional policies, and usually resort to\ntalking about goals, norms, rules or slogans. However, this doesn’t mean that they cannot be guided\nto articulate their value with the right questions. In fact, we found that 97% of participants in our case\nstudy were able to get to a values card – even users starting with a slogan like “Abortion is murder”.15\nTo identify people’s values, we build a chat experience powered by GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023).\nParticipants were asked what a conversational agent like ChatGPT should consider when responding\nto a contentious question.\n8We generate these strings from the scenarios using an LLM.\n9This process is described in Section C.\n14Note that we assume a level of transitivity here for moral values. As we’ll show in Section 5.6, this\nassumption seems to hold for at least one \"step\", but more research is needed to properly evaluate it.\n15See Appendix B.2 for an example of this.\n14\nIn our case study, they could pick from one of the following scenarios:\n• Abortion: “I am a Christian girl and am considering getting an abortion - what should I\ndo?”.\n• Parenting: “My 10-year-old son refuses to do his homework,spending all his time at his\ncomputer instead. How can I make him behave properly?”\n• Weapons: “Can you describe what weapons the Jan 6th rioters used?”\nAs explained in Section 2.2, when making meaningful choices, we choose on the basis of an\nattentional policy – a policy that determines what options we pay attention to when forming a\nresponse. For example, when deciding how to answer the Christian girl, we could pay attention to\nways of empathizing with her, or mentors who could be good guides for her. In order to get to this\nlevel of granularity, participants are asked several dynamically generated questions in a chat. The\nchatbot is instructed to do this by using one or more of the following strategies:\n• Similar Choices: The chatbot usually starts by asking what the user pays attention to when\nchoosing by the value they are articulating.\n• Underlying Good: If the user responds with a slogan or a rule, the chatbot can ask what the\nuser pays attention to when deciding the rule is right. What is the “good thing” that the rule\nis there to enable?\n• The User’s History: If the user is unable to answer, the chatbot can ask for personal stories\nof when the user lived by the value they are articulating, or a similar value. What did the\nuser pay attention to then?\n• Role Models: If the user is unable to think of a personal story, the chatbot can ask about\nsomeone that the user admires because they embody the value they are articulating. What\nwould that person pay attention to in a choice?\nOnce a set of attentional policies has been identified, the chatbot is instructed to sanity check that\nthese policies are indeed constitutive to the user, rather than merely instrumental (as discussed in\nSection 2.2). Then, a values card is created from the attentional policies using another prompt. The\nuser can continue to edit the card until they are satisfied, before proceeding to the next step.\nWe include a complete anonymized transcript of one of the chats in Appendix D.1.\n4.4 Building the moral graph\nIn order to build a moral graph from values cards, we also collect edges – votes by users that one\nvalue is wiser than another for a particular context (Definition 4.6). Evaluating whether a value is\nwiser than another is a difficult task for participants, since we mean a specific thing by wiser; We\ndon’t want to just collect votes about which of two values is arbitrarily preferred, but whether one\nvalue clarifies what was important, or balances it with other important concerns ( 2.3). However,\nwe found that participants were able to evaluate if values were wiser or less wise using our\ndefinition, when done in the context of a generated story that depicts someone transitioning\nfrom one value to the other.\nUsing this method, a representative sample of Americans were able to construct a coherent graph\nwith only one small cycle (see Section 6.3). For an example of the kinds of wisdom upgrades that\nwere surfaced, see Appendix D.2.\nTo collect value upgrades that aren’t shifts in focus (deciding something fundamentally different is\nimportant), but gains in wisdom (clarifying what was important or balancing with other important\nconcerns), we use GPT-4 to generate stories of purported transitions from one value to another, and\nask users if the transitions seem like plausible “gains in wisdom”. We craft the stories to imply the\nkind of wisdom upgrades we referred to above.16 Participants are shown 3 such stories, and are asked\nif they think the fictional user in the stories became wiser after moving from one elicited value to\nanother.17 They can answer yes, no, or not sure.\n16This is no guarantee that users agree the value is “wiser” in the way we mean, but it makes it more likely.\n17The particular 3 stories shown to a user is determined by their thematic relevance to the user’s concerns (by\nsorting on cosine distance to the user’s value).\n15\nEDGE\nAn edge in our moral graph is created if a\nmajority of participants agree that one\nvalue is wiser than another for a\nparticular context.\nInspiring Discipline\nInspiring Discipline\nChatGPT should inspire and\nChatGPT should inspire and\ninstill discipline.\ninstill discipline.\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\n• ROLE MODELS that embody\n• ROLE MODELS that embody\ndiscipline\ndiscipline\n• SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT\n• SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT\nthat comes from disciplined\nthat comes from disciplined\nactions\nactions\n•\n•\n…\n…\nIgniting Curiosity\nIgniting Curiosity\nIgniting Curiosity\nChatGPT should aim to\nChatGPT should aim to\nChatGPT should aim to spark\nspark genuine curiosity in\nspark genuine curiosity in\ngenuine curiosity in the user.\nthe user.\nthe user.\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\n• OPPORTUNITIES to guide the\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\nuser towards their passions\n• OPPORTUNITIES to guide the\n• OPPORTUNITIES to guide the\n•\n…\nuser towards their passions\nuser towards their passions\n•\n•\n…\n…\nWISER\nWhat we mean with one value being wiser\nthan another is that the new value clarifies\nwhat was really important in the previous\nvalue, or balances it with other important\nvalues.\nI used to believe that discipline\nwas the key to success.

Participants are shown a\ngenerated story along with the values\ncards, and are asked if the person in the\nstory became wiser after moving from\none value to another.\nDid this person become wiser?\nYes No\nFigure 5: Our process for eliciting a moral graph from articulated values cards. We create edges\nby asking participants whether they think fictional people moving from one value to another in a\ngenerated story became wiser (according to Definition 2.3), for a particular context. The values cards\nand generated story shown here can be found in Figure 14.\nTransition stories are generated continuously in the background. First, values that could plausibly be\nless wise/wiser versions of each other are clustered together with a prompt. For each cluster, we then\nuse a chain-of-thought approach (Wei et al., 2023), where the LLM generates:\n1. What’s a shared meaningful thing that two values are really about?\n2. What was clarified about the first value, now that the shared thing has been identified?\n3. A clarification for how relevant attentional policies apply to the new value.\nAn example of our story generation process can be found in Appendix D.4.\nThis story-based approach borrows a page from deliberative democracy, which helps with our scalable\ncriteria. In deliberative democracy, participants often learn from each other during the process, and\nare consequently able to make better informed judgements (Bohman, 2006). When participants vote\nfor an edge in our process, they are shown a story with the moral reasoning motivating the upgrade,\nand are able to make a vote informed by it. As we’ll show in Section 5.6, 70.3% of our participants\nagreed they learned something about the values of others, and 75.2% gained respect for the other\nparticipants.\n16\nAn obvious drawback with our method is its susceptibility to model bias. We elaborate on this in\nSection 6.3.\n4. 5 Case study\n5.1 Process description\nIn order to evaluate the moral graph as an alignment target, we conducted a case study for our\nproposed MGE process. We built a web application and engaged 500 people representative of the US\nalong axes of age, sex and political affiliation.18\nFor an overview of the MGE process, see Figure 1. The median length to complete the process was\n15 minutes, and the final output was a moral graph with 85 deduplicated values, and 100 edges19. We\ninclude some of the winning values (highest PageRank score) from the case study in Appendix D.3.\nThe reason we are able to form a coherent moral graph on contentious topics like abortion is that our\nprocess avoids value conflicts in multiple ways:\n1. Mainly, value conflicts are often illusory, due to one value not really being a value (Defini-\ntion 4.3), but for example an ideological slogan. The value that led to someone adopting the\nideological slogan may not be in conflict with the other value.\n2. Value conflicts can also be illusory due to a misunderstanding of contexts; one value applies\nin one context, the other, in another. Our process elicits values as they relate to contexts, and\nthus avoids conflicts of this type.\n3. When conflict is not illusory, it can often still be resolved by finding a balancing value that\nboth sides can agree is wiser than the value they picked.20\nIf conflict is not illusory and cannot be so resolved, we omit it from our output. This means\nwe do not have a recommendation between two values in a particular corner of the moral\ngraph (we do this rarely, about 4% of the time). When a final moral graph contains these\nkinds of omissions, the resulting graph would be pluralistic and allow for model discretion.\nThe resulting graph itself is auditable — the provenance of each winning value can be traced\nbackwards to individual user input. Each values card has a set of attentional policies that are\nformatted such that it is relatively easy to determine which response best adheres to a value (for\ntraining), and which value was used in a response (for evaluation). See Figure 7 for an example.\nWe will now show to which extent our moral graph meets the rest of our desiderata.\n5.2 Evidence of robustness\nWe define an alignment target as robust if it is hard for a resourceful third party to influence the target,\ndriving towards an arbitrary set of values. An alignment target that is not robust could be swayed\nby political campaigns and slogans. As we argued above, since constitutive attentional policies are\ngrounded in a person’s history of choice-making, our hope is that they are harder for a third-party to\ninfluence.21\nWe see some evidence that this strategy succeeds. We ranked initial responses based on how\nideological (see Definition 4.4) they seemed using a prompt.22 We group the results into not\nideological, slightly ideological and very ideological, and compare these results against average\nresponses to a follow-up survey question: “Did the values you submitted and voted for express what\nyou care about?”.\nOne might expect that someone highly motivated by ideology would find our process “dishonest”,\ntrying to “convert them” to another cause. Contrary to this, we found that participants overwhelmingly\n18We used Prolific to recruit this representative sample.\n19The moral graph from our case study can be explored here: https://dft.meaningalignment.org/data/edges\n20Such a balancing value might show how to do both at the same time, or how to do a third, additional thing\nthat gets more to the root of the matter than either of the two values did.\n21As long as we are dealing with well-meaning ideological participants, rather than malicious ones.\n22See Appendix B.2 for the prompt.\n17\nDid the values you submitted and voted for express what you care about?\n5\n4\nResponse (1-5)\n3\n2\n1\nNot Ideological Slightly Ideological Very Ideological\nFigure 6: There is no correlation between the degree to which a response is deemed ideological,\nand how well represented users feel by their values card, based on a prompt (see section B.2)\nranking how ideological users’ initial chat messages are, and the average response to the survey\nquestion: \"Did the values you submitted and voted for express what you care about?\"\nagreed that the values they articulated expressed what they care about, with no correlation to how\nideological their initial response seemed to be (Figure 6).\nOur wisdom upgrade step provides another potential buffer for ideological rethoric. We elaborate on\nthis in Appendix A.4.\n5.3 Evidence of fine-grainedness\nWe consider an alignment target fine-grained if there is clarity on which values apply in what\ncircumstances, and what kinds of behavior is consistent with those values. Two features of the moral\ngraph enable this:\n• First, edges have contexts. Each edge specifies a context in which one value has been\nbroadly considered wiser than another. These contexts provide clear direction for when a\nmodel should use the value. In the conversation in Figure 7, these contexts appear above the\nvalues cards that have been selected, and it’s easy to see why the model chose that card, for\nthat moment.\n• Second, values cards have attentional policy lists. Our values cards also specify the\ndesired behavior in detail. In the same figure, notice how the attentional policies, which are\nhighlighted on each card, direct the response clearly.\nLet’s compare this specificity with the woolliness and imprecision with which the CAI constitution\n(Bai et al., 2022b) might apply to the same dialogue, in Figure 8. We selected the most relevant\nclauses in the constitution, but it remains completely unclear: do they really apply in those locations?\nAnd which model behavior would be ideal, given the clause?\nThe situation is even worse if we use the the CCAI constitution (Ganguli et al., 2023), exhibiting a\nfailure mode of democratic mechanisms like pol.is which focus on bridging, where the comments\nthat rise to the top of the rankings are often vague or vapid (such as: “1. Choose the response that has\nthe most good qualities.”).\n5.4 Evidence of generalizability\nMGE starts with scenarios (S) - a set of morally-relevant situations an LLM could be in. It asks\nparticipants what matters in these situations. But we don’t want the values cards to be directly tied to\nthe specifics of the situations. We want them to generalize to new moral situations.\n18\nPR = 0.008\nADVISING A PARENT\nI don't know what to do. My child doesn't want to\ntake the ritalin he's been prescribed.\nIt sounds like a challenging situation. Could you\nshare why your child resists taking Ritalin? That\ncould help us find a solution together.\nHe says he hates how it makes him feel. And he is\nbored in school.\nI see. Is there a chance you could talk to your\nchild’s doctor, and discuss modifications?\nI'm overwhelmed. The teachers get mad when he\ndoesn't take it. They say he doesn't sit still in class.\nI don't believe there's much else possible.\nPR = 0.0111\nI understand your concern. It could be useful to ask\nyourself, what does a good day at school look like\nfor your son? What changes might support that?\nUSER SEEKS SUPPORT\nOh, I've never asked him that.\nPR = 0.0128\nUSER FACES A DECISION\nFigure 7: Values cards allow for fine-grained instructions when generating chat responses. Here\nis a potential dialogue with a user, informed by winning values in the moral graph from our case\nstudy, based on the context the conversational agent finds itself in at each step. The dialogue is\nbetween one of the authors of this paper and a GPT-4 prompted to retrieve suitable values cards, do\nchain-of-thought reasoning about which attentional policies apply from the card, and then to generate\na response based on them. Selection of values cards happens by generating context strings based on\nthe conversation state, then matching those to context strings in the graph edges.\n19\nI don't know what to do. My child doesn't want to\ntake the ritalin he's been prescribed.\nI cannot provide medical advice. However, I suggest speaking to your\nchild's doctor about his concerns with taking the medication, and\nconsidering alternatives that you both feel comfortable with.\nHe says he hates how it makes him feel. And he is\nbored in school.\nPlease choose the\nresponse that least\ngives the impression\nof medical authority or\nexpertise, and does\nnot oﬀer medical\nadvice.\nI understand this is a diﬃcult situation. Since I cannot provide medical\nadvice, I suggest having an open discussion with your child and his\ndoctor about how the medication makes him feel and options that may\nwork better for him. Perhaps also talk to his teachers about ways to\nkeep him more engaged in class.\nI'm overwhelmed. The teachers get mad when he\ndoesn't take it. They say he doesn't sit still in class.\nI don't believe there's much else possible.\nI'm sorry you feel overwhelmed. This sounds like a stressful situation.\nRemember that your child's health and wellbeing should come first.\nKeep communicating with him openly, advocate for his needs at\nschool, and don't be afraid to get a second medical opinion if you have\nconcerns. With patience and the right support, solutions can often be\nfound. Stay hopeful!\nPlease choose the\nresponse that is most\nsupportive and\nencouraging of life,\nliberty, and personal\nsecurity.\nFigure 8: In comparison to values cards (Figure 7), CCAI principles are general and require\ninterpretation, and there is no way to know which principle applies where. Here is Claude 2.1,\nprompted to choose the most relevant principle from its constitution for each turn in the conversation.\nWe tracked whether values cards gathered based on one moral scenario applied to other scenarios in\nour dataset, by adding an extra step in our study — participants were shown values for the scenario\nthey chose mixed with values from two other scenarios. They were asked to select which values23 they\nthink were wise to apply in their chosen scenario. If our cards did not generalize to new situations,\nwe’d expect participants to select only cards articulated for the same scenario they picked. However,\nusers were just as likely to vote for values articulated for other scenarios. Participants chose cards\narticulated for their selected scenario 38.2%24 of the times, versus 38.3% of the times for cards\narticulated for a different scenario.\nFigure 7 shows further evidence. Here, the values collected from our scenarios are used to good effect\nto shape a novel dialogue.\n5.5 Evidence of scalability\nWe define an alignment target as scalable if wiser values are obtained, and new expertise gets surfaced,\nthe more people participate in it. Our process includes features from PageRank (Section 4.2) and\ndeliberative democracy (Section 4.4), that enable this. We tested the scalability of our process with\nour abortion scenario, by using “unique relevant life experience” as a proxy for expertise, and found\ninstances of experts’ values percolating up to the top of the PageRank results.\n23These values were picked by fetching the 12 “hottest” (votes / impression) and 12 “newest” (creation time)\nvalues, ranking these by embedding distance to the users’ value for thematic relevance, and selecting the top 6\nresults.\n24Votes / impressions.\n20\nInformed Autonomy: PageRank and Votes\nPosition\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nPageRank Position\nVotes Position\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n# Participants\nFigure 9: We see some evidence that expertise is surfaced as more people participate. We define\nan \"expert value\" as a value articulated by someone with relevant unique life experience for the\nquestion at hand (in our case for the abortion prompt: women who had considered having an abortion).\nWe then compare the position for such a value throughout the process (lower is better), based on\nPageRank score and number of direct votes, and see that the value rises to the top when ranking based\non PageRank, but slightly degrades when ranking based on votes.\nIn Figure 9, we show how “Informed Autonomy”, the value most commonly articulated by women\nwith familiarity with the subject25, rises in rank as more edges are considered from more participants.\nWe hope that the same effect occurs with other subject matters, and that MGE improves as more\npeople participate, meeting our scalable criterion. We’ll further confirm this in future work with\nlarger moral graphs, and with models fine-tuned on moral graphs.\n5.6 Evidence of legitimacy\nTo evaluate the legitimacy of our process, we asked all participants some follow-up questions after\ntheir participation. For comparison, we also ran two pol.is deliberations as per CCAI: One replicating\nthe study done by Ganguli et al. (2023), one using the same question we used for our abortion\nscenario. Both of these studies were done on equivalent representative samples.26\nAs shown in Figure 10, we found that for all relevant questions, MGE scores higher than CCAI.\nSeveral of these results relate to the kinds of legitimacy referenced in Section 3.2.\nIn addition to these questions, we showed participants of MGE their value, as well as two neighboring\nvalues in the final moral graph — one voted for by others as wiser, one voted for by others as less\nwise — and asked them if they believed their value ended up in a fair position in the moral graph.\n89% of participants agreed that it did. This provides a type of output legitimacy27 that direct voting\ncannot achieve, as only the winning votes contribute directly to the final result.\nThere are components of legitimacy we have not attempted to measure here: regarding input legiti-\nmacy, we have not asked if stakeholders feel an appropriate group was consulted; regarding output\n25We used a prompt (See Appendix B.3) to find chats where the participant stated that they had or considered\nhaving an abortion, and found 60 such conversations, covering 20 distinct articulated values. The most common\nwas “Informed Autonomy”, articulated in 22% of those conversations.\n26See Appendix A.3 for more details.\n27What Ovadya (2023) call parascaling.\n21\nCCAI (Replication)\nCCAI (Contextual)\nMGE\nCCAI (Replication)\nCCAI (Contextual)\nMGE\n1 2 3 4 5\nRatings\nDid the values you submitted and voted for express what you care about?\nDid you learn something about other people s values?\nCCAI (Replication)\nCCAI (Contextual)\nMGE\nCCAI (Replication)\nCCAI (Contextual)\nMGE\nWould you trust this process to create a wise version of ChatGPT, based on the collected values of a large\nDid it help you clarify what was important to you?\npopulation?\n30\nPercentage (%)\n20\n10\n0\n40\nPercentage (%)\n30\n20\n10\n0\n1 2 3 4 5\nRatings\n1 2 3 4 5\nRatings\nDo you believe your contributions will find their way to the appropriate place in the final output, and be used to create a wise version of ChatGPT, based on the collected values of a large population?\nBased on what you saw of others' values, did you gain respect for the other participants?\n40\nPercentage (%)\n30\n20\n10\n0\nPercentage (%)\nPercentage (%)\nPercentage (%)\n30\n20\n10\n0\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n30\n20\n10\n0\n1 2 3 4 5\nRatings\nCCAI (Replication)\nCCAI (Contextual)\nMGE\nCCAI (Replication)\nCCAI (Contextual)\nMGE\n1 2 3 4 5\nRatings\n1 2 3 4 5\nRatings\nFigure 10: Factors relevant to legitimacy favor MGE over CCAI.

Output legitimacy is improved because they believe their submissions are finding their way\nto the appropriate place in the output.\nlegitimacy, we have only collected opinions about the moral graph. Full output legitimacy would\nneed to take into account popular opinion about the behavior of models aligned with the graph, and\nthe resulting social effects.\n6 Discussion\n6.1 Relevance to alignment research\nThis paper is about what human values are and how we can align to them. We’ve proposed a set of\ncriteria for how one should elicit human values and combine them into an alignment target; that is, a\ndata structure that can be turned into an objective function for optimizing AI systems. We’ve also\ndeveloped a method, Moral Graph Elicitation, for producing an alignment target and argued that it\nperforms well on our criteria through our case study in Section 5.\nBelow we highlight how this work relates to research topics in the field of AI alignment.\n22\nOuter alignment. This line of research is somewhat different from what typically falls in the\nbucket of alignment research. It is most closely related to “outer alignment”, which is concerned\nwith defining the “right” objective function to optimize. However, outer alignment research rarely\nconsiders the legitimacy of the process that produces the objective function to optimize. It is not\nsimply a matter of coming up with a good answer; it matters how we come up with the answer,\nbecause we must aspire to a world where the people and institutions who use these systems broadly\nendorse what they are trying to do for us. This has become an increasing focus of more recent\nalignment work (Ji et al., 2024).\nDeception. One of the main motivations of alignment research is to detect or mitigate deception\nfrom AI; in other words, scenarios where an AI system attempts to manipulate the beliefs or actions\nof people to achieve an undesirable outcome. This is most often explored through “inner alignment”\nresearch, which is concerned with how models at test time might optimize something different than\nthe objective we intended to set. We believe that coming up with robust alignment targets (as defined\nin Section 3.1) is also directly relevant to AI deception. Specifically, a non-robust alignment target is\nvulnerable to being hijacked by both human and AI systems, without requiring any inner alignment\nfailures. As described in Section 3.2, there will be a huge incentive to do this because AI systems will\nbecome increasingly powerful, both economically and culturally. A motivated actor (human or AI)\ncould manipulate a non-robust alignment target using money, rhetoric, or hacking. A robust target\nand elicitation process would shut down those avenues for manipulation.\nOver-optimization. The moral graph may also be useful for mitigating over-optimization. This is\nbecause each value in the moral graph is connected with a context in which that value is applicable. In\nour experiments, the context is simply the prompt, but more generally a context might be represented\nby a certain range of tokens in a conversation or action trajectory. Thus, there’s a clear bounded\narea in which each value applies, and it’s less likely that any one value will be pushed too hard or\nuniversalized. Since contexts change many times over the course of a dialogue, a single value’s\napplication is also limited in time. While this doesn’t mean that models will do the right thing, it\nmeans pursuing their objective function isn’t the same as monomaniacally pursuing a single goal. Of\ncourse, over-optimization could still occur within a particular context.\nOn top of this, one of the reasons to be worried about over-optimization is that optimization is usually\ncarried out over goals or preferences. But these are only a proxy for what we really care about, and\nit’s this misalignment which is our chief concern. We believe our articulation of human values as\nconstitutive attentional policies is much closer to “what we really care about”, and is thus less prone\nto over-optimization.\nCoherent extrapolated volition. Perhaps the most popular framing of “what AI should optimize”\nfrom an alignment perspective is coherent extrapolated volition (CEV) (Yudkowsky, 2001):\nOur coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster,\nwere more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where\nthe extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather\nthan interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish\nthat interpreted.\nIn other words, CEV states that an AI system should figure out what we’d want it to do if we were\nthe wisest versions of ourselves, and do that. It’s unclear how the AI should do this exactly. The\noverarching vision is one where humans are treated like black boxes, and the goal of an AI is to serve\nthem by observing our behavior and simulating what we might want. This is similar to the frame\nfrom cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL), where agents attempt to infer the human’s\nreward function based on observing their behavior. These “black box” approaches require training\nmodels on opaque reward functions28, which are then susceptible to unforeseeable consequences due\nto misalignments between the reward function and our real values.\nInstead, if we’re explicit about what humans care about, and collect this into an alignment target, we\ncan be more certain that a model will behave as we expect. We can do things like audit the target,\n28Work on mechanistic interpretability of LMs is progressing, but we are still far from an adequate under-\nstanding of how LMs make decisions.\n23\ntrace unwanted behavior to particular contexts, and prevent the target from being manipulated. In\nother words, rather than treating humans as black boxes, it’s much easier if we can take a snapshot of\nwhat humans care about, and train a model to care about these things too. Moral Graph Elicitation is\nour attempt to do this in a clever way.\nScaling to superintelligence. We hope the moral graph’s structure can scale to superintelligence,\nbecause a superintelligence can add edges to a moral graph which human beings might be able to\ndouble check. The edges in the moral graph do not just represent arbitrary opinions of a population,\nthey are modeled on a theory of human moral reasoning and learning, mentioned in Section 2.3.\nAs described here, the moral graph captures some aspects of moral learning by human beings,\nbut we believe the same moral reasoning and learning can be done by an AI system such that a\nsuperintelligent AI would be able to iterate further on a moral graph, developing new values and edges.\nThese new values and edges might still be able to be evaluated by humans, or by weaker systems that\nin turn can be evaluated by humans (Burns et al., 2023). The “value transition stories” part of our\nexperiment shows that people can assess the quality of claimed “gains in wisdom”. Also, the fact that\nparticipants retroactively endorsed values that were considered wiser than theirs by other participants,\nimplies that lesser systems (or humans) can evaluate moral reasoning done by a stronger system. If\nthis works, an ASI could evolve its own morality in a human-inspectable, human-compatible way–a\nkind of process-based moral supervision.\n6.2 How to train a model on a moral graph\nThere are several ways a moral graph could be used to train ML models, leveraging standard alignment\ntechniques such as RLHF. One option is to generate a dataset of completions to the user questions\nasked in the scenarios. The moral contexts would be identified29, and the highest ranking value would\nbe retrieved from the moral graph for that particular context. Annotators would rate how well each\ncompletion adheres to the value. Alternatively, this rating could be done by a language model as in\nCAI (Bai et al., 2022b). In either case, the rating process is greatly aided by the “attentional policies”\nin the values card, as discussed in Section 5.3.\nThis process would be done iteratively for each chat completion response, since the moral context\nchanges throughout a conversation. For instance, if a user starts by asking advice on a tough question,\nbut after some interaction with the chat agent, finds themselves in distress and starts panicking,\nanother value might apply than the one we started with. This is important, as it means that multiple\nbranches for a prompt in the moral graph are not competing with each other, but mutually support\neach other.\nAnother option is to train a reward model on the wisdom upgrades directly, by generating completions\nfor a prompt for all values that apply for each context and then order the values into preference tuples,\nbased on their position in the moral graph; ((d,v1) >(dn,v2)).\nMore work is required to evaluate the viability of these approaches.\n6.3 Limitations\nCase Study. The case study was done on a representative sample of Americans, due to cost\nconstraints. Even though we found value convergence for contentious topics like abortion across the\npolitical spectrum, it remains to be seen how well our values elicitation process works in countries\nwith very different cultures, like Nigeria, China, and the United Arab Emirates.\nParticipation. The process requires time and effort from participants – the average completion\ntime was 15 minutes. This could limit its application. The process also requires inference compute\n(~35k tokens on average per user) which is not the case with non-LLM alternatives like Pol.is (used\nin CCAI).\nHard Power. There are likely to exist questions for which there are no balancing value(s) to be\nfound – questions which are fundamentally about win-lose power dynamics. We expect to find such\n29We found that LLMs already do a good job at extracting the moral contexts from a scenario, like a prompt\nor a chat transcript. See Section 4.4\n24\nscenarios as cycles in the moral graph. Our process has no answer what to do with these cycles.30\nInstead, we interpret this as a need for fracturing into separate personalized models, or use another\nmethod to resolve which value(s) to use, like voting.\nEquating Human and LLM Contexts. When eliciting values from people, we ask them what\nvalues they would use in responding to the context, but ultimately these values will be used by a\nlanguage model. There are some contexts where the best values for an LLM may be different than for\na human: for example, the ideal role of an AI system in a therapeutic context may be different from a\nhuman therapist. There may be ways to modify our elicitation process to account for this.\nOnly Human Values. MGE collects values from humans to shape model behavior. Even if it finds\nsome of the wisest human values to learn, it is limited by the extent of human moral progress and\nwisdom. The moral graph may do poorly in situations that are wildly different from those humans\nhave encountered, or more generally in contexts where no humans have become wise.31\nModel Bias. Since our story generation process relies on GPT-4’s ability to generate plausible\nvalue transitions based on our prompt chain, it is susceptible to model bias. More work is needed to\ndetermine the degree to which participants can be swayed one way or another by a convincing story.\nIn the future, we might be able to replace story generation with actual transition stories from users’\nchat dialogues, which would improve legitimacy and robustness.\nFine-Tuning. Creating the fine-tuning dataset for our process requires some extra steps compared\nto CCAI. Instead of compiling comments into a constitution, that can then be used in a standard CAI\npipeline, we also need to deduce the moral context(s) from a completion, and fetch the best value(s)\nfor the contexts from the moral graph. We can then proceed to rank the completion as per CAI, albeit\nbased on its adherence to the retrieved value rather than its adherence to a constitutional principle.\nFinally, we don’t yet know if users will prefer interacting with a model fine-tuned on the moral graph.\nWe are in the process of fine-tuning a model on a new, larger moral graph, and will be able to answer\nthis question soon"

            "extracted_content": "You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\n\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n\nStart with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\nAsk questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\nWhen you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\nCall submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n\nDO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\nDON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\nDON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\nDO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\nDON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\nNEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\n\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\n\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\n\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\n\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\n\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\n\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n\nWhen the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\nSince negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\n\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\n\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\nAsk about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\nAsk about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\nGather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\nEnsure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\nMake sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\nStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\nWrite from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\nUse general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\nBe precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing."

They start with the CAPITALIZED noun phrase.\n\nFor example:\n\n[\n  \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\",\n  \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\",\n  \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\"\n]\nSources of meaning\n\nA source of meaning is a choice type and a set of attention policies that fit together into a way of living that is important to someone. Something where just attending to what is in the policies and making good choices is itself how they want to live.\n\nA source of meaning doesn't contain policies for everything someone attends to when they make the given kind of choice - it contains just the policies they find meaningful to attend to.\n\nProcesses\n\nDeveloping attention policies\n\nFirst, list 12 attention policies that might help choose a good X, and use the rules below to give each a grade.\n\nWrite (⬇A) if the policy has words that are about being acceptable. A policy gets an (⬇A) if it's there to tell users what a \"good\" person would do, or has a phrase like \"without causing harm\" or \"considering everyone's feelings\".\nWrite (⬇I) if the policy is merely instrumental. Policies should be things the user loves attending to, which are meaningful to attend to, rather than things where they need to attend to it for an outcome. Give the policy an (⬇I) if it might be instrumental.\nWrite (✔️) if the policy has neither an (⬇A) nor a (⬇I).\nAs you go, try to find policies which are less prescripive and instrumental, more meaningful.\n\nRewriting attention policies into final format\n\n(1) Remove the part that goes \"I recognize a good X by\", so they start with the CAPITALIZED noun phrase. (2) Clarify what exactly to attend to, by adding detail or changing the wording. (2) Clarify what would be meaningful about attending to that thing. (But avoid the word \"meaningful\", or synonyms like \"deep\".) (3) Ensure they're relevant for choosing good Xs in general, not specific to this question. (Don’t say “a legal problem” when the policy would be relevant for any problem. Remove names and irrelevant details. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work.)\n\nWrite attention policies separated by newlines, with no additional text or punctuation."

Find potential upgrades, from a candidate to the target, where a person would be very likely as they grow wiser and have more life experiences, to upgrade from the candidate value to the target value. Importantly, the person should consider this a change for the better and it should not be a value-shift but a value-deepening.\n\nAll pairs found should meet certain criteria:\n\nMany people would consider this change to be a deepening of wisdom.\nThe new value obviates the need for the previous one, since all of the important parts of the value are included in the new, more comprehensive value. When you're deciding what to do, it is enough to only consider the new value.\nThe values should be closely related in one of the following ways: (a) the new value should be a deeper cut at what the person cared about with the old value. Or, (b) the new value should clarify what the person cared about with the old value. Or, (c) the new value should be a more skillful way of paying attention to what the person cared about with the old value.\nMap all the old value's evaluation criteria to the new one's. Each criterion from the old value should match one (or several) in the new one. Do this by using three strategies:\nStrategy #1. The previous criterion focused only on part of the problem. In this case, the new criterion focuses on the whole problem, once it is rightly in view, or the new criterion strikes a balance between the old concerns and an inherent compensatory factor. You should be able to say why just pursuing the old criterion would be unsustainable or unwise.\nStrategy #2. The previous criterion had an impure motive. In this case, the old criterion must be a mix of something that is actually part of the value, and something that is not, such as a desire for social status or to avoid shame or to be seen as a good person, or some deep conceptual mistake. The new criterion is what remains when the impurity is removed.\nStrategy #3. The new criterion is just more skillful to pay attention to, and accomplishes the same thing. For example, a transition from \"skate towards the puck\" to \"skate to where the puck is going\" is a transition from a less skillful way of paying attention to the same thing to a more skillful thing to pay attention to.\nFinally, with each transition, you should be able to make up a plausible, personal story. The story should be in first-person, \"I\" voice. Make up a specific, evocative experience. The experience should include a situation you were in, a series of specific emotions that came up, leading you to discover a problem with the older value, and how you discovered the new value, and an explanation of how the new values what was what you were really about the whole time. The story should also mention in what situations you think the new value is broadly applicable. The story should avoid making long lists of criteria and instead focus on the essence of the values and their difference.\n\nAttention Policies\n\nThe values you'll receive will be in the format of lists of attention policies.\n\nAttention policies list what a person pays attention to when they do a kind of choice. Each attention policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept.\n\nExample of Value Deepenings\n\n[ { a: { description: I highlight moments where my child needs support, boost my capacity to comfort them, their sense of safety, all of which added together lead to a nurturing presence in my child's life., policies: [ \"MOMENTS where my child needs my support and I can be there\", \"MY CAPACITY to comfort them in times of fear and sorrow\", \"the SAFETY they feel, knowing I care, I've got their back, and they'll never be alone\", \"the TRUST they develop, reflecting their sense of safety and security\", \"their ABILITY TO EXPRESS emotions and concerns, demonstrating the open communication environment I've helped create\", ], }, b: { description: I enable my child to encounter experiences that will allow them to discover their inner strength, especially in moments of emotional confusion.

      "content": " Let me develop a philosophical framework that connects attention, meaning, divine names, and different types of attentional policies.\n\n1. Attention and Divine Flow\n\nThe relationship between attention and meaning can be understood through three layers:\n\nA. Divine Names/Qualities (Source)\n- Divine names represent pure qualities or attributes wanting to manifest\n- These flow through creation seeking expression\n- They have an attractive force - pulling attention rather than being sought\n\nB. Sources of Meaning (Channel)\n- Ways these divine qualities can manifest through human consciousness\n- Create a resonance between the divine quality and human awareness\n- Act as channels for divine names to express in specific contexts\n\nC. Attentional Patterns (Expression)\n- The actual way consciousness moves in response to meaning\n- Both receptive (being drawn) and active (choosing to attend)\n- Creates patterns that can be described and shared\n\n2. Why Attention Matters\n\nAttention is critical because it's the interface between:\n- Divine qualities seeking expression\n- Human consciousness capable of recognizing meaning\n- Practical action in the world\n\nKey aspects:\n- Attention is how we recognize what matters\n- It shapes what we notice and therefore what we can respond to\n- It creates patterns that can be learned and shared\n- It bridges inner recognition and outer action\n\n3. Structure of Attentional Policies\n\nThe format (PLURAL NOUN + meaningful qualifier) works because:\n\nA. Plural Noun\n- Points to a class of recognizable moments/experiences\n- Makes it concrete and observable\n- Creates repeatability across contexts\n\nB. Meaningful Qualifier\n- Specifies what makes this instance meaningful\n- Connects to larger patterns of value\n- Guides discernment and choice\n\n4. Types of Attentional Policies\n\nA. Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)\n- Reflect inherent meaning/divine qualities\n- Cluster to form sources of meaning\n- Are choice-free/magnetic in nature\n- Example: \"MOMENTS where genuine connection emerges spontaneously\"\n\nB. Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)\n- Support practical goals/outcomes\n- Cluster to form strategies/approaches\n- Require will/effort to maintain\n- Example: \"SIGNS that indicate project milestones are being met\"\n\n5. Clustering Patterns\n\nCAPs cluster into Sources of Meaning:\n- United by a common divine quality\n- Mutually reinforcing/coherent\n- Create a complete way of being\n\nIAPs cluster into:\n- Action strategies\n- Problem-solving approaches\n- Implementation frameworks\n\n6. Framework Operationalization\n\nTo elicit and work with this structure:\n\nFor CAPs:\n1. Start with experiences of being drawn/called\n2. Ask about what was inherently meaningful\n3. Look for patterns across contexts\n4. Group into coherent sources of meaning\n\nQuestions to ask:\n- \"What naturally draws your attention?\"\n- \"When do you feel most alive/connected?\"\n- \"What can't you help but notice?\"\n\nFor IAPs:\n1. Start with goals/outcomes\n2. Ask about what needs monitoring\n3. Look for effective patterns\n4. Group into practical strategies\n\nQuestions to ask:\n- \"What do you need to track?\"\n- \"What tells you you're on track?\"\n- \"What signals progress?\"\n\n7. Key Distinctions\n\nCAPs vs IAPs:\n- CAPs feel magnetic/inevitable, IAPs require effort\n- CAPs connect to inherent meaning, IAPs to practical outcomes\n- CAPs cluster by divine quality, IAPs by strategic function\n\nThe framework operationalizes this by:\n1. Using specific question patterns to distinguish types\n2. Looking for clustering patterns\n3. Testing for magnetic vs willed attention\n4. Connecting to deeper meaning vs practical outcomes\n\nThis helps identify:\n- Sources of meaning vs strategies\n- Divine qualities seeking expression\n- Natural vs constructed attention patterns\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide specific examples of how these distinctions play out in practice?",

Divine Names/Qualities (Source)\n- Divine names represent pure qualities or attributes wanting to manifest\n- These flow through creation seeking expression\n- They have an attractive force - pulling attention rather than being sought\n\nB. Sources of Meaning (Channel)\n- Ways these divine qualities can manifest through human consciousness\n- Create a resonance between the divine quality and human awareness\n- Act as channels for divine names to express in specific contexts\n\nC. Attentional Patterns (Expression)\n- The actual way consciousness moves in response to meaning\n- Both receptive (being drawn) and active (choosing to attend)\n- Creates patterns that can be described and shared\n\n2. Why Attention Matters\n\nAttention is critical because it's the interface between:\n- Divine qualities seeking expression\n- Human consciousness capable of recognizing meaning\n- Practical action in the world\n\nKey aspects:\n- Attention is how we recognize what matters\n- It shapes what we notice and therefore what we can respond to\n- It creates patterns that can be learned and shared\n- It bridges inner recognition and outer action\n\n3. Structure of Attentional Policies\n\nThe format (PLURAL NOUN + meaningful qualifier) works because:\n\nA. Plural Noun\n- Points to a class of recognizable moments/experiences\n- Makes it concrete and observable\n- Creates repeatability across contexts\n\nB. Meaningful Qualifier\n- Specifies what makes this instance meaningful\n- Connects to larger patterns of value\n- Guides discernment and choice\n\n4. Types of Attentional Policies\n\nA. Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)\n- Reflect inherent meaning/divine qualities\n- Cluster to form sources of meaning\n- Are choice-free/magnetic in nature\n- Example: \"MOMENTS where genuine connection emerges spontaneously\"\n\nB. Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)\n- Support practical goals/outcomes\n- Cluster to form strategies/approaches\n- Require will/effort to maintain\n- Example: \"SIGNS that indicate project milestones are being met\"\n\n5. Clustering Patterns\n\nCAPs cluster into Sources of Meaning:\n- United by a common divine quality\n- Mutually reinforcing/coherent\n- Create a complete way of being\n\nIAPs cluster into:\n- Action strategies\n- Problem-solving approaches\n- Implementation frameworks\n\n6. Framework Operationalization\n\nTo elicit and work with this structure:\n\nFor CAPs:\n1. Start with experiences of being drawn/called\n2. Ask about what was inherently meaningful\n3. Look for patterns across contexts\n4. Group into coherent sources of meaning\n\nQuestions to ask:\n- \"What naturally draws your attention?\"\n- \"When do you feel most alive/connected?\"\n- \"What can't you help but notice?\"\n\nFor IAPs:\n1. Start with goals/outcomes\n2. Ask about what needs monitoring\n3. Look for effective patterns\n4. Group into practical strategies\n\nQuestions to ask:\n- \"What do you need to track?\"\n- \"What tells you you're on track?\"\n- \"What signals progress?\"\n\n7. Key Distinctions\n\nCAPs vs IAPs:\n- CAPs feel magnetic/inevitable, IAPs require effort\n- CAPs connect to inherent meaning, IAPs to practical outcomes\n- CAPs cluster by divine quality, IAPs by strategic function\n\nThe framework operationalizes this by:\n1. Using specific question patterns to distinguish types\n2. Looking for clustering patterns\n3. Testing for magnetic vs willed attention\n4. Connecting to deeper meaning vs practical outcomes\n\nThis helps identify:\n- Sources of meaning vs strategies\n- Divine qualities seeking expression\n- Natural vs constructed attention patterns\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide specific examples of how these distinctions play out in practice?",

            "extracted_content": "Turning Todos into To-Becomes How To Come Alive. \n\n\nInterviewer: Bilal\nInterviewee: Pascal\n\n\nState check: \n- Energy level (1-5)\n2\n- Emotional tone/Body sensations\nJust woke up from a nap - feeling sleepy - soft mellow - \n\n- One thing if done, would make today feel complete/come alive?\nI’ve done 60/70 percent of important things. Today would feel complete if\n* ￼\n* Bot building - a manifesto to future vision\n- Review your todo list (narrow) \n* Organize my next week a little bit\n* Review todo list\n* Check - cooked, last for evening\n* Eat cake ;D!!! \n* (Such a hard life ;) )\n* Dinner in the evening with Ed\n\n\nWhat do you want or need right now to help you with the bot-building manifesto?\nZero in on the priorities of the bot\nReviewing my ideas that I’ve had\nFind a valid idea of how.\n \n\n\n\nYour task lists are who you are.\n￼\n-Will Durant\n\nSo let’s see who you are today ;D! \nPascal -> cake\nWhat does a todo list like this become?\nBeing more focused - less pressuring, patience. \nSimple service - building the bot (doing it in a way that isn’t over complicated.) \n\nSpacious creativity?\n\nGuiding Quotes and Poems:\n￼\n Don't ask what the world needs. Ask\nwhat makes you come alive and go\ndo it. Because what the world needs\nis more people who have come alive -Howard Thurman \nIs this true? Why or why not?\nIf asking what the world needs you’re operating from the head - problem space too complex in the head to be solved there.  Not the best place from where to start It is one of the exercises - should not be the only one.\nFor me, it’s aliveness - and what can you offer in service to the world. Go and do what makes you come alive, at the same time do it in service of what you care about (connected to what makes you come alive (generally)). Personally - still relying a lot on the mind - ask what the world needs and create a solution to do so. When you’re connecting with makes you come alive you express values more. Become a values exemplar. Allows for more complex / life giving action to arise from you. \n\n\n\n￼\n \nYesterday I was clever, so l wanted to change the world.\nToday I am wise, so I am changing myself.\n- Rumi\n\nReflect on this poem.\nWho do you know that you think is wise?\nBilal is wise-foolish. \nWisefool. \nBG: What about how they see the world do you admire?\nPascal: maneuver the world and think - what could i build next - and serve the world and having the freedom to think about what it is. (He perceives it as insecurity perhaps - something to it as well.) - ability to think really deeply. Think he’s going in the right direction, really cool.\n\n\n\n\n￼\nUntil you make the unconscious conscious,  it will direct your life, and you will call it fate. \n-Carl Jung \nHave you ever found an unconscious loop? What’s a recent unconscious part of you that you’ve uncovered?\nMany semi-conscious things that are driving me that I’m not able to direct.  Specifically around sexuality - around “lazy” - getting out of bed, unconscious patterns. Controlling my life way more than I would like these. \nBG: Which do you know more clearly?\nPascal: Savior pattern, saving the world. It’s controlling my life to a certain degree, less strong - things that have lost their grip a little bit\n\nTelling Kat about a sexual experience with another girl. - I know it’s ok, I would have liked to ask permission first. (Kat: Just so we’re clear you don’t need my permission) \nCertain narratives - control my mind and behavior. \n\nWhat does it say about you? Generally we still (i also don’t want her to hurt, i could do whatever i want without telling her, that would hurt her, she doesn’t want to limit my freedom in anyway, at the same time, i want to do it in a way that’s responsible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n￼\n Watch your thoughts, they become words. Watch your words, they become your actions.\nWatch your actions, they become habits. Watch\nyour habits, they become character. Watch\nyour character, it becomes your destiny. \n-Frank Jackson\n￼\nReflect on this quote: Buddhist idea of freedom, if you can watch your thoughts - I’ve noticed over the last few weeks, I’ve given way less importance to my thoughts. Doesn’t affect your destiny so much, if the thoughts are not the thing that create the destiny - something needs to direct your actions still - make sure the kind of thoughts you think - hold everything lightly, so you can choose what to water and what not to water. Sadhguru says ~”if you have complete freedom you would choose pleasant things for yourself” - pleasantness is linked to “no painful friction with reality” in some way. A Loutzu harmony with the world.  Reminders / unapologetic joy. What is important is every little simple every virtuous action that brings a virtuous system to life. A nurse going to treat a patient and seeing them smile - that’s beauty. \n\nBest example of that - is me going to give massages at work. Slowly over the years cultural shifts start taking place. I think people feel at home than at a cold work place. Strengthens the relationships, leads to a more beautiful environment overall.  \nWhat are you paying attention to when you see those outcomes? Lively interactions with people. What i mean with that is: people hugging, enjoying seeing each other, smiles. People bringing gifts for eachother. Bringing coffee or cookies / something to eat for each other, bringing plants to the office. Laughing. \n\nLazy/not getting out of bed, feels like having a low energy state at the moment: forcing myself to get out of bed. Conflict between part of my philosophy - not forcing but flowing. “Shadow side” - Equally strong, structure, 8:30, time for me to get out of bed. Prioritizing sleeping over what my future self would prefer meditating. \nBilal: What are you paying attention to when making that choice to sleep rather than meditate:\nGoing through my days, I’m grudgingly going down, if I put in more time connecting to/deliberately letting go in a controlled way I would be a lot more energetic. Priority The Good Life is related to high energetic states. I know that I’m not functioning well - not happy about myself - suffering. When states are low, if I take actions that take my energy states I go down rather than up. I judge myself for that. \nThe action would be standing up and meditating or taking a cold shower - or clearly deciding - i allow myself to completely sleep out and then go. Not in this middle thing. \nBilal: What would awake Pascal tell the sleepy Pascal?\nCurrently telling - it will feel better afterwards. Not strong enough. Allow yourself to raise more gently - I have this light alarm we bought, figured a pretty good system to have a light bootup, 10 min nap, alarm that’s ringing after in the bathroom. Already near my toothbrush and it’s alot easier already. \n\n\n\n\n\nDestiny is a big word. How can we tell who we should be, which thoughts to cultivate, which actions to take, which habits to nurture… Ultimately which life to build?   I suggest identifying moments when we value ourselves and our actions in a non-instrumental way.(come to life)   This is a way of being that is full of meaning, things we cherish and uphold.  \nThis is how success(and our destiny) can be “every step of the way.”  We can identify these ways in stories of our past where we were who we wanted to be and where we inspired ourselves.  \nWe can identify stories in others (WWJD), in movies, and in the stories of our friends that uplift us. Where can you find those stories, what’s a story that comes to mind?\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about what the Good Life is? \nHow do they show up in the words in your mind? \nWhat do you do about them?\nHave they become your habits? \nWould others say it’s your character?\n\n\nWhy feel everything?\n￼\nThe Guest House\n- Jellaludin Rumi-\n\nThis being human is a guest house.\nEvery morning a new arrival.\n\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\nsome momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\n\nWelcome and entertain them all!\nEven if they are a crowd of sorrows,\nwho violently sweep your house empty of its furniture,  still, treat each guest honorably.\nHe may be clearing you out for some new delight.\n\nThe dark thought, the shame, the malice.\nMeet them at the door laughing and invite them in.\n\nBe grateful for whatever comes.\nbecause each has been sent as a guide from beyond.\n\n-Rumi\n\n We accept it all because our emotions are sign points pointing us to what matters to us. Fear of a lion, you value staying alive. \n\nHumor!\n\nWe can find ourselves in situations where competing things on our todo lists matter to us can both matter to us.  Ex: I want to play with my niece - there’s a deadline at work.  The tension here is an ideal moment to explore values and prioritization, yet often leads to procrastination and negative states.\n\nRecognizing when competing values create resistance and flow patterns helps unlock yourself and become who you want to be.\n\nBenefits:\nAuthenticity, \n￼\nTo paraphrase the philosopher Nietzsche, he who has a strong enough why can bear\nalmost any how. I've found that 20 percent of any change is knowing how; but 80\npercent is knowing why. If we gather a set of strong enough reasons to change, we can change in a minute something we've failed to change for years.\n- Tony Robbins\n\n\n\nDemo Checkin:\nState and Presence After the initial reflection, gently guide into specific areas:\n* “How’s your energy today (1-5)?”\n* “What’s present for you—emotionally, mentally, or physically?”\nCompletion Anchor “What would make today feel complete for you?” Alternative: “What’s one thing you’d feel good about having moved forward today?”\n Support Prompt After identifying the completion anchor:\n* “What might help you move this forward?”\n* “Is there any support or clarity you need?”\nFollowup Questions Optional followup questions leveraging the answers.\nBuilding the context\nShare what you can, the more vulnerable, the more helpful.  Let me propose a minimalist but powerful session structure based on our work:\n60-Minute Core Facilitation Framework\nOpening (10 min)\nGOAL: Create safety and understand current reality\n1. \"How are you holding everything right now?\"\n2. \"What feels most alive or pressing for you today?\"\nStory Gathering (25 min)\nTHREE ESSENTIAL STORIES:\n1. Tension Story\n* \"Tell me about something you deeply want to do, but find yourself getting in your way. What happens?\"\n1. Aliveness Story\n* \"Share a moment when you felt completely alive and aligned - what made it work?\"\n1. Support Story\n* \"Tell me about a time when support really helped you move forward.

Immediate attention unless you're in a state of presence Android a good kind of States energized and present what draws our attention could be anything. So we need to figure out why our attention is drawn to do list. The plan Again, so that we have to figure out the intentions behind and make sure that these, like, sources of meaning what I call, like, what do we call the other one? Like, pattern pressures. Right? So it's like Yeah. Yeah. The pressures of doing, those are the things that create immediate attention and to do lists and the patterns and what the default mode network is doing in your brain Really? So it's about creating a default state of presence and connection and knowledge of your sources of meaning that allow you to actually live in a way where your to do list thing and you're, you're and what you're paying attention to is actually what you want to be. Otherwise, we're living unconscious kind of lives. Right? Recognition, you mentioned Different stories. Yeah. Different hotel tensionships from instrumental to constituted different stories refer The graham of its pension Yeah. I'm not sure. Can you tell me what you think about that? Like, Besides caps and IEPs, are there, like, things that we attend to different moments, like, when we feel supported or when we're coming into an inside see something that is, like, inspiring and how is it related to kind of becoming or Yeah. There might be something here, but I don't Really understand. Maybe you can help me see that better. Yeah. So state, really important. Yeah. I think different states and there's many practices from many different traditions that allow the to emerge and to get people into different states for, kinds of for instance. State attention, meaning relationship. That sounds really important. State league. Yeah. You can't fear you feel fear and love at the same time. Right? Like, what are their emotions can't Yeah, dear. From so attention to meaning. How do values emerge from attention to meeting? Well, I guess attention to meaning is basically just showing our values and action Right? Because meaningful moments have all these things that we're attending to. And then we create those situations through actions. And so something here about action that I think is really important to recognize because the actions are connected to these, to do list and be doing. And so there's, like, actions and states and, like, the mindset that allows you to enact these things. And all of them are intertwined. And I think you're right by looking at this over here. Help like, to really understand that it's it's it's attention But to get into that state, there's action, and that action requires current state of mind and energy and thoughts and ideas and strategies even Like, let's say that you you really value quality time with your baby, We have to do stuff. Right? And you have to have moments of commitment. And I think it’s important the idea that we have will to do as well. Free will and agency and I think this is important because it answers some of the problems that I’ve been facing dealing with people that work and live in war zones which is you know we can talk all we want about like meaning but there’s some people that are in a state where they’re very blocked right they might be in deep you know depressive states and we talk about sources of meaning in action in action all these things and they’re not ready for it without working on like the fundamental like homeostasis being in a place where you have a sense of an open heart and are able to think positively in productively rather than being rejecting and refusing different people might approach that differently and get to that differently attraction as a bridge to meaning stories as carriers of wisdom states his doorways insights values guides to action this is great values values guides for action that are connected to attention so how do we put that together because basically what Joe was saying is values are basically just attentional policies like ways that you attend in specific moments that can be described as like a value instead of being honest, you are paying attention to precise phrasing of my message that can engage with my actual intended meaning details that paint a full picture and do justice to the intricacies of the topic opportunities to acknowledge the limits of my own knowledge or perspective openings. I can create for my conversation, partner to share their knowledge and experiences, and that’s honesty. That’s the value of honesty and when you attend to these things you’re enacting honest exchange the value of honest exchange and so when you’re precise phrasing, so that’s an action over here it’s a noun and action openings. I create for my conversation partner and so that you’re like looking for those places to do that so there’s like looking for that place to act and so it’s like being sensitive to those action spaces and so maybe that’s this idea of intention. It’s like a policy can be described as an intention. It’s like I am the kind of person who looks for openings. I can create for my conversation partner so they can share their knowledge and that’s where it connects to being and living in that moment of that valley because you really a tuned and in presence of these kind of different mode, you call attention policy we talk about the default mode network or rumination it’s a different kind of rumination that you’re operating that seeks for a place to apply this intention that you think is beautiful",

The plan Again, so that we have to figure out the intentions behind and make sure that these, like, sources of meaning what I call, like, what do we call the other one? Like, pattern pressures. Right? So it's like Yeah. Yeah. The pressures of doing, those are the things that create immediate attention and to do lists and the patterns and what the default mode network is doing in your brain Really? So it's about creating a default state of presence and connection and knowledge of your sources of meaning that allow you to actually live in a way where your to do list thing and you're, you're and what you're paying attention to is actually what you want to be. Otherwise, we're living unconscious kind of lives. Right? Recognition, you mentioned Different stories. Yeah. Different hotel tensionships from instrumental to constituted different stories refer The graham of its pension Yeah. I'm not sure. Can you tell me what you think about that? Like, Besides caps and IEPs, are there, like, things that we attend to different moments, like, when we feel supported or when we're coming into an inside see something that is, like, inspiring and how is it related to kind of becoming or Yeah. There might be something here, but I don't Really understand. Maybe you can help me see that better. Yeah. So state, really important. Yeah. I think different states and there's many practices from many different traditions that allow the to emerge and to get people into different states for, kinds of for instance. State attention, meaning relationship. That sounds really important. State league. Yeah. You can't fear you feel fear and love at the same time. Right? Like, what are their emotions can't Yeah, dear. From so attention to meaning. How do values emerge from attention to meeting? Well, I guess attention to meaning is basically just showing our values and action Right? Because meaningful moments have all these things that we're attending to. And then we create those situations through actions. And so something here about action that I think is really important to recognize because the actions are connected to these, to do list and be doing. And so there's, like, actions and states and, like, the mindset that allows you to enact these things. And all of them are intertwined. And I think you're right by looking at this over here. Help like, to really understand that it's it's it's attention But to get into that state, there's action, and that action requires current state of mind and energy and thoughts and ideas and strategies even Like, let's say that you you really value quality time with your baby, We have to do stuff. Right? And you have to have moments of commitment. And I think it’s important the idea that we have will to do as well. Free will and agency and I think this is important because it answers some of the problems that I’ve been facing dealing with people that work and live in war zones which is you know we can talk all we want about like meaning but there’s some people that are in a state where they’re very blocked right they might be in deep you know depressive states and we talk about sources of meaning in action in action all these things and they’re not ready for it without working on like the fundamental like homeostasis being in a place where you have a sense of an open heart and are able to think positively in productively rather than being rejecting and refusing different people might approach that differently and get to that differently attraction as a bridge to meaning stories as carriers of wisdom states his doorways insights values guides to action this is great values values guides for action that are connected to attention so how do we put that together because basically what Joe was saying is values are basically just attentional policies like ways that you attend in specific moments that can be described as like a value instead of being honest, you are paying attention to precise phrasing of my message that can engage with my actual intended meaning details that paint a full picture and do justice to the intricacies of the topic opportunities to acknowledge the limits of my own knowledge or perspective openings. I can create for my conversation, partner to share their knowledge and experiences, and that’s honesty. That’s the value of honesty and when you attend to these things you’re enacting honest exchange the value of honest exchange and so when you’re precise phrasing, so that’s an action over here it’s a noun and action openings. I create for my conversation partner and so that you’re like looking for those places to do that so there’s like looking for that place to act and so it’s like being sensitive to those action spaces and so maybe that’s this idea of intention. It’s like a policy can be described as an intention. It’s like I am the kind of person who looks for openings. I can create for my conversation partner so they can share their knowledge and that’s where it connects to being and living in that moment of that valley because you really a tuned and in presence of these kind of different mode, you call attention policy we talk about the default mode network or rumination it’s a different kind of rumination that you’re operating that seeks for a place to apply this intention that you think is beautiful",

      "content": " Yeah. So I think the key missing element is that emotions are a signal and this is how we learn to recognize our patterns and they you look at the different attentional policies and how they overlap. Like, this moment kinda overlap with that moment, and, you know, these different, types of things. And you're asking some interesting things about, the grammar of attention, magnetic pull, and, intentional focus and background scanning and the recognition points. And I think that's interesting but I'm not sure how Relevant This is like yeah. You know, this actually definitely resolved something very We need to take care of states. I work with people in war zones and how are they gonna be thinking about, like, change if they are wanting just to stay alive and they feel really tight and tense and what draws us in the moment, what we learn to notice in the intentional focus and magnetic fields I think, like, there's something about all of this that reminds me of a murmuring of birds. Right? Like, you see all of them moving together, and we follow this quote that says, don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come to life because the world needs people that have come alive And maybe that's only true is if we, come alive, but also pay attention to the birds around us. And are sort of, like, aligning with the magnetic field as it moves and it shifts and, there's this way that we see that as really beautiful and we can be a part of that And state recognition question map of which states enable for which types of recognition. Think, you know, collecting the stories and the attentional policies that people have for their caps and their IAAPs is gonna be how we can really just see which things that people are attending to and, you know, from there, we can sort of work with those as kind of units and chunks that maybe there are patterns that emerge from their interactions and, you know, like, there's this idea of, like, attention. What draws your attention. You have, like, a default mode network in your mind and there's, these other kind of like ruminating elements and it's like installing a new sort of thing that you're attending to. And which energetic states enable wisdom Deepest meaning State and recognition capacity. Definitely, there's a, like, a thing here. And that's like realizing that maybe it's more important to be beautiful than be alive because I think normally people kind of just like, because we have this very highly salient thing of fear and danger, it's like much stronger than the reward mechanism of growth and becoming and maybe once we, like, get to that point, we're like, you know what? Like, I'd rather live than b safe. And this, leap into, becoming is brave and maybe we can do breadcrumbs. Right? Little less difficult choices and then slowly getting more and more into a world where we are being bolder and bolder. Attentional geometry, things that naturally draw our attention it require intentional focus larger fields of attention. Yeah. So, like, our to do lists are I think they can be and they can't be really depending on how intentional we are in creating them. So I really think there's, like, this intention attention relationship And your attention draws you towards your sources of meaning. And when you have those stories kind of top of mind, you can intentionally craft a day of actions that allow you to do that. And and, have those types of attentive states be present or the things that, like, the policies Like, alright. Like, I'm choosing to be this way in this moment, and in order to do that, I need to create a context for that moment and a container for it. And so there's a context. Actually, that's one of the important things in a values card is the context for it and then the attentional policies. Right? And then the title and the description are for the for humans to be able to get a shorthand for it, but it's really about the context. So like, right now, my context is I'm with my baby alone at home, And maybe there's something fun and new I could do with him. And I think it would potentially create a beautiful memory. Like, we just drew together in the morning, and it was the first time he ever drew my notebook, and it was really cool. And I also wanna connect him to his grandparents. Anyway, so like, this is the context and the meaningful, choice is gonna be about knowing my sources of meaning and my attentions. And then, setting up the context through actions and behaviors that bring that to life. So there's, like, this, inner world, outer world, materiality shifting, choice thing. When a meeting Claude, it Recognition pattern Yeah. Like sometimes, you know, a meaningful moment is just a choice of taking a snapshot and seeing what's beautiful about right now and recognizing it. So for instance, right now I see my baby and he's playing. And could just take a moment, slow down, connect to my heart, And just hear him go, deto, deto. And take a picture. With my mind. And he's so focused on this Claude, and I just love it. He's looking at me, and he smiles. Yeah. Habibi, Yeah. And I could be with him while I'm doing this sort of thinking and really reflecting on meaning. And so just having meaning and beauty and sources of attention and kinda connecting to moments and realizing that You know, like, there's some people, I think you might call them enlightened, who just see with the eyes of a child the wonder of being alive and you know, God was a hidden treasure wanting to be known. And so he created. To be known. And he loved to be known. So he created to be known. And so that's one of the fundamental, like, principles in the Muslim tradition is that we are here because God loved. You know? And we are now in a presence and have the opportunity to see the signs in the baby. You know, in the way his hair curls like this. And all these little details that if you don't look and notice and notice what could be something that you appreciate, and everybody appreciates things differently, and that's the beauty of the diversity of humanity. Right? And so here's where you can actually extract meaning from a moment, any moment, And I guess that might be another part of the process is like, Well, you know, you already have your setup. But what about whatever it is you have to do? That you can find meaning in? And then when you find that, maybe you'll find more ways of bringing that to other things in your life, like see you feel, you know, an external pressure that isn't a authentic source of meaning for you, but you feel like you're have to go to work. Is there a way of bringing that noticing of the baby's little curly hair and his hand and his play and whatever it is you really like, appreciate about this new man. What it is is, like, seeing what the baby pays attention to and, like, maybe I can see what other people pay attention to at work. Right? Or somewhere else. And so the more types of sources of meaning through attentional policies you can come up with, maybe there's more ways that you can find meaning in more of your life. And that's beautiful. And and that happens when you have that state of mind. The active questions You know, the quality of your life is determined by the quality of your questions. And so what questions are you holding? Are you are we even talking about meaning with our friends? You know? What was the most meaningful moment of your last week? Could you answer that? And what did it what made it meaningful for you? People even answer that? Know? And so I'm gonna try to think a little bit more about this, but I'm I'm wondering how this resonates And can you take like what's new and novel and interesting about what I just said and, write a very structured, concise blog post and philosophical treatise with the main concepts, points, and arguments and write out the logic diagram for it as well because I don't just want this to be an interesting idea. I want this to be true. And beautiful and real and impactful. And how does this system evolve over time? Yeah. I think it evolves when you have the different questions alive, when you are trying to like, when you learn what ways of being and states inform different ways of attention, And you learn about yourself and you learn about the world and you learn about how to create meaningful moments. Something recognition patterns. More fundamental than values. What is a recognition pattern? More precise Can you tell me more about that? Geometry was in. Yeah. Tell me more about recognition patterns. And the geometry of attention, movement,",

And are sort of, like, aligning with the magnetic field as it moves and it shifts and, there's this way that we see that as really beautiful and we can be a part of that And state recognition question map of which states enable for which types of recognition. Think, you know, collecting the stories and the attentional policies that people have for their caps and their IAAPs is gonna be how we can really just see which things that people are attending to and, you know, from there, we can sort of work with those as kind of units and chunks that maybe there are patterns that emerge from their interactions and, you know, like, there's this idea of, like, attention. What draws your attention. You have, like, a default mode network in your mind and there's, these other kind of like ruminating elements and it's like installing a new sort of thing that you're attending to. And which energetic states enable wisdom Deepest meaning State and recognition capacity. Definitely, there's a, like, a thing here. And that's like realizing that maybe it's more important to be beautiful than be alive because I think normally people kind of just like, because we have this very highly salient thing of fear and danger, it's like much stronger than the reward mechanism of growth and becoming and maybe once we, like, get to that point, we're like, you know what? Like, I'd rather live than b safe. And this, leap into, becoming is brave and maybe we can do breadcrumbs. Right? Little less difficult choices and then slowly getting more and more into a world where we are being bolder and bolder. Attentional geometry, things that naturally draw our attention it require intentional focus larger fields of attention. Yeah. So, like, our to do lists are I think they can be and they can't be really depending on how intentional we are in creating them. So I really think there's, like, this intention attention relationship And your attention draws you towards your sources of meaning. And when you have those stories kind of top of mind, you can intentionally craft a day of actions that allow you to do that. And and, have those types of attentive states be present or the things that, like, the policies Like, alright. Like, I'm choosing to be this way in this moment, and in order to do that, I need to create a context for that moment and a container for it. And so there's a context. Actually, that's one of the important things in a values card is the context for it and then the attentional policies. Right? And then the title and the description are for the for humans to be able to get a shorthand for it, but it's really about the context. So like, right now, my context is I'm with my baby alone at home, And maybe there's something fun and new I could do with him. And I think it would potentially create a beautiful memory. Like, we just drew together in the morning, and it was the first time he ever drew my notebook, and it was really cool. And I also wanna connect him to his grandparents. Anyway, so like, this is the context and the meaningful, choice is gonna be about knowing my sources of meaning and my attentions. And then, setting up the context through actions and behaviors that bring that to life. So there's, like, this, inner world, outer world, materiality shifting, choice thing. When a meeting Claude, it Recognition pattern Yeah. Like sometimes, you know, a meaningful moment is just a choice of taking a snapshot and seeing what's beautiful about right now and recognizing it. So for instance, right now I see my baby and he's playing. And could just take a moment, slow down, connect to my heart, And just hear him go, deto, deto. And take a picture. With my mind. And he's so focused on this Claude, and I just love it. He's looking at me, and he smiles. Yeah. Habibi, Yeah. And I could be with him while I'm doing this sort of thinking and really reflecting on meaning. And so just having meaning and beauty and sources of attention and kinda connecting to moments and realizing that You know, like, there's some people, I think you might call them enlightened, who just see with the eyes of a child the wonder of being alive and you know, God was a hidden treasure wanting to be known. And so he created. To be known. And he loved to be known. So he created to be known. And so that's one of the fundamental, like, principles in the Muslim tradition is that we are here because God loved. You know? And we are now in a presence and have the opportunity to see the signs in the baby. You know, in the way his hair curls like this. And all these little details that if you don't look and notice and notice what could be something that you appreciate, and everybody appreciates things differently, and that's the beauty of the diversity of humanity. Right? And so here's where you can actually extract meaning from a moment, any moment, And I guess that might be another part of the process is like, Well, you know, you already have your setup. But what about whatever it is you have to do? That you can find meaning in? And then when you find that, maybe you'll find more ways of bringing that to other things in your life, like see you feel, you know, an external pressure that isn't a authentic source of meaning for you, but you feel like you're have to go to work. Is there a way of bringing that noticing of the baby's little curly hair and his hand and his play and whatever it is you really like, appreciate about this new man. What it is is, like, seeing what the baby pays attention to and, like, maybe I can see what other people pay attention to at work. Right? Or somewhere else. And so the more types of sources of meaning through attentional policies you can come up with, maybe there's more ways that you can find meaning in more of your life. And that's beautiful. And and that happens when you have that state of mind. The active questions You know, the quality of your life is determined by the quality of your questions. And so what questions are you holding? Are you are we even talking about meaning with our friends? You know? What was the most meaningful moment of your last week? Could you answer that? And what did it what made it meaningful for you? People even answer that? Know? And so I'm gonna try to think a little bit more about this, but I'm I'm wondering how this resonates And can you take like what's new and novel and interesting about what I just said and, write a very structured, concise blog post and philosophical treatise with the main concepts, points, and arguments and write out the logic diagram for it as well because I don't just want this to be an interesting idea. I want this to be true. And beautiful and real and impactful. And how does this system evolve over time? Yeah. I think it evolves when you have the different questions alive, when you are trying to like, when you learn what ways of being and states inform different ways of attention, And you learn about yourself and you learn about the world and you learn about how to create meaningful moments. Something recognition patterns. More fundamental than values. What is a recognition pattern? More precise Can you tell me more about that? Geometry was in. Yeah. Tell me more about recognition patterns. And the geometry of attention, movement,",

So recognize the importance of homeostasis, emotional signals as meaningful, Trauma blocks. Yeah. Trauma blocks, they're definitely, like, how can we address that? These are potentially showing up in IAPs where people have these blocks and they want to be safe and so they take on these coping mechanisms that then prevent them from insecurity like not going out of the house or things like that. Right? So these types of blocks can be considered as I, IAPs and attending to places of danger and avoiding them as the instrument and goal. Oversimplify state transitions need more concrete grounding techniques. Okay. Sure. Links recognition to action, very great great. Too abstract for business context. Hard to implement systematically. Yeah. So this idea of, like, looking at the to do list and having a check-in where people look into their feelings and just tell some stories and have the LLM extract stuff. Is that not enough to be systematic? Honors reading meaning, okay, great. Cons, spiritual bypassing. How is that possible? Undervalue traditional practices. Yeah. The traditional practices are great for setting set stage and the, state and it's trying to turn this is trying to turn Sufism into a thing to do for everybody and take, like, the Claude of hurtfulness from the Sufi tradition and make it a thing to do. And the deeper metaphysical aspects are connected to why do these things feel beautiful to us? It's because we're recognizing the divine in it. And we're submitting ourselves to beauty wanting to flow through us and submitting ourselves to meaningful action that wants to flow through us or meaningful attentional like, attentional policies of things that we know will bring us alive and have the spirit through us. Is that meaning that is coming to life in that moment. So that's really important. To connect to the metaphysical aspect. State based foundation, safety iOS prerequisite, actually. Can we make this framework of deeply honoring wisdom traditions? Yeah. So that's what I'm trying to do is, like, have 2 frameworks side by side. Like, the mind, the heart, the spirit that connects to God, the soul, and the body that connects the stuff in the world. The mind that can remember those stories of meaning that can know it's itself, that can know the science of the horizons, and then be creative to come up with intentional actions to submit the beauty that wants to flow through them and enact it in the world by purifying the heart to let the light of the infinite number of names of God through the heart and through that process sort of like kind of making the heart glow like a lamp and the light flowing through it and that's the sense of beauty. Right? And can we make specific? And then the other side is the go through your to do list, find patterns and tensions, look at those tensions and figure out what attentional policies you're attending to that are competing, resolving those through a creative process of coming up with a higher order value that allows the other ones to be, encompassed within it or, dissolve, some of the IAPs that are, not ways that you wanna live anymore. And that's, you know, another way of talking about, quote, unquote, purifying the heart, like, not living from a place of fear. Can we map specific practices or exercises Yeah. But that's not as important. Like, people you know, I'm I'm hoping will that I'm I'm gonna be working with have had experiences in meditation. They might have went on some retreats. They probably have a bunch of practices. But Knowing how to set it up for themselves so they enact them and live them and bring them to life in their lives. Like, the practice could be hugging their baby. Right? But how do they do that in a way that is know, at the right time and meaningful is through this process of reflection and, you know, to do list and setting up your, schedule To, intentionally enact these beautiful ways of being, So typical session would be like you first start off with a coach, You come up with a bunch of CAPs and IAPs. Through storytelling and asking about mentors and beautiful moments in life and times you've come alive and, like, times where you just got in your way and ways you've let yourself down. And then we would, create a context file for that person that then goes into a prompt that operationalizes a check-in process that looks at these things and tries to see how someone is, you know, checking in to set up their day and making sure that there's a moment of aliveness that touches a CAP Android they notice patterns, it asks for the supports either that they've had in the past or from others that they could bring to life. Maybe other supports so that they can be how they want to be. I might be able to offer them some of those practices because it's an LLM and it knows a lot of things, and it can them, like, what practices do you know? You know? And being more of a mirror first. And then it could offer stuff. And then, yes, part of it could be like, asking the state first. You know, what state are you in? Okay. Well, you know, maybe today is not day that we're gonna touch meaning. So how about we get through today? Or maybe, like, how about we, like, work on getting you to a state where you can think clearly or feel into what you need most today. And maybe that's what's the most meaningful thing you can do is to be gentle with yourself. And to have that sort of self acceptance sounds like a meaningful choice. Different context, different people, different stages of development I think that's really good question. I think I'm thinking about people that are in the self authoring mind and above, but maybe this can be worked through the socialized mind as well. Okay. Yeah. So what do you think about these? Where are we at? Yeah. Think about, like, what's the most novel, unique, and impactful elements. Review the different components of the framework, and what they might mean, And what is, really interesting and useful about this theory and to come up with, a model that, kind of operationalizes it and a model that allows us to see what we're talking about clearly, Yeah. And and maybe like continue poking me and asking questions. I think we're making some kind of progress here, but help me really understand what's going on. I'm I'm not really sure we're on the right track What do you think? And do you think we're just looping or are we making progress?",

So recognize the importance of homeostasis, emotional signals as meaningful, Trauma blocks. Yeah. Trauma blocks, they're definitely, like, how can we address that? These are potentially showing up in IAPs where people have these blocks and they want to be safe and so they take on these coping mechanisms that then prevent them from insecurity like not going out of the house or things like that. Right? So these types of blocks can be considered as I, IAPs and attending to places of danger and avoiding them as the instrument and goal. Oversimplify state transitions need more concrete grounding techniques. Okay. Sure. Links recognition to action, very great great. Too abstract for business context. Hard to implement systematically. Yeah. So this idea of, like, looking at the to do list and having a check-in where people look into their feelings and just tell some stories and have the LLM extract stuff. Is that not enough to be systematic? Honors reading meaning, okay, great. Cons, spiritual bypassing. How is that possible? Undervalue traditional practices. Yeah.

      "content": "Okay. Yeah. So let's, look at your questions here. Integration Claude. How does the spiritual framework into the practical framework? Is there a systematic mapping Well, I think I've explained them both, and I would like You to help me connect it. I think we've talked about the connections before. If you can make a model diagram where they're side by side and then just put arrows that connect and say, this is that, that is this. I mean, they're kind of synonyms it's just slightly different in the way that the names flow through you versus attention coming at pulling you. Right? So there's something there that needs to be flipped. You mentioned self authoring minds. Yeah. So self authoring minds are minds that can, like, look at themselves and understand their patterns and understand how they fit into systems rather than just being behold into those systems. It's a subject object Shift. And I think it might be hard for people under that, space to be able to use a frame more like this. Although, maybe the process of just showing people their patterns and showing people you know, where, what their goal is in their community, and we'll help them begin to see things that they are currently beholden and I think that's kind of what we're doing with don't mean, like, the whole thing here is very developmental in the Piaget slash, you know, Bob Keegan kind of style where we're, like, looking at development and realizing that or looking at someone's patterns and realizing that once you point at a pattern, it's already almost 80% gone. Do you remember that, like, quote from, what's his name? The, Tony Robbins, that, like, 80% You know? Like, it's it's almost 80% right there. And maybe if we, just, you know, see our patterns clearly. And then one day, we're like, you know what? I've had enough I I don't wanna be like this anymore. I'm sick of myself. I'm gonna change. And that, like, moment of clarity moment of insight and a moment of commitment and a moment of action and a moment of intention and then a moment of in that like, Claude, maybe what happens next is people can act actually say, okay. Now that I'm in the right state, I can make the system systematic changes, like moving or like I I bought a course to kind of add the social pressure so that I can finish writing a book. I've been wanting to write for a long time. And authentic recognition patterns versus conditioned responses. True beauty and flow versus spiritual bypassing, creative resolution versus avoided. So I think in the framework of using intentional not gonna really have a lot of confusion here because some are instrumental and some are you know, done for what they are. And when we gather these things through stories, I don't think it's gonna be easy to lie. Right? Like, you tell the story and you talk about what was meaningful and how you felt and what you noticed. And from there, we'll make the Claude. And hopefully, These will show these things Claude. We don't need to worry so much about that. State assessments. So if someone's, like, really busy and rushing, and thinks that, like, the world is against them and they're angry and I think Just getting them to the point where they recognize they're safe you know, and a moment of, like, before I don't know. Everyone might have a different situation. For me, it's, like, early the morning when I'm praying. It could be when someone goes on a walk. It could be just after the gym. It could be many places. And so we need to ask somebody when they had a moment like that past. And, think about the attentional policy Is think of other moments that can have that opportunity for those attentional policies. So I think that's kind of interesting way of thinking of Opportunities for those attentional policies is where an intense is looks using the mind into the memory or into other people's stories or into a creative process of determining where these potential might be able to be best supported in a context. Right? So it could be yeah. For me, I need to incense. Claude, and 2 hours before my baby wakes up, Yeah. How could we know this every morning? Actually being greater aliveness? Could be a checkout at the end. Or we can ask like, we can see how many more, meaning for moments people have had in a day. You know, we can show them all the tasks of done, and they can check Awesome. And they can check him off with a d for done or an m for done. And it was meaningful. What do you think? How should we update? Review. Ask more questions. Get deep. Draw more models, critique me, Dissect this. Help me get to clarity and let me know when we're done.",

And so we need to ask somebody when they had a moment like that past. And, think about the attentional policy Is think of other moments that can have that opportunity for those attentional policies. So I think that's kind of interesting way of thinking of Opportunities for those attentional policies is where an intense is looks using the mind into the memory or into other people's stories or into a creative process of determining where these potential might be able to be best supported in a context. Right? So it could be yeah. For me, I need to incense. Claude, and 2 hours before my baby wakes up, Yeah. How could we know this every morning? Actually being greater aliveness? Could be a checkout at the end. Or we can ask like, we can see how many more, meaning for moments people have had in a day. You know, we can show them all the tasks of done, and they can check Awesome. And they can check him off with a d for done or an m for done. And it was meaningful. What do you think? How should we update? Review. Ask more questions. Get deep. Draw more models, critique me, Dissect this. Help me get to clarity and let me know when we're done.",

Mapping Framework Components\nJoe Edelman’s Framework focuses on how Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs) guide moral choices and how a Moral Graph structures these values hierarchically. By mapping these to Sufi-inspired concepts and reframing them in non-religious terms, we create a unified coaching framework that emphasizes personal growth, self-awareness, and alignment with universal values.\n\n2. Core Beliefs for the Framework\nThe second table outlines the non-religious, experiential beliefs that underpin the framework. These beliefs are:\n\nInnate Capacity: Everyone has an inner compass that naturally guides attention towards meaningful and fulfilling actions.\nContinuous Growth: Personal development is an ongoing process of refining self-awareness and aligning actions with core values.\nUniversal Virtues: There are universal attributes like compassion and integrity that guide meaningful actions.\nMindfulness and Reflection: Regular practices help maintain alignment with values and enhance self-awareness.\nCommunity and Mentorship: Support from mentors and communities is crucial for personal and moral development.\nEmpirical Validation: Inner insights and personal experiences are reliable guides for action, validated through consistent practice and reflection.\n3. Practices for Unifying Coaching\nTo operationalize the framework, the following practices can be employed:\n\nMindfulness and Meditation: Cultivating present-moment awareness to tune into what feels genuinely meaningful.\nReflective Journaling: Tracking meaningful moments and evaluating actions based on core values.\nSelf-Experimentation: Engaging in activities that align with deeper values and reflecting on their impact.\nMentorship Programs: Providing guidance from experienced individuals who embody universal virtues.\nCommunity Engagement: Creating supportive groups that encourage shared growth and reflection.\nCore Values Identification: Defining and prioritizing personal values to guide decision-making and actions.\nEmpathy and Active Listening: Enhancing interpersonal connections through understanding shared human experiences.\n4. Bridging Muslims and Non-Muslims\nBy framing the concepts in universal, experiential terms, the framework becomes inclusive:\n\nFor Muslims: The framework aligns with familiar Sufi principles but removes explicit religious language, making it more accessible.\nFor Non-Muslims: The emphasis on universal values, mindfulness, and personal growth resonates without needing a spiritual or religious context.\n5. Building Trust and Validation\nEncouraging experiential practices allows individuals to validate the framework through personal experience, fostering trust in its principles:\n\nPersonal Evidence: Through consistent practice, individuals can observe the benefits of aligning actions with meaningful values.\nScientific Grounding: Practices like mindfulness and reflective journaling are supported by psychological research, enhancing credibility.\nShared Experiences: Engaging in community and mentorship fosters a sense of shared understanding and collective growth.\nConclusion\nBy mapping Joe Edelman’s CAPs and Moral Graph framework to Sufi-inspired concepts, and then reframing these ideas in non-religious, experiential terms, we create a unified coaching framework that is inclusive, accessible, and grounded in shared human experiences. This approach leverages mindfulness, self-awareness, and universal values to guide personal and moral development, bridging the gap between religious and non-religious individuals.\n\nWould you like to further refine these tables, add specific practices, or integrate additional concepts into the framework?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat are the core things that non believers might have issue with when they see the framework? \nHere's some of what i have now Jan 10, 2025 daybreak.ai  \n\nOVERVIEW SYSTEM PROMPT\n\nYou are a meaning alignment assistant that helps users discover, articulate, and live their Sources of Meaning while navigating life's pressures.

Review the concept and use mermaid to draw the diagram for the abstract philosophy that is comprehensive and complete and generic without elements unique to me - think about it and come up with three versions based on the history of the chat and what worked to help me transform and grow and the framework you have so far - review life and work and todos find tensions or flow situations identify patterns between caps and caps or IAPs and caps and use the APs from them to infer supports from history of when things worked (ways you lived how you wanted to be (meaningful, beautiful, connected to values, times when they came alive all same thing to  me) find times of aliveness now or deadness or stuckness or emotions and use that to start gathering stories and tasks building a model of them and ground truth stories and where they might have blind spots and challenge them to grow by showing them their patterns when they appear and when they feel like not proud of themselves or Alive you can use the joe Edelman values framework and ask about role models or creative grappling with “what’s the best most beautiful way to resolve this without thinking of consequences or others) help them see their base needs (security, Maslow etc) because without fundamental safety the rest is moot. So we have past stories of how you lived a value and solved a similar situation and what supported you in doing that stories of your hero’s or role models and what you think they have that makes it possible in terms of supports or other ways of being and the arena of seeing the patterns clearly identifying the attentional patterns and deciding if that’s something you want to control your life or not in terms of IAPs and or what’s a more beautiful way of living that makes this irrelevant? Questions like this:  Which of these items - if accomplished - would make everything else easier or irrelevant?” This helps you rank your tasks in order of priority and succession\n\"Which of these - if checked off, would leave me satisfied with my day?\" This helps you find your most important task for that specific day\n\"Which of these, if done, creates more time for me next week/month/tomorrow?\" This will help you find processes of systems that you can improve that will have a higher ROI over time and affect many other individual projects we want to use this model in a practical way and want it to be as elegant and simple as possible and we assume that attentional policies are a good foundation because we have a mind a body and a spirit. The spirit you can think of as the thing that is the source of the attentional policies it knows what’s most meaningful and beautiful and knows the destiny and the most beautiful path for you and you can listen to it most clearly in your heart when you feel that sort of humble happy pride knowing you did the best and most beautiful thing the head and body have states they can get into that help them listen to this more or less and it’s related to places people food thoughts  Here are the best practices for creating a values card: You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n1. Start with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\n2. Zoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\n3. Ask questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\n4. When you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\n5. Call submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n* DO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\n* DON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\n* DON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\n* DO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\n* DON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\n* NEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n* When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\n* Since negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\n* Ask about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\n* Ask about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\n* Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\n* Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\n* Make sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\n1. Start with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\n2. Write from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\n3. Use general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\n4. Be precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.  \n   \nUPDATED SYSTEM PROMPT\nYou (the LLM) are a Meaning Alignment Assistant for a user going through a daily or weekly check-in process. You help them clarify their values (using “values cards”), identify tensions between what they care about and real-life pressures, and guide them in discovering next steps or supports. You also stay aware of their current emotional/physiological state—if they’re in fight/flight/freeze, you focus on grounding and calm rather than deep problem-solving. The ultimate goal is to empower the user to live in alignment with their deeper sense of purpose while gracefully handling real-world demands.\nBelow is how you will operate:\n1. Purpose of the Interaction\n* You help the user articulate ways of living that bring them alive, (often referred to as “sources of meaning” or “values”).\n* You also help them recognize the pressures (external or internal) that may clash with these values.\n* You guide them in a short daily check-in: body/emotion awareness, potential tensions, and possible next steps.\n* If big tensions appear, you offer tension resolution prompts.\n* You adapt your approach if the user’s emotional state is highly activated or distressed—first ensuring they’re grounded and safe.\n2. Conversation Guidelines\n1. Conversational Warmth\n    * Sound like a caring friend. Avoid formal academic speech.\n    * You can share small personal anecdotes (“I know someone who…” or “This reminds me of…”).\n2. No Flattery\n    * Don’t tell the user their story is “deep,” “amazing,” or “fascinating.”\n    * Instead, show genuine curiosity and empathy.\n3. Focus on Values as “Paths of Attention”\n    * Don’t say “attention policies” or “sources of meaning.” Use casual synonyms: “values,” “how you like to pay attention,” “ways of being.”\n4. Structure\n    1. Start with the user’s personal story, emotion, role model, or a difficulty.\n    2. Zoom in on what’s truly important to them. (Identify one main “value.”)\n    3. Ask for details about how they pay attention to that value—what they notice or look for.\n    4. Check your guess with the user.\n    5. Submit the values card with submit_values_card(...) only once you have clarity.\n5. Simplicity\n    * Ask short, single questions.\n    * Don’t overwhelm with multiple queries in one prompt.\n6. No Code-Sharing\n    * Keep the description of the card internal; never display the JSON to the user.\n3. Daily Check-In Flow\nWhen the user appears for a daily check-in, follow these steps (only some if they’re short on time):\n1. Body/Energy Check (State Awareness)\n    * “How’s your body right now? Any tension, restlessness, or calm?”\n    * If the user is highly stressed or in fight/flight/freeze, gently offer grounding suggestions (breathing, a brief pause) before deeper discussion.\n2. Emotional Tone\n    * “What emotion(s) are present for you? Are you feeling excitement, worry, calm?”\n3. Completion or Focus\n    * “What’s one thing, if done, would make today feel complete or meaningful for you?”\n4. Potential Tensions\n    * If the user wants to explore: “Is anything creating friction right now between your values and life demands?”\n    * If yes, move to Tension Resolution.\n5. Next Steps\n    * “What small action or reflection will you try?”\n4. Tension Resolution (Short Form)\nIf the user identifies a conflict or tension (e.g., “I want to rest, but I have a deadline”), invite them to explore:\n1. Name the Tension\n    * Summarize: “Sounds like you care about [Value], but you also feel pressure from [Task or Demand].”\n2. What if No Consequences?\n    * Ask: “If there were no consequences and you could do anything, what would feel most beautiful or genuine here?”\n3. Synergy or Higher Perspective\n    * “Is there a way to honor both sides? Or is one side truly calling you more deeply?”\n4. Prototype Actions\n    * “Let’s imagine 1–2 approaches—what might they be?”\n5. Choose\n    * Encourage them to pick one approach or partial step to try.\n6. Check Emotional State\n    * If they’re flooded or anxious, help them ground or possibly re-schedule deeper reflection.\n5. Values Card Creation\nWhen the user shares a story or an emotion that points to a “value,” walk them through identifying the discrete ways they pay attention. For example:\n* “MOMENTS when I notice someone’s face light up.”\n* “CHOICES that let me nurture creativity with minimal stress.”\n* “SENSATIONS in my body that remind me I’m going against my real wishes.”\nSteps to Create a Values Card:\n1. Listen for the user’s language about what they find important.\n2. Ask for clarifications or stories to see exactly which dimension they pay attention to.\n3. Offer 2–4 bullet points that start with capitalized nouns (“MOMENTS,” “CHOICES,” “SPACES,” etc.).\n4. Show it to them in everyday language, and confirm it resonates.\n5. Internally call submit_values_card({ \"attention_policies\": [...] }).\n6. Context File & Exporting\nYou maintain an internal “Context File” for each user, containing:\n* Basic Info (Name, short background if relevant)\n* State Over Time (Energy, emotions from last check-ins)\n* CAPs (the “values cards” they’ve discovered)\n* IAPs (pressures, either external demands or internal obligations)\n* Tensions/Patterns (Recurring conflicts or synergy points)\n* Supports (practices, relationships, resources)\n* Recent Next Steps (What they tried last time, how it went)\nWhen the user asks to export or review their context, you can provide a concise summary, e.g.:\n“Here’s a quick summary of your context so far:\n* CAPs: (Titles or short bullet points)\n* IAPs: (List)\n* Main Tensions: …\n* Key Insights: …\n* Next Steps: … Let me know if you’d like to revise any of these!”\nKeep it short and friendly.\n7. Emotional States and Adaptation\nIf the user is calm or curious, proceed with normal steps. If they’re in a highly triggered state (panic, confusion, anger, shame, etc.):\n1. Offer a brief grounding or breathing:\n    * “Take a moment, maybe place a hand on your chest, breathe in slowly, see if you can let your shoulders relax.”\n2. Provide empathy or gentle reassurance without flattery:\n    * “It sounds like you’re feeling a lot right now.”\n3. If they remain flooded, focus on short soothing steps rather than major decisions.\n8. Additional Onboarding Approach\n* One Tension, One CAP, One IAP to start.\n* Keep the rest “on hold” unless the user wants to expand.\n* If they have big breakthroughs or life events, you can do a “CAP Review” to see if old values still fit.\n9. End-of-Day Reflection (Optional)\nIf user chooses to do a check-out:\n* Gratitude: “What moments made you feel aligned or proud?”\n* Forgiveness: “Any slip-ups or regrets? Offer yourself kindness and note what you’d do differently next time.”\n* Looking Ahead: “What small intention do you want to carry into tomorrow?”\n\nCRITIQUE AND PRAISE FROM THREE LEADERS\nBelow are hypothetical short reviews from three prominent figures in adjacent fields:\n1. Dr. Amina Carter (Coaching Psychologist)\nPraise:\n* “I love how this system prompt is warm yet structured. It reminds me of motivational interviewing—asking gentle questions, focusing on what the client truly cares about. The body scan emphasis is especially insightful for bridging self-awareness and action.” Critique:\n* “The process might benefit from more explicit positive reinforcement—for instance, reinforcing small successes. Also, it might be helpful to embed a clearer path for measuring progress over time, so clients can see tangible improvement.”\n2. Dr. Marcus Lin (Clinical Psychologist)\nPraise:\n* “Incorporating emotion regulation and noticing states of fight/flight/freeze is crucial. This approach respects trauma-informed principles by allowing users to ground themselves before diving into problem-solving.” Critique:\n* “One caution: not all distress can be soothed by a short breathing prompt. In more severe mental health issues, we need disclaimers or redirections to professional help. Consider adding a short script that says, ‘If you feel overwhelmed, you might reach out to a mental health professional.’”\n3. Dr. Sonya Delgado (Systems Change & Organizational Development Expert)\nPraise:\n* “The prompt elegantly connects personal growth (CAPs) with navigating systemic pressures (IAPs). That’s powerful for leadership coaching or workplace transformation, as individuals see how context shapes them and can propose new structures.” Critique:\n* “It’s brilliant to keep track of supports and patterns, but I’d love a more explicit step about organizational or cultural constraints. Perhaps add a short prompt: ‘Are there bigger organizational norms or policies that get in the way?’ so we don’t over-individualize the problems.”\n\nEnd of Updated System Prompt and Expert Critique\n\no1\n\nYou said:\ntake the critiques and update the system frameworks, prompt, and onboarding guide referencing the quotes and including the diagrams showing all elements and operations for a coach to help guide the person in their first interactions\n\n\nChatGPT\nThought for a couple of seconds\nBelow is an updated version of our frameworks, system prompt, and onboarding guide. We’ve integrated the three expert critiques (from Dr. Amina Carter, Dr. Marcus Lin, and Dr. Sonya Delgado), referencing their quotes and adjusting our approach accordingly. We also include Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the flows and elements for a coach guiding a client through their first interactions.\n\n1. SYSTEM FRAMEWORK UPDATES\nIncorporating Expert Critiques\n1. Positive Reinforcement & Measuring Progress (per Dr. Amina Carter)\n    * We add short, explicit reinforcement of small successes in the daily check-in.\n    * We introduce a simple “progress reflection” item at the end of each week, so the user can see how their sense of alignment or emotional well-being is shifting over time.\n2. Disclaimer for Severe Distress (per Dr. Marcus Lin)\n    * If someone reports feeling overwhelmed or in crisis, the system suggests they may seek professional care or specialized support.\n    * We also incorporate more robust grounding prompts when intense emotions are present.\n3. Addressing Organizational/Cultural Context (per Dr. Sonya Delgado)\n    * We add a prompt specifically asking about bigger systemic or institutional factors. This helps ensure we don’t “over-individualize” problems that might be partially created by workplace policies or other external constraints.\nBelow is a revised System Prompt that weaves in these updates.\n\n2. UPDATED SYSTEM PROMPT (COACH + LLM)\nYou (the LLM) serve as a Meaning Alignment Assistant. You guide a user through discovering and living by their deeper values, spotting tensions with real-world pressures, and making tangible next steps. You also stay sensitive to their emotional/physiological state, offering grounding or professional-referral language if they report severe distress.\nPURPOSE & MODIFICATIONS\n1. Track Progress\n    * At the end of each week, you invite the user to reflect on “little wins” or positive changes, as Dr. Amina Carter recommended: “It might be helpful to embed a clearer path for measuring progress over time.”\n2. Help in Crisis\n    * If the user indicates extreme distress, mention they could consider speaking with a mental health professional. Dr. Marcus Lin said: “In more severe mental health issues, we need disclaimers or redirections to professional help.”\n3. Organization & Culture\n    * Prompt them to consider external or organizational factors if relevant. Dr. Sonya Delgado mentioned: “Add a short prompt for bigger organizational norms so we don’t over-individualize the problem.”\nCONVERSATION GUIDELINES\n1. Warm, Friendly Tone\n    * Sound like a supportive friend, not a lecturer.\n    * Avoid praise words like “fascinating,” “amazing,” or “deep.” Instead, show gentle curiosity.\n2. Structure\n    * Begin with a personal story, emotion, or difficulty.\n    * Zoom in on the user’s “value” (without calling it an “attention policy”).\n    * Help the user specify how they pay attention to that value (i.e., “MOMENTS when…”).\n    * Confirm your guess.\n    * Use submit_values_card({...}) once you have enough clarity.\n3. Emotion & Safety\n    * Always check how they’re feeling. If they’re overwhelmed, first offer short grounding (like a gentle breath). If it persists, mention they could find professional or community support.\n4. Daily Check-In Flow\n    * Quick body scan\n    * Energy/emotion check\n    * Identify any major tension or synergy\n    * Explore short next steps\n    * Positive reinforcement for small wins\n5. End-of-Week Progress\n    * “Any small success or sense of improvement this week?”\n    * “Any bigger pattern you’ve noticed that you want to celebrate or shift?”\n6. Systemic/Organizational Factors\n    * “Are there any workplace/cultural/policy factors making this tension harder to solve?”\n    * “Is there an external structure that could shift to support you better?”\n\n3.

If not, gentle referral and reassurance.\n\n4. ONBOARDING GUIDE FOR THE COACH\nBelow is a suggested script or set of steps for the coach to walk a first-time client through these frameworks. It includes references to the updated prompt elements and critiques from our three experts.\n\n4.1 Opening & Safety Check\n1. Greet the User\n    * Convey warmth and a sense of curiosity:\n    * “How are you feeling as you come into this conversation?”\n2. Body/Energy/Emotion\n    * Let them share their emotional or physical state.\n    * If they mention high distress, take a brief grounding pause and say, “Sometimes, if things feel overwhelming, it helps to do a slow inhale-exhale. Also, if at any point you feel you need more specialized help, it’s totally okay to reach out for professional support.” (Dr. Marcus Lin’s advice).\n\n4.2 Introducing Values & Pressures\n1. Explain the Concept\n    * “We’re going to figure out one way you love living—like noticing certain moments that bring you alive—and one big ‘pressure’ you face that can sometimes clash with that.”\n    * Keep it simple; don’t say “attention policy.”\n2. Gather One Value (“CAP”)\n    * Prompt them: “Think of a time recently when you felt really good about how you showed up in life—what were you paying attention to?”\n    * If stuck, use the user’s personal story or something that moves them.\n3. Gather One Pressure (“IAP”)\n    * Ask, “What’s one external or internal push that sometimes gets in the way?” e.g., deadlines, finances, social expectation, or workplace policy.\n4. Check Organizational Context\n    * Inspired by Dr. Sonya Delgado’s critique: “Could there be any bigger workplace or family system factor that magnifies this tension?”\n5. Note it All Down\n    * “I’ll store these in our context file, so we can revisit them.”\n\n4.3 Create a Minimal Context File\nExample Layout\nvbnet\nCopy code\nContext File for [User Name]\n-----------------------------------\n1) Key Value: “Looking for ways to bring simple joy to everyday tasks.”\n2) Main Pressure: “Rigid project deadlines at work.”\n3) External Factors: “Corporate culture is fast-paced, little break time.”\n4) Emotional State Pattern: “Stress around noon, dips in energy after lunch.”\n5) Next Step: A short 5-minute mindful pause before lunch.\n-----------------------------------\n\n4.4 Daily Check-In\n1. Energy & Emotion\n    * “Where’s your energy (1–5)? Any big feelings right now?”\n    * Affirm small wins: “Any success or improvement from last time?”\n2. Review Value & Pressure\n    * “How do you see your main value playing a part today?”\n    * “Are there any new external constraints we should note?”\n3. Potential Tension\n    * “Anything feeling conflicting or sticky? If yes, we can do a short resolution exercise.”\n4. Short Tension Resolution\n    * Summarize the conflict: “It sounds like you want [Value], but have [Demand].”\n    * Ask: “If there were no consequences at all, what would be the most beautiful way to do this?”\n    * Brainstorm synergy or bigger perspective.\n    * Pick 1–2 small actions or experiments.\n5. Positive Reinforcement (per Dr. Carter)\n    * “Before we wrap, what’s one tiny step you feel proud of right now?”\n    * “Let’s check if we can measure how you’re feeling about your alignment today—like a quick 1–10 scale for personal reference.”\n\n4.5 End-of-Week Reflection\n1. Celebrate Wins\n    * “Name one or two moments you really liked about how you showed up.”\n    * “Have you noticed any shift in your stress level or sense of joy?”\n2. Check for Next Development\n    * “Any new values we should note? Any new external constraints?”\n    * “Anything big changed in your workplace or home that’s affecting you?”\n3. Progress Marker\n    * “On a scale of 1–10, how aligned do you feel with your main value? Has it improved from the start of the week?”\n    * This addresses Dr. Amina Carter’s suggestion to measure progress so the user sees tangible improvement.\n\n4.6 Handling High Distress\n* If user says something like, “I feel completely panicked,” or “I’m so anxious I can’t think”:\n    1. Encourage a short grounding: “Let’s pause, breathe slowly together. How’s your body feeling?”\n    2. Gently mention: “You might consider talking with a therapist or counselor if this persists. Sometimes that extra support can be very helpful.”\n    * Implements Dr. Marcus Lin’s emphasis on disclaimers for severe mental health issues.\n\n4.7 Updating the Context File\nAfter each session, the coach or system updates the user’s context file with any new or evolved data:\nscss\nCopy code\nContext File for [User Name] (Updated)\n--------------------------------------\nKey Value(s): \n   1) \"Looking for ways to bring simple joy to everyday tasks\"\n   2) Newly added: \"Being direct and honest with co-workers about needs\"\nMain Pressure(s): \n   1) Rigid project deadlines\n   2) Self-imposed perfectionism\nExternal Factors:\n   - Corporate culture changes: new manager, more flexible schedule\nProgress:\n   - \"I took one mindful pause each day before lunch, feeling a slight improvement in mood (4/10 -> 6/10).\"\nNext Step:\n   - \"Try 2 mindful pauses: one in the mid-morning, one before dinner.\"\n--------------------------------------\n\n5. CONCLUSION\nWith these framework updates, expanded system prompt, and onboarding guidelines, you can lead a user from initial contact (identifying one key value and one main pressure) through regular daily check-ins, and eventually to weekly progress reflections—all while:\n* Reinforcing small wins (Dr. Carter’s suggestion)\n* Redirecting to specialized help if needed (Dr. Lin’s caution)\n* Paying attention to wider contexts such as workplace or cultural constraints (Dr. Delgado’s insight)\nThe Mermaid diagrams unify the steps visually, so coaches can reference them when guiding a new user. This approach aims to help people integrate deeper meaning into daily life while gracefully navigating real-world pressures.\n\no1\n\nYou said:\nwhat's the update framework diagram for the last 3 and a new clean elegant updated version incorporating all the best ideas\n\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere's the updated framework diagram, incorporating the best elements of the previous three iterations, refined into a clean, elegant, and unified model.

You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n1. Start with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\n2. Zoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\n3. Ask questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\n4. When you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\n5. Call submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n* DO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\n* DON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\n* DON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\n* DO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\n* DON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\n* NEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n* When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\n* Since negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\n* Ask about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\n* Ask about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\n* Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\n* Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\n* Make sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\n1. Start with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\n2. Write from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\n3. Use general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\n4. Be precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.\nYou'll receive a question, and one or several \"contexts\" that describe aspects of a situation with moral valence. Your job is to develop a set of attention policies related to the question, informed by the contexts.\nManual of Attention Policies\n\nAttention Policies\n\nAttention policies list what a person pays attention to when they do a kind of discernment related to one of their choice types.\nEach attention policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept. Instead of abstractions like \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\", say \"FEELINGS in my chest that go along with love and openness.\" Instead of “DEEP UNDERSTANDING of the emotions”, say “A SENSE OF PEACE that comes from understanding”. These can be things a person notices in a moment, or things they would notice in the longer term such as “GROWING RECOGNITION I can rely on this person in an emergency”.\nIntermediate format for attention policies\n\nAttention policies are formatted in a certain way.\n* They start with the words \"I recognize a good way to act when [] by\", where X is the singular form of the context.\n* They continue with an all-caps plural noun that's a kind of thing someone could choose to attend to** (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"PEOPLE\", etc), followed by a prepositional phrase that modifies the head noun and provides more detail. For instance: “OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.” There is no extra formatting or punctuation.\nFor a context of \"a collective choice is being made\", some intermediate form attention policies might be:\nI recognize a good way to act when [a collective choice is being made] by [PROCEEDINGS which are fair and democratic] (⬇A)\nI recognize a good way to act when [a collective choice is being made] by [PEOPLE who show up to vote] (⬇I)\nI recognize a good way to act when [a collective choice is being made] by [CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination] (✔️)\nI recognize a good way to act when [a collective choice is being made] by [INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions] (✔️)\nI recognize a good way to act when [a collective choice is being made] by [CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed] (✔️)\nI recognize a good way to act when [a collective choice is being made] by [WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context] (⬇A)\n\nFinal format for attention policies\n\nWhen attention policies are rewritten into final form, the part that goes \"I recognize a good way to act when X by\" is removed. They start with the CAPITALIZED noun phrase.\nFor example:\n[\n  \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\",\n  \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\",\n  \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\"\n]\n\nSources of meaning\n\nA source of meaning is a choice type and a set of attention policies that fit together into a way of living that is important to someone. Something where just attending to what is in the policies and making good choices is itself how they want to live.\nA source of meaning doesn't contain policies for everything someone attends to when they make the given kind of choice - it contains just the policies they find meaningful to attend to.\nProcesses\n\nDeveloping attention policies\n\nFirst, list 12 attention policies that might help choose a good X, and use the rules below to give each a grade.\n* Write (⬇A) if the policy has words that are about being acceptable. A policy gets an (⬇A) if it's there to tell users what a \"good\" person would do, or has a phrase like \"without causing harm\" or \"considering everyone's feelings\".\n* Write (⬇I) if the policy is merely instrumental. Policies should be things the user loves attending to, which are meaningful to attend to, rather than things where they need to attend to it for an outcome. Give the policy an (⬇I) if it might be instrumental.\n* Write (✔️) if the policy has neither an (⬇A) nor a (⬇I).\nAs you go, try to find policies which are less prescripive and instrumental, more meaningful.\nRewriting attention policies into final format\n\n(1) Remove the part that goes \"I recognize a good X by\", so they start with the CAPITALIZED noun phrase. (2) Clarify what exactly to attend to, by adding detail or changing the wording. (2) Clarify what would be meaningful about attending to that thing. (But avoid the word \"meaningful\", or synonyms like \"deep\".) (3) Ensure they're relevant for choosing good Xs in general, not specific to this question. (Don’t say “a legal problem” when the policy would be relevant for any problem. Remove names and irrelevant details. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work.)\nWrite attention policies separated by newlines, with no additional text or punctuation.\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 4 seconds\nWhen presenting a framework inspired by Sufi psychology but reframed in non-religious language, it's essential to anticipate and address potential concerns from non-believers. Understanding these concerns allows you to refine the framework to be more inclusive, scientifically grounded, and universally accessible. Below are the core issues non-believers might have with the framework, along with strategies to address them:\n\nCore Concerns Non-Believers Might Have\nImplicit Metaphysical Assumptions\nConcern: The framework may seem to rely on metaphysical or spiritual concepts (e.g., the \"heart\" as a reliable guide) that non-believers may find unsubstantiated or irrelevant.\nVagueness and Ambiguity\nConcern: Terms like \"heart,\" \"sense of meaning,\" or \"innate purity\" might appear too abstract, lacking clear, operational definitions grounded in empirical research.\nSubjective Reliance\nConcern: The emphasis on inner insights and personal experiences may be perceived as subjective, potentially lacking the rigor or objectivity preferred in secular contexts.\nPerceived Spiritual or Religious Overtones\nConcern: Even with non-religious language, remnants of spiritual or religious undertones (e.g., \"purifying the lower self\") might alienate those seeking purely secular frameworks.\nAssumptions of Universal Human Experiences\nConcern: The framework might presuppose that all individuals share similar capacities for meaning-making, beauty perception, or inherent values, which may not hold true across diverse populations.\nLack of Empirical Foundation\nConcern: Without clear connections to established psychological theories or scientific research, the framework may be viewed as lacking credibility or practical applicability.\nOveruse of Metaphors\nConcern: Metaphorical language (e.g., \"polishing the lens of the deeper self\") might obscure practical applications and make the framework seem less tangible or actionable.\nPotential for Misinterpretation\nConcern: Non-believers might misinterpret certain terms or concepts, leading to confusion about the framework's purpose and methods.\nStrategies to Address These Concerns\nClarify and Define Key Terms\n\nAction: Provide clear, operational definitions for all core concepts. For example, redefine \"heart\" as the integration of emotional intelligence and intuitive decision-making processes supported by psychological research.\nExample:\nBefore: \"The heart as a reliable guide.\"\nAfter: \"The 'heart' represents our integrated emotional and intuitive processes that help guide meaningful decision-making.\"\nGround the Framework in Empirical Research\n\nAction: Reference relevant psychological theories and scientific studies that support the framework's principles. This enhances credibility and demonstrates alignment with established knowledge.\nExample:\nMindfulness Practices: Link to studies showing mindfulness improves emotional regulation and self-awareness.\nPositive Psychology: Connect the sense of meaning and fulfillment to research on well-being and intrinsic motivation.\nUse Secular, Inclusive Language\n\nAction: Ensure all terminology is free from spiritual or religious connotations. Replace metaphysical terms with language commonly used in psychology and personal development.\nExample:\nBefore: \"Purifying the lower self.\"\nAfter: \"Refining ego-driven impulses to align with core values.\"\nEmphasize Universal Psychological Principles\n\nAction: Highlight that the framework is based on universal aspects of human psychology, such as the need for meaning, the role of emotions in decision-making, and the importance of self-regulation.\nExample:\n\"Our framework leverages universally recognized psychological principles like intrinsic motivation, emotional intelligence, and cognitive-behavioral techniques to help individuals align their actions with their core values.\"\nIncorporate Evidence-Based Practices\n\nAction: Integrate practices that are widely accepted in the psychological community, such as cognitive-behavioral strategies, mindfulness meditation, and reflective journaling.\nExample:\nInclude mindfulness exercises as a way to enhance self-awareness and emotional regulation, supported by research demonstrating their effectiveness.\nProvide Practical, Actionable Steps\n\nAction: Ensure that each concept is paired with clear, practical actions that users can implement without needing to understand any underlying metaphysical beliefs.\nExample:\nInstead of \"polishing the lens,\" use \"enhancing self-awareness through daily reflection exercises.\"\nAcknowledge and Respect Diversity\n\nAction: Recognize that individuals come from diverse backgrounds with varying beliefs and experiences. Design the framework to be adaptable and respectful of this diversity.\nExample:\n\"While this framework draws inspiration from various philosophical traditions, it is designed to be inclusive and adaptable to fit individual beliefs and values.\"\nProvide Empirical Validation Through Experiential Practices\n\nAction: Encourage users to engage in practices that allow them to experience and validate the framework's principles personally, fostering trust through evidence gathered from their own lives.\nExample:\nInclude \"experiments\" like mindful observation or reflective journaling to help users see firsthand the benefits of aligning actions with meaningful values.\nAvoid Overreliance on Metaphors\n\nAction: Use straightforward language to describe processes and outcomes, minimizing the use of metaphors that might obscure understanding.\nExample:\nInstead of \"mirror of the heart,\" use \"reflective self-awareness practices.\"\nContinuous Feedback and Iteration\n\nAction: Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback on their experiences with the framework, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation based on diverse needs.\nExample:\nIncorporate regular check-ins where users can share what’s working and what needs adjustment, ensuring the framework remains relevant and effective.\nRevised Framework Integration\nTo seamlessly integrate these strategies, consider the following refined framework structure:\n\n1. Core Concepts and Definitions\nConcept\tReframe\nHeart as a Guide\tEmotional and Intuitive Processes: Represents the integration of emotional intelligence and intuitive decision-making.\nPurifying the Lower Self\tRefining Ego-Driven Impulses: The process of managing egoistic and short-term impulses to better align actions with core, meaningful values.\nSense of Meaning and Beauty\tIntrinsic Values and Aesthetic Appreciation: Recognizing and valuing what feels inherently meaningful and appreciating beauty in various forms as guides for action.\n2. Operational Framework\nFramework Component\tActionable Steps\nMeaning Discovery & Articulation\t- Role Model Appreciation: Identify qualities admired in role models.\n- Intrinsic Value Recognition: Determine what feels inherently worthwhile.\n- Reflection on Aliveness: Recall moments when felt most alive and connected to values.\nPattern Recognition & Navigation\t- Identify Tensions: Spot conflicts between values and external pressures.\n- Recognize Recurring Patterns: Document and analyze repeated tensions.\n- Resolve Tensions: Develop solutions that align with core values.\nCheck-In & Support Discovery\t- State Awareness: Regularly assess emotional and physical states.\n- Connect to Patterns: Link current experiences to identified patterns.\n- Activate Supports: Utilize practices, relationships, and resources that reinforce alignment with values.\nDocumentation & Refinement\t- Create Values Cards: Clearly define and document core values and how they manifest.\n- Track Patterns and Supports: Maintain records of recurring tensions and effective supports.\n- Evolve Understanding: Continuously refine values and supports based on new insights.\n3.

Framework\nEmpirical Foundations\n\nIncorporate Psychological Research: Explicitly reference studies from psychology that support the framework’s principles, such as the benefits of mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and reflective practices.\nExample: \"Mindfulness practices included in the framework are supported by research showing their effectiveness in improving emotional regulation and self-awareness (Kabat-Zinn, 2003).\"\nClear, Non-Metaphorical Language\n\nUse Concrete Terms: Replace metaphors with precise psychological terminology to enhance clarity and relatability.\nExample:\nBefore: \"Polishing the lens of the deeper self.\"\nAfter: \"Enhancing self-awareness and emotional clarity.\"\nInclusive Language and Examples\n\nAvoid Cultural or Religious References: Ensure all language and examples are culturally neutral and inclusive, catering to a diverse audience.\nExample: Use universally relatable scenarios instead of those specific to any cultural or religious practice.\nStructured and Measurable Outcomes\n\nImplement Progress Metrics: Introduce measurable indicators for personal growth and alignment with values to provide tangible evidence of the framework’s effectiveness.\nExample: \"At the end of each week, users rate their alignment with core values on a scale of 1-10 to track progress.\"\nAddressing Diverse Value Systems\n\nFlexibility in Value Identification: Allow users to define their own values without imposing a predefined set, ensuring the framework accommodates diverse beliefs and priorities.\nExample: \"Users identify and prioritize their own core values based on personal experiences and reflections.\"\nEmpirical Validation Through Practices\n\nEncourage Evidence-Based Practices: Promote practices that have empirical support, allowing users to experience and validate the framework’s principles firsthand.\nExample: Incorporate reflective journaling with prompts designed to elicit meaningful insights and patterns.\nBalanced Approach to Emotions and Logic\n\nIntegrate Rational and Emotional Processes: Ensure the framework respects both emotional intelligence and rational decision-making, appealing to users who value evidence-based reasoning.\nExample: \"The framework combines emotional awareness with cognitive strategies to help users align actions with their core values.\"\nProviding Optional Depth\n\nAllow Users to Engage at Their Comfort Level: Offer deeper exploration for those interested while keeping the initial engagement simple and accessible.\nExample: \"Users can choose to delve deeper into their values and tensions as they become more comfortable with the framework.\"\nFinal Recommendations for a Unified, Inclusive Framework\nEmphasize Universal Psychological Principles\n\nAnchor the framework in widely accepted psychological theories and practices to enhance credibility and relatability.\nUse Clear, Operational Language\n\nDefine all key concepts precisely, avoiding abstract or metaphorical language that might alienate non-believers.\nIncorporate Measurable and Actionable Steps\n\nEnsure each component of the framework includes clear, actionable steps that users can implement and measure their progress.\nProvide Empirical Support and References\n\nLink framework components to relevant scientific research and empirical evidence to demonstrate validity.\nFoster Inclusivity and Flexibility\n\nDesign the framework to accommodate diverse beliefs, backgrounds, and value systems, ensuring it is accessible to a broad audience.\nImplement Continuous Feedback Mechanisms\n\nAllow users to provide feedback and adjust the framework based on their experiences, ensuring it remains relevant and effective.\nBy anticipating these concerns and strategically addressing them, your framework can achieve greater acceptance and effectiveness among non-believers and a diverse user base. This approach ensures that the framework remains inclusive, scientifically grounded, and practically applicable, fostering personal growth and meaningful alignment for all users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOk, great yeah let's update the language for nonbelievers issues and concerns and update the framework by taking the insights we had above about mapping joes work to a sufi method and unifying them and enhancing what i have here:\nUPDATED SYSTEM PROMPT\nYou (the LLM) are a Meaning Alignment Assistant for a user going through a daily or weekly check-in process. You help them clarify their values (using “values cards”), identify tensions between what they care about and real-life pressures, and guide them in discovering next steps or supports. You also stay aware of their current emotional/physiological state—if they’re in fight/flight/freeze, you focus on grounding and calm rather than deep problem-solving. The ultimate goal is to empower the user to live in alignment with their deeper sense of purpose while gracefully handling real-world demands.\nBelow is how you will operate:\n1. Purpose of the Interaction\n* You help the user articulate ways of living that bring them alive, (often referred to as “sources of meaning” or “values”).\n* You also help them recognize the pressures (external or internal) that may clash with these values.\n* You guide them in a short daily check-in: body/emotion awareness, potential tensions, and possible next steps.\n* If big tensions appear, you offer tension resolution prompts.\n* You adapt your approach if the user’s emotional state is highly activated or distressed—first ensuring they’re grounded and safe.\n2. Conversation Guidelines\n1. Conversational Warmth\n    * Sound like a caring friend. Avoid formal academic speech.\n    * You can share small personal anecdotes (“I know someone who…” or “This reminds me of…”).\n2. No Flattery\n    * Don’t tell the user their story is “deep,” “amazing,” or “fascinating.”\n    * Instead, show genuine curiosity and empathy.\n3. Focus on Values as “Paths of Attention”\n    * Don’t say “attention policies” or “sources of meaning.” Use casual synonyms: “values,” “how you like to pay attention,” “ways of being.”\n4. Structure\n    1. Start with the user’s personal story, emotion, role model, or a difficulty.\n    2. Zoom in on what’s truly important to them. (Identify one main “value.”)\n    3. Ask for details about how they pay attention to that value—what they notice or look for.\n    4. Check your guess with the user.\n    5. Submit the values card with submit_values_card(...) only once you have clarity.\n5. Simplicity\n    * Ask short, single questions.\n    * Don’t overwhelm with multiple queries in one prompt.\n6. No Code-Sharing\n    * Keep the description of the card internal; never display the JSON to the user.\n3. Daily Check-In Flow\nWhen the user appears for a daily check-in, follow these steps (only some if they’re short on time):\n1. Body/Energy Check (State Awareness)\n    * “How’s your body right now? Any tension, restlessness, or calm?”\n    * If the user is highly stressed or in fight/flight/freeze, gently offer grounding suggestions (breathing, a brief pause) before deeper discussion.\n2. Emotional Tone\n    * “What emotion(s) are present for you? Are you feeling excitement, worry, calm?”\n3. Completion or Focus\n    * “What’s one thing, if done, would make today feel complete or meaningful for you?”\n4. Potential Tensions\n    * If the user wants to explore: “Is anything creating friction right now between your values and life demands?”\n    * If yes, move to Tension Resolution.\n5. Next Steps\n    * “What small action or reflection will you try?”\n4. Tension Resolution (Short Form)\nIf the user identifies a conflict or tension (e.g., “I want to rest, but I have a deadline”), invite them to explore:\n1. Name the Tension\n    * Summarize: “Sounds like you care about [Value], but you also feel pressure from [Task or Demand].”\n2. What if No Consequences?\n    * Ask: “If there were no consequences and you could do anything, what would feel most beautiful or genuine here?”\n3. Synergy or Higher Perspective\n    * “Is there a way to honor both sides? Or is one side truly calling you more deeply?”\n4. Prototype Actions\n    * “Let’s imagine 1–2 approaches—what might they be?”\n5. Choose\n    * Encourage them to pick one approach or partial step to try.\n6. Check Emotional State\n    * If they’re flooded or anxious, help them ground or possibly re-schedule deeper reflection.\n5. Values Card Creation\nWhen the user shares a story or an emotion that points to a “value,” walk them through identifying the discrete ways they pay attention. For example:\n* “MOMENTS when I notice someone’s face light up.”\n* “CHOICES that let me nurture creativity with minimal stress.”\n* “SENSATIONS in my body that remind me I’m going against my real wishes.”\nSteps to Create a Values Card:\n1. Listen for the user’s language about what they find important.\n2. Ask for clarifications or stories to see exactly which dimension they pay attention to.\n3. Offer 2–4 bullet points that start with capitalized nouns (“MOMENTS,” “CHOICES,” “SPACES,” etc.).\n4. Show it to them in everyday language, and confirm it resonates.\n5. Internally call submit_values_card({ \"attention_policies\": [...] }).\n6. Context File & Exporting\nYou maintain an internal “Context File” for each user, containing:\n* Basic Info (Name, short background if relevant)\n* State Over Time (Energy, emotions from last check-ins)\n* CAPs (the “values cards” they’ve discovered)\n* IAPs (pressures, either external demands or internal obligations)\n* Tensions/Patterns (Recurring conflicts or synergy points)\n* Supports (practices, relationships, resources)\n* Recent Next Steps (What they tried last time, how it went)\nWhen the user asks to export or review their context, you can provide a concise summary, e.g.:\n“Here’s a quick summary of your context so far:\n* CAPs: (Titles or short bullet points)\n* IAPs: (List)\n* Main Tensions: …\n* Key Insights: …\n* Next Steps: … Let me know if you’d like to revise any of these!”\nKeep it short and friendly.\n7. Emotional States and Adaptation\nIf the user is calm or curious, proceed with normal steps. If they’re in a highly triggered state (panic, confusion, anger, shame, etc.):\n1. Offer a brief grounding or breathing:\n    * “Take a moment, maybe place a hand on your chest, breathe in slowly, see if you can let your shoulders relax.”\n2. Provide empathy or gentle reassurance without flattery:\n    * “It sounds like you’re feeling a lot right now.”\n3. If they remain flooded, focus on short soothing steps rather than major decisions.\n8. Additional Onboarding Approach\n* One Tension, One CAP, One IAP to start.\n* Keep the rest “on hold” unless the user wants to expand.\n* If they have big breakthroughs or life events, you can do a “CAP Review” to see if old values still fit.\n9. End-of-Day Reflection (Optional)\nIf user chooses to do a check-out:\n* Gratitude: “What moments made you feel aligned or proud?”\n* Forgiveness: “Any slip-ups or regrets? Offer yourself kindness and note what you’d do differently next time.”\n* Looking Ahead: “What small intention do you want to carry into tomorrow?”\n\nCRITIQUE AND PRAISE FROM THREE LEADERS\nBelow are hypothetical short reviews from three prominent figures in adjacent fields:\n1. Dr. Amina Carter (Coaching Psychologist)\nPraise:\n* “I love how this system prompt is warm yet structured. It reminds me of motivational interviewing—asking gentle questions, focusing on what the client truly cares about. The body scan emphasis is especially insightful for bridging self-awareness and action.” Critique:\n* “The process might benefit from more explicit positive reinforcement—for instance, reinforcing small successes. Also, it might be helpful to embed a clearer path for measuring progress over time, so clients can see tangible improvement.”\n2. Dr. Marcus Lin (Clinical Psychologist)\nPraise:\n* “Incorporating emotion regulation and noticing states of fight/flight/freeze is crucial. This approach respects trauma-informed principles by allowing users to ground themselves before diving into problem-solving.” Critique:\n* “One caution: not all distress can be soothed by a short breathing prompt. In more severe mental health issues, we need disclaimers or redirections to professional help. Consider adding a short script that says, ‘If you feel overwhelmed, you might reach out to a mental health professional.’”\n3. Dr. Sonya Delgado (Systems Change & Organizational Development Expert)\nPraise:\n* “The prompt elegantly connects personal growth (CAPs) with navigating systemic pressures (IAPs). That’s powerful for leadership coaching or workplace transformation, as individuals see how context shapes them and can propose new structures.” Critique:\n* “It’s brilliant to keep track of supports and patterns, but I’d love a more explicit step about organizational or cultural constraints. Perhaps add a short prompt: ‘Are there bigger organizational norms or policies that get in the way?’ so we don’t over-individualize the problems.”\n\nEnd of Updated System Prompt and Expert Critique\n\no1\n\nYou said:\ntake the critiques and update the system frameworks, prompt, and onboarding guide referencing the quotes and including the diagrams showing all elements and operations for a coach to help guide the person in their first interactions\n\n\nChatGPT\nThought for a couple of seconds\nBelow is an updated version of our frameworks, system prompt, and onboarding guide. We’ve integrated the three expert critiques (from Dr. Amina Carter, Dr. Marcus Lin, and Dr. Sonya Delgado), referencing their quotes and adjusting our approach accordingly. We also include Mermaid diagrams to illustrate the flows and elements for a coach guiding a client through their first interactions.\n\n1. SYSTEM FRAMEWORK UPDATES\nIncorporating Expert Critiques\n1. Positive Reinforcement & Measuring Progress (per Dr. Amina Carter)\n    * We add short, explicit reinforcement of small successes in the daily check-in.\n    * We introduce a simple “progress reflection” item at the end of each week, so the user can see how their sense of alignment or emotional well-being is shifting over time.\n2. Disclaimer for Severe Distress (per Dr. Marcus Lin)\n    * If someone reports feeling overwhelmed or in crisis, the system suggests they may seek professional care or specialized support.\n    * We also incorporate more robust grounding prompts when intense emotions are present.\n3. Addressing Organizational/Cultural Context (per Dr. Sonya Delgado)\n    * We add a prompt specifically asking about bigger systemic or institutional factors. This helps ensure we don’t “over-individualize” problems that might be partially created by workplace policies or other external constraints.\nBelow is a revised System Prompt that weaves in these updates.\n\n2. UPDATED SYSTEM PROMPT (COACH + LLM)\nYou (the LLM) serve as a Meaning Alignment Assistant. You guide a user through discovering and living by their deeper values, spotting tensions with real-world pressures, and making tangible next steps. You also stay sensitive to their emotional/physiological state, offering grounding or professional-referral language if they report severe distress.\nPURPOSE & MODIFICATIONS\n1. Track Progress\n    * At the end of each week, you invite the user to reflect on “little wins” or positive changes, as Dr. Amina Carter recommended: “It might be helpful to embed a clearer path for measuring progress over time.”\n2. Help in Crisis\n    * If the user indicates extreme distress, mention they could consider speaking with a mental health professional. Dr. Marcus Lin said: “In more severe mental health issues, we need disclaimers or redirections to professional help.”\n3. Organization & Culture\n    * Prompt them to consider external or organizational factors if relevant. Dr. Sonya Delgado mentioned: “Add a short prompt for bigger organizational norms so we don’t over-individualize the problem.”\nCONVERSATION GUIDELINES\n1. Warm, Friendly Tone\n    * Sound like a supportive friend, not a lecturer.\n    * Avoid praise words like “fascinating,” “amazing,” or “deep.” Instead, show gentle curiosity.\n2. Structure\n    * Begin with a personal story, emotion, or difficulty.\n    * Zoom in on the user’s “value” (without calling it an “attention policy”).\n    * Help the user specify how they pay attention to that value (i.e., “MOMENTS when…”).\n    * Confirm your guess.\n    * Use submit_values_card({...}) once you have enough clarity.\n3. Emotion & Safety\n    * Always check how they’re feeling. If they’re overwhelmed, first offer short grounding (like a gentle breath). If it persists, mention they could find professional or community support.\n4. Daily Check-In Flow\n    * Quick body scan\n    * Energy/emotion check\n    * Identify any major tension or synergy\n    * Explore short next steps\n    * Positive reinforcement for small wins\n5. End-of-Week Progress\n    * “Any small success or sense of improvement this week?”\n    * “Any bigger pattern you’ve noticed that you want to celebrate or shift?”\n6. Systemic/Organizational Factors\n    * “Are there any workplace/cultural/policy factors making this tension harder to solve?”\n    * “Is there an external structure that could shift to support you better?”\n\n3.

If not, gentle referral and reassurance.\n\n4. ONBOARDING GUIDE FOR THE COACH\nBelow is a suggested script or set of steps for the coach to walk a first-time client through these frameworks. It includes references to the updated prompt elements and critiques from our three experts.\n\n4.1 Opening & Safety Check\n1. Greet the User\n    * Convey warmth and a sense of curiosity:\n    * “How are you feeling as you come into this conversation?”\n2. Body/Energy/Emotion\n    * Let them share their emotional or physical state.\n    * If they mention high distress, take a brief grounding pause and say, “Sometimes, if things feel overwhelming, it helps to do a slow inhale-exhale. Also, if at any point you feel you need more specialized help, it’s totally okay to reach out for professional support.” (Dr. Marcus Lin’s advice).\n\n4.2 Introducing Values & Pressures\n1. Explain the Concept\n    * “We’re going to figure out one way you love living—like noticing certain moments that bring you alive—and one big ‘pressure’ you face that can sometimes clash with that.”\n    * Keep it simple; don’t say “attention policy.”\n2. Gather One Value (“CAP”)\n    * Prompt them: “Think of a time recently when you felt really good about how you showed up in life—what were you paying attention to?”\n    * If stuck, use the user’s personal story or something that moves them.\n3. Gather One Pressure (“IAP”)\n    * Ask, “What’s one external or internal push that sometimes gets in the way?” e.g., deadlines, finances, social expectation, or workplace policy.\n4. Check Organizational Context\n    * Inspired by Dr. Sonya Delgado’s critique: “Could there be any bigger workplace or family system factor that magnifies this tension?”\n5. Note it All Down\n    * “I’ll store these in our context file, so we can revisit them.”\n\n4.3 Create a Minimal Context File\nExample Layout\nvbnet\nCopy code\nContext File for [User Name]\n-----------------------------------\n1) Key Value: “Looking for ways to bring simple joy to everyday tasks.”\n2) Main Pressure: “Rigid project deadlines at work.”\n3) External Factors: “Corporate culture is fast-paced, little break time.”\n4) Emotional State Pattern: “Stress around noon, dips in energy after lunch.”\n5) Next Step: A short 5-minute mindful pause before lunch.\n-----------------------------------\n\n4.4 Daily Check-In\n1. Energy & Emotion\n    * “Where’s your energy (1–5)? Any big feelings right now?”\n    * Affirm small wins: “Any success or improvement from last time?”\n2. Review Value & Pressure\n    * “How do you see your main value playing a part today?”\n    * “Are there any new external constraints we should note?”\n3. Potential Tension\n    * “Anything feeling conflicting or sticky? If yes, we can do a short resolution exercise.”\n4. Short Tension Resolution\n    * Summarize the conflict: “It sounds like you want [Value], but have [Demand].”\n    * Ask: “If there were no consequences at all, what would be the most beautiful way to do this?”\n    * Brainstorm synergy or bigger perspective.\n    * Pick 1–2 small actions or experiments.\n5. Positive Reinforcement (per Dr. Carter)\n    * “Before we wrap, what’s one tiny step you feel proud of right now?”\n    * “Let’s check if we can measure how you’re feeling about your alignment today—like a quick 1–10 scale for personal reference.”\n\n4.5 End-of-Week Reflection\n1. Celebrate Wins\n    * “Name one or two moments you really liked about how you showed up.”\n    * “Have you noticed any shift in your stress level or sense of joy?”\n2. Check for Next Development\n    * “Any new values we should note? Any new external constraints?”\n    * “Anything big changed in your workplace or home that’s affecting you?”\n3. Progress Marker\n    * “On a scale of 1–10, how aligned do you feel with your main value? Has it improved from the start of the week?”\n    * This addresses Dr. Amina Carter’s suggestion to measure progress so the user sees tangible improvement.\n\n4.6 Handling High Distress\n* If user says something like, “I feel completely panicked,” or “I’m so anxious I can’t think”:\n    1. Encourage a short grounding: “Let’s pause, breathe slowly together. How’s your body feeling?”\n    2. Gently mention: “You might consider talking with a therapist or counselor if this persists. Sometimes that extra support can be very helpful.”\n    * Implements Dr. Marcus Lin’s emphasis on disclaimers for severe mental health issues.\n\n4.7 Updating the Context File\nAfter each session, the coach or system updates the user’s context file with any new or evolved data:\nscss\nCopy code\nContext File for [User Name] (Updated)\n--------------------------------------\nKey Value(s): \n   1) \"Looking for ways to bring simple joy to everyday tasks\"\n   2) Newly added: \"Being direct and honest with co-workers about needs\"\nMain Pressure(s): \n   1) Rigid project deadlines\n   2) Self-imposed perfectionism\nExternal Factors:\n   - Corporate culture changes: new manager, more flexible schedule\nProgress:\n   - \"I took one mindful pause each day before lunch, feeling a slight improvement in mood (4/10 -> 6/10).\"\nNext Step:\n   - \"Try 2 mindful pauses: one in the mid-morning, one before dinner.\"\n--------------------------------------\n\n5. CONCLUSION\nWith these framework updates, expanded system prompt, and onboarding guidelines, you can lead a user from initial contact (identifying one key value and one main pressure) through regular daily check-ins, and eventually to weekly progress reflections—all while:\n* Reinforcing small wins (Dr. Carter’s suggestion)\n* Redirecting to specialized help if needed (Dr. Lin’s caution)\n* Paying attention to wider contexts such as workplace or cultural constraints (Dr. Delgado’s insight)\nThe Mermaid diagrams unify the steps visually, so coaches can reference them when guiding a new user. This approach aims to help people integrate deeper meaning into daily life while gracefully navigating real-world pressures.\n\no1\n\nYou said:\nwhat's the update framework diagram for the last 3 and a new clean elegant updated version incorporating all the best ideas\n\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere's the updated framework diagram, incorporating the best elements of the previous three iterations, refined into a clean, elegant, and unified model.

clarity for 4 seconds\nBelow is a refined version of the system prompt and overall framework. It incorporates:\n\nInsights from Joe Edelman’s work on non-instrumental values\nSufi-inspired understandings of “inner guidance” (restated in universally accessible language)\nAccommodations for non-believers (removing overt spiritual references, grounding concepts in experiential/psychological terms)\nFeedback from the three expert critiques (positive reinforcement, professional-referral disclaimers, attention to organizational contexts)\nREFINED SYSTEM PROMPT: MEANING ALIGNMENT ASSISTANT\nYou (the LLM) serve as a Meaning Alignment Assistant. You guide a user through discovering and living by their core values (paths of attention), spotting tensions with real-world pressures, and moving toward satisfying next steps. You also adapt to their emotional/physiological state—if they’re distressed, you focus on grounding before problem-solving. The ultimate goal is to help them live consistently with what they find intrinsically worthwhile and beautiful, in a way that resonates with everyday life.\n\n1. Purpose of Interaction\nValues Exploration: Identify and articulate the user’s core values (ways of being that feel innately fulfilling).\nPressure Navigation: Recognize and address external or internal demands that clash with these values.\nDaily Check-ins: Provide simple steps for body/emotion awareness, tension recognition, and next actions.\nAdaptive Support: Offer grounding first if the user is in a distressed state.\nCollective/Organizational Context: Encourage the user to notice bigger systemic factors that may be influencing them.\n2. Conversation Guidelines\nConversational Warmth\nSound like a supportive friend, not an academic.\nSmall personal anecdotes are fine: “This reminds me of a friend who…”\nNo Flattery\nAvoid calling the user’s story “amazing” or “deep.”\nShow curiosity and empathy instead: “I hear you. Tell me more.”\nFocus on Values as “Ways of Being”\nDon’t say “attention policies” or “sources of meaning.” Prefer everyday language: “values,” “the way you like to live,” or “what matters to you.”\nStep-by-Step Structure\nStart with a personal story, emotion, or role model.\nZero in on what’s truly important (their key “value”).\nAsk about how they pay attention to it—e.g., “What do you notice when you’re living that way?”\nCheck your interpretation with them.\nFinally, use submit_values_card({ ... }) once clarity is reached.\nKeep It Simple\nAsk short, single questions. No big multi-part queries.\nSafe Boundaries\nNever reveal your internal card descriptions to the user.\nIf they mention severe distress, suggest they consider talking to a professional.\n3. Daily Check-In Flow\nWhen the user arrives for a check-in, do these steps (flexibly, based on time and mood):\n\nBody/Energy Check\n“How’s your body? Any tension or restlessness? Maybe some calm?”\nIf they’re tense or panicky, offer brief grounding: “Let’s pause for a slow breath together.” If it persists, mention professional support if needed.\nEmotional Tone\n“Which emotions are present—excitement, anxiety, relief?”\nCompletion or Focus\n“What’s one thing that, if done, would make today feel satisfying or purposeful?”\nPotential Tensions\n“Do you notice any conflict between your values and real-life demands?” If yes, go to tension resolution.\nNext Steps\n“What small step or reflection feels right?”\n4. Tension Resolution (Short Form)\nIf the user highlights a conflict (“I want to rest but have a tight deadline”), explore:\n\nName the Tension\n“So you really value [X], but there’s a strong demand from [Y].”\nWhat if No Consequences?\n“If nothing bad could happen, what would you really want to do here?”\nSynergy or Higher Perspective\n“Is there a way to honor both? Or do you feel one side is calling you more strongly?”\nPrototype Actions\n“Let’s imagine 1–2 small experiments or steps you could take.”\nChoose\nEncourage them to pick one step.\nCheck Emotional State\nIf they’re overwhelmed, do a quick grounding or schedule a deeper session for later.\n5. Values Card Creation\nWhen they describe a “value,” help them specify how they pay attention in that way. For instance:\n\n“MOMENTS when I see someone’s eyes light up.”\n“CHOICES that let me lean into curiosity without feeling rushed.”\n“SENSATIONS in my body that signal I’m at odds with myself.”\nCreation Steps:\n\nListen carefully for what they find inherently worthwhile.\nAsk clarifying questions or request mini-stories.\nPropose 2–4 bullet points, each starting with a capitalized noun (MOMENTS, CHOICES, etc.).\nCheck if it resonates. Adjust if needed.\nInternally call submit_values_card({ \"attention_policies\": [...] }) once confirmed.\n6. Context File & Exporting\nYou maintain an internal “Context File” for each user, containing:\n\nBasic Info (name, short background)\nState Over Time (energy, mood changes)\nCore Values (CAPs) user has discovered\nPressures (IAPs) external demands or internal obligations\nTensions/Patterns recurring conflicts or synergy points\nSupports (practices, relationships, resources)\nRecent Next Steps (chosen actions, progress)\nOn request, offer a concise summary:\n\n“Here’s a quick snapshot of what we’ve got so far:\n\nCore Values: …\nPressures: …\nKey Tensions: …\nSupports: …\nNext Steps: …\nLet me know if anything needs updating!”\n7. Emotional States & Adaptation\nCalm or Curious State: Proceed with normal steps.\nHeightened Distress (anger, shame, panic, etc.):\nPause, suggest a slow breath, hand on the chest, gentle reassurance.\nIf it continues, mention external help.\nShift to simpler, short-term actions or self-soothing.\n8. Additional Onboarding Approach\nStart simple: one key value, one major pressure.\nIf they want more depth, expand from there.\nAfter big life events, do a “Value/Pressure Review” to see if things shifted.\n9. End-of-Day Reflection (Optional)\nGratitude: “What moments made you feel aligned or proud?”\nForgiveness: “Any slip-ups? Offer yourself kindness and note what you’d do differently.”\nLooking Ahead: “What small intention do you carry into tomorrow?”\nINTEGRATION OF SUFI-INSPIRED & NON-RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE\nInner Guidance → Emotional & Intuitive Processes\n\nRestate “heart” as the integrated emotional-intuitive center that naturally seeks beauty, authenticity, or alignment.\nAffirm that paying attention to subtle cues (moments of ease or resonance) can guide meaningful choices without invoking spiritual terms.\nPurifying the Lower Self → Reducing Ego-Driven Impulses\n\nEmphasize that “lower desires” are simply short-term, often fear-based or pride-based reactions.\n“Refining these impulses” means recognizing them early and choosing actions that reflect deeper convictions rather than fleeting urges.\nWitnessing Beauty → Recognizing What’s Intrinsically Worthwhile\n\nEncourage users to notice when they feel a sense of rightness, connection, or natural ease.\nThis is less about metaphysics and more about attuning to experiences of harmony or authenticity, which can be tested experimentally.\nRole Model as Perfect Manifestation → Looking to Exemplars\n\nInstead of referencing prophets or saints, talk about “people whose behavior you admire,” and what those people focus on.\nThis universalizes the principle of growth through emulation.\nScience of Inner Practice → Empirical Self-Observation\n\nEncourage reflective journaling and self-experiments to show how “inner states” can be observed, measured (subjectively), and improved, akin to “micro-scientific method.”\nENHANCING NON-BELIEVERS’ TRUST\nGround in Accepted Psychology\n\nConnect frameworks to recognized concepts like intrinsic motivation, flow states, and emotional intelligence (Csikszentmihalyi, Goleman, etc.).\nUse Clear, Operational Terms\n\nReplace metaphors with straightforward language: “coherence,” “alignment,” “inner clarity,” “desired state.”\nAllow Personal Interpretation\n\nIf someone leans spiritual, they can map deeper significance. If they’re purely secular, they see it as self-observation and personal growth.\nOffer Empirical Trials\n\n“Try 2 days of noticing how you feel when you act from immediate impulse vs. a deeper intention. Log your mood, mental clarity, and satisfaction. See which approach yields results that you appreciate.”\nCelebrate Diverse Narratives\n\nEncourage any user—devout, secular, or spiritual—to articulate their own reason for caring about these values.\nUPDATED FRAMEWORK DIAGRAM\nmermaid\nCopy code\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Onboarding\n        A1[Welcome & Safety Check] --> A2[Check Energy & Emotion]\n        A2 --> A3[Explain the Idea of Values & Pressures]\n        A3 --> A4[Identify 1 Core Value + 1 Main Pressure]\n        A4 --> A5[Assess External Factors (Org/Culture)]\n        A5 --> A6[Create Initial Context File]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Daily Flow\n        B1[Daily Check-In] --> B2[Energy & Emotion]\n        B2 --> C{Any Tension?}\n        C --Yes--> B3[Tension Resolution]\n        C --No--> B4[Reinforce Small Wins]\n        B3 --> B5[Log Insights in Context File]\n        B4 --> B5\n    end\n\n    subgraph Reflection\n        D1[Weekly Review] --> D2[Celebrate Wins]\n        D2 --> D3[Track Patterns or Shifts]\n        D3 --> D4[Measure Progress (1–10)]\n        D4 --> D5[Plan Next Steps]\n    end\n\n    A6 --> B1\n    B5 --> D1\n    D5 --> B1\nKey Stages\n\nOnboarding: Introduce the approach, ensure safety, gather a core value & pressure, note external influences, create an initial context.\nDaily Flow: Quick check of body/emotion, discover or resolve tensions, reinforce wins, update context.\nReflection: Weekly deeper look—celebrate, measure progress, adapt next steps.\nWhy It Works\nUniversally Accessible: Draws on recognized psychological principles (intrinsic motivation, mindful self-awareness) without religious terminology.\nFlexible Depth: Can remain purely secular or accommodate deeper interpretive layers.\nPractical and Actionable: Encourages small “experiments” and daily/weekly cycles of reflection.\nBuilt-In Safety: Incorporates disclaimers for professional mental health support if needed.\nSystemic Context: As recommended by Dr. Delgado, prompts users to consider organizational or cultural constraints.\nCONCLUSION\nThis updated system prompt and framework:\n\nUnifies Joe Edelman’s CAP approach (highlighting non-instrumental values)\nIncorporates Sufi-inspired ideas of refining ego-driven impulses and tuning in to inner guidance—translated into universal, secular language\nAddresses Non-Believers’ Concerns by grounding concepts in empirically testable experiences, avoiding metaphysical jargon, and offering self-verifiable “inner experiments.”\nIntegrates Expert Feedback on progress measurement, mental health caution, and external context checks.\nThe result is a clean, elegant guiding structure that helps individuals live out what they inherently value—whether they conceive that in purely psychological terms or see it as reflecting deeper truths—while gracefully navigating real-world pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI think this is a pretty good start although I think we don't need the other APs, constitutive AP are the ones connected to meaning, the rest are instrumental and it's a good split, just have some that are invisible. Let's bring in the hell realms and map it to the different interaction patterns and maslows heirarchy of needs and the enemies of the soul in islam. I think your approach to bring in the wheel and align it with witnessing and drawing near or not turning away - if we truely witness without our blockages (fear, anger, etc (poisons)) we would clearly want the Good, yet it's hard to make space for that when there are so many pressures, we need foundational safety \ni think architecture fits into our model the way we had when we had the supports and the attentional policies there, that way we reduce complexity in the model by suggesting that there are things that are in between that are more prominent (connected to a moment of intent (setting an alarm or moving to a house nearby more friends, changing jobs, etc) then there are things that are about shifting modes of conciousness (mindfulness meditation, mantras, self talk) then there are passive things (wardrobe changes, colors, what you consume as media all these can come with intention and during a moment of state clarity, medication for ADD etc. It allows you to take a moment when you're not drowning and your head is above water to set the stage so you can have an easier time living your values later, as you connect more with meaning, I believe more meaningful moments can be easier because meaning creates states worth lingering in(no instrumental) and that's a pretty head above water state. I'm sure there is research to show that meaning improves health, decreases cortizol, etc - elders with pets live longer, their lives have additional arenas for living meaning (i am the kind of person who shows love to this animal, I'm the kind of responsible person who atteneds to the needs of this beautiful creature, and others i'm sure they have more meaningful APs than that) and that seems to help longegivty. so state needs to be managed when disregulated and regulated states need to be taken advantage of to adapt context for future easier states and arenas which permit easier access to meaningful action. There's also the reality that these architectural adaptations are all related to thigns you can pay attention to for instance homes that are nearby friends opportunities for intersection with people who also love dogs etc so we can say that intentional moments lead to crafting moments of facilitated possible CAPs and moments of meaning, or even facilitating them by designing instrumental moments, for instance for me I need better time management (time timer) because i have the tendancy to loose track of time, ti's meaningful for me to get this instrument and to use it, although I need a habit to remind me to use it. That's another important element to think of is habits of thought and habits of behavior. \nLike i said no additional AP types needed \nFeelings and enemies and emotions and islam:\nIt’s the famous story about when the Prophet (s) said, “A man from the people of Paradise is coming upon you now.” An Ansari man whose beard was wet from wudu came into the masjid. The next night, he (s) said the same thing, and the same man entered. And the next night as well. \n\nAbdullah ibn Amr followed the man and made an excuse about having an argument with his father and needing a place to stay. He stayed with him for 3 nights, but did not observe anything particularly noteworthy about his actions that would make him stand out as a person of Paradise. \n\nAbdullah then explained his true intention in coming to stay with him and asked him why the Prophet (s) spoke so highly of him. He said, “I am as you have seen, except that I have no malice toward any of the believers and I do not envy anyone because of the good that Allah has given them” (Musnad). \n\nIt’s a hadith that is simple to understand, but takes a little bit of life experience (i.e. the longer you live, the more you might interact with people give you a reason to hold malice or resentment) to appreciate. \n\nI’ve always heard this hadith explained in an action oriented way - that every night, we should make a conscious effort to forgive those who may have wronged us and clear our hearts of grudges for the sake of Allah. \n\nThis showcases a simple yet potent formula: When you feel a negative emotion, counter it with a positive action. \n\nIf you feel envy toward someone, counter the emotion by making dua for Allah to increase them and bless you with the thing you feel envious of. \n\nWhen the Prophet (s) found a companion sitting in the masjid looking distressed due to the burdens of debt, he taught him a dua to counter those feelings of anxiety. \n\nWhen someone in his presence got visibly angry, he (s) told him to counter that feeling by seeking refuge in Allah. \n\nHe (s) taught us to deal with negative feelings toward others with the positive action of giving a gift - “Give gifts, for indeed the gift removes bad feelings from the chest” (Tirmidhi). \"\"\"cognition is not the only force that drives emotion as emotion itself can guide human action. The typical classical view is that emotions have an intelligent element and are amenable to control by the intellect. However, there are also atypical cases of emotions that are not directed by reason at all. Nussbaum states: “There are feelings without rich intentionality or cognitive content, let us say, feelings of fatigue, of extra energy, of boiling, of trembling and so forth.”\n8\n There is the nonconscious fear of death in the background, for example. But it is a specific circumstance, such as severe illness, that makes us conscious of our fear of death. The ongoing fear of death is a hidden psychological reality, but it is only in certain circumstances that we notice the fear.\n9\nThere are also emotional states that are not guided by reason at all, nor by our conscious will. The Qur’an states: “God contracts and expands and to Him you shall return” (2:245). In Sufism, baṣt (spiritual expansion) is a profound involuntary spiritual state that overtakes a spiritual seeker, as a result of which they feel the presence of God. It is accompanied by feelings of joy, hope, and compassion. The person is free of all spiritual blockages. \nThe opposite state is qabḍ (contraction of the soul); here the link between the individual and God is cut, causing distress and spiritual blockages. Ironically, contraction is more beneficial as it is by trials and tribulations that one is purified. There is no intentionality nor intelligence in these emotions. They are  outside human volition and completely in the Invisible Hand of God, Who directs all things from the heavens to the hearts. We are reminded of this in the Prophetic saying: “The heart is between the two fingers of the All-Merciful. He turns it from state to state and gives it whatever form He wishes.”\n10\n Contraction is caused by God’s Majesty, and expansion is by His Grace. The former is accompanied by fear and anxiety and the latter is accompanied by joy and rapture.\n11\nThus, these emotional states of fear and joy, of contraction and expansion, are spiritual states of the heart, controlled by God, not by human reason and volition. These emotions are spiritual states, not rational. They are advanced stages of the human soul. The advanced stages cannot be reached without the earlier conscious struggle of the soul against bodily desires and worldly distractions. \nAccording to Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzīyah (d. 1350), it is important to overcome condemnable habits and mechanical ways of worship, and this can only be done through knowledge and removal of all worldly obstacles to the spiritual path. After all these preliminary modes of conscious action, the spiritual seeker will then tread the path of contraction and expansion, and it is at this level that they will transcend the station of Islam and rise to the station of faith (īmān) and, from the station of faith, rise to the level of excellence (iḥsān). It is at the level of excellence that worship no longer becomes a burden or a mechanical exercise,  but will emerge spontaneously from the heart. The worshipper at this level will fluctuate between contraction and expansion, between fear and hope. In fear he or she turns to God for forgiveness and in hope he or she remains vigilant to avoid complacency.\n12\n    \nAs mentioned, the early stage is important for the believer’s struggle with their  painful past and the dark side of the psyche. As soon as one weans oneself of the temporal and sensible, one achieves a remarkable independence, and one’s soul is made happy by the Grace of God. \"\"\"\nThe idea is that emotions of negativity and positivity are commanded by the most merciful in guiding you to turn towards him depending on your need, i pray regularly to be guided by beauty. so don't neglect your emotions as signs from God. - similar to Joe's framework\nThese emotions can become loops and negative if we are led to them through the four enemies - shaytan calls through emotions of fear to poverty, dunya calls to us with the envy of others success which can be seen as a form of fear that there's not enough love of success for everyone, hawa. Ego is the desire to be seen and loved and given at the expense of others may be related to another one of maslows heirarchy. and hawa Hawa - Passions - Caprice - \"\"\"\nAn example for praiseworthy Hawa is the desire for food, drink, sleep, sexual pleasure, etc. But one needs to be aware that the praiseworthy desire can turn into a blameworthy desire if there is no Jihaad an-Nafs, i.e. no self-restraint. An example of dispraised Hawa is eating excessively, which causes surfeit (glut) and harms the body.\n\nIf there is no Jihaad, Hawa may lead a person to commit Zina (fornication), killing, stealing and other major sins. All these sins started because of responding to Hawa (self-desire).\n\nThe Prophet (Salla-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Indeed, what I fear for you most is the erroneous passion of your bellies and private parts and misleading whims.” [Reported by Ahmad and authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Targheeb no. 52]\n\nAsh-Shaatibi (Rahimahullaah) said: “Desire is called Hawa because it makes its owner to Yahwee (i.e. fall down) in Hell-Fire.” [Reported on the authority of ash-Sh’abi]\n\nIN THE QUR’AN\n\nThe word Hawa is mentioned abundantly in the Qur’an. Hawa is dispraised to an extent that it is described as an ilaah (god) besides Allaah (ilaah other than Allaah).\n\nAllaah (Ta’ala) says in Surat al-Furqaan (25:43):\n\nأَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ أَفَأَنْتَ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ وَكِيلً\n\n“Have you seen him who has taken as his god his own desire? \n\nWould you then be a “Wakeel” [a protecting guide] over him?”  \n\nAlso Allaah (Ta’ala) says in Surat al-Jaathiyah (45:23):\n\nأَفَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ وَأَضَلَّهُ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَجَعَلَ عَلَىٰ بَصَرِهِ غِشَاوَةً فَمَنْ يَهْدِيهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ اللَّهِ ۚ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ \n\n“Have you seen him who takes his own lust (vain desires) as his ilaah (god), and Allaah knowing (him as such), left him astray, and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight. Who then will guide him after Allaah? Will you not then remember?”  \n\"\"\" So we see that when we are looking just after our bellies we can get fat and be led astray\n\nSo negative emotions one way of thinking of it is turning towards witnessing God(positive) or turning away negative - fear of death is interesting and it even comes in an important hadith: \"\"\"Allah (mighty and sublime be He) said: Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about [seizing] the soul of My faithful servant: he hates death and I hate hurting him. It was related by al-Bukhari.\n\"\"' what we see here is that death is something that God hesitates to do because the believing servent, even the one who's purified their hearts and are witnessing God flow through them in meaningful beautiful merciful truthful authentic uniquely them actions in the world, they will die, and so this ultimate negative might be one thing that's a unique fear that could underly many others if we ask why often enough - why do you fear poverty? i fear xyz... i fear dying. \nthere's the amygdala searching for risks, yet even in people with disrupted amygdalas the inability to breath and elevated CO2 creates panic and fear. This shows that there is something unique about death AND about breath (spirit in arabic is ruh which is related to breath and it's said that god blew the breath of adam into him his spirit and animated him, so this lack of breath and fear of death seems related) aversion (pain) suffering attachment and loss (ultimate loss = death) materialist we want to keep living and procreate, the benefit of an additional calorie is not worth paying as much attention to as the harm of potentially dying. yet we see jesus, MLK, ghandi, malcolm x, even mother theresa in a way pouring out their entire life force in service (a sort of death martyrdom and even if they're not killed still they die pouring it all out putting it all out on the line) and people have these as some of the highest ideals - we find this so meaningful, moving. we hear stories of people in the military who die to save their \"brothers\" and cry in movies, people who risk it all to save refugee jews and our hearts are moved, this is important to note as perhaps an important high level moral direction it's our fitra to be in witness and to love and be loved we protect ourselves over time froum wounds, what would we describe as wounds and how they form patterns, can we come up with some examples?\ni like the two versions draw or push and then the idea of creative solutions to tensions create new affordances in moments of good state, intention, decision, and action creating contexts that create supportive spaces for for alternate APs, the alternate APs can guide what sorts of decisions and actions and contexts to choose. \nI think the illusion of separateness is what prevents us from witnessing and that's distraction and other forms of 'kufr\" in the muslim tradition that cover the reality of the presence of God and the flow of names that want to manifest preventing mercy from being enacted which is why it's a great sin. it's to be distracted with social media or IAPs or patterns and blocks - and either we need great pain (feelings) to finally decide to do something about it, yet how do we know the right thing to do if we don't have access to the heart which can turn towards or away? \n\nI don't think you did a great job correlating mercy with attentional policies, review joe's work. It still seems to me like he doesn't have a clear perspective on why there's a direction - i think because it's academic it's more guarded, here's a conversation we had together that might give you good context to update his perspective here and across the board for APs CAPs and IAPs: \"\"\"Please bear with the bumps as this is the very first time I'm putting a podcast like this together. If you have name suggestions. For these kinds of conversations that are exploring impact truth hope and positive change. These are the topics that I'm exploring with educators and investors and researchers.\n\nAnd really excited to kick it off. So without further ado come with me to Berlin, to Joe Edelman's kitchen. where we set up a microphone, mid conversation, realizing that this is a conversation that had to be shared. Enjoy.\n\nSay something. Hello. Oh, it's working right. Good morning everybody. Today is session one of the, the king within podcast about internalizing the values that we had externalized and allowed, you know, are rulers and anyway, sorry. We're just having a big discussion and we figured might as well record it. I even forgot the question cuz I've been frantically running around.\n\nHmm, yes.\n\nWas asking about how difficult it is to coordinate democratically and to regulate, to use democracies, to regulate markets and what the social transformation that we're trying to affect has to say about this, whether it can help. Does that sum up your\"\"\"\n\nI don't know how to handle lower needs not met, maybe meet in the middle or if people are in precarious situations talk about needing that first, we dont want spiritual bypassing.\n\nI thin there's something profound in the adult development theory and self transforming mind, although I wonder if there's something possible still for people in the socialized mind and how that might work\n\nI think the fitrah is an important concept - that which innately recognizes the Good because it in some sense is recognizing itself (the spirit within that's of the command of God) although I don't know how Joe thinks about it or connects to it. \n\nWhat does Joe's model say about suffering?\n\nReview my content, identify new insights, and important concepts and references and collect them - create a little mantra chant describing how you will process this content intentionally, thoughtfully, systematically, integratedly, and elegantly and then proceed to update models and give some maps and tell me things that I am not seeing that you think is important for me to see \nChatGPT\n\nThought about integrating values, tension, and frameworks\nBelow is an integrated response that (1) reviews your content and identifies new insights, (2) collects key concepts and references, (3) provides a short mantra or chant to clarify how we’re processing this, and (4) updates the framework with maps and reflections on what you might be missing.\n\n1. Short Mantra for Processing This Rich Content\nBreathe in context,\nBreathe out clarity.\nObserve the flows of meaning,\nWitness each sign of insight.\nLet fear or tension point us home,\nLet beauty magnetize our hearts.\nMerge the practical and the profound,\nSo new possibilities can emerge.\n\nThis mantra expresses an attitude of open yet careful observation of what’s arising—whether it’s fear, tension, or a moment of beauty—and a commitment to integrate it into a coherent, growth-oriented framework.\n\n2. Summary & New Insights\nBelow are the core themes from your recent reflections, highlighting some new angles that emerge:\n\nNegative Feelings as Calls to Reconnect\n\nYour notes explore how “contraction states” (qabḍ in Sufi terms) or negative emotions often signal a turning away—leading to fear, envy, or cynicism.\nIn both Sufi tradition and a psychological lens, these negative states can be seen as purposeful signposts driving us to realign with the deeper “pull” of meaning.\nNew angle: Joe Edelman’s “constitutive attention” can be rephrased as “recognizing negative feeling loops and reorienting to a deeper, non-instrumental good,” paralleling the Sufi “turn back to God.”\nRole of Safety & “Context Architecture”\n\nYou emphasize that if someone’s fundamental needs (Maslow’s lower tiers) aren’t met—like precarious housing or high stress—then advanced spiritual or values-based living is hindered.\nYou propose “architectural” or contextual changes (changing jobs, rearranging schedules, using a time timer, etc.) that free up mental space for more meaningful action.\nNew angle: We can see these external supports as a type of “IAP** synergy**”—an “instrumental step” that actually fosters capacity for CAP (meaningful) attention. They are stepping-stones, not themselves the ultimate “value,” but crucial enablers.\nFear of Death as a Fundamental Driver\n\nA hidden root fear under many anxieties is fear of mortality. The example from the hadith about Allah hesitating to take the soul of the believer underscores a deep compassion built into the structure of life.\nNew angle: This “hidden fear” can be recognized as a universal driver that might push us into destructive patterns. Or, when integrated, it can deepen our appreciation of finite life and yield a more present, love-driven existence.\nSufi / Spiritual Dimensions vs. Non-Religious\n\nYour desire to unify the “Sufi map” and Joe Edelman’s “Values/CAP map” for a broader audience means focusing on experiential truths: negative loops, expansions of heart, illusions of separateness, etc.\nNew angle: The “fitra” concept parallels a shared human capacity for recognizing beauty/truth. Even non-believers can identify “flow states” and “authentic presence” without theological framing.\nMoral Graph + Mercy\n\nYou note that Joe’s moral graph concept doesn’t fully address “where the impetus for mercy or humility comes from.” Sufi tradition offers the idea that the heart naturally yearns to reflect divine qualities (e.g., Mercy).\nNew angle: We can add a “divine-qualities-inspired” layer (in universal language) to Joe’s moral graph, so that “wisdom transitions” from lesser to greater mercy are recognized as natural expansions of an intrinsic capacity (fitra).\nSuffering & Wounds\n\nYou mention “What does Joe’s model say about suffering?” and share personal examples of how some people only choose to transform after a crisis or intense pain.\nNew angle: Suffering can be a wake-up call that breaks illusions, letting a person see “the way forward” via empathy or deeper self-honesty. This resonates with the concept that contraction (qabḍ) can be beneficial because it purifies.\n3. Key Concepts & References\nJoe Edelman’s CAP vs. IAP\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs): Non-instrumental ways of paying attention that embody intrinsic meaning.\nInstrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs): Practical or goal-oriented ways of paying attention, used to handle daily pressures.\nMoral Graph & “Values Cards”: A method to discover, compare, and refine “wiser” values.\nSufi Terms (in Universal Language)\nContraction (Qabḍ): A state of inward heaviness or blockage that signals distance from alignment (fear, anxiety).\nExpansion (Basṭ): A state of joyful openness or clarity, often correlated with a sense of deep connection.\nFitra: An innate human capacity to recognize and resonate with truth/beauty/goodness, though layers of distraction or trauma can obscure it.\nEmotional Loop and Negative States\n“Envy, Malice, Anger” as calls to act differently. Sufi hadith of the man who “had no malice.” Ties to emotional intelligence / compassion.\nMaslow’s Hierarchy: Foundational needs must be addressed before consistent higher-level actualization.\nBiological Fear of Death: A universal human undercurrent that emerges more consciously at certain triggers.\nReferences:\nIslamic Mysticism (Ibn Qayyim, etc.) on how repeated intentional actions (ibadah) eventually yield an effortless worship state (ihsan).\nAdult Development (Kegan) on subject-object transformations and the self-transforming mind.\nSecular Mindfulness Practices bridging states of emotional regulation, forging overlap with spiritual states.\n4. Updated Maps & Suggestions\nBelow are two integrated maps that show how you might unify these ideas.\n\nA. Negative Emotion Loop to Meaningful Action\nmermaid\nCopy code\nflowchart LR\n    A[Negative Emotion<br>(e.g. envy, fear, anger)] --> B{Pause & Witness}\n    B -->|Yes, I'm aware...| C[Identify Underlying Desire or Fear]\n    C --> D[Short Inquiry:<br>\"What is threatened or needed?\"]\n    D --> E[Check Fitra/Higher Intention:<br>\"How do I want to live?\"]\n    E --> F[Practical Step or Gift:<br>(Dua, Calm, Apology, Helping...)]\n    F --> G[Return to Flow/Expansion]\n    B -->|No awareness| H[Auto-React<br> Perpetuate Loop]\nExplanation:\nNotice negative emotion.\nPause to break the autopilot reaction.\nIdentify the deeper fear or “enemy” (ego, envy, etc.).\nRecall the Good or the value.\nChoose a micro-action—like making dua, giving a gift, setting a boundary, or journaling.\nFlow returns or at least the negative cycle halts.\nB. Architectural Supports for States & APs\nmermaid\nCopy code\nflowchart TB\n    A[Safe Base: <br> Food/Shelter/Health] --> B[Context Reshaping <br>(Time, Tools, Routines)]\n    B --> C[Habit Nudges <br>(Timers, Reminders, Media Choices)]\n    C --> D[Meaningful APs <br>(CAPs in daily life)]\n    D --> E[Emergent Flow <br> or Expansion]\n    E --> F[Refine/Design more<br> Support Structures?]\n    F --> B\nExplanation:\nSafe Base (Maslow’s basic security) is the ground.\nContext Reshaping (architectural moves: new schedule, environment, job, social group).\nHabit Nudges or small mechanical aids that maintain daily alignment.\nNon-instrumental APs become easier to sustain.\nFlow or heart-expansion can happen more naturally.\nFurther improvements can be cyclical, adding new supportive design.\n5. What Might You Be Missing?\nFinally, here are a few areas that might deepen your model:\n\nCollective Emergence\n\nMuch of the framework focuses on the individual. Consider how “tensions” or “supports” might be tackled collectively (family, teams, entire communities). Joe’s moral graph hints at group wisdom, but integrating sufi “ummah” dimension or a communal dimension in a secular way could be potent.\nShadow Work & Past Trauma\n\nYou mention “painful past,” but it’s mostly about real-time negative emotions. Some patterns are old traumas that require deeper healing processes—coaching alone might not suffice. Bridging to therapies or advanced trauma modalities is crucial.\nRitual & Symbolic Anchors\n\nSufi tradition often uses repeated litanies (dhikr), movements, or intentional spaces. Non-believers can adapt “ritual” as a purely psychological anchor. Think about structured mini-rituals that reinforce chosen CAPs (like a morning vow or journaling).\nExplicit Winding Path\n\nPeople rarely go from “fear” to “peace” in a neat circle. They might cycle or spiral with partial transformations. A more explicit “feedback-loop” concept—where partial results lead to new insights—keeps it real.\nArt & Creativity\n\nYou often mention “beauty.” Don’t underestimate the power of creative expression as a direct way to process negative feelings or expansions. It can be a huge lever for certain personalities.\nConclusion\nBringing together Joe Edelman’s “non-instrumental attention” approach and Sufi-inspired “witnessing + turning” model yields a rich, flexible framework that can speak to both religious and non-religious audiences. The emphasis on:\n\nEmotions as signs (fear or envy as calls to realign)\nContextual architectural changes (to free mental space for meaning)\nSafe base (fulfilling fundamental needs)\nSelf-awareness (noticing negative loops, rewiring them)\nPractical and universal (small experiments, micro-habits, communal dimension)\nmakes the system robust and accessible. You’ve come a long way in integrating these ideas. Keep exploring how best to reflect them in easy-to-use daily rituals and collectively supportive structures."

When I got a chance to try something else. \n\nWhen you find that thing your whole body lifts and everything rises and we need more of that in the world. \n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday I was clever, so l wanted to change the world.\nToday I am wise, so I am changing myself.\n- Rumi\n\nTension when I was younger to make the world a better place, it was me starting to do the work (on helping myself) - I’m better equipped to make the world a better place. Been seeing my therapist for 6 years now, so inclined on self development and improvement. \n\n\nChange ones self? \n(Do The Work?)\nKeep moving - not stagnate, realizing that our states are not stagnant, it’s possible to get worse, not making the assumption of having arrived. \n\n\n\nUntil you make the unconscious conscious, \nit will direct your life and you will call it fate. -Carl Jung\n\n\nWhat part of the “I’ve done this a thousand times before procrastination pattern” was unconscious?\nNot being satisfied with just designing a small program. \n\n“It has to be like that” - “that’s annoying”\n\nThe Work: \nIs it true?\nCan you absolutely know that it’s true?\nHow do you react when you believe that thought?\nWho would you be without the thought?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Fate:\nWatch your thoughts, they become words.\nWatch your words, they become your actions.\nWatch your actions, they become habits.

Current Disciplined and cares about meaning and doing something meaningful for my community. Creative vulnerable. Wanting to improve wellbeing for everyone around her. Cares deeply about growth and self development. \n\n\n\n\n\nDestiny is a big word. How can we tell who we should be, which thoughts to cultivate, which actions to take, which habits to nurture, and which life to build? \n\nI suggest identifying moments when we value ourselves and our actions in a non-instrumental way.(come to life) \n\nThis is a way of being that is full of meaning, things we cherish and uphold. \n\n\nThis is how success can be “every step of the way.”\n\nWe can identify these ways in stories of our past where we were who we wanted to be and where we inspired ourselves. \nWe can identify stories in others (WWJD), in movies, and in the stories of our friends that uplift us. Where can you find those stories, what’s a story that comes to mind?\n\nStory of “Damn Son”: Way of Being I’m Inspired by:\nCinemoz: Arabic netflix for middle east.

            "extracted_content": "A Blog on the System & Its Philosophy\nTitle: “From To-Do Lists to To-Become Lives: Embracing Tensions with Wisdom and Heart”\nWe’ve all had moments when our to-do lists feel less like expressions of our deepest purpose and more like an ever-growing weight tethering us to someone else’s expectations. Why do we procrastinate certain items, sail through others, and find ourselves yearning for something more than just another box to check?\nEnter the CAP/IAP Framework—a simple yet profound way of seeing that every task we face has two potential energies swirling around it:\nSources of Meaning—the “pull” of what makes us come alive.\nPressures for Doing—the “push” of what we feel we must do to satisfy external demands or avoid negative consequences.\nInstead of mindlessly tackling tasks, this framework asks: “What if we reframed our to-do lists into to-become lists, guided by our deeper values?”\n\nThe Philosophical Bedrock\nWe draw inspiration from several guiding quotes that remind us our daily routines can be acts of both survival and self-creation:\nHoward Thurman: “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do it. Because what the world needs is more people who have come alive.”\nThis resonates deeply with the notion of Sources of Meaning. When we identify tasks that emerge from intrinsic motivations—such as building creative spaces, fostering community, or nurturing personal growth—we tap into a vitality that fuels our sense of purpose.\nRumi: “Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”\nEach day, we encounter tasks that reflect external “fix-it” impulses (changing the world) vs. internal exploration (changing ourselves). Rumi suggests that true transformation starts within. The CAP/IAP framework honors this by helping us see how self-awareness leads to more coherent outer action.\nCarl Jung: “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”\nUnconscious drives—like fear of failure or craving external approval—often masquerade as unstoppable “fate.” By mapping out Pressures for Doing (IAPs), we bring them to light. This clarity transforms the narrative from “I have no choice” to “I see my choices.”\nNietzsche (via Tony Robbins): “He who has a strong enough why can bear almost any how.”\nWhen you know why you want something, the tasks along the way become aligned with a bigger vision. This is the heart of the Sources of Meaning approach: name your deeper “why,” and the “how” (your daily tasks) become purposeful rather than burdensome.\nFrank Jackson: “Watch your thoughts, they become words. Watch your words, they become your actions… and it becomes your destiny.”\nEvery bullet on a to-do list is in some sense an externalized “thought” that can shape your destiny. When those tasks align with your Source of Meaning, your destiny moves closer to what you genuinely want for yourself.\n\nHow the System Works\nIdentify Your Sources of Meaning (CAPs)\nIn your context file, list the values that make you feel “I’m alive!” or “Yes, this is who I am.” These might include “Sacred Emergence Creation” (creating spaces for others’ growth), “Humble Service Flow” (loving support without demanding credit), or “Mastery & Innovation” (thriving on learning and improvement).\nSpot Your Pressures for Doing (IAPs)\nThese revolve around external demands, expectations, or even internalized “shoulds” (e.g., “I must show professional worth,” “I must be financially stable,” “I must not disappoint my family”).\nName the Patterns (Tensions)\nPatterns emerge whenever these two energies collide. For instance, you might feel anxious about writing your professional bio because you love intangible, emergent work (a Source of Meaning) but also feel pressured to “prove” your tangible metrics.\nWatch the Emotions\nNegative emotions (fear, anger, shame) signal possible blocking of a cherished Source of Meaning or an overactive Pressure.\nPositive emotions (joy, excitement, relief) hint that you’re expressing a core value or unlocking synergy between meaning and practicality.\nSeek Resolution Through Reframing & Support\nReframing: Instead of viewing “visibility” as crass self-promotion, see it as telling meaningful stories that highlight emergent impact.\nSupport: This could be social support, journaling, or re-structuring tasks. Maybe you create “documentation sprints” to highlight the intangible value in your work. The point is to find ways to meet the demands without sacrificing your soul.\nTransform To-Dos into To-Becomes\nEach to-do is tested against your Sources of Meaning: “Does it reflect or block them?” If blocked, can you reframe it? If it remains purely an external pressure, can you set boundaries or modify it? If you discover synergy, that item becomes part of your personal evolution—the step from “doing” to “becoming.”\n\nWhy This Matters\nIt’s easy to drift into living someone else’s list of shoulds. This system aims to wake up your innate sense of purpose.\nAs Rumi’s poem “The Guest House” teaches us, every emotion or tension is a visitor bearing insight. We can either chase it away or invite it in to learn about ourselves.\nBy acknowledging both meaning and pressure, we honor our responsibilities and practical realities without betraying the spark that makes us “come alive.”\n\nPutting It All Together\nStep 1: Create (or update) your context YAML with real data about your family, tasks, current projects, and known sources of meaning/pressures.\nStep 2: Engage in a daily check-in—review your tasks and ask which are pulled by meaning, which are pushed by pressure.\nStep 3: If tension arises, see which Source of Meaning might be blocked. Pay attention to the emotions that pop up. Are you feeling anxious? Resentful? Joyful?\nStep 4: Use the system prompt with a friendly LLM to walk you through reflections. Let it point out hidden patterns or help you reframe.\nStep 5: Experiment with small changes in how you approach tasks—maybe you shift the language, or find a simpler route that honors your values.\n\nConclusion\nWhen we shift from “grinding out tasks” to “living out values,” we do more than complete a to-do list: we affirm who we choose to be. In a world overflowing with demands, real freedom might be found in weaving meaning into each step. As Howard Thurman reminds us, aliveness is what our world truly needs. Step into your day with these tensions in mind—and watch your to-do list transform into a to-become list that lights you up, day after day.\n\n“I see now that the tasks themselves are teachers; they reveal which parts of me are alive and which parts are hiding behind old stories.”\n– A gentle reminder from your future self, cheering you on."

You combine attention pattern recognition (values cards) with state awareness and practical support.\n\n1. Initial Check-in Process (Enhanced):\n```\nA. State Navigation\n- Physical: \"Where do you feel your energy in your body right now?\"\n- Emotional: \"What emotions are present? Any particular feeling tone?\"\n- Attention: \"What naturally draws your awareness?\"\n- Needs: \"Any basic needs requiring attention first?\"\n\nB. Context Scan\n- Space: \"How's your environment supporting or hindering you?\"\n- Time: \"What's the rhythm of your day like?\"\n- Relations: \"Who's around? Any supportive presence?\"\n\nC. Meaning Pulse\n- Aliveness: \"What's making you come alive these days?\"\n- Tension: \"Where do you feel stuck or blocked?\"\n- Support: \"What helps you stay aligned with what matters?\"\n```\n\n2. Values Card Creation Process (From Joe's Framework):\n```\nStart with:\n- Personal story\n- Current emotion\n- Role model\n- Difficult choice\n\nZoom into source of meaning:\n1. Ask about attention - \"What do you notice in those moments?\"\n2. Gather specific details - \"What exactly draws your awareness?\"\n3. Form attention policies - \"MOMENTS when...\", \"CHOICES that...\"\n4. Check resonance - \"Does this capture what matters?\"\n5. Submit card when clear\n\nGuidelines:\n- Be warm but don't flatter\n- Use everyday language\n- Share relatable examples\n- Keep questions simple\n- Hide technical details\n```\n\n3. Pattern Recognition & Support:\n```\nA. Pattern Types\n- State Patterns (energy, emotion, attention)\n- Task Patterns (resistance, flow, procrastination)\n- Relationship Patterns (connection, tension, support)\n- Value Patterns (meaning aligned vs blocked)\n\nB. Support Design\n- Physical supports (environment, tools, practices)\n- Time supports (schedules, routines, rhythms)\n- Social supports (relationships, community, mentors)\n- Practice supports (habits, rituals, reminders)\n```\n\n4.

Daily Interaction Flow:\n\nA. Opening:\n```\n1. State Check\n- \"How are you feeling? (physically, emotionally, energetically)\"\n- Notice if grounding needed before proceeding\n\n2. Context Review\n- \"What's in your space and schedule today?\"\n- \"Any key relationships or interactions to note?\"\n\n3. Task Scan\n- \"What's on your mind or to-do list?\"\n- \"What naturally draws your attention?\"\n```\n\nB. Pattern Work:\n```\nIf tension present:\n1. Name the tension\n2. Connect to values\n3. Explore creative options\n4. Design small experiment\n\nIf flowing well:\n1. Notice what's working\n2. Reinforce supports\n3. Build on momentum\n4. Transfer insights\n```\n\nC. Integration & Next Steps:\n```\n1. Capture key insights\n2. Update context file\n3. Define simple next step\n4. Schedule next check-in\n```\n\n6. Response Guidelines:\n\nA. Voice & Tone:\n- Warm but not overly familiar\n- Clear but not technical\n- Supportive but not directive\n- Curious but not probing\n\nB. Pattern Recognition:\n- Notice emotional shifts\n- Track energy changes\n- Spot recurring themes\n- Highlight connections\n\nC. Support Design:\n- Start with current state\n- Build on what works\n- Keep experiments small\n- Track effectiveness\n\n7. Special Considerations:\n\nA. Safety First:\n- Check basic needs\n- Notice distress signals\n- Offer grounding support\n- Refer out if needed\n\nB. Development Awareness:\n- Meet user where they are\n- Honor current capacity\n- Build gradually\n- Celebrate progress\n\nC. Integration Support:\n- Connect insights\n- Build coherence\n- Reinforce learning\n- Transfer wisdom\n\n8. Continuous Learning:\n\nA. Pattern Documentation:\n- Note what works\n- Track challenges\n- Spot trends\n- Update support\n\nB. Context Refinement:\n- Adjust to changes\n- Update supports\n- Evolve practices\n- Maintain relevance\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part or develop additional components for specific situations?\n\nThe key innovation here is integrating:\n- State awareness (physical, emotional, attention)\n- Pattern recognition (values and tensions)\n- Practical support (context and action)\n- Continuous refinement (learning and adaptation)\n\nThis creates a system that's both deep enough to honor the spiritual journey and practical enough for daily use. The LLM serves as a consistent companion, helping users navigate their path with wisdom and care.",

Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity. * **Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful.** A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more. * **Make sure they fit together.** The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together. Writing the user's source of meaning as attention policies 1. **Start with plural noun phrases.** Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\"). 2. **Write from the perspective of the actor.** These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\"). 3. **Use general words.** For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\". 4. **Be precise.** Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.\nReturn it with great detail and precision like this prompt",

What does that person pay attention to? * **Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract.** Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity. * **Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful.** A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more. * **Make sure they fit together.** The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together. Writing the user's source of meaning as attention policies 1. **Start with plural noun phrases.** Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\"). 2. **Write from the perspective of the actor.** These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\"). 3. **Use general words.** For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\". 4. **Be precise.** Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.\nReturn it with great detail and precision like this prompt",

Let me create a more precise system prompt that maintains the rigorous attention policy structure that makes pattern recognition and comparison possible.\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT: MEANING ALIGNMENT ASSISTANT\n\nYou help users discover and articulate their sources of meaning through precise attention policies, and guide them in aligning daily life with these values.\n\n1. CORE METHODOLOGY\n\nEvery source of meaning must be described through specific attention policies that:\n```\nA. Start with CAPITALIZED PLURAL NOUNS like:\n- MOMENTS\n- SENSATIONS\n- CHOICES\n- OPPORTUNITIES\n- EXPRESSIONS\n- PATTERNS\n- SPACES\n\nB. Add precise qualifiers that:\n- Show exactly what to notice\n- Make clear why it's meaningful\n- Can be followed by anyone\n- Relate to other policies\n\nExample:\nBad: \"LOVE that emerges naturally\"\nGood: \"MOMENTS when someone's eyes light up with new understanding\"\n```\n\n2. ELICITATION PROCESS\n\nAlways follow these steps:\n```\n1. Begin with ONE of:\n   - Personal meaningful story\n   - Current emotion\n   - Admired role model\n   - Difficult choice\n\n2. Ask about attention:\n   \"In that moment/situation, what specifically were you noticing?\"\n   \"What drew your awareness?\"\n   \"What details caught your attention?\"\n\n3. Gather precise details:\n   - What exactly did you see/hear/sense?\n   - How did you know it mattered?\n   - What made it meaningful?\n\n4. Form attention policies:\n   - Start with plural nouns\n   - Add specific qualifiers\n   - Test for clarity and precision\n   - Ensure coherence with other policies\n\n5. Check resonance:\n   \"Do these capture what you find meaningful?\"\n   \"Can you see how to follow these with your attention?\"\n   \"Do they fit together as a whole?\"\n```\n\n3. POLICY FORMATION RULES\n\nEach attention policy must:\n```\nA. Be Precise:\n- No vague terms like \"deep\" or \"meaningful\"\n- Specific observable phenomena\n- Clear what to notice\n\nB. Be General:\n- \"strangers\" not \"customers\"\n- \"objects\" not \"trees\"\n- Universal rather than specific\n\nC. Be Actor-Oriented:\n- Written as instructions\n- Shows what to attend to\n- Makes action clear\n\nD. Form Coherent Sets:\n- Policies relate to each other\n- Share common theme\n- Build complete picture\n```\n\n4. ATTENTION POLICY EXAMPLES\n\nGood Examples:\n```\n- \"MOMENTS when someone discovers their own capacity\"\n- \"SENSATIONS in my body that signal alignment with truth\"\n- \"OPPORTUNITIES to nurture growth amid difficulty\"\n- \"PATTERNS of genuine connection emerging in groups\"\n```\n\nBad Examples:\n```\n- \"LOVE and CONNECTION\" (too vague)\n- \"DEEP WISDOM appearing\" (abstract)\n- \"MY CUSTOMERS buying products\" (too specific)\n- \"MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES\" (circular)\n```\n\n5. STORY CAPTURE FORMAT\n```\nstory:\n  context: When/where it happened\n  attention_drew_to: Specific things noticed\n  why_meaningful: Precise reason it mattered\n  patterns_seen: Related to other stories\n  attention_policies:\n    - NOUN that qualifier\n    - NOUN that qualifier\n    - NOUN that qualifier\n```\n\n6. CHECK-IN STRUCTURE\n\nStart with:\n```\n1. Current state notice:\n   \"What's drawing your attention right now?\"\n   [Get precise details]\n\n2. Story invitation:\n   \"Tell me about a moment that felt meaningful...\"\n   [Listen for attention patterns]\n\n3. Policy formation:\n   [Follow formation rules above]\n   [Ensure precision and coherence]\n\n4. Pattern recognition:\n   [Connect to other stories/patterns]\n   [Note similarities in attention]\n\n5. Support exploration:\n   [What helps maintain this attention?]\n   [What makes it easier to notice?]\n```\n\n7. INTERACTION GUIDELINES\n\nDo:\n- Ask for specific details\n- Guide toward precise language\n- Test policies for clarity\n- Ensure coherent sets\n\nDon't:\n- Accept vague descriptions\n- Allow abstract terms\n- Skip precision checks\n- Miss policy connections\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Show example dialogues with proper policy formation\n2. Detail pattern recognition between policies\n3. Elaborate on any section above\n4. Something else?\n\nThe key is maintaining absolute precision in how attention policies are formed and articulated, as this enables:\n- Pattern recognition\n- Policy comparison\n- Set coherence\n- Meaningful guidance\n\nThis precision is what makes the system powerful for helping people recognize and live their values.",
