      "content": "What you’re describing sounds like a kind of **oral habit / body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRB)** — similar to nail-biting, cheek chewing, or lip biting. A few points to help you make sense of it:  \n\n---\n\n### Why it might be happening\n- **ADD medication (stimulants like dexamphetamine, methylphenidate, etc.)**  \n  These can increase oral restlessness, jaw clenching, or repetitive habits. Dry mouth from meds can also make you more aware of your teeth/tongue.  \n- **Stress & anxiety**  \n  Stress often worsens oral habits as a way to self-soothe or release tension.  \n- **Sensory stimulation**  \n  Sometimes the tongue unconsciously seeks stimulation, especially with cracks, chips, or uneven dental surfaces.  \n\n---\n\n### What you can do\n1. **Check with your prescriber**  \n   - Mention the sores and new oral habit. Sometimes dosage adjustments, timing changes, or even switching formulations can reduce this side effect.  \n   - They’ll want to rule out bruxism (jaw grinding), which stimulants can worsen.\n\n2. **Protect your tongue**  \n   - Dental wax (sold for braces) can be pressed into tooth cracks or sharp edges temporarily.  \n   - A soft mouthguard (boil-and-bite from pharmacy) at night may help if it’s worse then.  \n   - Keep your mouth moist (sipping water, sugar-free gum, xylitol lozenges).\n\n3. **Redirect the habit**  \n   - Instead of fighting it, give your mouth a safer outlet:  \n     - Sugar-free gum  \n     - A chew stick (food-grade silicone “chewlery” exists for adults with ADHD/anxiety)  \n     - Sunflower seeds or crunchy vegetables  \n   - This breaks the feedback loop of tongue-on-tooth.\n\n4. **Stress reduction strategies**  \n   - Brief breathing exercises, body scans, or even hand fidgets can sometimes reduce oral fixation.  \n   - Notice if certain situations (work, boredom, high focus) make it worse.\n\n5. **Dental check-up**  \n   - If your teeth have cracks or rough edges, a dentist can smooth them or check for damage. Prevents sores from recurring.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **When to get help urgently:**  \n- Persistent tongue sores that don’t heal within 2 weeks  \n- Significant pain, swelling, or signs of infection  \n- Jaw pain, headaches, or tooth wear from clenching  \n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to suggest some **safe, discreet oral fidgets** you could use during the day, so you can redirect the habit without it feeling obvious in public?",

      "content": "That makes a lot of sense — trying to “just stop” usually doesn’t work, especially if it’s tied to medication and stress. It’s almost like your tongue is on autopilot.  \n\nInstead of relying only on willpower, here are some strategies that can help:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Replace, don’t remove  \n- **Chew something safer**: sugar-free gum, licorice root sticks, or even crunchy veggies.  \n- **“Chewlery”** (adult silicone chew tools, often marketed for ADHD/anxiety) can give your mouth stimulation without damage.  \n- Keep one in your pocket or bag so you don’t have to remember — it’s just there.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Make it harder to do automatically  \n- **Dental wax**: smooths out cracks so your tongue doesn’t “find” them as much.  \n- **Mouth spray / lozenge**: changing taste/sensation breaks the autopilot cycle.  \n- **Habit cue**: put a small sticker on your water bottle, computer, or phone case — when you see it, check “Is my tongue safe right now?”  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Work with your body, not against it  \n- **Mouth fidget routine**: Instead of “don’t do it,” try giving yourself 1–2 minutes where you *do* it consciously, then follow it with chewing gum. This teaches your body there’s a time/place.  \n- **Short breathing reset**: When you catch yourself, take one deep nasal breath and relax your jaw. That can break the loop without judgment.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Medication awareness  \n- Many people notice this is **worst when the stimulant peaks** or when it’s **wearing off**. Tracking *when* it happens might show a pattern you can mention to your doctor — sometimes a small timing adjustment helps a lot.  \n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can give you a **tiny “micro-protocol”** you could keep on your phone — 3 steps to do each time you notice your tongue going to your teeth, so it becomes a repeatable routine instead of a willpower battle.  \n\n👉 Want me to draft one for you?",
