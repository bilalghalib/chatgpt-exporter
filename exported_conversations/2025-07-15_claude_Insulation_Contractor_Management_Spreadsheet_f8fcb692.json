  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user requested comprehensive supporting documents to enhance a 5-day thermal improvement and insulation implementation training program for Mosul. They had already provided detailed slides, training curriculum, and system design materials, and wanted additional Google Docs-style worksheets to make the class more engaging and easier to operate. Claude created eight comprehensive markdown documents that transform the training from a standalone event into a complete business development ecosystem.\n\nThe user's training program teaches participants to start energy efficiency businesses by helping families reduce home temperatures and energy costs through insulation and thermal improvements. Claude developed a Facilitator's Master Guide with pre-training checklists, daily setup requirements, timing management strategies, and engagement techniques for different learning styles. A Participant Workbook and Learning Journal provides structured note-taking spaces, exercise templates, goal-setting sections, and a 30-day action plan. The Visual Reference Guide includes heat flow diagrams, material application techniques, quick calculation charts, and professional standards for field use.\n\nAdditional documents include a Complete Materials and Supplies Checklist with detailed shopping lists and budget planning templates for 20 participants, a Post-Training Follow-Up and Success Tracking System covering 90 days of graduate support with communication templates and intervention protocols, and a Marketing and Recruitment Toolkit with target audience profiles, ready-to-use marketing materials, and social media campaign templates. Claude also created an Assessment and Evaluation Toolkit with pre/post assessments, daily skills checkpoints, practical competency evaluations, and impact measurement frameworks. Finally, Claude enhanced the original business workbook system with detailed tables for all nine operational tabs and comprehensive implementation guidance.\n\nThe documents are designed to ensure operational excellence through consistent delivery, participant engagement across different learning styles, quality assurance through competency standards, sustainable impact via follow-up systems, scalability through efficient recruitment tools, proper resource management, and data-driven continuous improvement. Each document includes specific templates, checklists, scripts, and tracking systems that can be immediately implemented to support the training program's success in developing energy efficiency entrepreneurs in Mosul.",

I will read the Arabic slowly: “مَن نَفَّسَ عن مؤمن كُرْبَةً…” Then in English: “Whoever relieves a believer’s distress of the distressful aspects of this world, Allah will rescue him from a difficulty of the difficulties of the Hereafter.” This hadith teaches us that when we solve real problems for others, we earn care and compassion in return.\nKey Points:\nOur role is to identify and relieve distress.\nCaring for others is both a moral and practical motivation.\nThis spirit will guide every activity in this module.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul after the conflict, simple actions—like shading a hot room—can ease families’ hardships.”\nActivity Instructions:\u000b No action required; this is purely a reflective opening.\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Participants may not understand Arabic.\u000b   – Solution: Emphasize the translation and its meaning.\u000b • Issue: Silence may feel awkward.\u000b   – Solution: Encourage a brief moment of quiet: “Feel free to close your eyes as you reflect.”\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we’ve grounded ourselves in the purpose of caring and problem‑solving, let’s explore how to build comfort businesses that support dignified living.”\n2\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nBuilding Comfort Businesses for Dignified Living\n🏡 \"Dignified Living\"\n⚡ \"Energy Systems\" \n💼 \"Build Business\"\n🔌\"Save Amps\"\nDay 1\n09 :05 – 09 :15 Building Comfort Businesses for Dignified Living (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Quickly surface participants’ personal goals and set group focus on building comfort‑oriented energy businesses.\nSetup:\u000b • Chairs in a semicircle facing the screen\u000b • Two sticky‑note pads and pens at the front table\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Sticky‑note pads (2 per table)\u000b • Pens (enough for each participant)\u000b • Whiteboard or flipchart + markers\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify each table has pads and pens\u000b • Confirm the slide shows the four keywords clearly\u000b • Ensure whiteboard/flipchart is ready and markers work\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Good morning everyone! To kick off, I’d like you to think about what brings you here today. On the screen you see four words: ‘Dignified Living,’ ‘Energy Systems,’ ‘Build Business,’ and ‘Save Amps.’ Please choose two that best reflect your personal goal for this week. When you’ve decided, shout them out and stick a note on the board.”\nKey Points:\nEngaging everyone immediately builds energy.\nReveals shared priorities (e.g., comfort vs. savings).\nConnects personal goals to our module theme.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul last week, many families said ‘Save Amps’ because generator fuel is so costly—so our work here can really matter.”\nActivity Instructions:\nDisplay slide with the four keywords.\nAsk participants to write their two words on sticky notes.\nInvite them to come up, shout their choices, and place notes on the board.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Room too quiet / hesitant volunteers\u000b – Solution: Prompt specific people by name: “Ahlam, what two would you pick?”\nIssue: Participants pick more than two words\u000b – Solution: Gently remind: “Remember, only two—choose what matters most to you.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great—we see that most of us care about comfort and cost‑savings. Up next: let’s break the ice with a quick activity that’ll bust some heat‑flow myths.”\n3\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIce Breakers - “Hot-Potato Myth Tos”\nDay 1\n09:15 – 09:25 Ice Breaker: Hot‑Potato Myth Toss (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Energize the group and surface common heat misconceptions.\nSetup:\u000b • Participants stay in the semicircle.\u000b • You hold a soft bean‑bag or foam ball (“hot potato”).\nMaterials needed:\u000b • One bean‑bag or foam ball\u000b • Slide listing the four myths\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the slide clearly shows the myths.\u000b • Ensure everyone can see and hear you.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Okay everyone, let’s play ‘Hot‑Potato Myth Toss’ to kick things off. Here are four myths we often hear: ‘724 amps of heat is normal,’ ‘AC needs 50 tons for 100 m²,’ ‘Solar watts equal indoor heat,’ and ‘Bigger generator means better comfort.’ I’ll toss this ‘hot potato’ to someone in the circle. When you catch it, name one of these myths or another you’ve heard about home heat—and then toss it to someone else. Ready? Let’s go!”\nKey Points:\nCommon myths can lead to wasted time and money.\nIdentifying myths is the first step to learning the real energy story.\nA playful start builds energy for the rest of Day 1.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “Many families in Mosul believe that big glass windows keep rooms cool at night—but we’ll test that idea soon.”\nActivity Instructions:\nDisplay the slide with the four myths.\nToss the bean‑bag to a volunteer.\nVolunteer names one myth and tosses to another.\nContinue rapid tosses until time is up.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Silence or hesitation.\u000b – Solution: Prompt with “Can someone try ‘Solar watts equal indoor heat’?”\nIssue: Same person catches every time.\u000b – Solution: Aim your toss toward quieter participants.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great job! We’ve debunked some myths. Now let’s dive into ‘The Real Energy Story’ and see how heat really moves in our homes.”\n4\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*QR code\nPre-Assessment Quiz\nScan QR here\nDay 1\n09 : 45 – 09 : 55 (10 min) – Pre-Assessment Quiz (QR Code)\nPurpose\u000b Provide an easy way for everyone to complete the baseline quiz via their own device.\nSetup\u000b – Participants seated, devices ready (phone/tablet).\u000b – Project the slide full-screen with a large QR code.\nMaterials needed\u000b – Slide with QR code linking to the 5 MCQs + 2 open questions form.\u000b – Internet connection.\nPre-activity checks\u000b – Confirm Wi-Fi or mobile data is on.\u000b – Test-scanned the QR code yourself.\nFacilitator Script\n“Please take out your phones and scan the QR code on screen now. It will open our short pre-assessment form. You have about 5 minutes to answer all questions.”\nKey Points\nThis helps us see what you know before we start—no judgments.\nUse your own words for the open questions.\nWe’ll revisit these same questions on Day 5.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Just like we saw with Muthanna’s story, small facts make a big difference. Your answers will guide our teaching.”\nActivity Instructions\nScan the code.\nComplete the 5 multiple-choice questions (A–D).\nWrite your 1–2 sentence responses to the open questions.\nSubmit when done.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b – Issue: QR not scanning?\u000b Solution: Manually type the short URL displayed below the code.\u000b – Issue: No device?\u000b Solution: Pair up with a neighbor for one device each.\nTransition\n“Great—thank you!

In the Apply block, you’ll practice two hands-on tasks that put those learnings into action. And finally, in the Sell block, you’ll produce one proof or pitch deliverable that captures your work. Keep these objectives in mind as we move into the Learn session.”\nKey Points\nLearn: Understand the core concepts—ask questions if anything is unclear.\nApply: Use the tools and methods immediately—capture photos or data as evidence.\nSell: Create a shareable asset that demonstrates your progress for tomorrow’s pitch.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nGlance through each bullet to internalize the day’s goals.\nNote which deliverable (video, sheet, card, etc.) you’ll produce in the Sell block.\nWhen the slide disappears, we jump straight into the Learn session.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants miss which day they’re on →\u000b Solution: Verbally point to the highlighted row and restate “Today is Day X.”\nIssue: Overwhelm from many objectives →\u000b Solution: Emphasize that Learn and Apply each have only two bullets, and Sell has one—manageable chunks.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now let’s dive into our Learn session and master today’s first concept.”\n8\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n9\n\nBuilding Heat Gain Breakdown\nDay 1\nRoof: 70% \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWalls: 20% \nAir Leaks: 10% \nWe'll address each systematically\n10:10 – 10:15 Building Heat Gain Breakdown (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To show participants where heat enters a typical home so we can plan targeted interventions.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen with the three graphics (roof, walls, air leaks).\u000b • Keep participants seated from the quiz.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck ready with visuals clearly labeled\u000b • Laser pointer or cursor\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify each graphic is visible and the percentages are legible\u000b • Confirm pointer/device is working\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Let’s look at how heat gets into a building. You see that about 70 percent comes through the roof, 20 percent through walls, and the remaining 10 percent through air leaks around doors and windows. By breaking it down this way, we know where to focus our efforts: first on the roof, then on walls, and finally on sealing gaps. These steps, in order, will give us the biggest comfort gains and cost savings.”\nKey Points:\nRoof is the biggest source of heat gain (70 percent).\nWalls contribute 20 percent—important, but secondary.\nAir leaks account for 10 percent and can be sealed quickly.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul, many homes have uninsulated tin roofs, so fixing the roof alone can cut indoor temperatures by several degrees.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Which area would you prioritize first in your own homes or projects?”\nInvite 2–3 participants to share their choice and reasoning (30 seconds each).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants debate exact percentages.\u000b – Solution: Emphasize these are typical averages; local conditions may vary slightly.\nIssue: Overfocus on air leaks.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “While leaks matter, the roof and walls have much larger impact.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we understand the breakdown, let’s preview Ghassan’s real‑world case: a coating failure that teaches key lessons for durable solutions.”\n10\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nPreview – Ghassan’s Coating Failure\n🖌️ Low-cost coating peeled in 2 weeks\n🔄 Customer paid twice to fix it\n💡 Quality matters: invest once, save long-term\nDay 1\nThis is why we focus on trust and quality - one bad job ruins 10 referrals\n10:15 – 10:25 Preview – Ghassan’s Coating Failure (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To show a real cost of choosing cheap materials and underline why quality and trust are critical.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen with both peeled and intact coating photos visible\u000b • Keep participants seated\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with high-resolution images\u000b • Pointer or laser\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm both photos are sharp and contrasty\u000b • Verify this slide follows immediately after the previous segment in your deck\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Before we go into the technical fixes, let me share Ghassan’s story. He applied a very low-cost roof coating, hoping to save money—only to see it peel completely in two weeks. He had to pay a second contractor to redo the job, effectively doubling his expense. This illustrates why cutting corners on quality can cost far more in the long run. Today, we’ll learn heat-flow solutions that last, so you invest once and avoid repeat work.”\nKey Points:\nCheap upfront materials often lead to higher repair costs.\nOne bad job can destroy your reputation and referrals.\nInvesting in quality builds trust and long-term savings.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul’s intense summer sun, I’ve seen white paint blister and fall off within days—forcing homeowners to recoat multiple times in one season.”\nActivity Instructions:\nDisplay the peeled-off sample prominently.\nAsk: “Has anyone witnessed paint or coating fail this quickly?”\nInvite 1–2 quick responses (about 30 seconds each).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: No one has seen rapid peeling.\u000b – Solution: Relate to any familiar fading or cracking on local homes.\nIssue: Participants demand technical data now.\u000b – Solution: Reassure them: “We’ll cover material selection and durability in Day 2; today is about why we prioritize quality.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we understand the stakes, let’s explore ‘Heat Moves in 3 Ways’ to see the mechanisms behind these failures.”\n11\n\nHeat Moves in 3 Ways\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nReal 100m² Home:\nRoof: 75m² × 0.8 × 20°C = 1,200W\nWalls: 150m² × 1.2 × 20°C = 3,600W\nWindows: 15m² × 5.0 × 20°C = 1,500W\nTotal: 6.3kW = 2.4 tons needed\n10:25 – 10:35 How Heat Moves: Conduction, Convection, Radiation (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To demonstrate the three modes of heat transfer with simple demos, then apply them to calculate real heat gain in a home.\nSetup:\u000b • Demo table visible at front with all props laid out\u000b • Project slide showing demo instructions and home calculation\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Metal rod or spoon with an ice cube on one end\u000b • Incense stick + small stand or plate\u000b • IR camera or thermal image of a heat bridge\u000b • Calculator or whiteboard for home heat gain math\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Ensure the rod and ice are ready and stable\u000b • Test incense to produce visible smoke\u000b • Confirm IR image is loaded and legible\u000b • Have calculator or marker ready for the math example\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we’ll explore how heat actually moves in three different ways. First, for conduction, you’ll feel it yourselves: here’s a metal rod with an ice cube on one end—when I heat the opposite end over the flame, you’ll feel warmth travel instantly along the rod’s length. Next, for convection, watch this incense smoke under a lightweight sheet—notice how the hot air currents push the smoke upward and then outward. Finally, for radiation, we’ll use an IR camera to find hotspots on this metal plate—just like spotting thermal bridges in your own projects.\n“With those modes fresh in mind, let’s apply them to a 100 m² home. The roof (75 m²) at U‑value 0.8 and a 20 °C temperature difference gives 1,200 W. Walls (150 m²) at U = 1.2 yield 3,600 W. Windows (15 m²) at U = 5.0 add 1,500 W. Total heat gain is about 6.3 kW, meaning you need roughly a 2.4‑ton cooling system to maintain comfort.”\nKey Points:\nConduction moves heat through solids instantly.\nConvection carries heat via moving air currents.\nRadiation transfers heat through electromagnetic waves.\nReal‑world heat gain combines all three modes in roof, walls, and windows.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Baghdad’s hot season, you can see conduction when metal window frames burn your hand, and convection when exhaust fans spread hot air down your hall.”\nActivity Instructions:\nConduction demo: Heat rod end for 5 seconds; pass handle to a volunteer to feel warmth.\nConvection demo: Light incense; let participants observe smoke under sheet.\nRadiation demo: Show IR image; ask: “Where is the hottest spot?”\nMath example: Invite one participant to help calculate one of the three components on the whiteboard.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Ice slides off rod.\u000b – Solution: Secure ice with a small clip or tape.\nIssue: Smoke too light.\u000b – Solution: Use more incense or briefly fan to concentrate smoke.\nIssue: Math intimidates participants.\u000b – Solution: Walk through each multiplication step slowly and clearly.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent—now that we’ve seen heat transfer and calculated a home’s load, we’ll move into practical insulation strategies to slow these heat flows.”\n12\n\nHow Heat Moves: Conduction, Convection, Radiation\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMode\nConduction\nHeat through solids 🔥\nConvection\nHeat with moving air 🌬️\nRadiation\nHeat by waves ☀️\nU-value = heat transfer rate\nLower = better insulation\nConcrete roof: 0.8 W/m²·K\nConcrete wall: 1.2 W/m²·K\nSingle glass: 5.0 W/m²·K\nWith insulation: divide by 2.5\n10:35 – 10:45 How Heat Moves & U‑Values (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To reinforce the three heat‑transfer modes and introduce U‑values as a measure of insulation performance.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen showing the three icons and U‑value table\u000b • Participants remain seated from the previous activity\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with icons and U‑value table\u000b • Pointer or laser\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Check icons and U‑value numbers are large and legible\u000b • Ensure slide follows immediately after the demo slide\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Let’s recap the three ways heat travels: conduction through solids, convection with moving air, and radiation by waves. You can see each mode represented with an icon: a flame for conduction, wind for convection, and sun rays for radiation.\n“Next we introduce U‑values—the rate at which a material transfers heat. The lower the U‑value, the better the insulation. For example, a concrete roof has U = 0.8 W/m²·K, concrete walls U = 1.2, and single‑pane glass U = 5.0. If we add insulation, we divide these values by about 2.5, dramatically cutting heat flow. Understanding U‑values helps us choose the right materials to slow each heat‑transfer mode.”\nKey Points:\nThree modes: conduction, convection, radiation.\nU‑value measures heat transfer per area per temperature difference.\nLower U‑values mean better insulation; adding insulation divides U‑value by ~2.5.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul, switching from single‑pane windows (U = 5.0) to insulated panels (U ≈ 2.0) can cut wall heat gain by over 60 percent.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Which building element in your project has the highest U‑value?”\nInvite two volunteers to name an element (e.g., window or roof) and suggest an insulation idea that lowers its U‑value.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusion between lower U‑value and thicker walls.\u000b – Solution: Explain: “It’s about material properties, not just thickness.”\nIssue: Participants forget to divide by 2.5 after insulation.\u000b – Solution: Emphasize: “Think: new U = old U ÷ 2.5.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we know how to slow heat flow in materials, let’s cover some essential precautions before our hands‑on activities.

First, enter your generator size in amps—this tells us how many common appliances you can run simultaneously, like lights, fans, and a small AC. Next, the sheet automatically computes your monthly fuel cost based on typical generator efficiency and local fuel prices. Finally, by plugging in the post‑retrofit amp draw—say 10 amps instead of 20—you’ll see the monthly savings immediately. Let me show you with our sample data: with a 20 amp draw, the cost is 36 million IQD; drop to 10 amps, and you save 18 million IQD per month.”\nKey Points:\nGenerator size → appliance capacity: understand real load limits.\nAmp draw → monthly cost: fuel usage scales directly with amps.\nPost‑retrofit savings: halving amps nearly halves your fuel bill.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Basra, one home reduced its monthly generator spend from 30 million IQD to 15 million by adding reflective roof coating.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk for a volunteer team to call out their measured amp value.\nEnter that value on the slide calculator.\nShow the appliance capacity and cost outputs.\nThen enter the projected amp after retrofit (e.g., 12 amps) to display savings.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants confuse amps with kW.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Amps × voltage gives watts—our tool handles that conversion.”\nIssue: Calculator not updating live.\u000b – Solution: Use pre‑prepared screenshots or run the Excel live on your laptop.\nIssue: Fuel price varies by region.\u000b – Solution: Note: “You can adjust the fuel‑price cell to match your local cost.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “With this baseline and savings data, you’re ready to see the full Audit Sheet Template—the master form we’ll use for detailed reporting and follow‑up.”\n18\n\nAudit Sheet Template\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nLog one row per room\nRoom\nTime Period\nAC Status (On/Off) \nGenerator Amps Reading    \nIndoor Temp (°C)   \nOutdoor Temp (°C)   \nNotes (rooms abandoned?) \nMorning (6am-12pm)\nPeak (12pm-6pm)\nEvening (6pm-12am)\nNight (12am-6am)\n📊 SPREADSHEET MOMENT \u000bOpen the Diagnostic Checklist tab\n11:25 – 11:35 Audit Sheet Template & Diagnostic Checklist Mapping (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Make sure teams know exactly which existing columns in the Diagnostic Checklist match the fields shown on the slide, so they can record data without editing the worksheet.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide full‑screen with the four time periods table\u000b • One clipboard + printed Diagnostic Checklist per team\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Printed Diagnostic Checklist sheets\u000b • Pens or pencils\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm every team has one sheet and pen\u000b • Remind teams to use only the columns we specify\n### Facilitator Script\u000b “Here is the audit table you see on the slide: Morning, Peak, Evening, Night with AC‑status, amps, temps, and notes.

Next, let’s cover Logging Tips & Photo Examples so your entries are clear and consistent.”\n19\n\nLogging Tips & Photo Examples\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🌡️ Use thermometer at centre of room\n🪟 Test drafts at windows & doors with incense\n📱 Snap clear “before” photos\nFocus on peak hours (12-6pm) - this is when savings matter most\n11:35 – 11:45 Logging Tips & Photo Examples (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Give practical tips so teams capture reliable data and usable photos during their sprint, ensuring worksheet entries are clear and consistent.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide full‑screen with logging icons\u000b • Teams at their rooms with clipboards and tools\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Thermometer (IR or probe)\u000b • Incense stick\u000b • Phone or camera\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each team has a working thermometer and incense\u000b • Remind everyone to note their Photo ID on the worksheet\n\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Before you head out, here are four quick logging tips: First, place your thermometer in the centre of the room—this gives the true ‘before’ temperature, which you write under Room‑by‑room temperature log. Second, hold incense near windows or door gaps to spot drafts; if you see smoke flutter, mark a leak under Abandoned spaces measured. Third, snap clear ‘before’ photos showing your setup and any drafts—label each photo (e.g., LivingRoom_Before.jpg) and note the filename in the Photo ID column. Finally, focus your checks on peak hours (12–6 pm), since these readings drive our savings math later.”\nKey Points:\nCentre‑room readings avoid edge errors.\nSmoke tests reveal hidden leaks.\nWell‑labeled photos document conditions for later review.\nPeak‑period data matters most for cost savings.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In a Mosul home last week, a team missed a draft behind a curtain—but clear incense photos would have caught it.”\nActivity Instructions:\nEach team assigns roles: one measures temperature, one tests drafts, one takes photos.\nRecord the centre‑room temperature under Room‑by‑room temperature log.\nMark any draft under Abandoned spaces measured and note Photo ID.\nLabel each photo with room name and period (e.g., Kitchen_Peak_Before.jpg).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Thermometer too close to walls.\u000b – Solution: Move at least 1 m away from surfaces.\nIssue: Smoke disperses too quickly.\u000b – Solution: Hold incense 1–2 cm from the gap steadily.\nIssue: Blurry photos.\u000b – Solution: Tap the screen to focus before snapping.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “All set—now start your Home‑Audit Sprint. After 30 minutes, we’ll tag the biggest Δ°C on the wall and discuss your top findings.”\n20\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTag the Biggest Δ°C\n🏷️ Pick the room with the largest temp gap\nTag the Biggest Amp Draw - which room costs you the most?\n✍️ Write “Room: X, ΔT: Y °C” on one sticky note\n📌 Post it on the wall chart\nDay 1\n11:45 – 12:10 Tag the Biggest Δ°C (25 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Visualize and compare each team’s largest temperature gaps to identify priority areas for intervention.\nSetup:\u000b • Teams return and stand by the sticky‑note wall chart\u000b • Ensure wall chart has columns labeled for each team\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Brightly colored sticky notes (one pad per team)\u000b • Pens (enough for each team member)\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify wall chart is pre‑drawn with team labels\u000b • Confirm pens and stickies are within easy reach\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Welcome back, everyone! Now let’s find the single room in your audit that had the largest Δ°C—meaning the biggest difference between outdoor and indoor temperatures you recorded in your Diagnostic Checklist. Look at your Room‑by‑room temperature log and your IR temperature mapping values, subtract indoor from outdoor to get ΔT. On a sticky note, write ‘Room: X, ΔT: Y °C’ and stick it under your team’s column on the wall chart. This helps us see at a glance which spaces need fixes most.”\nKey Points:\nUse your logged indoor and outdoor temps to calculate ΔT for each room.\nPick the highest ΔT value only.\nClear handwriting and bright colors make comparisons easy.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In a Mosul school, the classroom under a tin roof had a 15 °C gap—its sticky immediately caught everyone’s eye.”\nActivity Instructions:\nReview your worksheet’s Indoor Temp and Outdoor Temp entries for each room and period.\nCalculate ΔT = Outdoor Temp − Indoor Temp.\nIdentify the single largest ΔT.\nWrite “Room: [name], ΔT: [value] °C” on one sticky.\nPlace it on the wall chart under your team’s label.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams calculate multiple gaps.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Choose only the single largest ΔT.”\nIssue: Sticky doesn’t stick.\u000b – Solution: Press firmly or fold edge for extra adhesion.\nIssue: Teams not at the wall.\u000b – Solution: Call them one column at a time by team number.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent work!

Start by naming the customer’s worst pain—frame it in terms of amps they lose. For example: ‘Losing 5 amps means you can’t run your whole house without borrowing your neighbor’s generator.’ Next, tie that amp loss to a monthly IQD cost: ‘That’s nearly 5 million IQD of fuel every month.’ Finally, end with a question to engage them: ‘So what would you pay to stop the heat?’ Think of this like a mini‑ad that grabs attention, shows value, and invites action.”\nKey Points:\nPain first: Lead with the amp‑loss scenario.\nCost next: Quantify in IQD per month.\nQuestion last: “So what would you pay?” invites dialogue.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“Your roof leak of 8 amps costs 8 × 5,000 IQD × 6 h × 30 d = 7.2 million IQD every month—so what would you pay to eliminate that?”\nActivity Instructions:\nIn your team, draft a one‑sentence script that follows the three prompts.\nPractice reading it naturally for up to 30 seconds.\nRecord your video on your device.\nPlayback together—if it exceeds 30 seconds or feels awkward, refine and re‑record.\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Hook exceeds 30 seconds.\u000b – Solution: Time your read‑through and remove any filler words.\nIssue: Script sounds too formal.\u000b – Solution: Speak as if talking to a friend—use simple, direct language.\nIssue: Background noise interferes.\u000b – Solution: Move to a quieter spot or pause recording during distractions.\nTransition:\u000b “Great hooks, everyone!

Walls account for only about 25 percent, and windows about 10 percent. That means if we want to cool a house for less money and effort, we start at the roof. By insulating or coating the roof, we can cut most of the heat before it even reaches the attic or rooms below.”\nKey Points:\nRoof is the top source of heat gain (60–70 %).\nInsulating or coating the roof yields the largest temperature drop.\nWalls and windows matter too but are secondary.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul’s July heat, we saw uncoated roofs reach 55 °C under the sun, while roofs with reflective coating stayed at about 45 °C—a full 10 °C cooler!”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk the group: “Why does the roof let in so much more heat than walls?”\nInvite one or two volunteers to answer (30 seconds each).\nReinforce that today’s hands‑on demos will start with roof solutions.\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants ask for exact numbers.\u000b – Solution: “These are industry averages; local results may vary slightly.”\nIssue: Diagram seems busy.\u000b – Solution: Point at each colored segment in turn and read the label.\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now that we see why roofs matter most, let’s look at our Solution Categories Map to plan the types of interventions we’ll use.”\n42\n\nSolution Categories Map\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nProblem\nLocation\nSolution Options\nCost Range\nHeat Gain\nRoof\nCoating/Insulation/Shade\n15-50k/m²\nHeat Gain\nWalls\nInsulation/Coating\n20-35k/m²\nAir Leaks\nGaps\nSealing/Weatherstrip\n5-15k/m\n09:55 – 10:00 Solution Categories Map (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Provide a quick reference to the main problem areas, their locations, solution types, and typical cost ranges so teams can choose the right fix.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen with the solution table\u000b • Participants seated and able to view clearly\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Ensure each column (Problem, Location, Solutions, Cost) is legible\u000b • Confirm cost units (IQD/m² or IQD/m) are clear\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here’s our Solution Categories Map. We’ve broken down the three main heat‑entry problems—roof, walls, and air leaks—into where they occur, which solutions work best, and what you can expect to pay. For roofs, you can choose coatings, insulation panels, or shade structures at roughly 15,000–50,000 IQD per square meter. For walls, coatings or insulation cost about 20,000–35,000 IQD per square meter. And for air leaks, sealing and weatherstripping run about 5,000–15,000 IQD per linear meter. Use this map to estimate and compare interventions quickly during your field work.”\nKey Points:\nRoof fixes yield the highest impact but can vary more in cost (15–50 k IQD/m²).\nWall treatments are next, with moderate cost and impact (20–35 k IQD/m²).\nAir‑leak sealing is cheapest and fastest (5–15 k IQD/m) but tackles only 10 % of heat gain.\nAlways match solution type to the problem location for best ROI.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, a simple shade cloth over a tin roof cost only 20 k IQD/m² and cut roof heat by 30 percent.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk each team to pick one problem area they audited (roof, wall, or leak).\nHave them note on their flipchart which solution option and cost range they’d recommend.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams confuse cost per m² vs per m.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Roof and walls are per square meter; leaks are per meter of gap.”\nIssue: Uncertainty about which solution fits their site.\u000b – Solution: Encourage: “Choose the lowest‑cost option that still meets durability needs.”\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now let’s dive into our first set of material tests with Three Common Coatings and see how they perform under real sun.”\n43\n\nThree Common Coatings\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nType\nCost (IQD/L)\nCLTD Reduction (°C)\nCoverage (m²/L)\nDurability (yrs)\nNotes\nAcrylic\n 15 000\n 3–4\n3.5\n 4–5\nCheap, prone to cracking\nSilicone\n 30 000\n 6–8\n3.0\n 7–8\nUV‑proof, needs primer\nElastomeric\n 25 000\n 5–7\n3.2\n 6–7\nFlexible, mid‑price\n(10:00 – 10:10) Three Common Coatings (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Introduce participants to the cost‑to‑performance trade‑offs of the three main roof coatings they’ll test.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide displayed full‑screen showing the enhanced table\u000b • Lay out three demo tiles (Acrylic, Silicone, Elastomeric) on a table and label them A/B/C\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with the enhanced table\u000b • Three labeled coating samples on tile pieces\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each demo tile matches its table row\u000b • Make sure cost and CLTD values are visible on the slide\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here are the three coatings you’ll test today. Notice Cost in IQD per liter and CLTD Reduction in °C—this tells you how much cooler your roof will get. Acrylic costs 15 000 IQD/L but only cuts 3–4 °C and lasts about 4–5 years. Silicone runs 30 000 IQD/L, reduces 6–8 °C, and endures 7–8 years with a primer. Elastomeric sits in the middle at 25 000 IQD/L, gives 5–7 °C reduction, and lasts 6–7 years. Keep these factors—price, cooling impact, and lifespan—in mind as you move into the scratch‑test demo.”\nKey Points:\nCost vs. Cooling: higher price generally buys more °C reduction.\nDurability Matters: longer life can offset higher upfront cost.\nCoverage: tells you how much area one liter covers (m²/L).\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul’s sun, contractors often skip acrylic because they know it only lasts one season—silicone’s extra cost pays off in fewer recoats.”\nActivity Instructions:\nTouch each tile to feel surface texture.\nNote the table’s Cost and CLTD values for that sample.\nPrepare to scratch each sample next and compare real durability.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams confuse CLTD reduction with CLTD factor.\u000b – Solution: Clarify: “CLTD reduction = how many degrees cooler the roof surface becomes.”\nIssue: Coverage rates mix up.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Coverage m²/L tells you how many square meters one liter paints.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that you know what you’re testing, let’s move to the Scratch‑Test Demo to see how each coating actually holds up under force.”\n44\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nScratch-Test Demo\nDay 2\n🔍 Step 1: Use a coin to gently scratch each coated tile\n📝 Step 2: Observe & note any chipping or flaking\nStep 3: Test perlite plaster too - notice the granular texture that traps air\n⭐ Step 4: Rate durability from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)\n10:10 – 10:30 Scratch‑Test Demo (20 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Let participants feel firsthand how each coating—and our perlite plaster alternative—resists abrasion, so they can compare durability ratings.\nSetup:\u000b • Demo table at front with four labeled samples: Acrylic, Silicone, Elastomeric, and Perlite Plaster\u000b • Coin or metal scraper and rating sheet/whiteboard ready\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Four tile samples labeled A (Acrylic), B (Silicone), C (Elastomeric), D (Perlite Plaster)\u000b • Coins or small metal scrapers (one per team)\u000b • Rating sheet or whiteboard with columns A–D and rows 1–5\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each sample label matches the slide\u000b • Verify scraper edges are clean and safe\u000b • Show teams where to record their star ratings\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we begin the scratch‑test: first, gently drag your coin across Sample A (Acrylic). Don’t press too hard—just enough to test surface adhesion. Look for any chipping or flaking, then record a durability rating from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) on our board under column A. Next, repeat the same steps on Sample B (Silicone) and Sample C (Elastomeric). Finally, we’ll test a perlite plaster sample (D); notice its granular texture trapping air and how it resists your scrape differently.”\nKey Points:\nGentle pressure tests real‑world wear, not brute force.\nChips and flakes indicate weak adhesion or low durability.\nGranular perlite traps air—compare how it breaks versus coatings.\nStar ratings make side‑by‑side comparison quick and clear.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, coatings rated below 3 chipped within days of rain—that’s why durability matters in dusty, wet seasons.”\nActivity Instructions:\nTeams come up one at a time to scratch Sample A, then B, C, and D.\nAfter each scratch, note any flaking and assign a rating 1–5 on the board under the matching column.\nRotate until every team has tested all four samples.\nCompare ratings to see which material performs best.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams press too hard, breaking the surface.\u000b – Solution: Demonstrate “light, steady drag”—use fingertip pressure only.\nIssue: Inconsistent star ratings.\u000b – Solution: Ask, “Did you see more than three flakes? If yes, rate below 3.”\nIssue: Perlite dust everywhere.\u000b – Solution: Scratch slowly and catch loose grains on a tray.\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent observations!

Notice the delamination and water damage underneath. Then compare it to a premium coating in the same conditions that stays bonded and intact. Show this to clients so they understand the hidden cost of a cheap job.”\nKey Points:\nUV exposure and thermal swings crack low‑grade silicone by year 5.\nDelamination allows water ingress, damaging the roof substrate.\nPremium coatings resist UV and stay bonded—avoiding repeat recoats.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, homeowners who chose the cheapest silicone had to recoating twice by year 6—costing more than a one‑time premium application.”\nActivity Instructions:\nPlay the 1 minute 30 second clip.\nAsk teams to note:\nOne cause of the cheap coating’s failure.\nOne benefit they see in the premium alternative.\nInvite two teams to share their observations aloud.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants miss slow degradation.\u000b – Solution: Pause at frames showing cracks and flaking and point them out.\nIssue: Audio is unclear.\u000b – Solution: Briefly summarize the narrator’s points in your own words.\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we see the long‑term risks, let’s head to our Mini‑Roof Tile Lab to test coatings ourselves.”\n46\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n47\n\nMini-Roof Tile Lab\nDay 2\n🧹 Station 1: Clean\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🖌️ Station 2: Coat\n🌡️ Station 3: Measure\n10 : 40 – 10 : 45 (5 min) Slide 1: Mini-Roof Tile Lab Overview\nPurpose\u000b Orient teams to the three lab stations so they know the flow before splitting up.\nSetup\nFloor cleared for three stations in a row.\nStation markers (1, 2, 3) visible on tables.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nSignage or tape labeling each station.\nBrief slide up so participants can scan stations visually.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm all three stations are stocked and labeled.\nCheck walkthrough path for teams is clear.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Welcome to the Mini-Roof Tile Lab.

Use the brush to sweep off loose particles, then wipe corners and edges with the cloth—your goal is a visibly clean, smooth tile.”\nKey Points\nDust removal prevents coating from trapping particles.\nEdge cleaning ensures full coverage next.\nVisual check—tile should look uniformly clean.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In dusty Mosul homes, uncleaned tiles can cause tiny cracks later—so take your time here.”\nActivity Instructions\nPick up the brush and gently sweep the tile surface.\nWipe down with the damp cloth, focusing on corners.\nInspect under good light—no dust should remain.\nRaise your hand when done; you’ll rotate to Station 2.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Cloth leaves lint →\u000b Solution: Switch to a lint-free cloth or dry brush again.\nIssue: Teams rush and miss spots →\u000b Solution: Remind them to inspect from different angles.\u000b\nTransition\n“Excellent—once your tile is clean, head to Station 2 to apply your coating. Let’s keep the pace.”\n49\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nStation 2: Apply Coating\nDay 2\nEven brush strokes\n11:05 – 11:30 (20 min) Station 2 – Apply Coating\nPurpose\u000b Show how consistent application affects coverage and performance.\nSetup\nStations labeled “2” with clean tiles from Station 1.\nEach station has its assigned coating type and a brush.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nPre-mixed coating cans (Acrylic, Silicone, Elastomeric)\nBrushes or rollers\nStir sticks\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nEnsure coating is well-stirred.\nVerify brushes are clean and dry.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“At Station 2, you’ll apply your assigned coating using even, overlapping strokes. Cover the entire tile surface without leaving drips or pools—this simulates a professional finish.”\nKey Points\nEven strokes ensure uniform thickness.\nFull coverage prevents weak spots.\nNo drips avoids uneven drying and wastage.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, uneven coating caused water ingress at thin spots—taking time here prevents future leaks.”\nActivity Instructions\nStir your coating for 30 seconds.\nDip brush, apply one stroke across tile.\nOverlap each stroke by 20 %.\nCheck edges for full coverage.\nRaise hand when finished to rotate to Station 3.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Too much paint on brush →\u000b Solution: Wipe excess on rim before stroking.\nIssue: Uneven thickness →\u000b Solution: Keep strokes parallel and consistent speed.\u000b\nTransition\n“Well done—your tile is now coated. Next, we’ll move to Station 3 to measure coverage and temperature drop.”\n50\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nStation 3: Measure & Record\nDay 2\nRecord ΔT (Before → After)\nLog coverage (m²) on your data sheet\n11: 30 – 11 : 50 (20 min) Station 3 – Measure & Record\nPurpose\u000b Capture the quantitative results—temperature drop and area covered—to compare performance across coatings.\nSetup\nStations labeled “3” with freshly coated tiles.\nEach station has an IR thermometer and the Labour & Coverage data sheet.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nIR thermometer (or IR gun)\nRuler or tape measure\nData logging sheets and pens\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm IR gun is calibrated (point at a known surface).\nCheck rulers are accurate and sheets are blank.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“At Station 3, measure the tile’s surface temperature before and after coating to get ΔT. Then use your ruler to measure the tile area covered and log both values in your data sheet.”\nKey Points\nΔT = Temp before coating minus temp after 5 min drying.\nCoverage (m²) = area of tile (e.g., 0.09 m² for 300 × 300 mm).\nAccurate logging ensures valid comparison across teams.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Teams in Mosul found a 6 °C drop under direct sun—that was a big selling point for premium coatings.”\nActivity Instructions\nMeasure and record the “Before” temperature on the data sheet.\nWait 5 minutes, then measure and record the “After” temperature.\nCalculate ΔT and write it down.\nMeasure the tile’s dimensions, compute m², and log coverage.\nConfirm entries legible before rotating or debriefing.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: IR readings jump →\u000b Solution: Hold gun steady 30 cm from surface for 3 seconds.\nIssue: Mis-measured area →\u000b Solution: Double-check scale (mm → m).\u000b\nTransition\n“Well done—now let’s collect all your results in the Data Logging slide.”\n51\n\nFill Labour & Coverage Sheet\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTeam\nStation\n⏱️ Labour (min)\n📐 Coverage (m²)\n🌡️ ΔT (°C)\nTeam 1\n1, 2, 3\n5 / 5 / 5\n0.09 / 0.09 / 0.09\n6 / 8 / 5\nTeam 2\n1, 2, 3\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n11 : 50 – 12 : 20 (20 min) Data Logging\nPurpose\u000b Guide teams to consolidate their station results into a single, comparable table for review and Sell-block preparation.\nSetup\nSlide projected with empty headers.\nData sheets or a shared spreadsheet available for each team.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nPrinted or digital Labour & Coverage sheet.\nPens or laptops.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm each team has a copy of the blank table.\nEnsure data from Station 3 (ΔT and coverage) is at hand.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Now we’ll compile your findings.

In the Solution Designer tab, yellow cells are the only places you type. Tick the Select box for Premium Coating (25 000 IQD/m²) and enter 100 % coverage for a 75 m² roof. Instantly, the green Roof Investment cell shows about 1.9 million IQD.\nNow look at the slide: before coating, this roof pulled 110 kWh/day; after coating it drops to 75 kWh/day—that’s a saving of 35 kWh/day, or roughly 3 amps on a generator. Three amps, at 5 000 IQD per amp‑hour, for 12 hours a day over 30 days, equals 5.4 million IQD monthly savings.\nBecause the sheet links to the Quote Generator tab, the Executive Summary box updates automatically, showing Investment 1.9 M IQD, Monthly Savings 5.4 M IQD, Pay‑back < 1 month. Grab a screenshot of that green box for your pitch.”\nKey Points\nYellow cells = input (Select, Coverage %) & white cells elsewhere if needed\nGreen cells = auto‑calculated (Investment, Savings, Pay‑back) – don’t type there\nQuote Generator’s Executive Summary populates automatically from Solution Designer\u000b\nLocal example\n“A Mosul contractor used this same sheet—clients loved seeing a < 1‑month payback and signed on the spot.”\nActivity Instructions\nIn ROOF SOLUTIONS, tick your chosen coating and enter coverage % for your project.\nConfirm the green Roof Investment value.\nNote the green Roof Impact %, then open Quote Generator to see updated Investment, Monthly Savings, and Pay‑back.\nWrite those three numbers on your flipchart for tomorrow’s pitch.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Green cells show “0.”\u000b – Solution: Check that you actually typed coverage % and ticked Select.\nIssue: Someone overwrites a formula.\u000b – Solution: Ctrl + Z, then remind: “Only yellow or white inputs, never green.”\nIssue: Unsure of roof area.\u000b – Solution: Use the default 75 m² example, then adjust when you have exact measurements.\nTransition\u000b “Numbers look great, but remember: the lowest upfront price can fail fast. Next, we’ll learn Why ‘Cheap Now = Pay Later’ so you can handle that objection with confidence.”\n57\n\nWhy “Cheap Now = Pay Later”\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🏷️ Low upfront cost → high rework expense\n🤝 Quality builds trust & repeat business\n📖 Ghassan’s story: Acrylic peeled in 2 weeks → paid 2× to recoat\n13:25 – 13:30 Why “Cheap Now = Pay Later” (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Explain why emphasizing long‑term value beats low upfront price, so trainees truly believe in the objection‑handling line.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide displayed full‑screen with the three bullet icons and Ghassan’s story\u000b • Participants seated\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck only\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the iconography and text are legible from the back of the room\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “We say ‘cheap now = pay later’ because a low upfront price often means repeat fixes and extra expense. As Ghassan’s story shows, choosing a budget acrylic at only 15 000 IQD/m² led to peeling in two weeks—then he paid twice to recoat with a better product. That doubled his cost and damaged his trust in the installer. By contrast, investing a bit more up front in quality coatings avoids that rework cost and builds your reputation.”\nKey Points:\nLow upfront cost can lead to high rework expenses.\nQuality products last longer and build trust and referrals.\nA one‑time premium saves money and protects your brand.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, clients who skimped on coating came back within months for a second job—paying 2× the original price.”\nActivity Instructions:\nThink about your ROI numbers—calculate the difference between a cheap coating and a premium option over one year.\nKeep Ghassan’s anecdote in mind when you role‑play objections in the next slide.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams doubt the magnitude of rework cost.\u000b – Solution: Highlight the “2×” repeat‑cost fact and tie it back to the customer’s budget.\nIssue: The phrase feels generic.\u000b – Solution: Encourage swapping in a local anecdote from Day 1 audits or your own experience.\nTransition:\u000b “Now that you know why this message works, let’s practice it in our 1‑minute role play.

Moisture is key: too little water and the plaster cracks; too much and it won’t set properly.”\nKey Points\nMoisture prevents shrinkage cracks.\nBinder (cement) gives strength.\nAggregate (sand) provides body and workability.\nWater activates the mix—use just enough.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, some teams skipped adding water and saw panels crack within days—that’s why we emphasize balanced moisture.”\nActivity Instructions\nNote the three components on your notepad.\nThink of instances when you’ve seen plaster crack or sag.\nWe’ll use this foundation in our next live demo.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants question exact ratios now →\u000b Solution: Reassure: “We’ll cover precise ratios in the next slide.”\nIssue: Overload of terminology →\u000b Solution: Stick to the three core ingredients only.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now that we understand the ‘why,’ let’s learn the ‘how.’ Here’s our mix ratio and live demo.”\n72\n\nMix Ratios & Live Demo\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nRatio Example:\n1 part cement ⚪ : 3 parts sand 🟨 : 0.5 parts water 💧\nMoisture Tip:\nKeep the mix damp. No dry pockets.\n▶️\nLive Demo\n09 : 45 – 10 : 00 (15 min) Mix Ratios & Live Demo\nPurpose\u000b Show how to mix plaster or render at the correct proportions and moisture level for optimal strength and workability.\nSetup\nDemo table front-left with buckets of cement, sand, and water.\nMixing tools (trowel, measuring cups).\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nCement, sand, measuring cups, water.\nMixing bucket and trowel.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm measuring cups are accurate.\nEnsure demo area is clear and tools are at hand.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s our standard mix: one part cement, three parts sand, half part water. Keep the mix damp—avoid dry patches that cause weak spots. I’ll now demonstrate mixing this exact ratio.”\nKey Points\nAccurate measuring ensures consistent strength.\nEven moisture prevents cracking and poor adhesion.\nProper mixing technique sets the foundation for durability.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, teams that followed this 1 : 3 : 0.5 ratio saw their panels hold for years, while those who eyeballed often had to redo after the first dry season.”\nActivity Instructions\nWatch me measure and pour each component.\nNotice how I check for dry pockets.\nAfter the demo, we’ll pass buckets so each team mixes their own batch.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Too much water →\u000b Solution: If the mix slumps, add small amounts of cement-sand dry mix until creamy.\nIssue: Uneven mix →\u000b Solution: Stir thoroughly from the bottom up for at least 60 seconds.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that we’ve mixed our demo batch, let’s see how this technique paid off in Omar’s famous 17 °C ‘temperature-bet’—on to the video!”\n73\n\nMaterials Selection Matrix\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nProblem Type: Roof, Wall, Leak\nBudget Range: Low (≤ 15k IQD/m²) → High (≥ 60k IQD/m²)\nRecommended Materials: e.g., Acrylic Coating, EPS Boards, Weatherstripping\nSuppliers List: Local vendors stocking each material with contact info\n10:00 – 10:10 Materials Selection Matrix (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Introduce an interactive decision tool that matches the right material solution to the customer’s problem type and budget.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the interactive matrix on screen (or simulate with click‑through slides)\u000b • Participants seated, ready to follow along\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Laptop with the interactive spreadsheet or web tool loaded\u000b • Clicker or mouse for demo\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify the dropdown options work (Roof, Wall, Leak)\u000b • Test the budget slider to ensure materials list updates\u000b • Confirm supplier data is visible and accurate\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we’ll use our Materials Selection Matrix—a tool to quickly match problems to the best solutions within a customer’s budget. First, choose a Problem Type from the dropdown: Roof, Wall, or Leak. Next, adjust the Budget Range slider to reflect what the customer can spend today—from low‑cost at 15 000 IQD per square meter up to premium at 60 000 IQD. The matrix then auto‑populates recommended materials—like Acrylic Coating for tight budgets or EPS Boards for mid‑range—and lists local suppliers who carry them. This ensures you always propose feasible, cost‑aligned solutions.”\nKey Points:\nDropdown & slider let you tailor solutions on the fly.\nAuto‑populate removes guesswork—tools pick the right material.\nSupplier list speeds up ordering and builds credibility.\nLocal example:\n“When working in Mosul’s Old City, I use this matrix to select Perlite Overlay when budgets allow, or acrylic coating when funds are tight—then call the nearest supplier in 30 seconds.”\nActivity Instructions:\nI’ll demo: select Roof, set budget to 25 000 IQD/m²—see the matrix recommend Premium Coating and list two local vendors.\nNow in pairs, choose Wall and a budget of 10 000 IQD/m²—note which materials and suppliers appear.\nShare one pair’s selection with the group.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Dropdown not responding.\u000b – Solution: Click the header cell to reset the field and try again.\nIssue: Suppliers list too long.\u000b – Solution: Use the filter box at the top to narrow by district.\nIssue: Budget slider feels coarse.\u000b – Solution: Enter numeric value directly in the adjacent cell.\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now that you can match problems, budgets, and materials instantly, let’s see those materials in action in our Temperature‑Bet Demo.”\n74\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTemperature-Bet Demo\n*▶️ Watch Omar’s 17 °C “bet” clip\nDay 3\n10 : 10 – 10 : 20 (10 min) Temperature-Bet Video\nPurpose\u000b Demonstrate real-world validation of proper mix ratios through Omar’s recorded 17 °C drop “bet.”\nSetup\nProjector & sound ready.\nVideo queued at the 0:00 mark.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nDownloaded/video file of Omar’s “temperature-bet” demonstration.\nSpeakers or external audio device.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nPlay a 5 s test to confirm audio/video sync.\nAdjust volume to room level.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s watch Omar’s famous 17 °C temperature-bet demo. He mixed plaster exactly as we did and challenged a client on a 10 °C drop—then delivered 17 °C. Notice how a precise mix transforms performance.”\nKey Points\nPreparation matters—Omar’s mix avoided cracks and delivered real ΔT.\nData-driven trust—clients believe what they can measure.\nHands-on validation—proof beats theory.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“That bet convinced a homeowner to pay extra upfront because they saw real numbers on their own thermometer.”\nActivity Instructions\nWatch the entire clip (approx. 1 min).\nNote one element that made Omar’s demo compelling (e.g., clear measurement method).\nBe ready to share your observation in one sentence.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Video stalls →\u000b Solution: Switch to the local file and restart.\nIssue: Participants miss the key moment →\u000b Solution: Pause at the peak ΔT reading to highlight the outcome.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great insights!

Each row shows the action, whether it’s a do or don’t, an icon cue, and the reason why it matters.”\nKey Points\nShade curing prevents cracks from rapid temperature swings.\nSubstrate prep creates a clean base for lasting adhesion.\nBalanced moisture avoids pinholes that weaken the surface.\nControlled drying stops shrinkage and crazing.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“A Mosul contractor tried mixing in direct sun and ended up with hairline cracks within two days—this table would have prevented that.”\nActivity Instructions\nScan the table and note the icon cues for each row.\nKeep this slide open at your station as you work.\nCheck off each “Do” and avoid each “Don’t” as you mix, apply, and cure.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Teams ignore the table →\u000b Solution: Prompt them to call out each row aloud before starting.\nIssue: Row reasons unclear →\u000b Solution: Reiterate the “Why” column in your own words.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that we have our durability guide, let’s jump into the Plaster & Panel Lab and put it to the test.”\n76\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n77\n\nLab Workflow: Apply → Cure → Log → Film\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🛠️ Apply your plaster/panel with even strokes\n⏳ Cure in shade for 24 h (prevent cracks)\n🌡️ Log “Before” & “After” ΔT on your sheet\n🎥 Film a 60-sec “Before vs After” reel\n10 : 30 – 10 : 35 (5 min) Lab Overview & Flow\nPurpose\u000b Orient teams to today’s Plaster & Panel Lab steps so everyone knows exactly what to do and in what order.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed full-screen at demo area entrance.\u000b – Stations clearly numbered 1–4 corresponding to each step.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Slide deck only.\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Confirm station signage matches the four steps.\u000b – Ensure each station has required tools ready.\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s our lab roadmap: First, Apply your plaster or foam panel. Next, Cure the sample in the shade for 24 hours to avoid cracks. Then, Log your temperature drop by measuring before and after. Finally, Film a 60-second reel showing the comparison.”\nKey Points\nFollow the sequence—don’t try to log or film before curing.\nEach step builds the data and media you need for your portfolio.\nStick to the timing so everyone gets their turn.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Last cohort’s team skipped proper curing and lost half their ΔT gains—follow the flow to avoid that.”\nActivity Instructions\nNote the station numbers on your rotation sheet.\nStart at Station 1 (Apply) and move clockwise every station.\nCheck off each icon as you finish the step.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Teams mix steps →\u000b Solution: Remind them: “Apply now—even if you’re eager, no logging or filming yet.”\nIssue: Overlook film step →\u000b Solution: Point to the camera icon and emphasize it’s required for Day-5 portfolio.\u000b\nTransition\n“Let’s head to Station 1 for Apply & Cure—your detailed instructions are on the next slide.”\n78\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nStation 1: Perfect Application & Curing\nDay 3\n🖌️ Apply Evenly: smooth strokes, full coverage\n🌤️ Cure in Shade: avoid sun/wind, 24 h\n🔍 Inspect: check for uniform color before moving on\n10 : 35 – 10 : 55 (20 min) Station 1: Perfect Application & Curing\nPurpose\u000b Ensure each sample is applied correctly and cured under optimal conditions to maximize durability and ΔT performance.\nSetup\u000b – Participants at Station 1 tables with their mixed plaster or panel material.\u000b – Area shaded or sheltered for curing.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Coated tile samples, brushes/trowels\u000b – Shade structure or covered rack\u000b – Timer or calendar marker\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Verify each team has a clean tile and tools.\u000b – Confirm shade rack is empty and ready.\nFacilitator Script\n“At this station, apply your plaster or panel material with smooth, overlapping strokes until the surface is uniform. Then place your sample in the shaded rack—no direct sun or wind—and set a 24-hour timer. Before you leave, inspect the color and texture for any thin spots.”\nKey Points\nSmooth strokes avoid lumps that weaken the surface.\nShade curing prevents rapid drying cracks.\nVisual check catches missed spots early.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul’s heat, sun-cured samples often crack within hours. Teams who used shade racks saw zero cracking by Day 4.”\nActivity Instructions\nApply your mix across the tile with your brush/trowel.\nSlide the tile onto the curing rack in shade.\nNote “Applied at 10 : 40” and “Ready at 10 : 40 tomorrow” on your sheet.\nInspect for uniform finish—no visible gaps or drips.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Uneven thickness →\u000b Solution: Re-brush problem areas immediately.\nIssue: Shade rack overloaded →\u000b Solution: Stagger team start times by 2 min.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—your sample is curing.

At 8 hours a day that’s about 106 000 IQD/month—more than pays for the weather‑strip in one week.”\nActivity Instructions:\nFind your measured ΔA from yesterday’s diagnostics.\nIn the Infiltration row, set U‑Value = 0 to simulate a perfect seal.\nNote the new green Heat Gain (W) and resulting monthly IQD saving at the sheet bottom.\nWrite that figure on your flip‑chart for the next pitch exercise.\u000b\n Common Issues & Solutions:\nConfusing watts vs kWh\u000b “Remember to divide Watt‑hours by 1 000 to get kWh.”\nRate mismatch\u000b Check the sheet header and update the yellow kWh rate cell if your fuel price differs.\nFormula overwritten\u000b Press Ctrl + Z and edit only white input cells—never touch green formula cells.\nTransition\u000b “Now you have the dinar cost of leaks. Let’s move on to Pinpoint Leaks and learn the diagnostic tricks to find those hidden amp‑eaters.”\n101\n\nPinpoint Leaks\nDay 4\nSeal Room: close doors/windows; attach blower fan\nPressurize: run fan at low speed to create airflow\nSmoke Test: release smoke pencil at seams and watch flow\nMark Leaks: note spots where smoke is drawn or blown\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n09 : 50 – 10 : 00 Pinpoint Leaks: Blower‑Door & Smoke Test (10 min)\nPurpose\u000b Teach teams to locate infiltration points precisely so they seal the biggest leaks first, maximizing amp savings (“each leak found = fraction of your generator saved”).\nSetup\u000b • Slide displayed full‑screen before demo\u000b • Blower‑door fan, frame adapter, and smoke pencils pre‑assembled at demo area\nMaterials needed\u000b • Portable blower‑door fan with hose and door‑frame seal\u000b • Smoke pencils or incense sticks\u000b • Chalk, tape, or stickers to mark leak points\nPre‑activity checks\nVerify blower‑door fan powers on and hose connection is airtight\nTest a smoke pencil to ensure the plume is visible\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “First, seal the room by closing all doors and windows, then fit the blower‑door fan into a doorway frame. Run the fan at low speed to pressurize—this forces air through tiny gaps. Next, hold a smoke pencil near seams and watch where the smoke is drawn in or blown out. Each leak you find and seal saves a fraction of your generator capacity, so mark every spot with chalk or tape for targeted sealing.”\nKey Points:\nFull seal around the frame ensures you measure real leaks.\nLow‑speed pressurization reveals even subtle gaps.\nSmoke direction shows infiltration (smoke pulled in) vs. exfiltration (blown out).\nEach leak sealed equals more amps saved on your generator.\u000b\nLocal example\n“In one Mosul home, sealing a tiny leak at the attic hatch recovered 3 amps—enough to run a fan all night.”\nActivity Instructions:\nTeam A sets up the blower‑door frame and fan.\nTeam B lights a smoke pencil and moves along seams, doors, and windows.\nMark each leak location and note approximate draft strength on your chart.\nRotate roles so everyone practices setup, testing, and marking.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nSmoke disperses too quickly\u000b – Solution: Move the pencil closer to the seam or reduce fan speed.\nFan seal leaks around frame\u000b – Solution: Adjust the gasket or use extra tape to close gaps.\nToo many small leaks\u000b – Solution: Prioritize the largest drafts first—they save the most amps.\nTransition\u000b “Great detection!

For gaps ≤ 3 mm, use acrylic caulk—it sets in 30 minutes and costs about 350 IQD per meter. For 3–8 mm, choose silicone sealant, which cures in 2 hours and handles movement at 650 IQD per meter. For moveable joints, like door frames, install a rubber gasket at 900 IQD per meter. And for larger cracks and seams over 1 mm, use expanding PU foam—it fills irregular spaces in 10 minutes for 1 200 IQD per meter. Pick the right product for each leak to ensure long‑lasting seals.”\nKey Points\nPU foam expands to fill large, irregular gaps quickly.\nAcrylic caulk is fast‑setting for very thin cracks.\nSilicone offers flexibility on medium‑sized joints.\nRubber gaskets maintain a seal on moving parts and doors.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nLook at the leaks you marked on your wall diagram and estimate each gap’s width.\nChoose the material from the matrix that matches that gap size.\nRetrieve one sample tube of that product from the materials table for demo.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nFoam overshoots the gap\u000b – Solution: Apply sparingly and trim excess after it cures.\nSilicone vs. acrylic confusion\u000b – Solution: Recall: acrylic sets fast but is rigid; silicone takes longer but remains flexible.\nGasket sizing unsure\u000b – Solution: Press the gasket into the joint—if it compresses snugly, it’s the right profile.\nTransition\u000b “Great—now that you have the correct sealants, let’s turn to airflow and learn about Heritage Stack Ventilation next.”\n105\n\nZero‑Power Cooling Wisdom\nDay 4\nHeritage Design\nBadgīr (Wind‑Catcher)\n80–120 CFM airflow\nZero electricity\nProven for centuries in Iraqi architecture\n\nCourtyard Stack‑Effect\nWarm air rises through central shaft\nDraws cool air in at ground level\nPassive, maintenance‑free operation\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nModern Application\nRetrofit into existing stairwells or roof shafts\nIntegrate new additions with wind‑tower chimneys\nCombine with solar‑powered exhaust fans for hybrid boost\n(10:20 – 10:25) Zero‑Power Cooling Wisdom (10 min)\nPurpose\u000b Highlight traditional passive ventilation strategies (“zero‑power”) and show how to adapt them in modern retrofits for sustainable cooling.\nSetup\u000b • Slide full‑screen with two columns: Heritage Design and Modern Application\u000b • Participants seated, slide visible\nMaterials needed\u000b • Slide deck only (no physical props required)\nPre‑activity checks\nConfirm airflow figures (80–120 CFM) and headings are legible\nEnsure column separation is clear\u000b\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Let’s tap into centuries of Iraqi ingenuity—Zero‑Power Cooling Wisdom. On the left, you see two heritage methods. Badgīrs, or wind‑catchers, channel breezes down a rooftop tower at 80 to 120 CFM without using any electricity. In the courtyard stack‑effect, a vertical shaft draws hot air up and out, pulling cooler air in at ground level. Both strategies require zero maintenance power and have kept homes comfortable for generations.\nOn the right, we translate these ideas to today’s retrofits: you can retrofit a stairwell shaft as a mini wind‑catcher, or incorporate a wind‑tower chimney into new additions. And for hybrid performance, pairing them with a small solar‑powered exhaust fan gives you the best of passive and active cooling.”\nKey Points\nHeritage systems deliver 80–120 CFM at zero energy cost.\nStack‑effect works purely on temperature‑driven convection.\nModern retrofits reuse existing shafts or add new chimneys for the same effect.\nHybrid approach—combine passive chimneys with solar fans for reliable airflow day and night.\u000b\nLocal example\n“At the Beit al‑Turath museum in Mosul, restored badgīrs still draw cool air into the galleries, reducing daytime temperatures by up to 5 °C.”\nActivity Instructions\nVisualize where on your mock building you could add a badgīr or convert a stairwell into a stack‑shaft.\nSketch this placement in your workbook with brief notes.\nThink about pairing it with a solar fan for peak afternoon airflow.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nUnfamiliar with the shape\u000b – Solution: Sketch a simple rectangular tower rising above the roof ridge.\nDoubting airflow rates\u000b – Solution: Compare 80–120 CFM to two standard box fans at full blast.\nTransition\u000b “Now that we’ve honored passive traditions, let’s contrast them with modern options in our next slide: Ventilation Options: Passive vs Active.”\n106\n\nVentilation Options: Passive vs Active\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nOption\nAirflow\nPower Draw\nMaintenance\nWind‐Turbine Vent\n100–150 CFM\n0 W\nAnnual inspect\nBadgir / Courtyard Stack Vent\n80–120 CFM\n0 W\nAnnual inspect\nSolar Exhaust Fan\n250–300 CFM\n25 W (day)\nMonthly filter check\n10 :25 – 10 :35 (10 min) Modern Passive & Active Comparison\nPurpose\u000b Help teams assess the pros and cons of heritage and modern ventilation options to make informed retrofit choices.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed full-screen.\u000b – Demo examples (turbine vent, badgir sketch, solar fan) within view if possible.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Slide deck only.\u000b – (Optional) Physical samples or images of each option.\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Verify the table’s text and icons are legible.\u000b – Ensure no other visuals clutter the display.\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s a side-by-side comparison of our three ventilation options:\nWind-Turbine Vent: moves 100–150 CFM, zero power, needs only an annual inspection.\nBadgir/Courtyard Stack Vent: delivers 80–120 CFM via natural convection, also zero power, annual check.\nSolar Exhaust Fan: pumps 250–300 CFM using 25 W when the sun shines, with a monthly filter check.”\u000b\nKey Points\nAirflow rates vary—solar fans lead in volume, heritage methods provide steady passive cooling.\nPower draw is zero for passive, minor for solar (daytime only).\nMaintenance frequency differs—annual for vents vs. monthly filter care.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In a Mosul café retrofit, a badgir cut indoor temps by 4 °C overnight—useful where turbines aren’t practical.”\nActivity Instructions\nReview the airflow and power specs for each option.\nDiscuss with your team which option best suits the mock roof scenario.\nNote your choice for Station 2 sizing.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Confusion over CFM →\u000b Solution: Relate 100 CFM to roughly two desktop fans at full speed.\nIssue: Uncertainty on maintenance →\u000b Solution: Emphasize simple annual or monthly checks—no complex servicing.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great!

First, measure your roof: length times width gives area in square metres. Second, calculate airflow: we use 5 CFM per square metre, so CFM = m² × 5. Third, match a vent: a passive turbine vent moves about 80 CFM, a solar vent about 120 CFM. Divide your target CFM by the unit CFM to know how many vents you need.\nNow jump to the Solution Designer tab. Under ROOF SOLUTIONS tick Select for the vent type you want. In the yellow Coverage % cell, enter the percentage of airflow you’re providing. For example, roof area = 75 m² → target 375 CFM.
