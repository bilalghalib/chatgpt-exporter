your\n0:01\ntoes a signal is sent from your\n0:03\nhamstring muscles to your spinal cord\n0:04\nand brain once you cannot go any further\n0:07\nit's because you've reached the limit of\n0:09\nwhat your brain can handle or more\n0:10\ntechnically the maximum tolerable\n0:12\nperception of stretch the sensory part\n0:15\nof your brain can't tolerate any more\n0:17\nstretching signal and so it makes you\n0:19\ntighten up and stops you from going any\n0:21\nfurther but there's a problem fing\n0:24\nforwards does not just stretch your\n0:25\nhamstring there are multiple other\n0:28\ncomponents that contribute towards your\n0:30\nstretch tolerance fixing these is often\n0:33\nthe key to an amazing and usable forward\n0:36\nfold when you fold forwards stretching\n0:38\nsignals are also sent to your brain by\n0:40\nmuscles like your adductive Magnus and\n0:43\ngastrus your hip and spine flexors have\n0:45\nto contract and be strong to pull you\n0:48\ninto position the static nerve gets\n0:50\ntensioned and more each of these\n0:52\ncomponents like Lego building blocks\n0:55\nstack up and take room in your available\n0:57\nperception of stretch the more room\n1:00\nthese take up the less space there is\n1:02\nfor tolerating the stretching of your\n1:04\nhamstrings there is a limit for how much\n1:06\nthe sensory part of your brain will let\n1:07\nyou handle once that limit is reached\n1:10\nyou won't go further together we need to\n1:13\nlook at each of these components to\n1:15\ntruly understand how it's possible that\n1:17\nI went from miles away from reaching my\n1:19\nhead to my toe to reaching my head to my\n1:21\ntoe I did this journey as an adult and\n1:24\nhave replicated it with many of my\n1:26\nstudents who can now touch their head to\n1:28\ntheir toes when we bend over to touch\n1:30\nour toes or pick something up the hips\n1:33\nshould tilt forwards when the hip is too\n1:35\ntight and can't tilt the spine Then\n1:38\ncompensates Who Would You Rather Be by\n1:41\n30 years old most people's flexibility\n1:44\nwill look like this then between the\n1:46\nages of 30 to 70 the average person will\n1:49\nlose another 20 to 30% of their\n1:52\nflexibility flexibility declines down\n1:54\nfrom birth so how did my dad do this at\n1:57\n58 years old he touched his toes for the\n1:59\nfirst time in over three decades or our\n2:02\nstudent Rob who at 66 years of age and\n2:05\nfor the very first time in his life\n2:06\nreached his nose to his toe with a\n2:08\nstraight leg at shoulder height to\n2:10\nanswer this question we first need to\n2:12\nunderstand what has to happen in order\n2:14\nto show a high level of forward folding\n2:16\nability a common mistake is to think\n2:18\nabout bringing the head down towards the\n2:20\nknees which makes us round our spine to\n2:22\nfold forward once we reach our head down\n2:25\nwe're effectively stuck the correct\n2:27\ntechnique is primarily to travel\n2:29\nforwards in reality this will be more of\n2:32\na diagonal but the intention is to reach\n2:34\nforwards towards our feet and not just\n2:37\ndown regardless of your orientation the\n2:40\nintention should be to travel towards\n2:42\nyour feet this small change shifts the\n2:44\nfocus from just the spine rounding over\n2:47\nand instead emphasizes that forward\n2:50\ntilting of the hips it's the movement of\n2:52\nthe hip that makes something like head\n2:54\nto toe anatomically possible as The Hip\n2:57\nFlex is enough it brings the base of the\n2:59\nspine spine over and forwards which\n3:01\nallows the spine to then straighten out\n3:04\ncombine this with dorsy flexing the\n3:06\nankle by pulling it towards us and\n3:08\ntogether they allow a position like head\n3:10\nto toe to become much more realistic\n3:12\nthan most people would realize for\n3:14\ncontext five of my team members from our\n3:17\ncoaches to video editors have learned to\n3:19\nhead to toe and many more of my students\n3:23\nall using the approach I'm going to show\n3:24\nyou statistically that would be very\n3:27\nunlikely if it was completely down to\n3:28\nbody proportions\n3:30\nas you can see it is totally possible\n3:32\nfor the vast majority of people\n3:35\nunderstanding the extremes like head to\n3:37\ntoe means understanding each component\n3:39\nproperly even as a beginner\n3:42\nunderstanding the full Journey allows\n3:43\nyou to make more effective training\n3:45\ndecisions which muscles need stretching\n3:48\nwhat exercises to use and how often to\n3:50\ntrain are questions that can be answered\n3:53\nwith much more certainty when they're\n3:55\nfrom A system that takes into account\n3:57\nthe whole journey from beginner to\n3:59\nadvance\n4:00\nmy obsession with flexibility came from\n4:02\nthe fact that I was not naturally\n4:04\nflexible at all so my inner nerd decided\n4:07\nto embark on a mission to figure it out\n4:10\nlong story short I learned how to become\n4:12\nflexible once my athletes have won\n4:14\nOlympic gold medals becoming the fastest\n4:16\nin the world 503 final this is for\n4:20\nOlympic gold they're the fastest men in\n4:22\nthe pool it is Meo our journey to touch\n4:26\nour toes begins with this component the\n4:28\nstrength of mans if you lack the\n4:30\nstrength to go with your flexibility it\n4:32\ncan stop you from progressing further\n4:35\nthe problem is that if you're not strong\n4:36\nenough to pull yourself into an\n4:38\nend-range position your body has to try\n4:40\nharder and therefore exert more effort\n4:43\nthis signal from the central motor\n4:45\ncommand in your brain to make you\n4:47\nstronger creates a bigger Block in your\n4:49\nperception of stretch which leaves less\n4:52\nspace for tolerating the other\n4:53\ncomponents like stretching your muscles\n4:56\ntake a look at these two forward fold or\n4:58\npipe positions the surprisingly similar\n5:01\nfirst we have a standing fold and then\n5:03\nif we flip at 180° it becomes a hanging\n5:06\nleg rate immediately you might notice\n5:08\nthat the one on the left looks more like\n5:10\na stretch whilst the one on the right\n5:11\nlooks more like strength training yet\n5:13\nthey're the same shape left shows\n5:15\npassive flexibility we're being pulled\n5:17\nby something external in this case\n5:19\ngravity into position whilst right shows\n5:21\nactive flexibility we're having to use\n5:23\nour strength to pull ourselves into\n5:25\nposition in this case against gravity a\n5:28\nmore passive exercise will feel like\n5:29\nstretch for the muscles on the back of\n5:31\nour legs whilst the more active exercise\n5:33\nwill feel like strength training and\n5:35\nContracting the muscles in the front of\n5:36\nour leg now imagine how it would feel if\n5:39\nwe added the same weight to each of\n5:41\nthese positions the weight on the left\n5:43\nwould assist us and make it easier to\n5:45\nget deeper into the stretch whilst the\n5:47\nweight on the right would resist us and\n5:49\nmake it harder to achieve the same range\n5:51\nsince we can increase or decrease the\n5:53\nweight we use we have different levels\n5:55\nof assisted to resisted it was this\n5:58\nrealization that completely transformed\n6:00\nthe way I looked at flexibility and\n6:01\nstrength training you see most people\n6:04\nthink of passive and active flexibility\n6:06\nas opposites like two sides of a coin\n6:09\nwhen in reality they're two ends of the\n6:11\nsame Spectrum a spectrum between passive\n6:14\nand active\n6:15\nflexibility after many versions and a\n6:18\nridiculous amount of testing and\n6:19\nexperimentation here's version 11 of my\n6:22\nassisted to resisted Spectrum which used\n6:25\nto be known as the passive to active\n6:27\nSpectrum it's a powerful tool for\n6:29\nknowing which exercises you need to\n6:31\nfocus on first is heavily assisted using\n6:35\ngravity and added weights a partner or\n6:38\neven a cable machine to really help us\n6:40\nget deeper if we take the weight away\n6:42\nwe're still assisted just not as much as\n6:45\nbefore because it's only gravity helping\n6:47\nnow if we change our angle so that\n6:49\ngravity no longer helps pull us towards\n6:51\nour feet as much here we are neutral or\n6:54\nwe transition folding forwards with the\n6:56\nlegs elevated or while seated means that\n6:59\nGra gravity pulls us down but not\n7:01\nforwards we're now between assisted and\n7:04\nresisted as gravity is no longer helping\n7:07\nus as much in the direction we want\n7:09\nremember we want to reach towards our\n7:11\nfeet now if we try to lift the leg\n7:14\ninstead the movement will be resisted we\n7:17\nhave to fight against gravity add weight\n7:20\nto this and it's now heavily resisted\n7:22\nyou're now strength training through\n7:23\nyour existing range of motion these five\n7:26\nzones form the main stages of the\n7:28\npassive to active Spectrum technically I\n7:31\ninclude more zones in the full model but\n7:33\nthese are for the rare cases when people\n7:35\nare using more Advanced Techniques or\n7:37\nsimply using too much weight so we can\n7:39\nignore those for now as you move from\n7:42\nleft to right across the Spectrum you go\n7:44\nfrom being pulled by something else into\n7:46\nthe stretch to using your own strength\n7:49\nto pull yourself into the stretch so\n7:52\nflexibility and strength training are\n7:54\nnot opposites but two ends of the same\n7:56\nSpectrum let's run through it the first\n7:59\nstep of spectrum is heavily assisted as\n8:01\nboth the weight and gravity are helping\n8:03\npull us deeper into position if we\n8:06\nremove the weight we're still assisted\n8:08\nbut now just by gravity from here we can\n8:11\nchange the body position slightly so the\n8:13\nwearing more of a gravity neutral type\n8:15\nof position as we transition from\n8:17\nassisted to resisted as we fight against\n8:20\ngravity add weight to this and we're now\n8:23\nheavily resisted and have to be really\n8:25\nactive in our range every exercise can\n8:28\nbe placed this Spectrum which means we\n8:31\nnow have many many ways of targeting our\n8:33\ntraining assisted training allows you to\n8:36\nstretch deeper whilst resisted training\n8:39\nmakes that range stronger and more\n8:41\nusable whilst the middle develops a\n8:43\nlittle bit of both improving your\n8:45\nflexibility is a game of knowing when to\n8:48\npush the ceiling of your total\n8:49\nflexibility by training more assisted\n8:52\nversus when you need to focus on getting\n8:54\nstronger into your existing range of\n8:56\nmotion and training more resistive\n8:58\nhere's the magic\n9:00\nby testing where you are on this\n9:01\nspectrum how large of a gap there is\n9:03\nbetween your total passive range and\n9:06\nyour active strength to use it you can\n9:08\nnow determine which exercises you will\n9:10\nlikely respond best to if you need to\n9:13\nwork on increasing your passive total\n9:15\nrange motion use more assisted exercises\n9:18\nthat will focus on stretching your\n9:20\nmuscles like your hamstrings ductor\n9:22\nMagnus and gastronomias or if you need\n9:25\nto improve your strength through your\n9:26\nexisting range of motion use more resist\n9:29\nexercises that focus on strengthening\n9:31\nthe hip and spine flexes along the front\n9:34\nof your body muscles like your rectus\n9:36\nforus and ilio soat the assisted to\n9:39\nresisted Spectrum allows you to\n9:41\nindividualize your training for the best\n9:43\nresults we use it in almost all the\n9:46\nflexibility skills we're looking to\n9:47\nimprove for example when our students\n9:50\njoin the mobility and flexibility tool\n9:52\nkit it begins with an assessment one of\n9:54\nthe key tests in the Pike and head-to\n9:56\ntoe module is comparing your ability\n9:58\nassist Ed versus resisted the difference\n10:01\nin angle between these positions allows\n10:03\nus to see where you are on the assisted\n10:06\nto resisted spectrum and therefore which\n10:08\nexercises are likely to be best for you\n10:10\nright now a larger difference means you\n10:13\nshould focus on the resisted end of the\n10:15\nspectrum and work on strength whilst a\n10:18\nsmaller Gap suggests focusing on more\n10:20\npassive approaches this is why people\n10:23\nprogress with assisted passive\n10:25\nstretching whilst others progress with\n10:28\nresisted active stret training holding\n10:30\npive stretches might work for some time\n10:32\nbut then why does progress suddenly stop\n10:35\noften it's because the gap between your\n10:37\npassive total range and your active\n10:39\nstrength to use it has become too big\n10:41\nand it's time to switch to more\n10:42\nstrengthening active exercises once this\n10:45\nGap closes it's then time to switch to\n10:48\npushing the range with more passive\n10:50\nassisted exercises mobility and\n10:52\nflexibility training is a game of\n10:54\nknowing when to push the ceiling and\n10:56\nwhen to strengthen into that range this\n10:59\nis a mental model that I like to use and\n11:01\nalso explains why most people's bodies\n11:03\ndo not want to be flexible without the\n11:06\nsafety of being strong enough to control\n11:08\nit when this doesn't happen as can be\n11:10\nseen in hypermobile people injuries\n11:13\nbecome more common those with\n11:14\nhypermobility who keep pushing their\n11:16\nrange create problems like joint\n11:18\ninstability they need to deliberately\n11:20\nfocus on active strengthening more so\n11:23\nthe Gap does not become too big a lack\n11:26\nof strength can mean a plateau in\n11:28\nprogress in contrast you might be\n11:30\nsomeone who is stronger and Tighter\n11:33\nwhere it's easy to gain the strength so\n11:35\nmore time should be focused on\n11:36\nincreasing your passive range as your\n11:39\nstrength will typically come with it\n11:41\nthis individualization means faster and\n11:44\nmore consistent progress or whilst\n11:46\ntraining less because you focus on what\n11:49\nis needed and don't waste time on things\n11:51\nyour body does not currently require\n11:54\nmore efficient training means you can\n11:56\nachieve more in less time such as\n11:59\nbecoming both very strong and very\n12:01\nflexible I can Nord it curl which\n12:03\nrequires very strong hamstrings and also\n12:06\nhead to toe which requires very flexible\n12:09\nhamstrings it is possible to have both\n12:12\nat the same time and I was not naturally\n12:15\ngifted either I was weak and tight when\n12:18\nI started as an adult there is a long\n12:21\nway for my head to reach my toe\n12:23\ndeveloping my flexibility and strength\n12:25\nhere allowed me to access other skills\n12:27\nmuch more easily such as achieving an I\n12:30\nsit without any direct training for it\n12:33\nhaving a good forward fold means I can\n12:35\nstay compact in acrobatics compress\n12:37\nimpress handstands and have literally\n12:39\nzero issues moving in day-to-day life to\n12:43\ndevelop a good forward fold we need to\n12:45\nknow if our current training is working\n12:48\nwhich is why being able to accurately\n12:49\nmeasure progress is crucial to effective\n12:52\ntraining to measure progress in this\n12:54\npipe position we use a really easy\n12:56\nmethod with touch points fold forwards\n12:58\nwhile sliding your hands down your legs\n13:00\nand keeping your knees straight make a\n13:03\nnote of any Landmark that you can reach\n13:04\nto for example just below the knee\n13:07\nsegments of the shin top of the foot and\n13:09\nso forth once you can reach the floor of\n13:12\nyour fingers it's finger Knuckles\n13:14\nKnuckles then Palms to floor if you have\n13:16\naccess to standardized weight plates or\n13:18\nyoga blocks they can work well to\n13:20\ncontinue measuring your ability with\n13:22\nboth legs together alternatively once\n13:25\nyou've got Palms flat to floor you can\n13:27\nmeasure elbow to toe\n13:29\nPlace one leg out in front with the foot\n13:31\npropped up the back leg is then bent out\n13:33\nof the way measure elbow to Shaka which\n13:35\nis your thumb and Little Finger extended\n13:38\nif a you'll know then thumbs up bent\n13:41\nthumbs up fist four fingers 3 2 one and\n13:46\nelbow to toe then repeat these touch\n13:48\npoints for head to toe and if you're as\n13:50\ndetermined as our student rob you can\n13:52\nachieve your first leg elevated nose to\n13:54\ntoe at 66 these touch points means you\n13:57\ncan now track your program down to the\n13:59\nwidth of a single finger a quick\n14:02\n5-second check means you now know if\n14:04\nYou' progressed compared to last session\n14:06\nwhich means you can quantify if your\n14:08\ntraining is working or if you need to\n14:10\nmake some changes to your program you're\n14:12\nno longer guessing plus you can now make\n14:15\nsmarter choices in your training because\n14:17\nyou can now work out what is working and\n14:20\nwhat is not so far we know the technique\n14:23\nof reaching forwards towards our toes\n14:26\nwhether we need to focus on more passive\n14:28\nstretching exercise or more active\n14:30\nstrengthening exercises and can\n14:32\nprecisely measure our progress to be\n14:34\nconfident it's working the next step in\n14:36\norder to pick the best exercises is to\n14:39\nunderstand their Anatomy unfortunately\n14:41\nmost people think falling forwards just\n14:43\nstretches the hamstrings in reality\n14:46\nthere's a whole lot more to start there\n14:48\nare four parts that make up your\n14:50\nhamstrings then there's your lower back\n14:52\nyour hip rotators glutes adductive\n14:55\nMagnus gastro anemia in the calves and\n14:57\nmore they get stretched and the forward\n14:59\nF remember a tight muscle can limit your\n15:02\nability to touch your toes even if it's\n15:04\nnot maximally stretched in the position\n15:06\nit can still contribute to the maximum\n15:08\ntolerable perception of stretch we\n15:10\ntalked about earlier the sensory part of\n15:12\nyour brain can only tolerate so much\n15:14\nperception of stretch before it starts\n15:17\nto limit you it's therefore important to\n15:19\nisolate out the problematic areas work\n15:21\non them and then integrate them back\n15:23\ninto our forward fold position we should\n15:26\nbe deliberate with which exercises we\n15:28\nchoose in in order to get the best\n15:29\nresults when done right we can improve\n15:32\neach component's relative contribution\n15:34\nmake changes to the muscles themselves\n15:36\nand ultimately if you train properly\n15:39\neven increase our maximum tolerable\n15:41\nperception of stretch with the forward\n15:44\nfold a common problem is that often\n15:46\npeople only stretch their hamstrings in\n15:48\none way let's break this down it might\n15:50\nsound complex at first but we can make\n15:53\nit simple three of the hamstring muscles\n15:55\nare biarticulate meaning they cross two\n15:57\njoints there also the short head of the\n16:00\nbiceps for morus which only crosses the\n16:02\nknee and I'll include the posterior\n16:04\ndivision of adductor Magnus here as it\n16:06\nfunctions much like a hamstring but only\n16:08\ncrosses at the hip this means that\n16:10\nfocusing the stretch by primarily moving\n16:13\nfrom either the knee or the hip will not\n16:16\nonly target different ends of the\n16:17\nhamstrings but even stretch completely\n16:20\ndifferent muscles now if you were to\n16:22\nstretch of your legs away or across your\n16:24\nbody you'll emphasize as a stretch on\n16:27\nthe medial inside muscles like the\n16:29\nsemimembranosus in a pancake or the\n16:31\nlateral outside muscles this goes even\n16:34\nfurther when the leg is across and the\n16:36\nknee is also bent as it would Target the\n16:38\nstretch on the three glutes Min me and\n16:40\nMax alongside four of the six deep hip\n16:43\nrotators Pur forus obturator internis\n16:47\nand the two GIS quadratus forus is\n16:50\nsimilar but stretches with internal\n16:52\nrotation whilst in this position instead\n16:54\ninter rotation is particularly\n16:56\ninteresting here as it has a kinematic\n16:58\ncoupling with the forward fold Bagwell\n17:01\ntow found that on average for every 5°\n17:03\nof anterior pelvic tilt there is around\n17:05\n1 and A2 de of internal FEMA rotation\n17:08\nlacking internal rotation can therefore\n17:11\nlimit your forward fold then the more\n17:13\nthe ankle is stretched the more involve\n17:15\nmuscles like the gastrus and a rounded\n17:18\nback brings in muscles further up the\n17:20\nposterior chain so we can stretch by\n17:23\nmoving from the hip or knee to Target\n17:25\nthe top or bottom of the hamstring group\n17:28\nhave the leg go across or away from our\n17:30\nbody to Target the inside or outside\n17:32\nmuscles change the rotation of the leg\n17:34\nto stretch more of the glutes and most\n17:36\nof the hip rotators and add involvement\n17:38\nat the ankles and spine for more of the\n17:40\ncalf and lower back regions it's\n17:43\nimportant to take advantage of this\n17:45\nPrecision I see a lot of people\n17:47\nfollowing generic routines that never\n17:49\nreally address the weak link that's\n17:51\nholding them back I hope you can see\n17:53\nthat just stretching in a forward fold\n17:56\nis not the only way to improve a forward\n17:59\nfold isolate the problematic area then\n18:02\nintegrate it back into the skill you\n18:04\nwant to achieve as you advance the\n18:07\nstretch of the muscles around the spine\n18:08\nand lower back will become less and less\n18:11\nrelevant so much so head to toe actually\n18:13\nuses a straight back position where they\n18:16\naren't really stretched at all and by\n18:18\nthe way in 98% of cases if you've ever\n18:21\nbeen told you have short hamstrings it's\n18:23\nprobably the biggest load of rubbish in\n18:26\nreality a more likely silent killer of\n18:28\npeople ability to touch the toes is one\n18:30\nof the least expected try this while\n18:34\nseated dorsy Flex to pull your feet\n18:36\ntowards you now while keeping this foot\n18:38\nposition reach\n18:39\nforward once you find your limit point\n18:42\nyour toes and see how much further you\n18:44\ncan go by changing our position of the\n18:47\nankle we've affected our range at the\n18:49\nhip but there's no muscle that crosses\n18:51\nfrom our ankle to our hip so how is this\n18:54\npossible you see a tight cuff\n18:59\ncan limit your hip\n19:01\nmobility despite not crossing your hip\n19:04\nyou'll be amazed at how many people can\n19:06\ndramatically improve their ability to\n19:08\nforward fold through calve stretching\n19:11\nand there's three main reasons for why\n19:12\nthis can happen first the carves added\n19:15\nan additional block of stimulus to the\n19:17\nsensory part of the brain which then\n19:19\nreached its maximum perception of\n19:21\nstretch\n19:22\nsooner second is the myofascial\n19:24\nconnection along the back of the leg and\n19:27\nthird is tension compression and\n19:29\nentament of the sciatic nerve the\n19:32\nsciatic nerve runs from your toes all\n19:34\nthe way up the back of your leg\n19:36\nalongside or even through the performers\n19:38\nin some people up your spinal cord to\n19:40\nyour head when we fold forwards we\n19:43\ntension this nerve but nerves have a\n19:45\nlimited ability to stretch for the\n19:47\nsciatic nerve it's only about 8 to 10%\n19:50\nmore than its resting length so instead\n19:53\nthey slide up and down their sheath\n19:55\nwhile we move if an area gets compressed\n19:58\nthe nerve can get stuck and unable to\n20:01\nglide through this is known as a nerve\n20:03\nentrapment which can cause excruciating\n20:06\npain in some people create an electric\n20:08\ntype feeling in others or simply stop\n20:10\nyou from being able to move any further\n20:12\nwithout any pain at all meaning a nerve\n20:15\nentrapment can stop your flexibility\n20:17\nprogress without you even knowing it\n20:20\ncould cause a large Block in your\n20:21\nbrain's perception of stretch without\n20:24\nyou even realizing this is why I\n20:26\ndeveloped a 10 level sciatic nerve test\n20:29\nto help you identify a nerve issue once\n20:31\nyou feel an electric nervy sensation\n20:34\nstop and make a note of your level each\n20:36\nlevel is going to build on the previous\n20:38\nlevel one is I'm going to place my foot\n20:40\nup on an object between knee and hip\n20:42\nheight next level two I straighten the\n20:45\nknee three I pull the foot and the toes\n20:48\ntowards me four I'm going to bring my\n20:50\nleg and my hip across each other five I\n20:55\ninternally rotate the leg six I fold the\n20:58\nhip hips forward seven lower back\n21:00\nforward eight upper back nine I tuck the\n21:04\nchin and 10 I grab the foot and pull\n21:07\neverything together something to keep in\n21:10\nmind because of the nature of nerves\n21:12\nwhen it is painful it could be referred\n21:14\npain meaning you feel it in one area\n21:16\nlike your lower back but the problem is\n21:18\nactually coming from somewhere\n21:20\ncompletely different compression from\n21:22\nareas like the cars and piriformis are\n21:24\nsurprisingly common causes of sciatic\n21:27\nnerve ATT tratments even among people\n21:29\nwho do not have any pain there are other\n21:32\ncauses of sciatica like slip discs or\n21:34\neven viral infections so obviously get\n21:37\nit checked with your healthcare provider\n21:39\nwith that in mind it's worth noting that\n21:42\nan encouraging amount of cases can be\n21:44\ntreated even on your own proper\n21:47\nstretching of these areas deliberate use\n21:49\nof nerve Glides and tensioners and soft\n21:51\ntissue treatments are all effective ways\n21:53\nof improving your nerve's ability to\n21:55\nslide through its sheath how it should\n21:57\nwhich can open up your\n21:59\nflexibility furthermore the hip joint is\n22:01\nwrapped by your joint capture sometimes\n22:04\npeople think they've reached a bone\n22:05\nblock and the limit of their hip\n22:07\nmobility I've seen people only ever be\n22:09\nable to bring one leg in fully to their\n22:11\nchest they assumed it was a bone limit\n22:14\nbut upon closer inspection we found it\n22:16\nwas actually an issue with the hip\n22:18\ncapsule by working the capsule space was\n22:21\nfreed up restoring four range of the hip\n22:24\nsimilarly the hamstrings don't just\n22:26\nattach to a hipbone they fuse into the\n22:28\nsacr tuberous ligament along the back of\n22:30\nyour hip these connective tissue\n22:32\nstructures are different to stretching\n22:34\nmuscle and are often the cause when\n22:36\npeople say they've reached their\n22:37\nanatomical bone limit which is rarely\n22:40\nthe case if you think or have ever been\n22:42\ntold you've reached your anatomical\n22:44\nlimit you can't go any further despite\n22:47\nnot really feeling a stretch it's worth\n22:49\ntaking a look at these structures more\n22:52\noften than not I found that people can\n22:54\nin fact go further these muscles soft\n22:57\ntissue structures like our fascia\n22:59\nligaments and hip capsule and the nerves\n23:01\nalong the back of our body are what has\n23:03\nto lengthen when we fought forwards to\n23:06\ncontinue to build our knowledge we need\n23:07\nto look at the muscles on the other side\n23:10\nthe ones which contract and pull us into\n23:11\nposition the quads straighten out the\n23:13\nknee whilst our hip flexors such as\n23:15\nrectus foror of the quads ilos SARS and\n23:18\neven muscles like a ductor longus work\n23:21\ntogether to flex our hip forward when\n23:23\nthey contract your hip will fold\n23:24\nforwards if your leg is fixed or your\n23:27\nleg will lift when your body remains in\n23:29\nplace these actions are paired with the\n23:31\nspine flexors such as your abs like your\n23:33\nobliques and rectus abdominus muscles to\n23:36\ncompress and pull us into position\n23:39\ntogether they take our range of motion\n23:41\nand help make it usable in a wide range\n23:44\nof sports in context anytime we need to\n23:47\nfold with power they're the ones making\n23:49\nit happen being able to pull the hips\n23:51\nforward is a combination of everything\n23:53\nwe've talked about it's one of the most\n23:55\nfundamental and basic movements in\n23:57\ngeneral so much so this type of training\n24:00\nis actually one of the best ways of\n24:02\nstarting your full body mobility and\n24:04\nflexibility Journey the simple test of\n24:07\ncan you touch your palms to the floor is\n24:09\nactually a great starting place for\n24:12\nopening up more advanced flexibility\n24:14\nskills and is basically a prerequisite\n24:17\nto all splits you want a pancake well\n24:20\nit's the same forward hip flexion\n24:21\nmovement but now done with the legs\n24:23\napart you want to sides split or the hip\n24:25\njams unless you forward flex the hips\n24:28\nenough\n24:29\nwhat about front split well the front\n24:31\nleg is literally in a forward fold\n24:33\nposition so forward fold training is\n24:35\nessentially working half of a front\n24:37\nsplit when Liv achieved the first front\n24:39\nsplit it happened sooner than most\n24:41\npeople cuz she'd already developed great\n24:43\nflexibility in the front leg with her\n24:45\nPike training this meant her back leg\n24:47\nhad to stretch relatively less for her\n24:49\nto touch down and she could focus her\n24:51\nfront split training on just the back\n24:53\nleg to quickly achieve her front split\n24:55\nimproving your ability to touch your\n24:57\ntoes open opens up a whole world of hit\n24:59\nMobility gains it's the foundation the\n25:03\nprocess we use in the mobility and\n25:04\nflexibility toolkit is by first testing\n25:07\nthe difference between your passive and\n25:09\nactive flexibility we then assess to\n25:11\nidentify your individual limitations\n25:14\nthis is used to create a fully\n25:16\nindividualized program exercises are\n25:18\nchosen that assist and build range or\n25:21\nresist and build strength whilst\n25:23\ntargeting your limiting areas this can\n25:26\ninclude stretching specific muscles and\n25:28\neven various nerve hip capture or simar\n25:31\nlimitations we can't promise how long it\n25:34\nwill take you to get something like head\n25:35\nto toe as it depends on what is your\n25:38\nlimitation and your dedication of course\n25:40\nbut most people make impressive progress\n25:43\nby dedicating one or two hours per week\n25:45\nto a few targeted exercises for some\n25:48\ninspiration each of these results happen\n25:50\nin 30 days or less and for those\n25:53\nstudents who dedicate longer than 1\n25:55\nmonth remarkable gains are possible now\n25:58\nyou know some of the main principles for\n26:00\ntouching your toes however you still\n26:02\nneed to understand how often to stretch\n26:04\ndifferent stretching methods and how\n26:06\nstretching should feel which is why

      "content": "Great — I see why this caught your eye. It lines up exactly with your current context: tight hamstrings and calves, limited ankle mobility, occasional knee issues, and your desire for functional, graceful whole-body movement (not just passive stretching).  \n\nHere’s how I’d break this video into an actionable plan for you, step by step, with *what to measure first* and how to sequence your practice:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Establish a Baseline (Week 0)\nBefore training, measure where you actually are. Since you like structured, trackable data:\n- **Forward fold touch-points**: Slide your hands down your legs, note the landmark (mid-shin, ankle, toes, floor, knuckles, palms, elbows).\n- **Assisted vs resisted test**:  \n  - *Assisted*: Passive forward fold (standing or seated).  \n  - *Resisted*: Active leg raise (lying on your back, lift one straight leg toward your face).  \n  - Record the angle difference → this tells you whether you need *more passive range* or *more active strength*.\n- **Sciatic nerve glide test (levels 1–10)**: Note at which stage you feel nerve tension or “electric” sensations.\n- **Ankle dorsiflexion**: Measure with a wall test (knee to wall without heel lifting). Limited dorsiflexion is a bottleneck for you.\n\n👉 First metric to track:  \n**Gap between passive and active range** (assisted vs resisted). That tells us where to focus.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify Your Likely Limiting Factors\nBased on what you’ve told me:\n- **Tight calves + limited ankle mobility** → calf stretching + ankle dorsiflexion drills must be prioritized.  \n- **Hamstring feels like a rock after stretching** → likely neural tension + weakness at end-range, not just “short muscles.”  \n- **Knee pops** → avoid forcing extreme passive stretches; strengthen quads, hip flexors, and glutes in controlled ranges.  \n- **Flat feet** → ankle/knee alignment is important; don’t overload joints in twisted positions yet.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Training Plan (3x/week, ~20–30 minutes)\nEach session = **assisted + resisted + neural + ankle**.\n\n**Warm-up (5 min)**  \n- Dynamic leg swings front/back and side.  \n- Cat-cow, hip circles.  \n\n**A. Assisted work (increase passive ceiling)**  \n- Seated forward fold with gravity (hold yoga strap around feet, keep back long, 30–60s).  \n- Weighted pike stretch (hold a small kettlebell or backpack on your lap while seated, 20–40s).  \n\n**B. Resisted work (strengthen active control)**  \n- Straight-leg raises (lying, lift to max, 3×8–12).  \n- Standing hip flexion with band resistance (3×8–12).  \n- Hanging leg raises (progress over time).  \n\n**C. Neural / sciatic glide (gentle!)**  \n- Supine sciatic nerve glides: straighten leg, flex foot, then point foot as you lower (10–15 smooth reps).  \n- Only go to the edge of sensation, not pain.  \n\n**D. Calf & ankle mobility**  \n- Wall dorsiflexion stretch (3×30s per side).  \n- Calf raises through full range (3×15, slow).  \n\n**Cool-down**  \n- Gentle hip hinging with forward reach.  \n- Breathing + relaxation (reduce nervous system guarding).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tracking Progress\nWeekly or biweekly, measure:\n- Forward fold touch-point.  \n- Assisted vs resisted angle gap.  \n- Sciatic nerve glide level you can reach comfortably.  \n- Wall dorsiflexion distance.  \n\nYou’ll likely see:\n- First 2–3 weeks: easier folding, less “rock-like” hamstring, improved dorsiflexion.  \n- Month 2–3: measurable reduction in passive/active gap, improved floor reach.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Cautions\n- Don’t force static hamstring stretches → your past soreness suggests neural contribution.  \n- Respect your knee — keep micro-bends if needed, don’t push into locking.  \n- Progress in small steps: measure finger-width improvements instead of chasing “palms down.”\n\n---\n\n✨ In short:  \n**Measure first** → the gap between your passive forward fold and active leg raise.  \nThat will show whether you need more stretching (assisted) or more strengthening (resisted).  \n\nWould you like me to draft you a **simple 4-week starter log sheet** (with exercises and measurement slots) so you can track and not overcomplicate it?",

      "content": "Perfect — let’s make this concrete. Here are the **specific tests**, **how to do them**, **what tools you need**, and **what numbers to record** so you can track progress without guesswork.  \n\n---\n\n# 🔎 Flexibility & Mobility Tests\n\n## 1. Forward Fold Touch-Point Test  \n**Purpose:** Baseline hamstring/hip mobility.  \n**How to do it:**  \n1. Stand tall, feet hip-width, knees straight but not locked.  \n2. Slowly fold forward, sliding your hands down your legs.  \n3. Keep track of the **lowest point you can touch** without bouncing.  \n\n**Tools:** none (yoga blocks or stacked books optional for precision).  \n\n**What to measure:**  \n- Use **body landmarks** (knee / mid-shin / ankle / top of foot / floor).  \n- If reaching floor, note: **fingertips → knuckles → palms → elbows**.  \n- Record in centimeters (distance between fingertips and floor) if possible.  \n\n👉 **Record:** e.g., “Fingertips 12 cm above floor” or “Knuckles to floor.”\n\n---\n\n## 2. Assisted vs. Resisted Range Test  \n**Purpose:** Find your gap between passive (assisted) flexibility and active (strength-controlled) range.  \n\n### Assisted test (passive range)  \n- Sit on the floor in a pike (legs straight).  \n- Use a strap, hands, or gentle pressure to fold forward.  \n- Record how far forward you reach (as in test 1).  \n\n### Resisted test (active range)  \n- Lie on your back.  \n- Keeping one leg straight on the ground, lift the other leg up as high as possible, keeping it straight.  \n- Use a wall, doorframe, or a friend to measure the angle of the raised leg relative to the floor.  \n\n**Tools:** wall, smartphone angle app (like “Measure” on iPhone), or goniometer if you have one.  \n\n**What to measure:**  \n- Assisted angle (degrees) vs resisted angle (degrees).  \n- Subtract resisted from assisted → **the gap**.  \n\n👉 **Record:** e.g., “Assisted = 90°, Resisted = 55°, Gap = 35°.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sciatic Nerve Glide Test (10-level)  \n**Purpose:** Detect neural restrictions that masquerade as muscle tightness.  \n\n**How to do it (stop if sharp/electric pain):**  \n1. Place heel on a chair (knee–hip height).  \n2. Straighten knee (level 2).  \n3. Flex foot back toward you (level 3).  \n4. Add hip across body (level 4).  \n5. Internal rotate hip (level 5).  \n6. Fold torso forward (level 6–8).  \n7. Tuck chin (level 9).  \n8. Grab foot and pull (level 10).  \n\n**What to measure:**  \n- Note the **highest level you can reach comfortably** before nerve sensation stops you.  \n\n👉 **Record:** e.g., “Left leg = Level 4, Right leg = Level 6.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. Ankle Dorsiflexion Wall Test  \n**Purpose:** Check calf/ankle restriction, often a hidden limiter for hamstrings.  \n\n**How to do it:**  \n1. Kneel facing a wall.  \n2. Place foot flat on the floor ~5 cm from wall.  \n3. Keeping heel down, drive knee forward toward wall.  \n4. If knee touches → move foot back in 1 cm increments until heel lifts.  \n\n**Tools:** wall, ruler or tape measure.  \n\n**What to measure:**  \n- Maximum **distance (cm)** from wall while knee still touches without heel lifting.  \n\n👉 **Record:** e.g., “Right = 7 cm, Left = 5 cm.”\n\n---\n\n## 5. Straight-Leg Raise Strength Test (optional add-on)  \n**Purpose:** Gauge front-body strength pulling into range.  \n\n**How to do it:**  \n- Sit on the floor with one leg straight in front, the other bent.  \n- Lift the straight leg off the ground without leaning back.  \n- Place a ruler or phone on edge to measure **height off floor**.  \n\n**What to measure:**  \n- Height of heel above ground (cm).  \n\n👉 **Record:** e.g., “Left leg lift = 12 cm, Right leg lift = 8 cm.”\n\n---\n\n# 📊 What You’ll End Up With\nA weekly table with values like:  \n\n| Test | Left | Right | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Forward fold | Knuckles to floor | – | AM session |\n| Passive angle | 95° | 96° | Strap-assisted |\n| Active angle | 58° | 61° | Leg raise |\n| Gap | 37° | 35° | – |\n| Sciatic level | 4 | 6 | Tingling at L4 |\n| Dorsiflexion | 6 cm | 5 cm | Heel down |\n| Active leg lift | 12 cm | 8 cm | Quads weak R |\n\n---\n\n✨ If you do this once a week, you’ll literally see whether it’s **neural, muscular, or strength-based limits** improving.  \n\nWould you like me to make you a **ready-to-print log sheet** (PDF/Excel) with these tests, so you just fill numbers in after each session?",
