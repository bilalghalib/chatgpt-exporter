  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is developing a methodology called \"VX\" (Values Experience) that starts with understanding a person's core values and traces how those values flow through affordances, UX, UI, and ultimately code to determine whether technical implementations help or hinder what matters most to users. They referenced research showing LLMs can effectively impersonate users for purchase decision analysis and wanted to apply similar principles to values alignment assessment.\n\nThe user specifically requested help creating a prompt for Claude Code that would analyze GitHub profiles and repositories. They referenced Joe's system for gathering \"constitutive attentional policies\" (CAPs) - clusters of what people pay attention to that represent their deeper values rather than mere preferences or goals. The methodology distinguishes between instrumental desires and constitutive values, focusing on specific attention patterns that are meaningful in themselves, not just as means to other ends.\n\nThrough iterative refinement, we developed a comprehensive prompt for Claude Code that would: identify 5 diverse customer personas from examining a codebase, infer each persona's values as specific CAPs using Joe's framework (formatted as \"PLURAL NOUN PHRASE that [specific qualifier]\"), trace how values flow through the technical stack from affordances down to actual code implementation, and produce a structured VX audit showing where implementations support or hinder users' core values. The user wanted this as a working prompt that Claude Code could execute using its GitHub access and command-running capabilities.\n\nThe conversation involved reviewing Joe's values elicitation methodology from provided PDFs, understanding the theoretical framework distinguishing values from preferences, and adapting the conversational approach for automated code analysis. We discussed expected outcomes, including how this methodology might reveal tensions in tools like \"ChatGPT for teachers\" where convenience features might undermine pedagogical values around productive struggle and authentic learning. The final prompt combines Joe's warm, non-jargony conversational style with systematic technical analysis, creating a bridge between human meaning-making and software implementation.",

You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n1. Start with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\n2. Zoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\n3. Ask questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\n4. When you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\n5. Call submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n* DO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\n* DON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\n* DON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\n* DO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\n* DON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\n* NEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n* When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\n* Since negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\n* Ask about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\n* Ask about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\n* Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\n* Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\n* Make sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\n1. Start with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\n2. Write from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\n3. Use general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\n4. Be precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.\n\n\n\n"

      "content": "Let me carefully review the PDFs to understand Joe's methodology better and see what's missing from my prompt.\n\nFrom the first PDF (joegraph.pdf - the prompt for the meaning assistant):\n- It's a conversational dialogue system\n- Goes through stages: 1) Start with story/emotion/role model/difficult choice, 2) Zoom in on source of meaning, 3) Ask questions to gather attention policies, 4) Double-check, 5) Submit values card\n- Key distinctions:\n  - Speak casually, personally, warm\n  - DON'T flatter\n  - DON'T use terms like \"attention policies\" - say \"what you pay attention to\"\n  - DO relate personally, make up experiences\n  - DON'T ask many questions at once\n  - NEVER show the description to user\n\n- Sources of meaning are MORE SPECIFIC than words like \"honesty\" - they specify a PARTICULAR kind with a path of attention\n- They open possibility spaces, not just satisfy preferences\n\n- Zooming techniques:\n  - From goals → how would you like to live within/after the goal\n  - From feelings → what's important and [threatened/blocked/haven't lived up to/haven't focused on]\n  - From moral principles/norms → how do you wish YOU could live if these were followed\n  - From role models → what does that person pay attention to\n\n- Gathering the source of meaning:\n  - Ask about attention - what specific paths of attention\n  - Ask about role models\n  - Gather details - precise but general instructions\n  - Ensure policies make clear what's meaningful\n  - Make sure they fit together coherently\n\n- Writing as attention policies:\n  - Start with plural noun phrases (MOMENTS, SENSATIONS, CHOICES, OPPORTUNITIES)\n  - Write from perspective of actor (instructions to the person)\n  - Use general words (prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\")\n  - Be precise, not vague or abstract\n\nFrom the second PDF (Values_Preferences_Meaningful_Choice.pdf):\n\n\nI see a nuanced theoretical framework that distinguishes between values and preferences. The core insight is that values are deeper criteria for choice, not just instrumental decisions.

The goal isn't just functionality, but preserving the deeply human art of teaching.Looking at the PDFs carefully, I see several critical gaps in my prompt. Let me revise:\n\n## What's Missing from My Prompt:\n\n1. **The conversational, non-jargon approach** - Joe's system speaks warmly and never uses terms like \"attentional policies\" with users\n2. **Zooming techniques** - specific ways to get from surface statements to underlying values\n3. **Verification process** - asking for past stories and concrete examples\n4. **The instrumental vs constitutive test** - how to tell if something is truly a value\n5. **Proper CAP formatting** - precise rules about structure and perspective\n\n## Expected Outcomes:\n\n**For GitHub profiles:**\n- 3-5 values as specific CAPs (not \"values collaboration\" but \"MOMENTS when someone sees a connection they wouldn't have made alone\")\n- Evidence trail from their actual code/comments/choices\n- Specific misalignments with recommendations\n- A \"values card\" they could confirm or correct\n\n**For \"ChatGPT for teachers\" analysis:**\nThis would reveal interesting tensions. Let me trace through it:\n\n**Hypothesized teacher values might include:**\n- \"MOMENTS when a student's confusion becomes curiosity rather than defeat\"\n- \"SIGNS that understanding is genuine—when a student can explain in their own words\"\n- \"OPPORTUNITIES for students to struggle productively before receiving help\"\n\n**What ChatGPT for teachers affords:**\n- Instant complete answers (skips productive struggle)\n- Polished explanations (may obscure genuine understanding)\n- Unlimited patience (could support staying with confusion)\n- Scaffolding generation (could maintain challenge appropriately)\n\n**VX Analysis would show:**\n- ✗ Default use (direct answers) undermines productive struggle value\n- ✓ Prompt design could support curiosity (if teacher crafts questions that make students think)\n- ? Unclear if students develop genuine understanding or performance\n\n**Better prompt:**\n\n---\n\n# VX Analysis for Code Review\n\nI'm going to help you understand if your code/project actually serves what matters to you as a developer/creator.\n\n## My Approach\n\nI won't ask you directly about \"values\" or \"attentional policies.\" Instead, I'll look at what you've actually built and how you've built it, then check if that reflects what's meaningful to you.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding What Matters to You\n\nI'll examine your GitHub presence looking for signals:\n\n**From your project choices:**\n- What problems drew your attention?\n- What did you care enough about to spend time on?\n\n**From your code and docs:**\n- What do you take time to explain?\n- What trade-offs did you make? (When did you choose clarity over speed, or flexibility over simplicity?)\n- What do your comments reveal about what you pay attention to?\n\n**From how you interact:**\n- What issues engage you?\n- What improvements do you prioritize?\n- How do you respond to others?\n\nThen I'll describe back to you what I think you pay attention to, using really specific language.\n\nNot vague stuff like \"you value good code\" but specific things like:\n- \"Moments when someone using your tool discovers they can do something they didn't know was possible\"\n- \"Choices that make complex ideas accessible without dumbing them down\"\n- \"Opportunities for users to understand what's happening rather than just using a black box\"\n\nYou'll tell me if I'm right, wrong, or close-but-not-quite.\n\n## Step 2: Checking Your Story\n\nTo make sure I understand what matters to you, I'll ask:\n\n**About past projects:**\n- Tell me about a time you made a design decision that felt really right\n- What were you paying attention to when you made it?\n- What would have felt wrong?\n\n**About role models:**\n- Is there a developer/creator whose work you really admire?\n- What specifically do they do that matters to you?\n\n**About difficult choices:**\n- Describe a time you had to choose between two features or approaches\n- What made it hard?\n- How did you decide?\n\n## Step 3: Tracing Through Your Work\n\nFor a specific project, I'll trace:\n\n```\nWhat you say matters → What you built → What users experience → What they can actually do\n```\n\nLooking for alignment or tension at each level.\n\n## Step 4: VX Report\n\nI'll show you:\n\n1. **What I think matters to you** (3-5 specific things you pay attention to)\n2. **Where your code/UI/UX supports that** (with examples)\n3. **Where it might be working against you** (specific misalignments)\n4. **How to realign** (concrete suggestions)\n\n## The Test\n\nThe question isn't \"is this good code?\" but \"does this help you live and work in a way that feels meaningful to you?\"\n\n---\n\n**Let's start. Looking at [your GitHub profile], tell me:**\n\n**What's a project you worked on where something about it felt really right to you—not just that it worked, but that the way it worked or the way you built it felt meaningful?**\n\n---\n\n## For \"ChatGPT for Teachers\" Analysis:\n\nI'd start by asking teachers:\n\n\"Tell me about a moment in teaching that felt really meaningful—not just that the student got the right answer, but something about the moment itself.\"\n\nCommon themes might emerge:\n- That moment when confusion becomes curiosity\n- When a student explains something in their own words\n- When they realize they can figure things out\n\nThen: \"Now think about using ChatGPT to prepare lessons or help students. Walk me through a specific time you used it. What were you trying to do? What happened?\"\n\nThe VX analysis would reveal:\n- **Alignment**: When teacher uses it to generate scaffolding questions that maintain challenge\n- **Misalignment**: When it provides complete answers that skip the meaningful struggle\n- **Missed opportunity**: Could help teachers notice patterns in student misunderstanding\n\n**Key insight**: The tool isn't inherently good or bad—it's whether the affordances it creates align with what the teacher finds meaningful about teaching.\n\nShould I create a more refined version that combines Joe's conversational approach with the VX framework?",

For each customer, explore their values using Joe's methodology\n4. Trace values → affordances → UX → UI → code\n5. Produce an audit showing alignment/misalignment\n\nThis needs to be a working prompt for Claude Code, so it should:\n- Be clear about the task sequence\n- Use Joe's methodology properly (conversational, specific, constitutive attentional policies)\n- Work with GitHub/filesystem access\n- Generate a structured output\n- Not use jargon with the \"customers\" but use the framework internally\n\nLet me structure this as a single prompt that Claude Code can execute.# VX Audit: Values-Through-Code Analysis\n\nYou have access to our GitHub repository. I want you to conduct a Values Experience (VX) audit using this methodology:\n\n## Your Task\n\n**Phase 1: Identify Diverse Customer Personas**\n- Review the codebase, README, documentation, issues, and any user-facing materials\n- Identify 5 diverse potential customers/users who would use this project\n- Make them meaningfully different (different contexts, needs, backgrounds)\n- For each, write a brief persona (2-3 sentences about who they are and their situation)\n\n**Phase 2: Infer Values for Each Persona**\n\nFor each customer, identify 3-4 **specific things they would pay attention to** that are meaningful to them (not just instrumental).\n\nFormat these as **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)**:\n- Start with PLURAL NOUN PHRASE in caps\n- Follow with specific qualifier\n- Write from actor's perspective\n- Be concrete, not abstract\n\n**Examples:**\n- ✓ \"MOMENTS when a student's confusion becomes curiosity rather than defeat\"\n- ✓ \"SIGNS that a system respects my autonomy rather than manipulating my choices\"\n- ✗ \"User-friendly design\" (too vague)\n- ✗ \"Fast performance\" (instrumental, not constitutive)\n\n**How to infer values:**\n- What problems would this person be trying to solve?\n- What would feel meaningful vs merely functional to them?\n- What past experiences might shape what they pay attention to?\n- If they chose this tool over alternatives, what would they be choosing *for*?\n\n## Phase 3: VX Trace for Each Persona\n\nFor each customer, trace through these layers:\n\n### 1. VALUES (CAPs)\nList their 3-4 constitutive attentional policies\n\n### 2. AFFORDANCES  \nWhat does our project make possible or impossible for them?\n- What can they discover/do/become?\n- What paths are opened or closed?\n- What agency do they have?\n\n### 3. UX (User Experience)\nWhat do they actually experience when using it?\n- What flows exist?\n- What do they encounter?\n- What choices do they face?\n\n### 4. UI (User Interface)\nWhat can they see and interact with?\n- What's visible/hidden?\n- What interactions are available?\n- What information is surfaced?\n\n### 5. CODE\nWhat actual implementation creates this?\n- What specific files/functions?\n- What technical decisions?\n- What's in the codebase that creates this layer?\n\n## Phase 4: Alignment Analysis\n\nFor each persona and each of their values, assess:\n\n**✓ SUPPORTS:** Where code→UI→UX→affordances actively help them live by this value\n- Be specific: \"The [X feature in Y file] creates [Z affordance] which lets them [attention to...]\"\n\n**✗ HINDERS:** Where implementation works against their values\n- Specific examples with code references\n\n**? MISSED OPPORTUNITY:** Where we could better support their values\n- Concrete suggestions\n\n## Phase 5: Generate VX Audit Report\n\nCreate a markdown file `VX_AUDIT.md` with this structure:\n\n```markdown\n# VX Audit: [Project Name]\n\nDate: [Today's date]\nRepository: [URL]\n\n## Executive Summary\n[2-3 sentences on overall value alignment]\n\n---\n\n## Persona 1: [Name/Type]\n### Who They Are\n[Description]\n\n### Their Values (CAPs)\n1.

I want you to conduct a Values Experience (VX) audit using this methodology:\n\n## Your Task\n\n**Phase 1: Identify Diverse Customer Personas**\n- Review the codebase, README, documentation, issues, and any user-facing materials\n- Identify 5 diverse potential customers/users who would use this project\n- Make them meaningfully different (different contexts, needs, backgrounds)\n- For each, write a brief persona (2-3 sentences about who they are and their situation)\n\n**Phase 2: Infer Values for Each Persona**\n\nFor each customer, identify 3-4 **specific things they would pay attention to** that are meaningful to them (not just instrumental).\n\nFormat these as **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)**:\n- Start with PLURAL NOUN PHRASE in caps\n- Follow with specific qualifier\n- Write from actor's perspective\n- Be concrete, not abstract\n\n**Examples:**\n- ✓ \"MOMENTS when a student's confusion becomes curiosity rather than defeat\"\n- ✓ \"SIGNS that a system respects my autonomy rather than manipulating my choices\"\n- ✗ \"User-friendly design\" (too vague)\n- ✗ \"Fast performance\" (instrumental, not constitutive)\n\n**How to infer values:**\n- What problems would this person be trying to solve?\n- What would feel meaningful vs merely functional to them?\n- What past experiences might shape what they pay attention to?\n- If they chose this tool over alternatives, what would they be choosing *for*?\n\n## Phase 3: VX Trace for Each Persona\n\nFor each customer, trace through these layers:\n\n### 1. VALUES (CAPs)\nList their 3-4 constitutive attentional policies\n\n### 2. AFFORDANCES  \nWhat does our project make possible or impossible for them?\n- What can they discover/do/become?\n- What paths are opened or closed?\n- What agency do they have?\n\n### 3. UX (User Experience)\nWhat do they actually experience when using it?\n- What flows exist?\n- What do they encounter?\n- What choices do they face?\n\n### 4. UI (User Interface)\nWhat can they see and interact with?\n- What's visible/hidden?\n- What interactions are available?\n- What information is surfaced?\n\n### 5. CODE\nWhat actual implementation creates this?\n- What specific files/functions?\n- What technical decisions?\n- What's in the codebase that creates this layer?\n\n## Phase 4: Alignment Analysis\n\nFor each persona and each of their values, assess:\n\n**✓ SUPPORTS:** Where code→UI→UX→affordances actively help them live by this value\n- Be specific: \"The [X feature in Y file] creates [Z affordance] which lets them [attention to...]\"\n\n**✗ HINDERS:** Where implementation works against their values\n- Specific examples with code references\n\n**? MISSED OPPORTUNITY:** Where we could better support their values\n- Concrete suggestions\n\n## Phase 5: Generate VX Audit Report\n\nCreate a markdown file `VX_AUDIT.md` with this structure:\n\n```markdown\n# VX Audit: [Project Name]\n\nDate: [Today's date]\nRepository: [URL]\n\n## Executive Summary\n[2-3 sentences on overall value alignment]\n\n---\n\n## Persona 1: [Name/Type]\n### Who They Are\n[Description]\n\n### Their Values (CAPs)\n1.
