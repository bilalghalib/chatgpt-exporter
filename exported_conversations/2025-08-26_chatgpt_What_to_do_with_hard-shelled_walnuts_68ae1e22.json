      "content": "If your walnuts have already formed **hard shells inside**, they’ve moved past the “green walnut” stage used for things like pickled walnuts or nocino. At this stage they’re basically **immature regular walnuts**. Here’s what you can do depending on how mature they are:  \n\n### 1. If they are almost mature (shell hard, kernel forming):\n- **Harvest & dry for eating**: Let them dry/cure for a few weeks in a well-ventilated spot (spread out, not stacked). After curing, crack them open – the kernels may be smaller, shriveled, or slightly bitter compared to fully mature walnuts, but still edible.  \n- **Roast them**: Roasting can improve flavor if the nutmeat is still pale and a little bland.  \n- **Oil extraction**: Pressing immature walnuts gives walnut oil, though yield is lower than mature nuts.  \n\n### 2. If they are green outside but the inside shell is already hard:\n- The green outer husk will blacken and get messy. Traditionally, people let the husks darken and then remove them (gloves recommended, they stain skin).  \n- Once husks are off, dry the hard-shelled nuts like normal walnuts.  \n\n### 3. If they are small, underdeveloped, and not likely to mature:\n- **Animal feed**: Chickens, goats, and some wild animals may eat them after they dry/crack.  \n- **Dye use**: The green husks (even with hard shells inside) are a strong natural dye/stain. You can boil them to make a brown/black ink or wood stain.  \n\n👉 Question for you: do you want to use them **culinarily** (to eat/drink) or are you open to **non-food uses** (like dye or oil)? That’ll help narrow the best path.",
