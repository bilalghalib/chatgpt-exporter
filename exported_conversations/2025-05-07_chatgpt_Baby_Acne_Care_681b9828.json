Here's what you can do:\n\n### **What to Do:**\n1. **Leave it alone:** It usually clears up on its own within a few weeks to a few months.\n2. **Keep the skin clean:** Gently wash your baby’s face once a day with warm water. No soap needed.\n3. **Avoid harsh products:** Don’t use lotions, oils, or over-the-counter acne treatments unless prescribed.\n4. **Don’t scrub or squeeze:** This can irritate the skin and make it worse.\n5. **Be patient:** It’s not caused by dirt or poor hygiene and is not contagious.\n\n### **When to See a Doctor:**\n- If it lasts more than 3 months\n- If it spreads or worsens\n- If you're unsure whether it's acne or another rash (like eczema or an allergy)\n\nWould you like help identifying it from a photo or distinguishing it from other baby rashes?",

      "content": "Baby acne can seem to pop up suddenly, often around 2–4 weeks of age, and here's why:\n\n### **Where It Comes From:**\n1. **Maternal hormones:** Hormones passed from the mother to the baby during pregnancy can stimulate the baby’s oil glands, leading to acne.\n2. **Immature pores:** Newborn skin is still developing, and their pores can easily become clogged.\n3. **Normal skin bacteria:** Baby acne isn't caused by poor hygiene—it’s a reaction to natural changes in their skin environment.\n\nThe sudden appearance over a couple of nights is typical. It often looks worse before it gets better and can flare up due to heat, spit-up, or even contact with fabric washed in strong detergent.\n\nWould you like to send a photo so I can help confirm it's baby acne and not something else like eczema or a rash?",
