Oh, what's up? Hello, wait a minute? Hello? Hear me out? Hello, Aya. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, peace be upon you, hear me? \r\n\r\n00:01:15 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Oh. \r\n\r\n00:01:16 BILAL \r\n. Finally. It's working. And welcome \r\n\r\n. 00:01:17 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Peace be upon you \r\n\r\n. 00:01:20 BILAL \r\nWhat's up? \r\n\r\n00:01:21 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Do you have it? It's not good? Okay? It's a problem \r\n\r\n. 00:01:28 BILAL \r\n. We'd be honored. Thank you, it's been a while, how are you talking to me today? Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:01:36 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. By God, I mean, from the first time I spoke to him and this. I told him that I'm already busy, so what are we doing? Yes, this is the right time, honestly \r\n\r\n00:01:46 BILAL \r\n. I mean, don't, I don't want to put any pressure. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:01:50 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Okay, if it's something quick \r\n\r\n00:01:52 BILAL \r\n, I mean, let's start with, oh, the acquaintance, and I'll introduce myself a little bit, and yeah, I'll try, oh no. Peace. Peace be upon you, Aya, what do you think? Ok, if you want, I mean, good, let's just introduce myself. Yes, quickly, God willing. I'll give you the framework we're thinking about and we'll see if we can get some opinions from you. And this is it, God willing, so we won't take long. I'm Bilal, and I work with the UN. They want to develop job opportunities for young people through the green construction market in Mosul and Iraq in general. We want to work on three training courses. We decided to work on solar energy training. This is clear and simple. The second is on insulation, and we're trying to encourage people to use insulation and find opportunities for young people. This is a bit complicated in the insulation job market, but we want to work on it. We'll manage it. And the third one. The reason we want to fill it out today is to have the engineers, architects, and architects work with him to build and design buildings. Yes, green ideas from the ground up. So I wanted to see, what do you think about the engineers, the architects, and the architects? Engineers and how do you educate them about this topic? \r\n\r\n00:03:35 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Me. I'm not the majority, they're just like we say we use a lot of solar energy, it's available in homes or buildings, and all these things from the construction side, the building materials so far are the old building materials which are blocks, fireclay, red blocks, ceramic stone, which will not provide 100% insulation in terms of heat or the. The current temperatures, I as a group, I mean as we say, as a company inside Mosul that works on building the \r\n\r\n00:04:06 BILAL system \r\n. The German in German, you know about. About yourself in a little bit. Because I want a. Hahaha yeah \r\n\r\n00:04:14 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. I'm an engineer, engineer Aya Nizar, I work for a construction contracting company for the walls of Mosul. God willing, God willing, inside Mosul, and this is this \r\n\r\n00:04:23 BILAL \r\nGerman, what is it? Is it? I didn't understand the the. Ah? \r\n\r\n00:04:28 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. It's more like an elephant, like inside, it's like elephant molds, ah, inside, Cretan aligned. Currently, there is a factory in Baghdad that provides the raw materials \r\n\r\n00:04:41 BILAL \r\n. And it's a German design, but made in Iraq \r\n\r\n00:04:48 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Exactly, the industry is there, the raw materials are manufactured in Baghdad, almost everything in Mosul, the company, as we say, is exclusive, which imports this material and works with it almost since 2000 and it's been around \r\n\r\n00:04:59 BILAL \r\nthat the society doesn't have all the awareness about the importance of these things, what color, what color, do you encourage people on this topic? \r\n\r\n00:05:08 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nAh, and we are boss. Um. And here, as we say, through people's experiences, we always try new things. People have hesitation in accepting this thing, especially since it's a cork building, how cork is it, and how it will be affected, will it fall or will it burn? We try all these things through experiences, and most of us, little by little, are people who \r\n\r\n00:05:36 BILAL \r\n. You convince them through \r\n\r\n00:05:37 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. But they also have. They don't resort to the old methods, on the contrary \r\n\r\n00:05:40 BILAL \r\n. The old courtyard, I mean, not the old one. Only 20 years old, the old building, I mean, it's not Mosul's heritage, it was a green building because there was no electricity in the first place. Generators \r\n\r\n00:06:00 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. There is this use of stone and these things, these things take up from the building area itself, yes, we try to as little building area as possible to consume for the spaces themselves \r\n\r\n00:06:10 BILAL \r\n. Okay, so this takes the methods and the. I mean the old ways and updates them with new materials. Yes, exactly, yes yes \r\n\r\n00:06:18 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. But here, this is exactly the same cork used, but this is in two layers, external and internal, yes in the middle, they pour a reinforced concrete slab \r\n\r\n00:06:26 BILAL \r\n. And so. This material is expensive, I mean, let's say, let's compare it to regular construction \r\n\r\n00:06:33 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Regular construction, approximately in cost, reaches a house, I'll tell you, an increase of 10% of its price, here \r\n\r\n00:06:40 BILAL. \r\nAnd so, what difference does it make with the insulation? I mean? \r\n\r\n00:06:46 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Like I said, 85 to 90% of the time, but then you have the secondary openings, which are the windows, all the doors, which will be a source of A, which reduces the insulation \r\n\r\n00:06:59 BILAL \r\n. E. F. F \r\n\r\n00:07:00 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Let's extend the insulation \r\n\r\n00:07:01 BILAL \r\nI mean, if. If it increases by 10%, I mean, how long will it take? Even if someone returns it to him? \r\n\r\n00:07:06 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. His money? In the long run. There's a huge difference, close to electricity. Oil, anything else? \r\n\r\n00:07:15 BILAL \r\nSo, when are you embarrassed? And people, to convince them of this matter, you use materialistic methods, like telling them that you will get your money back in five years. What does that mean? \r\n\r\n00:07:28 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Exactly, it's okay, you will spend more now, but in the future you will save on secondary things, yes, especially since, like we say, electricity in Iraq was not stable, all these things, oil is not always available or prices can reach very high, yes, and I will save on things, yes, especially the second floor. We call it in Iraq, Mosul, specifically a block building, yes, it means a huge accumulation of heat, yes, it gains heat, especially on the upper floors \r\n\r\n00:07:55 BILAL \r\n. So, it gains an entire house. In the summer, it means the house is not liveable. Hahaha, but \r\n\r\n00:08:00 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. I bought that exactly most people hahaha don't need the first floor, go down to the ground floor for the sake of providing coolness \r\n\r\n00:08:06 BILAL \r\nYes, you. Do you see it as a used house? This cork and concrete, I mean, what color is it? What color? The second floor is houses? \r\n\r\n00:08:13 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nHouses and not a house at all, I mean, like we say, it still has a structure and a difference in temperatures between the outside and the inside \r\n\r\n00:08:21 BILAL \r\nDo you have any numbers to compare a house, a house made, what did it do? An experience? If you had statistics in Hechi M? \r\n\r\n00:08:29 AYA NIZAR BASHEER I mean \r\n, the numbers like the temperatures, to be honest, this is with the management and these things, they used this thing, he was the first, I mean, the company manager was the first person to use it on the second floor, pizza, yeah \r\n\r\n00:08:39 BILAL \r\nSweet before, this is from 2018 \r\n\r\n00:08:43 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n.2000. And about 1300 \r\n\r\n00:08:44 BILAL \r\nWhat? What are the names of the partners? \r\n\r\n00:08:46 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. So that the walls of Mosul can sleep? Now? I told you her page on Facebook, sweet sweet it exists, I mean like we say we have implemented many houses with this material \r\n\r\n00:08:55 BILAL \r\nYou, you are focusing on, I mean, what does this mean? \r\n\r\n00:08:58 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nThe company exactly is not focusing on this material, and honestly they have currently restricted it within the company, \r\n\r\n00:09:04 BILAL \r\n. Sweet sweet sweet God willing \r\n\r\n00:09:05 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. God, even the problem offices we return to, the second problem, the second offices, yes, at the same time, we do not encourage this time, why? It is not guaranteed and there are no studies on it at all, and all these things are strange, this is a bit like I said, competition in the job market \r\n\r\n00:09:21 BILAL \r\n. It is not useful, they try to say do not go, and come with this company, we will build it for you \r\n\r\n00:09:25 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. But we return. The one who is not pregnant with children. Yes \r\n\r\n00:09:30 BILAL \r\n. Yes yes, it is still possible that one of the things we must do is conduct this research and publish it so that people, I mean, have more confidence in it \r\n\r\n00:09:40 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. I mean, we held seminars, we held seminars on electricity, the Ministry of Electricity Department, we held a seminar at the university at the same time, the municipality of Masal, we suggested to them that it be now, the building inside it, with this system, you don't care at all, \r\n\r\n00:09:56 BILAL \r\n. H. H. This. The. This. The. This material, this the a cork and concrete, this means that only in the basic construction, if we could do this, I mean, on an existing house, and add it to the walls, \r\n\r\n00:10:08 AYA NIZAR BASHEER, \r\nit is available as a foundation for walls and ceilings. If I use it as a whole, it will be very expensive. I'm telling you, the difference is only the walls, as we say, as the lowest cost, at the same time it will provide me with the insulation that I require, \r\n\r\n00:10:22 BILAL \r\n. Yes, if I have \r\n\r\n00:10:22 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n, the old house. I will raise \r\n\r\n00:10:24 BILAL \r\n. I can add it to an old house, if necessary \r\n\r\n00:10:26 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. The house is new, no, because it's instead of the wall itself \r\n\r\n00:10:30 BILAL \r\n. There's no way. Hahaha. Are you thinking about it? We can add it \r\n\r\n00:10:36 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. The same pieces, and they're fixed directly to the table, but it's going to be shorter than the space itself \r\n\r\n00:10:41 BILAL \r\n. M, so that means it's possible \r\n\r\n00:10:43 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. We'll deliver the factory parts on pieces, for example, without concrete on one side, and they're fixed from the inside, yes, but it will be less than the foundations, and I have to go back again, yes? Packaging and these things \r\n\r\n00:10:56 BILAL \r\nYes, and this. This is me, Osama, about the idea of the plaster, does this mean that it might benefit the existing houses, and it means that it even increases the insulation, the material, the material, the wall, the walls, I mean from the outside from the inside? \r\n\r\n00:11:08 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nThese are materials that clean exactly, but at the same time they won't reach the degree of insulation of the fiber material itself \r\n\r\n00:11:17 BILAL \r\n. Mmm, I'm trying to imagine, I mean, this is the cork material, I mean, why can't we do it like someone hangs pictures, if he puts a high-quality one on the bottom, he puts a tile on the walls? And then he puts it in a second bathroom, it will definitely take up \r\n\r\n00:11:30 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nmore space than the house. Hahaha. Or the air conditioning stuff. How are we going to hang it? The air conditioning units with technicians? Yes? \r\n\r\n00:11:36 BILAL \r\nRight? \r\n\r\n00:11:37 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Us. No. Just Fisher that it would be longer. The delivery of patience is Crete, that's it, yes, that means all this problem will be solved \r\n\r\n00:11:43 BILAL \r\nYes, this problem, that the project that we focus on is the existing houses, I mean those who want to do retro-fine, I mean they want to add things, yes, I mean, of course we can train on this material and encourage the engineers to use it, but in this training we focus on the things that are applied to the existing houses, so you mean do you have any idea of the materials that are in it? \r\n\r\n00:12:09 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nThere are materials that are cleaning in what has not been done yet, the core or plaster or something, that provide a wheel, yes, we have another thing, the cork, but its thickness is very, I mean one centimeter, that is, they usually cover it from the outside, it provides a kind of insulation, but other than these materials there is no \r\n\r\n00:12:27 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes, yes, it is important that the new construction, I mean, they think about it from the beginning. I heard that from \r\n\r\n00:12:33 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. The Bekaa, hahaha. And by the way, we are starting to care. Exactly, we are working on reducing the cost, the meager income, we don’t need to build it with this material. I mean, it’s more like the outside of the house, it’s more like I make it like a cork box, and inside it is stronger than it can be with the material I need so that the cost doesn’t increase everything, because this 10%, I say that it is basically just outside the house \r\n\r\n00:12:57 BILAL \r\nHa, what does that mean? \r\n\r\n00:12:59 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Outside the house from four sides, yes, I mean, inside the house I don’t need \r\n\r\n00:13:02 BILAL \r\ninsulation and the a the a the roof on the I hear that a lot of? \r\n\r\n00:13:07 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. The existing ICF pieces are almost there, and let's go back to the second paragraph, the ICF pieces that the surface does not depend on. Start similar to the slab roof, it is bridges and poured very much, five to ten centimeters. People ask it and do not accept it, that it is not strong and cannot bear, and all of this if \r\n\r\n00:13:29 BILAL \r\nWhy is your company? This is focusing on green construction, meaning it is ignoring people on insulation, I mean what, what for? Why are you focusing on this topic? \r\n\r\n00:13:40 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nWhat is it, I mean, the manager from the beginning loved that he saw this material and something and brought the revolution and worked, and then he contacted a factory in Baghdad and provided these materials and all of these things right, as we say, and took yes and the most important thing, as we say, is that as a labor market, you are the only distinguished company that has this material, right, right, right, something is useful with it, if anyone \r\n\r\n00:13:59 BILAL \r\n. Investment, one has a point of view and a way of building, but \r\n\r\n00:14:04 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nHe was convinced from the beginning, God willing, that he would like you first, and they tried that there were even working cadres. Do you work on it or are you afraid of working on it? \r\n\r\n00:14:13 BILAL \r\nWhat? Why? I mean, is it complicated or different? \r\n\r\n00:14:16 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nNo, it's totally normal, no, it's totally normal, but like we say, people are afraid of anything new, so he was with them step by step, and gave them what they could do, and what did they start with in their home as it is \r\n\r\n00:14:28 BILAL And up until now, I mean \r\n, how many homes have been built using this, what did you call it? \r\n\r\n00:14:38 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nConcrete Phone? \r\n\r\n00:14:42 BILAL \r\nChinese, oh yes, it's nice, oh okay, I see it \r\n\r\n00:14:46 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. It fills many houses, it reaches a hundred houses, I mean during this period \r\n\r\n00:14:51 BILAL \r\n, it's nice, this is something, I mean, like you said, people don't like anything new, even if it's not tried and tested, \r\n\r\n00:14:57 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Except for a period exactly, my experience, yes \r\n\r\n00:15:00 BILAL \r\n. So now, I mean, if people see that they tried and go to the second floor in the middle of the summer, or his cousin's house, and he feels that he can't take a nap on top, it's not necessary, I mean \r\n\r\n00:15:11 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. I see that. Exactly, I mean, I've reached the point where I turn off the... the job takes one hour, and I turn it off. I don't need to... \r\n\r\n00:15:19 BILAL \r\nWow... Okay, so I mean, there are two things that I expect would be a nice thing for us to do. First, we share this material with people, and we bring it to the training and encourage some engineers to think about it using the new design. But one of the things that I expect we need to do is conduct research that... this means... this will make a building... in Mosul... it is... it is... strong... it is expected that we have 100 houses now, so that people can go and see these houses... hahaha... they know them... \r\n\r\n00:15:56 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Actually, there are existing sites and they are living there. Wasal, poor... \r\n\r\n00:16:00 BILAL \r\n. Do you know what his office is like? Is it made of this material? So people can visit it and feel it and see what the difference is between it and another building? I mean another building? Management \r\n\r\n00:16:15 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Akumul. Al-Nour neighborhood is there \r\n\r\n00:16:17 BILAL \r\n. Neighborhood \r\n\r\n00:16:18 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Almost a mall, I mean a small Musa, I mean a market in Al-Nour neighborhood in Mosul, yes, it is built in this ICF \r\n\r\n00:16:25 BILAL \r\n. Yes, so people can enter and feel the difference \r\n\r\n00:16:28 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Between them, they want to enter exactly yes \r\n\r\n00:16:30 BILAL \r\nWhat is the name of the place? Which part? I mean, I will go visit one day, God willing, haha? \r\n\r\n00:16:37 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nLet me confirm the name for you because it has changed, frankly, ah, I mean the A side of the name Let me confirm the name for you exactly, currently my name is and I told you \r\n\r\n00:16:45 BILAL \r\nthat it's nice that this is not a house, it's hard for someone to go and invite someone to go to the A house \r\n\r\n00:16:50 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. No, no, it doesn't exist, yes, it does, they hold weddings in the forests, they have this A system, wow, yes, but here we have an iron roof, so it's not 100% insulated \r\n\r\n00:17:04 BILAL \r\n. Yeah, so it's half and half \r\n\r\n00:17:05 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. We encouraged the mood of the sounds and the heat exactly \r\n\r\n00:17:08 BILAL \r\n. We didn't think about the sounds, \r\n\r\n00:17:11 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. It's the insulation, the sound, for sure \r\n\r\n00:17:13 BILAL \r\n. Wow, Mosul has a sound problem, I mean, if we wanted to try to talk with \r\n\r\n00:17:17 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. people, I mean, as a wedding hall, as a wedding hall, I mean, I don't like the sound to come out from the outside or something that stays inside, yeah \r\n\r\n00:17:27 BILAL \r\nWow, I don't remember its name, it's good, so you're focusing on this one. Or one of the things, I mean, the reasons that if I call people, if I want, I mean, I don't know if it's obvious that I, hahaha, don't live in Mosul, no matter how much I try to learn, oh, all the details, even when we apply for the training, it will be worth one, I mean, a new graduate who came out of the, oh, how much college, I mean, how much if he's an engineer? What do you expect? I mean? If you were giving advice, would you give it to her? Yes, in the information, would it benefit her by building houses, I mean, really? Yes, yes, the atmosphere of Mosul and the people of Mosul, what would you encourage her to do? I mean, any information, any direction \r\n\r\n00:18:17 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nI mean, it's a direction that exactly, that I benefited from the energy, that I benefited from the insulation, the solar energy, and all of these things, but that I continue to imitate the West in terms of facades, in terms of plans, the most important thing is that I sometimes exclude it, but the open system, not completely, I mean, I feel that it was in terms of customs and traditions, but in Mosul, it's not entirely successful, I mean, people always prefer isolation between the people or these things, yeah \r\n\r\n00:18:47 BILAL \r\nAnd as for \r\n\r\n00:18:48 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. God willing, the a. Yes \r\n\r\n00:18:49 BILAL \r\nAl Al means you are talking about the West and the building means it resembles the West. What is the Al A instead of it? What do we have? I mean, who are we to build like we used to build two hundred years ago? \r\n\r\n00:19:05 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nI died two hundred years ago, we prefer to isolate this space, for example, for living, this is for guests, like we say yes I come and gather these two, and I make the space very spacious for me, so that doesn’t mean I won’t use it the way I want, yes I will start on it in the future, because I will change the isolation from time to time, I will change I need isolation, I can’t integrate people together, \r\n\r\n00:19:31 BILAL \r\n. Sound isolation, isolation, personal. And isolation \r\n\r\n00:19:34 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Exactly, yes \r\n\r\n00:19:35 BILAL \r\n. Isolation yes. But it’s the \r\n\r\n00:19:37 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Oh people, sometimes it comes as a gift, that I or I want all the spaces to be open, so okay, positive \r\n\r\n00:19:47 BILAL \r\nRoom by room, meaning it helps insulation inside the house, right? I mean, not only does he put up two walls from the outside, I mean, when the house is not open plan, I mean, yeah, a bit, I mean, the rooms or yeah, are closed off and isolated from each other, yeah, it helps so that the heat doesn’t get in from outside, and doesn’t get in the house and penetrate it all, yeah, no screwdriver. What? \r\n\r\n00:20:10 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Is it my job or that I take advantage of copying and pasting the spaces, like me? God willing, a square, I have to keep my two bedrooms inside, I mean, we insist on having two bedrooms inside, good, I, on the other hand, I mean, I narrow down the spaces of the rest \r\n\r\n00:20:27 BILAL \r\n. M. M \r\n\r\n00:20:29 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. I mean, I have to think about the distant future, meaning that I think about being self-sufficient. I don't always say that his house is 200 square meters, it needs two rooms. I have to follow this principle, yes \r\n\r\n00:20:39 BILAL \r\n. But I mean, there are many times, there are people who are not lazy, but they want something simple and they want something that they know how to do. So, we have something, something big that benefits Mosul. I mean, a map that is worth it? On the basis of the area of the Mosul house \r\n\r\n00:20:57 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. The normal one, I think that's exactly what they want, that in our future for investment, this one has two rooms that can be invested in, I'm getting out of one room, I mean it's more in demand in the market, \r\n\r\n00:21:11 BILAL \r\n. But you're encouraging this space to go to the rest of the \r\n\r\n00:21:14 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. I mean, I take from it, yes, morals, internal judiciary, internal garden, anything else that would be a family outlet, yes, I don't use it all for construction now, almost Mosul, after the 100 square meters and the 90 square meters and the 150 were cut off, I missed the gardens, the simplest thing is \r\n\r\n00:21:34 BILAL \r\nor there is, I mean, let's think about 150 square meters, I mean, this is a modest house, I mean, not big, not very small. There is a map in it that can make a garden. And what is the difference in the garden in terms of building greenery and the atmosphere? \r\n\r\n00:21:51 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. And here we come to the fact that I have an external garden that will be a much more external outlet, but I can create an internal environment that is similar to an oriental house, but enclosed, mm, mm \r\n\r\n00:22:03 BILAL \r\n. I mean, there is none. There is no, there is no wind that doesn't come through, but I mean, maybe the window above \r\n\r\n00:22:08 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Or it's possible exactly, or maybe the skylight is open, I can open it or close it, but this has costs, as I said \r\n\r\n00:22:15 BILAL . \r\nYes, yes, but do you expect, I mean, in general, this benefits the percentage of green buildings and the atmosphere, I mean? It's better to say, but, but for comfort, but for comfort \r\n\r\n00:22:29 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. As for lighting, natural lighting, I mean, you feel from the natural lighting and at the same time isolated, the space will feel like you have a soul in the space itself \r\n\r\n00:22:39 BILAL \r\n. Nice. It's nice that I imagine that, I see \r\n\r\n00:22:41 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nhouses or maybe the outside garden will not be directed at the neighbors, directed at any other person from the outside, as for the interior, it will be private for the family, which is similar to the eastern houses, and everything is directed inwards, yes, not outwards, yes \r\n\r\n00:22:54 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes. I think we should go back to it, I mean, from the map from the inside. If it is a garden, my little ones will take from each room, I mean 25 m, and I will make you 50 m, yes, something small, I mean at least benefit from it with lighting, I hear that some engineers talked to them, the small garden like this that has natural lighting, it naturally reduces, yes, germs, I mean, people who do not exercise get sick with the same \r\n\r\n00:23:24 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Ventilation There will always be a draft \r\n\r\n00:23:27 BILAL \r\nYes, ventilation is important, meaning it kills germs. So, some people don't think about it, I mean, you tell them, I mean, you get sick in the winter or summer, yes, or no, yes, okay, then think about it hahaha, this is not only an insulator, not only a comfort, not only will it reduce, I mean, the days that mean illness, God willing, I mean, definitely hahaha, there is no power or strength except with God, but I mean, God willing, this will be beneficial in this direction, so it will be more convincing. And I miss the corruption, our concern is with the building, I mean, from the outside, I mean, how, how? Do people judge other people? It's a big window, or I don't know what. What do you expect? \r\n\r\n00:24:07 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Up until now, we insist that the largest number of windows and the largest area will give beauty, right? On the other hand, our atmosphere may not provide this thing. \r\n\r\n00:24:19 BILAL \r\nSo we thought together, and I mean, Asaad, in my mind, I have an excellent map. 150, we offer a quarter of what equals the atmosphere of Mosul, and in it, yes, it will benefit the people, benefit the environment, benefit the economy, that is, cork on the walls, and a small garden, that is, the simplest thing, and the rest is up to the engineer. Okay, we will encourage these two things only, but the corruption outside and the windows, I still cannot imagine what you mean, what you are encouraging people to do, meaning smaller windows. \r\n\r\n00:24:48 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Depending on the situation, depending on the orientation, like we say the facade itself, the direction of the sun, during, if the facade is facing south from the sun, approximately, it does not leave it for 6 hours a day. This will provide a very hot atmosphere, meaning a lot of heat will enter, for me and my father, the smaller the window, I will gain more insulation \r\n\r\n00:25:11 BILAL \r\nThe window and. First of all, I mean the privacy of the prayer hall, I mean I don’t know why they put a big window and close the a to the cold, I mean hahaha, so let’s reduce the face \r\n\r\n00:25:23 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nIt is exactly that, it is a tradition, nothing more, the tradition that windows give spaciousness and beauty and more, but in areas, I mean, maybe in the bedrooms I don’t need a big window \r\n\r\n00:25:33 BILAL \r\nYes, I expect this window, the ah, the small one, for whom? For whom is it a small window, but natural light coming from the skylight from this small garden, yes, it is permissible? \r\n\r\n00:25:45 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. I mean, yes, the exterior faces the interior or provides an internal environment. It's their concern, no, the facade window is important to me, yes \r\n\r\n00:25:55 BILAL \r\n. Yes yes. Okay. Come on, I'm convinced that you'll build me a house. Hahaha, really, no really. I mean, these are the ideas that we're talking about now, yes, I expect that when people think about them, they'll be better for the client, I mean, not that they'll convince them because this is green building, and all the international institutions want \r\n\r\n00:26:20 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Building okay, but people don't always see the most expensive people. I always ask my cousin, my cousin, my uncle, my uncle, no, this is better, this is better, yes, tradition. But I'm the one who sets the principle that I'm the one who makes the plan, I'm convinced by it, I'm the owner of the house. I'm going to live in it. Yes, no one else will live in it, yes, even if he offers suggestions, this will depend on my needs, I will complete the plan, not my neighbors' needs, whether it is my uncle or my maternal uncle, it is more important \r\n\r\n00:26:44 BILAL \r\n. Training, this talk with the client, and even cares about what the color is, they think that it was their idea from the beginning. Hahaha yes, God willing \r\n\r\n00:26:52 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. God \r\n\r\n00:26:52 BILAL \r\n. But I don't know what the color is? Do you have? Any. Any experience in this field? I mean, how do you talk to people in what way? A style, not even eloquence, and one accepts \r\n\r\n00:27:03 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. By God, sometimes they are convinced, not according to the person himself. But like we say, I have been in this field for almost five years, I always deal directly with clients. Sometimes I succeed in convincing him, and our wife, yes, and the last thing, like we say, I take the advice, yes, whether he accepts it or not. \r\n\r\n00:27:21 BILAL \r\n. Yes, right, right. Yes, but I think it is necessary. We have to take all these points that people say no, but this is not strong, and we do the research and show them. We did the research, a reliable government, I don't know what, no, this is strong and it's worth a few hundred houses, all the houses, and they go and see it. This is something else. I liked that there is this bridal salon and the engineering company. Yes, go and visit it. It's there in the middle of the summer. See the difference. \r\n\r\n00:27:47 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. They rented the same, as you say, for its employees. Some employees, they live in the same atmosphere. \r\n\r\n00:27:54 BILAL \r\nM. It didn't open for any employees. What? \r\n\r\n00:27:57 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nI mean, for example, in the market, the employee is shameful. You go in for an hour and then leave. You could say that they provide a lot of cooling. Yes, I hope so. Cooling or something? No, I put it. No, actually, this served me, right? \r\n\r\n00:28:12 BILAL \r\nRight? So they should be the ones who, I mean, fill the subject. Yes, yes, it's nice. Do you know what's nice about this? Because when someone starts thinking about building a global green building, there are 1,000,000 ways, right? I mean, who... From the direction of the houses from the \r\n\r\n00:28:27 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nYou come in, you come in, as we say, we are years late compared to the rest, yes \r\n\r\n00:28:34 BILAL \r\n, but we have this, the, the, and we have the interior lighting and the way of touching the old Masawi building, which means there is a garden inside the house, even if it is small exactly, and this is maybe enough, I mean I want to do some research, I mean my science about this idea of the house that we invented now, you and I, small windows, lighting, a garden, 25 x 30 m, I don’t know what? And what is the difference between this in terms of consumption and the natural Masawi house? I mean, the one built on tradition? I mean, I want to do a simple search and see what the difference is between them in terms of consumption, comfort, and illness. I mean, all the details that \r\n\r\n00:29:20 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\ninclude details of, like when we say the family itself lives in this thing, or maybe it was like what are the hypotheses ? \r\n\r\n00:29:29 BILAL \r\nOkay, what happened when I came to your house? \r\n\r\n00:29:33 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. No, by God, currently I have this old \r\n\r\n00:29:35 BILAL \r\nYes, God willing, one day, I mean, yes, when will you have the opportunity? \r\n\r\n00:29:39 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Of course, God willing, fans of this segment, of course \r\n\r\n00:29:43 BILAL \r\nYes, yes, and I'm not sure if you understood the whole topic. We're not just trying to ride this training, I'm trying to find trainers, and this means a project with a fee, of course, and the idea is that we'll have a five-day training, and we'll look for people in the market who have the knowledge and experience, and who have this desire to share this idea, because it's not just us \r\n\r\n00:30:11 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. In his words, by God, I can't sign step by step, that I'm honestly committed now, I mean, especially during this period, I'm committed to working from approximately eight to seven \r\n\r\n00:30:21 BILAL \r\n. Okay, good \r\n\r\n00:30:22 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. So I don't know if I'll be able to agree with them or not \r\n\r\n00:30:27 BILAL \r\nOkay, good, but even so. But let me tell you that the next steps are completely honest, I mean I had fun and benefited and learned a lot, and you, in your method, made things clear, you didn’t complicate them, I mean I’m not an engineer or anything. Who is that? \r\n\r\n00:30:43 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\nNow exactly, I’m not dealing with the most important person at the top, so it has to be the same person, I mean if you talk about him, it’s like, for example, we say a customer who came to the company, right? \r\n\r\n00:30:52 BILAL \r\nI now have a desire to buy a house from you, so thank God I understood a lot and learned a lot, God willing. Training, and then he will come to. To Mosul, God willing, at 719720, so that we can invite all the teachers. The people who want. They will be trainers one day. Yes, we will suggest training to them, and we will see who has it, yes, the desire, yes, and who has the ability, and who wants it, I mean, how do we get feedback? Yes, yes, we will suggest training, we will get feedback, and this will be a one-day session on Monday, and then, I mean, after the month of 78, yes, we will see if there is ability, if you have it, you will be \r\n\r\n00:31:30 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. One of the trainers \r\n\r\n00:31:33 BILAL \r\n. What's coming? I mean? The second step is that I will organize all this information. I may share it with you on WhatsApp when I organize it, and we will see it in July, God willing \r\n\r\n00:31:46 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. We are honored to meet you. No. No, they did not know everything \r\n\r\n00:31:52 BILAL \r\n. I mean, I'm very proud of you and your way of thinking and how you've improved the way the company thinks, this means everything, and it's true that people change their mentality and do something that will ultimately increase them, so people like them must be present little by little to change the environment \r\n\r\n00:32:07 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. God willing exactly, if we try as we say in every way and by every means God willing \r\n\r\n00:32:15 BILAL \r\n. They buy it, they buy it from you and they don't buy it \r\n\r\n00:32:18 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. From. No. From. No, from the same. No, from if Mustafa enters and from Mosul itself, I mean, as we say, they took an agency, meaning it's forbidden \r\n\r\n00:32:29 BILAL \r\n. In Arabic. What do you mean? The prices of materials and all the things that you sell \r\n\r\n00:32:34 AYA NIZAR BASHEER \r\n. Exist, exist, the price of the piece, what? What would it cost to get there? No problem, okay, no problem, God willing, it's an honor to meet you, professor. Yeah yeah, I'll go listen, God willing, welcome. Bye."

Peace be upon you \r\n\r\n00:02:20 OMAR LAITH . \r\nMay the \r\n\r\npeace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you \r\n\r\n00:02:23 BILAL . How are you, God willing, I will forget about \r\nyou with goodness 00:02:26 OMAR LAITH . Hello, professor 00:02:28 BILAL . Welcome \r\n\r\n00:02:32 OMAR \r\nLAITH \r\n. \r\n\r\nWait a second, let me turn on the camera for \r\nyou too \r\n\r\n00:02:39 BILAL \r\n. Oh my God. How are you? How are you? Hello \r\n\r\n00:02:42 OMAR LAITH \r\n. May God bless you. May God bless you \r\n\r\n00:02:44 BILAL \r\n. So what's his name? I guess Abdullah who? S I mean, she made contact between us, right? Get to know Abdullah from Mosul Space \r\n\r\n00:02:54 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Right, right, he is the one who made the contact, he is the one who contacted me through what? His name? The connection became \r\n\r\n00:02:59 BILAL \r\n, great, great. But I want to see that I want you to know how much you know about liquid rice, I mean, he introduced you to the subject, he introduced you to me a little bit, but I want to know, I mean, did he tell you about the Beit project before, I mean, what do you know about the project? Even before we start, I mean? \r\n\r\n00:03:17 OMAR LAITH \r\nHonestly, he made me understand this point, I mean, let's say it very briefly, yeah, about the... yeah, what's the name of your project, which is training and application at the same time, you try to do both things at the same time, yeah, about the subject of green architecture and insulation and such, but I honestly brought up a simple subject, I mean, I modified it, yeah, something simple, yeah, yeah, I told him all the details you're going to talk about, they fall under green architecture, so it's not good for green architecture to be... So one part? \r\n\r\n00:03:47 BILAL \r\nHahaha. Isn't it that we have solar. And then we have the insulation and then a green building? No, it's all green, green, green, right? \r\n\r\n00:03:55 OMAR LAITH \r\nExactly, I mean, one of the points, for example, I told him one of the points, I told him I fulfilled the subject of insulation and solar and so on. Um, I told him the design itself, if the design inspires you to feel good, this is a green building, right? Come on, right, right, right, yeah yeah, I told her this point, and I told him you. I mean, what exactly are you trying to get to? I mean, where are you? What is the important point that you want? For example? Let's say you want to make it clear to the trainees? \r\n\r\n00:04:24 BILAL \r\nOkay? \r\n\r\n00:04:24 OMAR LAITH \r\n. On this basis, so that we know, will we explain the subject to them in general, and then come and tell them we will give you only three branches from him? Or do we keep explaining to them? We will not explain to them, let’s say for example ten branches and each branch has abbreviations, right? I don’t know, he said there is originally a curriculum with you, meaning you have prepared something for the training, frankly after he sent it to me \r\n\r\n00:04:48 BILAL \r\nOkay, okay. F. F. A? Let’s make everything clear and understandable and I am with you that it is all under the framework of green building. And I liked the way that you said, yes, anything that gives someone, meaning entering a building with a home and feeling comfortable, this is green building. The basis is that sometimes you think that two hundred years ago, all buildings were green buildings, that all people thought in this way, how can we build a place? That is compatible with our location and our environment without electricity and I don’t know what? So that when we enter our homes, do we feel comfortable? And I mean, there is... A hobby methods are important to us, privacy and I don’t know what else, so all of this means being, yes, green building with sustainability, and it was all destroyed and now we are starting the project, as you know, the A that I work with, my name is Bilal, and I studied engineering, but I mean I was doing electronics and robot programming and I don’t know what else, and then I got involved in training because I said I can go and solve a problem, a problem if I train their people to solve 1,000,000 problems, so I liked this idea, meaning training and I studied a master’s degree in training and now I want to help them organize their training and now I will give you the framework, the framework that, God willing, Mosul needs it, meaning rebuilding many houses and it needs anything, meaning they want to encourage new construction, why should we try? If we are going to build, let’s build better than before. So, let’s bring ideas, about green building and sustainability, I don’t know what even? The future of EE Egypt is to be a nice environment, and that’s it. The second goal is at the same level, not two levels, at the same level, which is that the youth need work, they need job opportunities. So let’s see this as a blasphemy. These are the houses that we will need to build, let them be, yes, there is space for job opportunities for the youth, who may have finished college now, they may be studying engineering, they may be studying architecture, architects, but so that they find work and we give them training, so that we can find them, like a match between where they are now, and they find work, and I mean, after simple training, this is the goal, but how is it not entirely clear? I mean, what is the training itself? How can we, in a short time, take someone and help him learn something that will enable him to enter the job market, and get this certificate or take the L, meaning the knowledge and ability that he learned and find opportunities, it is clear and simple, Soler, meaning that someone who can explain to you the location, see the sun and shade, and all these things, and do the calculations for you, he will tell you that this, meaning the cost of the people of destiny will return its money to you after five years, because it was saved by oil, and I don’t know what else, this is clear, very clear, 123, if someone can do this, there is a possibility that his job will be canceled, because the market wants it, right? Yes. And these people ask about this kind of talk and neighbors and I don’t know what, insulation is not all insulation, a little bit, there are things that we can do with insulation, and I am confused with people who work in insulation, they say that this is useful, meaning there is something if someone learns it and can sell it, I mean, but people are not convinced about the L, L, that they can insulate the walls. Yes, we are trying not only to build new buildings, to focus on the failure, its name is, we come to the house, and improve the any the the the \r\n\r\n00:08:38 OMAR LAITH \r\n. The situation, which is the situation \r\n\r\n00:08:39 BILAL \r\n, which from now on in the isolation, we are still searching, and I expect that we have a step by step plan, any steps, I mean, we will explain the training there, yes, but after that, yes, I mean, we will try to adjust it well, the isolation is accurate soon, but the yes and yes, the architects, yes, it is enough for me to talk to you about this subject to give you the framework, and I have a plan, I have an idea of how we can, I mean, train people to do something nice, but yes, I want to see if I told you that our goal is for people to learn something in six days, I mean, unfortunately, I will tell you that time is short for everything, but they are coming. I mean, educated graduates, yes, they have, I mean, if they are engineers, yes, architects, and we want to give them yes? \r\n\r\n00:09:31 OMAR LAITH \r\n. We are basically going to start \r\n\r\n00:09:32 BILAL \r\n. Clean, we guide them and we make them communicate with the job market, so the main result is that the people who enter the job market have this thinking that when someone enters the building they feel comfortable, not that they feel the solar energy or the insulation, this is not important, what is important is comfort, and I expect, as you say, the architects and engineers, these are the foundation that must have this awareness. And the thing that I want to expect, the most important thing that they will learn is how to be convincing? This? It is not that it is the techniques, and I don’t know what this is, it is already there \r\n\r\n00:10:10 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Simply, simply, simply, simply, we can explain at a certain point, that is, green architecture, and sustainable architecture, is it basically about preserving resources, or is it about preserving resources, okay, now, for example, within the labor market, we do not target, let's say the people with huge amounts of money, we are targeting the middle class and below. Because the person with huge amounts of money, for example, you say isolation, he tells you that he has no problem with having money, okay, here we are targeting those with limited money, yes, I have ten \r\n\r\n00:10:43 BILAL \r\n. Satellites and that's it. Hahaha, that's nice. Hahaha, that's nice \r\n\r\n00:10:48 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Exactly, exactly, the agent of this subject does not have a problem, but we are targeting those who limit them, let's say limited resources, yes, what are we here? Let's come, we have to understand the matter. Understanding time, my dear, that you have resources that you will start to spend during, for example, let's say the the the ah for example the heating or the cooling or the ventilation or the or the sun, you see even the the the for information and access I challenge with it on Ali in my office that I and in the houses that I implement, I tell them if the skylight is M or the the the the your little court inside the house, if its direction, let the sun in you automatically summer winter you will not get the flu, meaning you involuntarily cleansed if you cleansed the air inside the house from viruses, I told him and there is nothing in that, of course what did I do, did, did, did several examples for houses, I do not work. Previously, I ask the people of the. So I tell them I mean please believe the saying you are summer winter flu, he says to me true, how do you know? I tell them, \"What's your light?\" On the contrary, here you are. What are you doing? You play with the customer's feelings, so that he feels that I am giving you a value, but if you add it all up, it will give you a value and so on, right? You come like this, I don't know what time of the year, in the subject of \r\n\r\n00:12:16 BILAL \r\n. Thermal insulation, you know, the good thing about this is money, money, money, illness, yes, yes, it goes well with the upper class, they make everyone patient, they are patient, so the good thing is that this is convincing to all \r\n\r\n00:12:27 OMAR LAITH \r\n. people, this, this upper class, the upper class is a bit annoying in the process of understanding, you have to take a lower class for it, I mean another method in the film process is better, God willing, what do you say? The upper class tells him he will increase you? His Highness, he says to you, “EM, he is not a scholar, to save his money,” he says to you, “I have a lot of money, I have no problem,” yes, but I tell you, you are the middle class and the economic class, yes, you are here, for example, at the beginning, three years ago, four years ago, when thermal insulation first started to appear in Mosul and he started writing. I am one of the house owners, yes, I mean I implement it, I design and execute it, so I told them the project, I told them, “Dad, thermal insulation,” he wasn’t convinced, I told them, “Okay, I’ll give you something.” I will agree with the office that will implement the thermal insulation for me, if it drops 10 degrees Celsius, the difference between the inside and outside, you pay money, if it is less than ten, you don’t pay . \r\n\r\n00:13:24 BILAL \r\nA lot of money? \r\n\r\n00:13:26 OMAR LAITH \r\n. It is clear that we did not work. Yes, we gave him a week's time until he took, let's say high efficiency. We checked it, we dropped 17 degrees \r\n\r\n00:13:38 BILAL \r\n. Wow \r\n\r\n00:13:38 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Some people feel that he gained double, as if psychologically, it's the same money, it's the same amount he gave me. Yes. But what does he feel? He felt that he gained double, as if he is most of us \r\n\r\n00:13:49 BILAL \r\n. Yes, right, didn't we make a mistake, right? Right, right, right \r\n\r\n00:13:52 OMAR LAITH \r\n. He was convinced by the subject, so when we recorded videos and right, left, yes, and we started to tell the people of the houses, we come after to complete them. For the next year, we tell them, \"Dad, what is your summer and winter? What is its color? Mm? He tells me, \"By God, with the least amount of cooling, my affairs are fine?\" Mm, I tell him, \"If you implemented the subject.\" If you benefited from money, let's say private generators, money from the national grid, your devices didn't get tired because you have split systems, but the issue has become a matter of money lifespan like this. The point of the obstacle is the issue, because you are preserving the customer's resources, in colloquial terms, something we say is that you are preserving his pocket, yes, correct, yes, this is the idea, yes, yes, this is the idea, what is the green architecture, meaning green architecture, it is as much as possible that you preserve the resources used, yes, to the greatest extent possible, whether it is from the design, whether it is from ventilation, lighting, whether it is from electricity, whether it is from heating, cooling, whether it is from your psychology, you may not be living in Iraq \r\n\r\n00:14:56 BILAL \r\n. I live abroad, meaning my family, yes, meaning my father \r\n\r\n00:15:00 OMAR LAITH \r\nJamal Green, meaning it comes from where and it comes from the from the the the government buildings and commercial buildings, and so on, and I know? \r\n\r\n00:15:08 BILAL \r\nI know? \r\n\r\n00:15:09 OMAR LAITH \r\nPlaying, playing on this point, yes, sometimes, for example, for example, now if you see the Iraqi government departments, where are the clients? Standing outside in the sun? Um? Why? Because the building wasn't designed to receive clients, it was designed for employees only. So when the building is completed and its employees are waiting, he says, \"Okay, where do I put them? Where do I leave the clients? I'll open a window for them and leave them outside to fight.\" Although you are studying that this era receives whom? How many clients, for example, 100 people a day? \r\n\r\n00:15:46 BILAL \r\nWhere do they sit? \r\n\r\n00:15:48 OMAR LAITH \r\nExactly? So what do I do, for example? If I receive 100 people a day? I have to leave 125 chairs, I leave them in the sun, so that when they come, they are comfortable. If the time takes a long time, they are comfortable and oppose. \r\n\r\n00:15:59 BILAL \r\nWhere are you from? I mean, I think your point of view is completely different from the ordinary, why? I mean, I see most of the buildings in Mosul? They are simple, like a big window oven, a rock, thick in the sun, I mean, really just an oven, and people love it, and they brag about it, but why are you different from the rest of the engineers who do these projects? \r\n\r\n00:16:27 OMAR LAITH \r\nBecause, simply, I love all clients, and for your information, yesterday I was at a wedding of one of the homeowners three years ago, we completed her house, yesterday I was invited to his son's wedding \r\n\r\n00:16:38 BILAL \r\n. God willing \r\n\r\n00:16:38 OMAR LAITH \r\nI love you, clients are my friends, I always tell them in principle. As an engineer, you are a problem solver, you imagine or anticipate the problem in advance and then you move forward to change it before it comes, so you find a proactive solution? \r\n\r\n00:16:57 BILAL \r\nOr? \r\n\r\n00:16:57 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Don't leave the father of the house to the one who is, for example, the father of the house or. Or the owner of the house, or something like that. After a year, two years, 345, what? When he sees you? He says thank you. \r\n\r\n00:17:08 BILAL \r\n. Right. Right. Right. Right for whom? The Iraqi government, I mean, if the price of oil increases and it starts to become expensive, electricity will remain, thank you. You have to think about it for the future. Now people are doing the equation and saying it's simple, there's no difference. From $50 to $30 a month, I mean, a guest on the generators, no problem. What? $20, no, but later it changes \r\n\r\n. 00:17:31 OMAR LAITH \r\n. It's a summary, it's a summary, yes it's a summary, look, look, just let's talk about private generators, you pay a monthly subscription or you take into consideration the possibility of your cable coming from the private generator to your house being cut, or it needs maintenance in the event of an airport or a high-powered car, or. You're taking into account the possibility that the voltage isn't adjusted? Right? It will destroy your devices, so you buy, you will buy protection devices, or you will buy protection devices to protect your devices, and you are limited, or your needs are greater, but you are limited because the money is expensive \r\n\r\n00:18:08 BILAL \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n00:18:09 OMAR LAITH \r\n. I mean, you are the citizen, he actually knows this information, but we won't detail it \r\n\r\n00:18:16 BILAL \r\nin front of you. This is the job of an engineer, so I expect, I mean if I see you, I mean you have a hobby of information and your thinking is very nice, the way he thinks about people’s solutions, this is the right valve, yes, he thinks about life and living, not just the appearance sometimes, I mean, choice is a hobby, sometimes people choose it over a big window, I don’t know what, but someone has to say, no, brother, wait a moment, let us explain this to you, what does it mean? What does it mean? \r\n\r\n00:18:49 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Yes? Isn’t it? It’s not a problem, it’s originally, it means, except for let’s say, yes, the work of engineers, designers, yes, the culture of a society, but it’s difficult, especially in a city like Mosul, a conservative city for them, Mosul, it’s a stereotypical thing, a simple thing, you buy something and someone else buys something and someone else buys something, he starts comparing or starts comparing. This thing, did they do it before a thousand and a thousand people? He starts? He works on it? Yes \r\n\r\n00:19:23 BILAL \r\n. Yes, \r\n\r\n00:19:25 OMAR LAITH \r\nis sacrificing? \r\n\r\n00:19:26 BILAL \r\n. Now he tells you \r\n\r\n00:19:27 OMAR LAITH \r\n. He is sacrificing. The final rest is zero. \r\n\r\n00:19:30 BILAL \r\n. Yes, I will tell you my thinking so that the thousand and one can see where we are coming from so that we can reach the idea of sustainability, and give you my plan. So, how do we make the architects think about the sect differently? Without telling them, I don't like training. One says, \"Yes, the first thing in green construction is to look at the direction of the building towards the sun. The second thing in construction, I mean, I don't want to do that kind of thing, so we go and take them all and take them to the old city and let them take a stick and a pen and photograph things from the old houses, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, all the things that they used, the methods, the architecture, the construction, and they think about how people benefited from this mashrabiya and the wind tower, and I don't know what that means. Everything after that is there. If his father, we try, I mean, to see it and see how people benefited from it, green or sustainability. We talk about comfort, we talk about, these are things \r\n\r\n00:20:33 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Yes, excuse me. Excuse me, you'll call it the process of irritating the modern mind \r\n\r\n00:20:40 BILAL \r\nM. What does that mean? \r\n\r\n00:20:41 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Irritating the modern mind? Why? He will tell you? I mean, for example, as a new engineer and I don't know, let's say I'm entering the job market, and I understand the psychology of the world. Either he says to you, for example, if I come to explain to him, \"Dad, I will make ventilation for you like in the old city,\" or he will look at him with a look that says you are not suitable, you are not targeted. We cannot enter into anything, I mean a certain point. He said, we made a statistic, for example, 20 houses. These 20 houses, ten of them are facing the sun, and ten of them are facing the sun. How many of them got sick in summer and winter? And how many didn't get sick? So when we give this statistic, we go back and tell them, we tell them, this thing existed in the old city. Yes, you were like you were absent for a long time. Yes, and he took pictures for us. \r\n\r\n00:21:39 BILAL \r\n. Until he points out, until he is convinced. Yes. Yes. \r\n\r\n00:21:43 OMAR LAITH \r\nWe didn't work on anything new. All we brought, something a bit old that the Kurds erased, we arranged it in another way, and presented it to you simply, simply because now there is a problem, I mean the current problem is the subject of social media or does this make people? Umm Bat Noizi? \r\n\r\n00:22:05 BILAL \r\n. Umm. I mean \r\n\r\n00:22:06 OMAR LAITH \r\nThe nondescript is not not not classic, I mean there is no classic, yes, no arrangement? Is it a subject that is seen? \r\n\r\n00:22:12 BILAL \r\n. Nice picture, but it turned out it came from China, or from Mexico, or a place different from Mosul, it would fit the place but it's nice and salty, great video exactly, yes he wants this \r\n\r\n00:22:22 OMAR LAITH \r\nI don't tell them any movie with the design, or the design of some people in the houses, we want so-and-so. No, I know this talk that he says in his Kuwaiti series, Umm Shaif the house is a 2000 AD villa. On the ground floor, there are 14 sitting rooms. Bro, you are four people in a family. What do you mean? What is your capacity? 150 m? Bro, focus on simpler things. Where are you going? You? Where are you going? \r\n\r\n00:22:48 BILAL \r\n. Okay? I like your idea, but now I have to change the training idea because my sequence is that we go and see the old ones, we take all the methods, all the ones, I mean, how was the right one? We take the picture and the drawing and try to interpret it. I only give them the answers. We tell them why did you do this, why did they do this, you explain it, do the research, and then let's try to update, I mean the opposite direction that you did, how can we use modern materials like solar energy, why not? I mean, all the things we have are development, not contradiction. But how can we take the methods that we wanted to build with, and the usage, the local things, the right direction, the small window, the air that comes in, all the things that we learn from history, how do we modernize them? And then we give them like two stars, we give them 150 square feet? And you have four people, I mean, and we bring them, it's like the story of the coach, he's the person and you design him and he talks to him and he says, you, as a coach, you tell him, \"No, shhhh, what do I want?\" I mean, from the window, he comes and makes the window bigger for me, and you have to defend him and we do it like a play. Oh, and then in the end, to connect them to the job market, the first idea I had was to find the owners of the offices and ask them to give us, oh, I mean, how many cups do you have? Oh, if you have houses, they will design them now, give us the details of the place, the location, the size, the number of residents, all of that, and give them to the students, and then they come and you, when they do the, they study the past. They updated it, and then they took the principles, they took all the, I mean, the methods that they were using, they updated them and used them again. Oh, oh, I mean, to build this new house that they take from the. From offices and offices, they will see in the idea that the offices, that now, I mean, one of the reasons that we said in the beginning is that we find them job opportunities, if someone is clever, and the office sees him, and likes him, we don’t know what will happen, if something happens, something will happen that doesn’t contradict itself, I’ll talk and then I just do it, so it’s half game and half forget and. So, this was my training like this, it was the sequence, I want to see if you encouraged me with this sequence, if I try to turn it around like you turned it around in the beginning, yes, that I don’t have the research, this is the problem, I mean I liked the idea that we do 20-house research, all the details, but I have two things: I’m afraid that we won’t find all the traditional methods that they used in conversation. And I’m afraid that he, yes, won’t be able to do this research. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:25:36 OMAR LAITH \r\nYou are the problem, the problem, the problem is that it’s not all traditional things, is that true? \r\n\r\n00:25:40 BILAL \r\nImportant, yes. But the idea is that they, and the students themselves, must see it and come up with methods that are compatible and modernize it. \r\n\r\n00:25:52 OMAR LAITH \r\nIt depends, it depends here. On two points: your information and who was teaching you. \r\n\r\n00:25:57 BILAL \r\nM. \r\n\r\n00:25:59 OMAR LAITH \r\nNow in the new generation, from what I heard, teaching has changed radically from what we were, I mean, let's say I am an architect who graduated in 2012. In 2006, I entered the architecture department at the university. Our professors were almost like a military college . \r\n\r\n00:26:16 BILAL \r\nM. \r\n\r\n00:26:17 OMAR LAITH \r\nHahaha. Yes, there is something that tells you not to mess with people's lives. M. These are people's lives, this is money. People, don't play around with your mood, don't knock, I mean knock on an idea to satisfy your ego, yes, at the expense of the customer, you came, you deserve it, Mr. Bilal, he came and was okay and his topic is okay and so on, and I don't know what, he promised 2,000,000,000 Iraqi dinars and he tells you to spend it, this is one, we are talking about the limited who has limited resources, right? Right? What color? You give it to him? Do you know one of the points of green architecture M. It is the process of managing money and materials M. I mean, we do a survey where are you? The father of the house? Did you use so-and-so material, so-and-so material to build your house, from the decoration, I mean? You spent approximately, let's say ten 1,000,000 dinars, did you benefit from it? Benefited. Did you see a benefit from it? Or was it not possible that I should spend these ten 1,000,000 on your furniture, for example? And of course, the people of the houses I have at the beginning forgot to tell you that there is a hidden period of youth extension. I say that the furnishing is the furniture of a new house, so new furniture will come. You know, you know the cost of new furniture for a house at this hour and at this rate and so on. So it becomes Hanana, what did you do? You moved something that was asleep, not present, not present in his mind, this is part of the engineer’s personality, that he imposes it, my dear, there are things that benefit you or there are things that do not benefit you, or who they are in themselves, you always look at the customer, how much you provide for him, and in reality you do not provide for him, you mean, let’s say you classify things with other things, when they are more beneficial, what you provide for him and make him feel that you are providing for him, he feels like he is king, I will return it to you, how does he feel that he has defeated you, as if he has benefited double, a quarter \r\n\r\n00:28:19 BILAL \r\nI liked this idea that this is one of the basic methods, it is possible that it is not that I am in the beginning, it is possible, this is my idea that the good thing is that there is an identity that we maintain, we learn from the past, I mean all of this is an idea, but what you want to say is very important that we forget the ideas and focus on the person, we want to benefit a person, and sustainability benefits the person, truly benefits the person, it benefits him Now, and it will benefit him in the future. This is the whole idea of Islam. Benefiting. So, if this, if this, we will pass it on to the people. If we train them and at the same time, let them, I mean, we will narrate these things that you know, the direction of the building, the air coming from the sun, the radiation, the viruses, I don’t know what, and we will find a way that, I mean, I don’t know how we can find it. I don’t like to share hobby information. I do like research. They do research, they discuss, they do, I mean, they do lessons in their homes \r\n\r\n. \r\nI mean, there’s nothing in it, there’s nothing in it. This is very good. I mean, you and I could be here, and we have each one of us, we have five ideas. If we collect an idea from each student, the total will be maybe 100 ideas. But as a student, he is not able to classify it or name it correctly or use it correctly. So, we may take the information and tell him, “What you’re saying is correct, but it’s called such and such and such,” and your answer is correct. \r\n\r\n00:29:54 BILAL \r\nmeans he made a place that uses these methods that you’re talking about that you invented, but no, it’s just a joke and there’s a model and methods for it, and I don’t know what it’s called. I mean, I don’t know. Drinking and whatnot and it came out hahaha in the end. And then the best thing is they say, “The smartest one in the room.” Is the whole room full of good methods, right? So, saying “aaa,” means the best thing is if we can find “aaa,” meaning offices and find—I mean, I don’t know how we’ll do it. Maybe the story, I mean, we take it from the foam of the house, from all these things. I mean, it’s real, but one person in the class, I mean one of the students, takes the customer’s head, says, “I’m the one who’s going to be the customer, and I’m going to defend myself, my money, and my needs,” I mean, we give them, I mean, they name it. Does this guy have that much money, does he have the same amount of money as his wife's father? You always say that he spends a lot of money, I mean, he has to know everything to be able to put himself in the other person's shoes, right? \r\n\r\n00:30:56 OMAR LAITH \r\nAnd then? \r\n\r\n00:30:57 BILAL \r\nLet them focus on it, like you were saying, that we are not here because the idea of sustainability is nice, and international organizations are coming, saying this is a nice idea, make every Mosul green, no. Sustainability is nice, because as an engineer, you have to focus on benefiting the people in front of you, I mean this, this is the most important thing, but rather actions are based on intention, if you do it in an Instagram photo, if it's a picture of someone saying you built every green house in Mosul, I mean, the first one I don't know what, no, go think. Nice, nice. Go help people and come back. What are there things we can learn from the past? There are things we can learn from the current time, but I won't tell you the solutions. Go solve this person's problem, and look wherever you can to find the solution. But later, let's gather all the ideas on this wall. \r\n\r\n00:31:52 OMAR LAITH \r\n. With it. \r\n\r\n00:31:52 BILAL \r\n. What should we do? Put notes. Is it from the air? Should they put it on the air? Where is it from? Where is it on a building? We will work on a direction on the one of the most difficult things. You mentioned that a green house is nice, but a green neighborhood is better, because these are things that you can't do in a house by house. But I don't know how to solve this. I mean, I still don't know how everyone who comes and builds a house, doesn't build a neighborhood. This is a governmental matter. How can we read this? \r\n\r\n00:32:22 OMAR LAITH \r\nIrbid, this is Irbid, its topic. The issue of the state, the issue of culture, and the issue, for example, the state forces residential complexes. Of course, the science is there, it exists even for a single house, but in our nature, the Iraqis always have the issue of being against the government. So, what do we say? We mean we circumvent the law. And also, the talk, I mean, we increase construction and I don’t know what because of the small spaces. This is a purely economic issue, but. The high price per square meter made the spaces start to get smaller. So, the issue of creating a front garden is an issue. A problem. A very big problem. I mean, if you leave a garden like let’s say in the days before the garden, for example, the area of the land is 400 square meters, the building is 150 and 250 square meters, a garden and a nice garage, this is no longer this, this is no longer this, now in Baghdad, 400 square meters turns into eight. Eight houses? What kind of disaster is this? \r\n\r\n00:33:27 BILAL \r\nDisaster 400 on \r\n\r\n00:33:29 OMAR LAITH \r\n.50 m. And Dahariz, by God, by God \r\n\r\n00:33:34 BILAL \r\nI mean the mattress goes into the other room and I don't know what else? \r\n\r\n00:33:38 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Exactly exactly, we always tell it as a joke, he says that whoever stretches out the sleeping person stretches out in the hall, his leg sticks out of the window, there isn't, I mean the spaces are completely ridiculous, here in Mosul, no, thank God, we are still insisting that it is the smallest space in the new areas. Except for the old ones, there are 100m. In the old areas, there are 60m, 80m, and 70m, but they have multiple floors. If we start talking about their problems, I mean the multiplicity of the floors, the lack of privacy for sound, the lack of privacy for strangers. Of course, this will get to you now. If it gets to you in the principle of the old city and its problems, yes, you will basically interpret it as a model, yes, you will fail as a model, by God, by God. I mean, many studies have been done on it, but like I said, we take the good, crystallize it, arrange it, and take the new ones that we have, and we will show them for production. This is a good idea. Always keep in mind that, my dear student, you are the customer. You are the servant of God, you are not excepting the cost that you came to take, which is the shelf, the salary or something, no, no, you are always useful, even always, how do we say that it benefits you, as a reputation, or that it continued, or that it benefits the owner of the person, or the owner of the house, that he is comfortable, yes, Hassan Fathy, may God have mercy on him, Hassan Fathy is an architect, not an Egyptian, or the owner of the mud architecture school, or what is his problem, meaning? Convincing a person in 2025 that we live in a mud house is a problem, and the man in the eighties had this idea, what is it? He says, he says what? How? I mean that I make a person live inside a house. This is blasphemy, blasphemy for which he will be punished, I will be held accountable for it before the Lord of the Worlds, how did he hold himself responsible? Why? Because you are the owner of information like a doctor, I mean, a doctor, you go in for an operation, and this patient needs so-and-so, and imagine that the doctor is moody, I don't do anything hahaha, he doesn't need this talk, as long as you are the owner of information, then the information must be applied in the best possible way, even if it is of course involuntarily useful and beneficial in several aspects, yeah yeah, always keep in mind don't let the issue of money be in front of you, it's everything, but money will come to you, it will come to you. But sometimes it comes with complications, if you are positive, your work is positive, things will continue, but if your experience is a failure, go and get this information. Mosul, no matter how big it is, it is a small city with a bad reputation, if it has a bad reputation it spreads \r\n\r\n00:36:23 BILAL \r\nYeah, huh? \r\n\r\n00:36:25 OMAR LAITH \r\nQuick, I mean, now I have information about engineers, they have some points like that, I don't know them or have seen them, or their news, it reached me, hahahaha, and I don't know where they live. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:36:36 BILAL \r\n. No mail hahaha. What's the story? Yes \r\n\r\n00:36:39 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Hahaha. This city has an arch system. It's something magical \r\n\r\n00:36:44 BILAL \r\n. Yes, and it means that if someone invites you to a wedding, is it his money, his son's money? It's clear, that's it. This goal isn't just the money, the goal is that after all these years, hahaha. The people you built houses for, are they going to invite you to a wedding? What's this? You know, your success means reputation, and it means you did the job right, and if you do the job right, more work will come to you, God willing \r\n\r\n00:37:08 OMAR LAITH \r\n. God, exactly, yes, so you understand here, my dear, if the profession of a doctor is humanitarian, then you are the father of humanity, because you serve societies. The doctor treats a person and you treat a society \r\n\r\n00:37:22 BILAL \r\n. Right. Right \r\n\r\n00:37:25 OMAR LAITH \r\n. This is a summary. What? I told you? An engineer is a proactive process, discovering the problem and treating it before it happens. Yes \r\n\r\n00:37:32 BILAL \r\nI was going to focus on the money, how can someone talk to the customer and convince him of this? Why don't you use this method? I mean money. Money. The green building method, because it has a benefit. You might pay a little more for insulation, but after a few years you get your money back, and I don't know what else, but yes I liked the idea. Your idea is that you let him. You think for him, you say, you know, no, no, no, build this because he forgot the furniture. And what else? I mean you think, so he sees, you and him in the thinking, not you trying to convince him financially \r\n\r\n00:38:12 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Another theory, no no, it is the construction process, for example, the owner of the land or the owner of the house, for example, said to you, I want to build such-and-such a job, or such-and-such, I mean let's say a simple detail in the house, either you know it wrong or you know it wrong, but you cannot tell him wrong, it cannot be, it cannot be, no customer, customer, it is always the same, M. So she doesn't tell you. She says, no, your words are nice and wonderful, fine, but unfortunately we will lose so-and-so. And so-and-so. And so-and-so. Here, what did you return? You stimulated dormant points in her brain, she didn't calculate, she will say to you, why will we lose her? I tell her, it's not like this, after a certain period it will happen, and this one, after a certain period it will become this, so are we good? Why don't we replace her with so-and-so. What do you think? Yes, for your information and information, she has tried this and that, and here you are? I mean, look at this one, she is messing with his ego, do you know what arrogance is? Why? Because in Mosul, of course, I will give a lot of points for the city of Mosul. \r\n\r\n00:39:11 BILAL \r\n. Yes, it's not important. Important. \r\n\r\n00:39:12 OMAR LAITH \r\n. This yes, yes, what is it in Mosul? They always have competition among themselves? Why? Is it a family issue? Families by families, so what does the issue of competition among them mean? If he does something good, fine, at home, he doesn't like to be pointed out, but if he does something bad, yes, yes, and this is it. Go ask your mother, Sedqi Abdullah Kabir. Hahaha, a lot, and negative. If he does something bad, yes. He tries to implicate others, even in the future. He is not to be blamed. When you tell him it's not your fault, he tells you it's not you, they're wrong. You used an explanation, I swear to God. I want to tell you, it's a difficult society. We don't talk, for example. Like what, Erbil, Kurdistan is nice for them. Development \r\n\r\n. 00:40:04 BILAL \r\nAll of them? \r\n\r\n00:40:04 OMAR LAITH \r\nConviction, they have the conviction of the simple Kurdish citizen, no matter how simple, even if he was a shepherd, but he is convinced that you, as an engineer or a doctor, understand? \r\n\r\n00:40:15 BILAL \r\n. M \r\n\r\n00:40:15 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Wrong. Right. He knows you understand. M Abu al. Abu Baghdad faces, because the subject is about chaos, chaos, so the subject is difficult, the. The. The. Let's say the. The. That you set standards and understand, there are people who understand, there are people who don't understand, there are such and such M. Mosul is a cultured city, but according to my mood, Umm. You need to know, you have to know which stereotype you are working with, and the evidence for this is if you come to conduct a survey, if you come to conduct a survey. After the. Let's say after 2003, after 2003, after the Americans entered Iraq, who worked in Kurdistan, the vast majority are engineers from Mosul. Yes, and cadres from Mosul are what? Mosul is unlucky. At work, he doesn't have certain standards, he doesn't accept losing them, he rarely loses them. We, he feels his nature, we feel he was raised well, we feel this is the stereotype he produces in Baghdad. Now, currently, there is this hotel that hosted the Arab Summit, which I think is a hotel called something around the world, I forgot its name, by God. I am one of the cadres from the health center group, they worked there from Mosul, from Mosul, I will work there. When I asked him, he said, how many cadres from Mosul did he work there? Because does that mean that Baghdad doesn't have cadres or not, of course, hahaha. Okay, why did they use them? Because they know they are good at work and they have standards at work? Yes, this is this, this is this point. So, how do you reach a city with this nature ? \r\n\r\n00:41:56 BILAL \r\nThis is a good idea. Okay, so you know a hobby that is deeper than mine? And oh, I mean, if you were going to answer the question, which is, if you tried to answer it, you have people who are graduates, designers, architects, they have studies, but they may not be working as a hobby, and you have six days with them and you want them to connect between helping and learning something new about green building, sustainability, and history, and you may forget all of this and you call it people benefiting. In short, at the same time they find job opportunities. If this means that when they graduate from this project, it will be easier for them to find work, so I told you the idea that we start by doing this awareness, they go looking, or we plant the seed for them, the idea is that you are there like a doctor who wants a house, and if you are with him, he will solve his problem, and we must learn from the past and from the present time and find out their useful methods and update them, and now we have, this is a house of 150, I don’t know what? All the information, and then we communicate with the labor market during the... We invite all the offices to do it, I mean, chickens, each one is long, I mean 5/5, 4/5, I mean, you know theirs, I mean, they give them whatever you say, I mean, not a judge, not a judge. They want. I mean, like the Olympics, what do they call them? \r\n\r\n00:43:28 OMAR LAITH \r\nYes, exactly, it's a competition to reach certain points, you collect points in the games, the Olympics, which are several games in one game. Like this, you follow, I think, its name, you follow maybe? \r\n\r\n00:43:41 BILAL \r\nThis, this. This model and that's it, I don't know the details, and I don't know if you, I mean, if you have six days with the guys and you want them to find work, I mean, green job opportunities, what do you do with the architects and engineers and tea? 00:43:56 \r\n\r\nOMAR LAITH \r\n. Frankly, I didn't know it was six days. Now I found out from you, unfortunately. \r\n\r\n00:44:00 BILAL \r\n. Unfortunately, this is what we have. If you tell me we need more, there is a possibility that we can defend and go and resist with them. And we tell them no, we need ten or 15. But what if it was less? Hahaha I don't know. But the goal is that we find them job opportunities, and they learn something that will strengthen their interviews, so that they can be more, meaning there is a possibility of a green job opportunity. \r\n\r\n00:44:24 OMAR LAITH \r\nSimply put, these six days we have to define a problem. What do you want it to define for you? It is necessary every day. I mean, how many hours approximately in one day? \r\n\r\n00:44:32 BILAL \r\n. Five means two, nine, three, shish. \r\n\r\n00:44:38 OMAR LAITH \r\n. You ask people. I mean, do you know how? I mean, it is necessary. You have to specify one topic every day with all its details, and they will be bored, meaning that I will talk about something, I. I mean, it's like water soup for me, but it's one day, one day you give him a huge amount, a huge amount of the and the and. I mean, I'm telling you this, right? You give him, you give him a benefit, the first benefit, and if you give him what is the mother, this \r\n\r\n00:45:13 BILAL \r\nThe engineers and architects. This. This is their job. I mean, in college, is this their job? \r\n\r\n00:45:19 OMAR LAITH \r\n. No, no, no, not always, not always, not always, not always. I might train in Barcelona. Sometimes the engineer is moody, you have to teach him not to be moody. You control the mood of the interviewer, not my mood. Mother, here it is, this is the the the the the the paragraph or the point, yes, this is the job, you have six days, you have to have a topic every day, every day a topic, for example, the client's psychology, how do I deal with him? How do you convince him? Yes, how do you control his money so that you try to provide him with as much as possible? What are the benefits that he will get, for example, solar from the yes, from using materials, yes, the yes, the always, always, everyone from the page, yes, that means that the owner of the house should not be from your own page, but it is all, it is all poured into your comfort, of course, yes, yes, it is your idea, but do not try to make sure that this is my idea, I want to force you to do it, by God, I thought of it last night and I felt that if you do it, it would be better for you, honestly, I did not present the idea, but my love for you as the owner of the house, I said, by God, if I received it, it is the same idea, you all apply it to 50 houses \r\n\r\n00:46:32 BILAL \r\nis the a, what is this color of cooperation, meaning you deal with the customer, yes, it pulls thousands, but it has to come from true love, it is important that he is an authority, you have to love people, hahaha, what is this that you do? With this, Shaddad? \r\n\r\n00:46:47 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Marketing Marketing E. If you always love the customer, you must love the customer for his benefit. No, of course, of course you are talking about things that are really missing in many, in many offices, I mean we are talking about the reality of many offices, there are many offices that target the upper class, which we have not had any relationship with until now, nor have we spoken with them on any point \r\n\r\n00:47:07 BILAL \r\n. It does not matter, I mean, the majority are not upper class, the majority are in the middle, so it does not matter that you work with the majority \r\n\r\n00:47:13 OMAR LAITH \r\nExactly, exactly, exactly, I mean, this is the point that. That you are trying, like every day, a topic. Honestly, I do not. I do not think, I mean, it is on my mind, it is just, I mean, what is the color of the simple giving, five? \r\n\r\n00:47:24 BILAL \r\nHa, yes, no, if you have something, then \r\n\r\n00:47:28 OMAR LAITH \r\nI didn't think of a specific question, because for example, you know what to give, what to leave, this, this, this, this, this, this, my \r\n\r\n00:47:36 BILAL, \r\nthis is a concern, sir, I didn't have in mind, so if I try, I mean, if I ask you a question so that I can see what's on your mind so that I can get the information, and try to put it together in a nice way, and then I can give you \r\n\r\n00:47:46 OMAR LAITH \r\ninformation, yes, at one time, no problem \r\n\r\n00:47:48 BILAL \r\n. What? I have a list here, I wrote all the information and I'm like, like you, yeah I want to think about the people who are coming as students and they will spend time with me and get tired and travel, and I don't know what, and I want to benefit them, how can I benefit them as best I can with the information that will benefit them in the job market, they need to work in Mosul, they need new ideas, they need the environment, I mean the community sees the idea of green building, it's not an idea coming from outside, but it comes with their benefit and this means how can the mentality change in this who tried to work in this framework. It's David, the people, you will benefit the people hahaha. And I do the information. I will organize it and I can show it to you. It was a model of five or six days, and you can dissect a voice note and say wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, now. You will come up with a billion new ideas. Hahaha and I'm trying to take it and I'm going again, this is my job, which is the design. But I said \r\n\r\n00:48:46 OMAR LAITH \r\n. In the picture, yes, so that it's in the picture, I mean, I say to you, thank you, if you left, I mean, the horizon of the speech that I said. Leave them in E, F, Preparing Note, or F, meaning, a specific, several subjects, several points, several notes that you leave in, and we try to develop them, but in my opinion, it's always better, the best teaching is the T and Spontaneous, L, LM, meaning without, without, without, without putting, without putting F, oh, father, today we will read 1234, yes, you put a big frame and go \r\n\r\n00:49:17 BILAL \r\n. And with them \r\n\r\n00:49:18 OMAR LAITH , \r\na big frame, you want to chat, yes, you start to chat and you start to wonder. You start to wonder so-and-so. What do you think of it? You? Tell me your opinion, can we put points or write them on the board? Should we come back later? What are the negatives and positives? This point? You are here to motivate so that there is no, I mean, what do we say is it a duty for these two hours, I come and go, or? No, is he using his mind, is that good? I told you that I am with you. The owners of the green information originally, we reached out to him, we want, he thinks as if the customer said to him, what do you think, should I put white ceramic tiles or ceramic tiles? Green? Good? He does not object to this question before it is asked? \r\n\r\n00:49:57 BILAL \r\n. It is necessary for him to be new \r\n\r\n00:49:58 OMAR LAITH \r\nWhat will he answer? What will he answer? So, for example? What should I tell him? Should I tell him who answers whom? Who has the power? The answer, by God, answer me, you are so-and-so. Is it possible? You are like this, it will happen, there will be a process, I mean a discussion between them, and they will start, no will, you want to present the useful points and matters, you want to ascend, yes \r\n\r\n00:50:19 BILAL \r\nand I liked the idea that we have a table like I said so that when the information ascends we take it and enter it into a table so that it is organized, I mean the ideas may come out to be 1,000,000 ideas, but later we can schedule them and know the a, the a, the, I mean. All the principles of green houses that come out of K during a long discussion, we don’t specify them at the beginning, but during the speech, if we want to focus on the benefit of the person, we will bring them out from the ideas, they will come out, and then we do this, I mean we do it, it’s great, great, exactly yes, you are a trainer, you have done trainings before, it’s clear, I mean you have experience \r\n\r\n00:50:58 OMAR LAITH \r\nYes \r\n\r\n00:50:59 BILAL \r\nWhat, how much, what? How much do you know? I mean, the most on, I mean, topics? And what, how much training? \r\n\r\n00:51:04 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Frankly, on our software, our software has done training, I mean on AutoCAD in general, and for your information, a trainer is a trainer, I mean they are not trained engineers, I mean uneducated, ungraduated groups, for example, blacksmiths, yes, blacksmiths, for example, the father of the subject of doors and windows, this decoration in how to arrange, it needs like using AutoCAD is good, these, for example, are trained from clothes, yes, frankly, if you see me, I am not white, yes, I am not white. Huh? Why? Because I am always in the sun in the sites, I try to give them what courses, but let's say a small thing for the workers, my dear, if you do you will in any case do so-and-so, if you do so-and-so, and so-and-so, dot, the father of the house, if you network, he will admire you, he will overlook a mistake, he may cry that you fall \r\n\r\n00:51:55 BILAL \r\n. There is yes. Yes \r\n\r\n00:51:56 OMAR LAITH \r\nand. And the topic was fixed at the time, but these are the third neck. Let's give it a try when I was in Turkey during the ISIS assassination of Mosul, and I enrolled in a course. A language course for a month, and I learned the simple stuff, and I started to develop myself in the language, of course now it started to go away because I have it. So I enrolled in another course in marketing. The problem was that our professor had a master's degree in marketing, but Turkey doesn't like anything in Arabic or English. Okay, we're Arabs, right? Okay, you're talking about an advanced science, okay? How will I communicate? She didn't ask permission because we don't have it, I told her, oh God, for the greatest benefit, don't study marketing, she said, \"Player TA,\" meaning of course in simple language, I told her I'm going to teach them Turkish, but we don't know them, yes, in my training for three weeks, I trained them, yes, by God, praise be to God, they benefited and I strengthened them. Right, you will benefit more from the lesson. If the information was presented twice, you will practice yes yes. So on this basis, I mean, I got it, by God. So I told you, I have things, but it's good, official. Yes, you have official matters with organizations and such. I don't have them. No, I mean, I didn't enter a single organization, but one worked after the liberation of Mosul. Yes, I worked in, I mean, with these colors within a private sector spare parts company, yes, in the process of removing the rubble and the effects, the war, the corpses, and the explosives. So that was it. May God help you. A very bad experience, scary. Yes, for three months, I mean. Yes, of course. Of course, in and of itself. This is how we trained the workers on how to deal with safety. May God have mercy on him. Welcome, professor. Take it easy. In the sun, yeah, relax, it's how the workers deal with, for example, explosives, with their dealings with people, yeah, because people just came out of war, or their dealings with this, with that, this is how you gain experience, yeah, from repeating the subject once, twice, three times, but I told you as an official subject for me to give \r\n\r\n00:54:15 BILAL \r\nIntelligence, no, but it's good, I mean, God willing, so in this project that we're working on, I'm taking all this information, I'm going to try to organize it, it's a nice way. And if we're looking for people to come for training, in the end, I'll come in July about Mosul, and I'm going to present the training that I arranged during these meetings with you and with, I mean, other valvers and engineers. We're going to search through them. Whoever wants to be a trainer, let them take the information. Let them organize it in their own way. It will be in my form, but they take the framework and the same, the, the plans, but they do it their way, because they have their own methods, the ways they like, meaning they give information. If they give Y, Y, they put the session A, and then Y, meaning they work with Mosul Space and Abdullah to organize the time for them, money, training money, and this training, meaning there is a fee for it, God willing, and it will be, meaning any experience is better than your first experience with the institutions, God willing, a little bit nicer and you learn, and young people, go and see the old buildings and you find the nicer updated ones that suit the site, and God willing you will benefit and learn, and. And certainly, during our short time together, I changed my mindset, and I started to notice, I mean, this yes yes, I mean, sometimes one idea changes everything, you don’t need more, the idea that we are doctors, I mean, like an engineer, if he forgets that he is an engineer and comes to do and learn in order to benefit, then the whole thing changes, and I finished my work, maybe in one day this one piece of information, and if someone has Google and comes and I don’t know what, he can do research on his own, and I mean, he thinks and honestly tries to solve a problem, we don’t need to go to sustainability and delve deeper and learn, and I don’t know what knowledge exists, but no no no the desire for one to learn in order to benefit the other must be there, so there is a possibility that we do a one-day session to give this information, and you and I goodbye, we’ll take out our money, let’s go drink tea hahaha, we let the students go and study on their own for six days, really? Ok, sister Iman, we can tell you again what the plan is, what color it will be, and I benefited from our time together and I will send you the information for when I want to install it over the days, and what is the idea so you can review it, and see if you have one and you want to be one of the trainers, there is a possibility that we will see you in July in our session where I will suggest the topic and we will confirm and talk about it, God willing. \r\n\r\n00:56:49 OMAR LAITH \r\n. God? I mean, ahead with you. Why didn’t you make this call and such ? \r\n\r\n00:56:54 BILAL \r\n. Good, God willing, good. God willing \r\n\r\n00:56:55 OMAR LAITH \r\nAs long as there is benefit, benefit for the people and the engineers, why not? \r\n\r\n00:56:59 BILAL \r\n. On the contrary, God willing, God willing, and yes, I mean yes, the plan is beneficial to the engineers and through them to the people and the country, and God willing, it helps them, as we said, to find work because someone without work is depressed and has problems, so we start by solving the problems of hobby dishes at the same time . \r\n\r\n00:57:21 OMAR LAITH \r\n. This is sustainability in itself, sustainability, preventing problems, its burden is work, this is sustainability? \r\n\r\n00:57:27 BILAL \r\nAlso, right? Right? Of course, God willing, thank you, thank you for everything. Yes, I was happy and of course, yes, I feel that I will send it to you if I have, yes, a question is permissible. Yes, how is your house? Who designed it? Did you design your house? \r\n\r\n00:57:43 OMAR LAITH \r\nI still don’t live in my parents’ house? \r\n\r\n00:57:48 BILAL \r\n. But one day I want to see it. Yes , \r\n\r\n00:57:51 OMAR LAITH \r\n. It’s easy. I have a garden, but a simple garden, but you will see that they care about it, or that we grow more plants in the oxygen mode, and only oxygen. This is the only point that I have applied. I mean, an old house, \r\n\r\n00:58:03 BILAL, \r\nyes, yes, I don’t know, they are young and have a hobby in it, yes, yes. I mean, I remember stories about my father, he used to tell me about their garden in Baghdad. As for the trees, the types of trees, yes, it means a paradise, approximately. As for him to tell me that it has ten trees, types of fruits, yes, from \r\n\r\n00:58:27 OMAR LAITH \r\nfour \r\n\r\n00:58:27 BILAL \r\npalm trees, pomegranates, and nomi, nomi, and what are these? \r\n\r\n00:58:35 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Yes, this was difficult before. Right? What did I tell you? The land was distributed as 400 m and 600 m. The house is small. And the rest was a huge garden. Yes, in the subject \r\n\r\n00:58:43 BILAL \r\n. The atmosphere was nice and different. No, yes, \r\n\r\n00:58:46 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Yes, but don't be like the mothers of the people, no, there was, and this is the rate of pollution, no, there was this subject, the letters \r\n\r\n00:58:53 BILAL \r\n. Let's see, we \r\n\r\n00:58:54 OMAR LAITH \r\n. Exactly, here we are, one of the professors is saying. He says there is no split, because the split itself is pollution. Any split itself is pollution. It is gaseous exactly \r\n\r\n00:59:04 BILAL \r\n. Yes, I mean, I learned a hobby from, I mean, things that I never thought about, that the asphalt breaks more when it is used? I mean, if it is busy for a period of time, I mean, consumption, this is one of the costs that I never thought about, like how someone, I mean, talks to a customer and tells him every time he works, one day it will not work, I mean, it will shorten its lifespan. So, not only that, I mean, there are a lot of ideas that I learned from you today, and I benefited from it, and thank you for everything, and I will see you when you come, God willing, to Mosul. We will drink tea and sit in the trees. See you \r\n\r\n00:59:45 OMAR LAITH \r\n. You will probably enlighten us, God willing \r\n\r\n00:59:47 BILAL \r\n. Thank you, thank you. Peace and God's mercy be upon you."

At the appropriate time, give me information about your project, which is a house that supports renewable energy, and is a green house, meaning that no chemicals are used in it, and it is friendly to nature, and it is thermally insulated with natural materials, let's say, and it has solar energy. This is the idea that I know about the project \r\n\r\n00:01:47 BILAL \r\nOkay, good, and you know Mosul, right? \r\n\r\n00:01:53 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nExcuse me? \r\n\r\n00:01:55 BILAL \r\nDo you know them, guys? \r\n\r\n00:01:58 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nYes, yes. Yes, I know them. The guys, thank God, are rich, you know? \r\n\r\n00:02:03 BILAL \r\nThe best people. Abdullah \r\n\r\n00:02:05 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. May God keep you safe. Every \r\n\r\n00:02:07 BILAL \r\nthere is very, very clean, oh good, let me start from the beginning, and give a framework and objectives for our call at home \r\n\r\n00:02:16 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. She \r\n\r\n00:02:16 BILAL \r\n. I mean, she came with support from the United Nations through an entity called ITC, I don't know if you've heard of her, and they want to do two things, or several things at the same time, they want to create job opportunities. Are there young people, right? No. No. \r\n\r\n00:02:32 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nThey don't have jobs, right? \r\n\r\n00:02:33 BILAL \r\n. They find work and houses that need to be rebuilt and houses that they consume, meaning energy is a hobby and they mean they want to combine the people who are looking for work and new job opportunities in building and re-building, meaning the construction of houses towards sustainability, meaning green houses, so these two things come together, and if I am now and one of the things, I will tell you about myself, but just a little bit about the short story, I mean an engineer from the beginning, but then I sat down and I had an idea, I said if I go to engineering and solve a problem, problem, problem, problem, maybe in my life I will solve 100 problems, but if I find a hundred people and teach them to solve a thousand problems now \r\n\r\n00:03:30 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. A thousand \r\n\r\n00:03:30 BILAL \r\n. Problem. From the engineering to training, it's something that happened right now that I'm doing training, this is my training organization, I mean, the first side is solar energy, and I expect that's what we'll fill in today, God willing, and the second side is the bachelor's side, and the third is architecture, the engineering side with the construction side. Okay, now, okay, the question will be this, where is this guy from? Where is his language from? It's a bit strange, strange, and I'll apologize for it. Peace be upon you, I'm an Iraqi-American born in America. My parents went out to study and they started to stay in wars, hahaha, so I grew up in America \r\n\r\n00:04:16 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. So \r\n\r\n00:04:17 BILAL \r\n. So if you have any problem, sometimes you go in English and come back in Arabic, but tell me as much as I can stay in Arabic \r\n\r\n00:04:23 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Now, okay, if \r\n\r\n00:04:25 BILAL \r\n. Do you have any problem with my speech, huh? Help me, help me hahaha, God willing \r\n\r\n00:04:30 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Your speech is very clear, I mean \r\n\r\n00:04:31 BILAL \r\n. Okay, good, good, now we've reached the framework. The framework is that we're looking for job opportunities, and we're doing these, you know, the training for young people so they learn things so they can find job opportunities that will help the environment in Mosul by rebuilding houses and building green houses. And my thing is if we're looking for people who can help us, it's arranging the training. I have an idea. I have six days and it's arranged. Yes, I can tell you about it. We'll do it after a while. The second thing is that we find trainers. So now we've reached the call, and this is our framework, and I want to think that when I want to talk to you, I want to try to get your opinions and ideas about the training. How do you conduct training? What do you think about the training that I attend? And if you're ready and encouraged to be part of us with the trainees, these are three questions in general. So I'm trying to explain this call, God willing. So if you can explain a little bit about yourself \r\n\r\n00:05:42 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Excuse me, Professor \r\n\r\n00:05:43 BILAL \r\nBut if you want to just explain a little about yourself, what is it? Yes, yes, studying? \r\n\r\n00:05:51 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nLet me tell you about myself, okay? I am Muthanna Al-Mashhadani, a civil engineer, yes, from Mosul, of course, born in 1990. I work in the field, excuse me? Is this what you are calling, okay? I work in the job field, at the university, the Northern Technical University, in the Construction and Projects Department, and I also have a secondary job as the owner of the Al-Hadaf Office for Thermal Insulation and Water Insulation, and Engineering Solutions, no \r\n\r\n00:06:28 BILAL \r\nGod willing, can I ask you about all the inspections, I mean can I ask you about the solar energy insulation and the engineering, I mean the three of them? \r\n\r\n00:06:37 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nOn my head, on my head? \r\n\r\n00:06:39 BILAL \r\nGod willing. Yes \r\n\r\n00:06:41 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Yes, yes, actually, what happened to me, Professor, I think Saleh \r\n\r\n00:06:51 BILAL \r\n. And with us at ITC \r\n\r\n00:06:54 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Yes. Yes, he came to me and said that we have an idea to give a lecture or a training course on thermal insulation in general and not specifically, okay, so I explained because I have no problem, I can prepare a lecture, something, I mean simple awareness about thermal insulation or maybe training and I am even ready for any compensation, I mean the thing that we are doing is humanitarian \r\n\r\n00:07:24 BILAL \r\nNo, no, this is so that I understand you. This is God willing. When the project reaches the implementation stage, it will be when we find the trainers. Sure, there will be a fee, God willing. It will be done, but I am not sure the number and quantity, and for how many hours. \r\n\r\n00:07:43 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Very normal. Very normal. I mean, I like to serve, but I even got the idea of those who visited me. I told them I am in service. This is my city, and I like to serve my city, and I serve the engineers of my city without any hassle. I know that. My experience may be little, but this little bit can add up, God willing . \r\n\r\n00:08:02 BILAL \r\nGod willing, God willing. Have you given any training before? You? \r\n\r\n00:08:08 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Honestly? Honestly, no, I have not given any training before, but it is the nature of our work in the company. Sometimes, customers come who need awareness about thermal insulation, so I sit and talk to them from beginning to end about a specific product. I mean, honestly, the product that I make is a product that I will make a frying pan for. But we are talking about this in Mosul Space, God willing. If it happens, we will talk in general and not specifically, God willing. I mean, okay, maybe I have the ability, even if I haven't tried it, but I will definitely get the ability. It's a difficult thing. God willing, I will be \r\n\r\n00:08:41 BILAL \r\n. This is part of my job, that I help people to make not only the training materials, and we prepare these materials, but how do they present the training? What kind of questions do they ask? \r\n\r\n00:08:53 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nColor, meaning you will also be the assistant who helps me with this thing, yes \r\n\r\n00:08:57 BILAL \r\nGod willing, yes this is my job, don't worry, I have been here for ten years and I really love training \r\n\r\n00:09:02 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. God willing \r\n\r\n00:09:02 BILAL \r\nThe best thing. You will see, God willing, in it. A nice pleasure when you feel that you have become a part of someone's life. He started with you. And then maybe after that he found job opportunities. If he developed himself in the way, yes, then you have taken training in something in your life, right? \r\n\r\n00:09:21 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nWhat training did he take? I mean, training to start burning Mosul, about humanitarian activities and cooperation, and Musa, how do we preserve it and things like that? Things, I mean, frankly, general things, I mean, it was for the youth of Mosul, yes. \r\n\r\n00:09:39 BILAL \r\nOkay, so, if you remember, we had a goal for the training, and I want to know what your opinion is if we did the training? Something in general about the, about the insulator? If it will benefit them to find work, I mean, there are gains to appointing people who have this experience and knowledge, and it is better for us to do the training, maybe we give them the framework. The insulator, but then we give them things, I mean, practical and pragmatic, I mean, they can go and apply it, so we remain in general, if we try to let them choose something and learn it, yes, application, \r\n\r\n00:10:25 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Ok, yes, sir, yes, frankly, as an engineer, as an applied engineer, yes, frankly, yes, he cannot apply it with his hands, I mean, this is not an engineer’s job, this will be a technical job or a job, yes, yes, we call it masters, you know, the engineer will not benefit from the work method, I mean, right now, there are some materials, yes, they are for nothing, I mean, an engineer cannot work with his hands, I mean, the engineer can provide the staff, he can teach the staff theoretically about the materials, prepare the work environment for them, it is possible but as training, I mean, with his hands, he uses, no, he cannot do this thing \r\n\r\n00:11:03 BILAL \r\n. After these differences, because this. See, we work with solar panels, the engineer must know how to install them, because he must go and see and supervise the workers to make sure, is this correct? This is correct, but there is a clear difference here. With the insulator, it is not the same, yes \r\n\r\n00:11:24 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. It is very necessary that he sees with his own eyes how the method is. I mean, he will have a theoretical aspect and yes, the practical aspect will be with the family. He will follow up with the family. He might make a wrong move, or he might, for example, make an excessive mistake or make it too little. This is a ratio and proportion. There are, for example, times when materials are mixed, for example, this text, this is complete, I mean, to the end of the offspring, meaning the middle one for work and the technician does not have this idea. \r\n\r\n00:11:59 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes. \r\n\r\n00:11:59 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. There is, like \r\n\r\n00:12:00 BILAL \r\n. A little bit of this and that's it. \r\n\r\n00:12:01 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Exactly, there are two to three, yes, these are two to three. He does not know how to come up with it. So, if he needs a little bit, what does the ratio come out to be? So, the presence of an engineer there is necessary for this follow-up first. And what is the role of the engineer? Now, you mentioned when you said I train ten and the ten train, let's say ten, right, the same situation when I train engineers, whatever the number, let's call them ten engineers. This engineer will have a course and will give awareness to the client who will make it. The engineer will give awareness, he will say to him I advise you to use thermal insulation, why? Its advantages are this, its disadvantages are that, its positives are this, its negatives are that, I mean these details, so he will be, I told you I will give to the engineer and the engineer in the course will have an office, for example, in the future he will develop himself and the office will be that he will do, I mean, advertising for thermal insulation, not advertising, but rather, I mean, pitying, but rather awareness advertising. \r\n\r\n00:12:58 BILAL \r\nThis is one of them. The things I was hearing, I mean, if I had a few meetings with a lot of people, one of the things people would tell me is that if you're looking for job opportunities, don't look for insulation because there aren't any. People don't ask about insulation. They build houses without insulation and there isn't enough awareness about what's right or wrong. What's the size of the market? Money, money, work for one? Is there something called an insulation engineer? If so, what is an engineer? \r\n\r\n00:13:31 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. The civil engineer in general is the one who wants to build quickly. In general, let's say \r\n\r\n00:13:39 BILAL \r\n. Does he take notes? \r\n\r\n00:13:45 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. The engineer quickly doesn't bring me the house, so the role of the engineer is to advise first. He advises on what will benefit the homeowner, for example, you insulate your house properly, you save on electricity, you live in a comfortable environment, right? And in the mood, you keep natural materials in the house, not chemical and carcinogenic materials or materials affected by the sun or anything like that, I mean, this is the job of the civil engineer, frankly, but the insulation engineer specializes in places. This might go to the mechanics, the mechanical engineer, the insulation work, and the need for these things, but now we were talking about the green house, we are saying that here the role of the civil engineer, when he builds a house, he advises the client and says to him I must advise you to do so-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so, there is such-and-such material, this material has disadvantages, this material has disadvantages, this material has disadvantages, yes, these are advantages, these are advantages, this is fine, he starts, brother, Rohit is better. Yes, Anis, your mother, the engineer Adel to your mother \r\n\r\n00:14:43 BILAL \r\nthat yes, this means God forbid, with people who work with insulation, and if they say that it is very difficult, they are convincing. So a big part of the training will be on the conviction that as a civil engineer you are a character, oh how will you be able to convince the client? You? You have an office, right? You must be working in this field enough to know the method well? And what is convincing, and what is not, can you help me understand, I mean, tell me, did you convince someone or what if you couldn’t? \r\n\r\n00:15:19 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nHow does he work? I mean, persuasion before anything else, Iranian, what should I say, persuasion in the beginning is not a method of persuasion, the first thing is success from God, this is the first thing, this is the first thing, then there comes a person, when he says that what I have, I say that conviction comes from, I mean, I don’t know, maybe I will go in a different way, I mean \r\n\r\n00:15:44 BILAL \r\n. Because we have to separate ourselves, I mean, explain the subject \r\n\r\n00:15:48 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Exactly, right until \r\n\r\n00:15:49 BILAL \r\n. Training \r\n\r\n00:15:49 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. I mean, the convincing person, the convincing person, the first thing he should do is his face. Oh, a little bit, it's not like this, evil, and go do a repeat or no, no, the first thing every year should be, I mean, yes, the person should first gain the trust of the interviewer completely with credibility, even this person, what does he say in the interviews to convince him, yes, yes . \r\n\r\n00:16:13 BILAL \r\n. I am clear from you, I talk to you, and this person is cultured, I mean, from your face, your methods are honest, I mean. \r\n\r\n00:16:24 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. To begin with, relax \r\n\r\n00:16:25 BILAL \r\n. And with you only. Hahaha \r\n\r\n00:16:26 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. My love. My love, professor, I swear. Yes, yes, I am honored by you, my dear professor. Yes, if a customer comes to a certain office, and he comes to request or ask about thermal insulation, if he just asks, should I let him take the insulation? Does he take the insulation? I mean, he comes to ask, should I let him take the insulation? How? First thing? The citizen here is looking for the cost? Okay? So what do I do? First thing? Oh, who is talking about the cost? I do not answer him. I do not answer the books. I answer him by saying, let me tell you about the specifications of the material, let me tell you about its benefits, what are they? Or leave it for its future, what are they in the future? What are its benefits? Okay? Then I tell him the cost, that if I give features, I compare it to you like a car, I say this car has such and such specifications, such and such specifications, okay. Then I tell him the price, here the price will not be expensive, it will be cheap, why? Because of those specifications. When a customer comes to me and says he wants an insulating material, I tell him $15, that's it. The discussion is over and we can go with our money, but I want to give the results of the material. What is its production? And its warranty? What is it? Here, the warranty is very important. I mean, it played a strong role \r\n\r\n00:17:42 BILAL \r\n. Last thing on \r\n\r\n00:17:43 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. The card \r\n\r\n00:17:45 BILAL \r\n. Okay, on the material \r\n\r\n00:17:48 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Ha, here, the warranty. Sometimes, if you leave the material on the wall, if it is misused, it can fall, frankly. Because its adhesion is not strong, why? Is there misuse of the subject? Why? I told you, I mentioned that the engineer is present on-site exactly, because he follows up on these matters. Sometimes he comes to apply the material on dirt, dust, or something like that. You know, the story is concerned with the salary of these matters, frankly. He wants to spend time on things that are not included in wages. So here is the role of the engineers, here lies the role of the engineer, which is to follow up on the work. So the guarantee that you provide is that during the follow-up with the engineer, as part of the follow-up, you tell him I will follow up with you on the situation. If there is no defect, I will tell you that this is a defect that is not within the guarantee. If not \r\n\r\n00:18:45 BILAL \r\n. Yes, what do we return it to you? Yes, yes, so there is a little more confidence. Yes \r\n\r\n00:18:55 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. In addition, there is something very basic here, specific to the Mosul community. Maybe you are from Mosul, I don't know, or from a different governorate \r\n\r\n00:19:03 BILAL \r\n. No \r\n\r\n00:19:05 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. No, yes, originally \r\n\r\n00:19:06 BILAL \r\nHow many times? Yes? \r\n\r\n00:19:08 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. On my head, yes, let's say there as a community, we are currently talking about Mosul, we are talking about training within the framework of Mosul in Mosul, you can tell the person, if you want to make sure, ask so-and-so who made his house this way, yes, how did you find out? Yes, he has no problem going to my mother and telling her, I asked so-and-so, an engineer, and he advised me to work with the insulating material, is it okay and efficient? Here the answer will be with the person, of course I will tell her yes, it is efficient, I advise you to work with it, here she has complete confidence. Very good, because yes, theoretically he knew the material, and practically he saw that there is experience, there is tangible experience \r\n\r\n00:19:46 BILAL \r\nThere are experiences? \r\n\r\n00:19:47 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nPeople, I mean? \r\n\r\n00:19:48 BILAL \r\nI heard. I don't know why insulation is rarely used in Mosul. Someone told me a story. He was with an architect. If someone says he built a house for $100,000, and he was encouraged to put insulation on the roof for $2,000, and he said no, he said no, it's okay. I mean, we don't need it. Why should we put any insulation? And I don't know what to get rid of. Who. Who? \r\n\r\n00:20:13 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Do you know what? My dear professor? Regarding. With your permission, just a second, professor. Excuse me, what do I get after receiving letters of redemption? What, professor, regarding insulation in Mosul? It's become a struggle, a hobby until we started to transfer a certain part from the engineering offices or contractors, why do we call them? Electricity in general inside Mosul. You know, the electricity system can sleep or you've heard of it as a meter clock, right? And you get an electricity bill, you're not obligated to pay this bill here, how are you obligated to pay it? I mean, legally you're obligated to pay it, this is the state, right? Here, citizen. No, no, no, so I can explain the situation to you. I know people who, when their electricity bill comes, don't pay it. I know how they don't pay it. They postpone it, they postpone it for two months, a year. They might postpone it and I sell the house with them. He sells the house, the taxes on these bills end up being paid, so they consider the electricity free. My dear sir, the citizen here considers the electricity free. Doesn't he consider it something from the state? Am I one of the people here in the area who are my neighbors? So he pays it of course because he turns off the electricity. What am I, sir? Here in the area, I know visitors who say I don't pay a penny for electricity. Electricity is free anyway. It's supposed to be that I don't have to pay it, and I don't have to. This mentality exists in most households, right? Especially the elderly. Ok, so today I am the one who gives the specifications of the insulator, and I tell the person that this insulator benefits you in terms of mood, saving electricity, he will say that electricity is free. Basically, if electricity was in European countries like ours here in Mosul, yes yes, I mean on the A, recharging cards, you know this thing, of course yes yes, I mean let's say now, residential complexes, I have a residence in Erbil, or the residential complex, when I go to the complex I buy a card, credit, I mean recharging the electricity, so here I am keen to save. Turn off this asphalt work. This is a heart. Turn off this heart, right? Because here it will be a material matter \r\n\r\n00:22:41 BILAL \r\nYes, this will Y Y, I mean? It will complicate matters, what is the satisfaction if we tell them that I mean every year what did you pay for electricity? Huh? I mean 100 dollars a month, 50 dollars a month, I don't know what? No. But we can't say that anymore. It's difficult in Mosul. F F Ah, it is possible that things will change in Iraq, and this will change the price of ah, oil will increase, ah, the government wants to change with ah \r\n\r\n00:23:10 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nEverything is on the rise, everything is on the rise, okay, here in Mosul when \r\n\r\n00:23:18 BILAL \r\nyou pay for electricity, yeah, what do you do, arrange your affairs okay, I mean build a house and put insulation on it hahaha roof \r\n\r\n00:23:28 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. So when you say there is an insulator that will save you electricity, he will tell you that my electricity is crazy, leave it, leave ten splitters, I have no problem, but if electricity becomes a compulsory payment, so that if you do not pay money, there will be no electricity, the whole focus will be on solar energy, and the whole focus will be on thermal insulation \r\n\r\n00:23:47 BILAL \r\nRight? \r\n\r\n00:23:48 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Right. But fine, just the temperature \r\n\r\n00:23:50 BILAL \r\nThis will change now, what do I see? This is possible in Erbil, right. But in Mosul, what will happen? \r\n\r\n00:23:56 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Right? Right? I mean, in the long run, not in the near term, in the distant future, this could happen if \r\n\r\n00:24:02 BILAL \r\n. God willing, God willing, God willing \r\n\r\n00:24:03 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. God, professor, can I ask you a question? Excuse me, yes. What is the material that will be about thermal insulators that I can bring from here? If you have a special curriculum, just give me a lecture \r\n\r\n00:24:16 BILAL \r\nI have it. I have a curriculum, but the curriculum is from people like you. How much can I learn? \r\n\r\n00:24:21 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Very good, very good, even \r\n\r\n00:24:23 BILAL \r\n. I mean, it will be strong, but I'm not a specialist here, but my specialty is to take the information and organize it, so it will be a curriculum, yours, I will, I mean, if you want to give me an idea, if you had six days, tell me, you had six days, what would you do? Day 123456? What would you do? It's good for people and I'll take notes \r\n\r\n00:24:44 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. A. If you allow me, my dear professor, yes, here you go, as an idea, an awareness idea about thermal insulation, six days is a hobby, honestly, M. I mean, if you give the material in an awareness-raising way, six days is a hobby, but if you give the material in a very in-depth way, you might need a week or five days. I mean, as I understood, the material is more about awareness than getting into the details of a hobby, I mean, the intricate details \r\n\r\n00:25:13 BILAL \r\nIs it awareness-raising or? Deep, don't think like this, we think, we want to do training that produces work, so people fall behind, they work, so tell me, awareness-raising, or deep, or you, I mean, what do we have a goal for, and we have six days, what do you do with the insulator? \r\n\r\n00:25:33 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nIf it's six days, then we have to go a little bit into the details of the work more, or even when the engineer goes to monitor the work, the engineer so that he has an idea when he goes to monitor, but he knows what are the weak points that he needs to focus on. Okay, so what will it be if it's six days? \r\n\r\n00:25:53 BILAL \r\nOkay, I was joking, and another person who works with insulation said that I need to explain something else to you. We will mostly work on existing houses, not new houses. Maybe we can start with information on new houses, but existing houses. He told me that whoever worked on the roof, the roof, they have to remove the existing ones and add new ones, and the cost is very high, and it will be difficult for people. So let's focus on the walls and the windows and the... to say it in Arabic, does that mean right? To make sure that the wind doesn't get into the houses? \r\n\r\n00:26:29 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nYes, right? Right? \r\n\r\n00:26:30 BILAL \r\nThere is no difference between the two things, I mean, the brains of different things in the idea that we started with, which is to give a framework. In general, heat, heat, how does it get in? How does it get into the wood? What is the difference between them? What does it mean? What does determination mean? It means something, if someone is a good engineer, but fast because he is an engineer, we don't need to go into detail about it. He passes its schools from the beginning, but we give him all the things, we give him the methods, the superficial ones, we give him the other methods. But we focus on the practical ones. The first half is that you go and talk to someone about how to convince him. Hahaha, how do you talk to him? How do you have this nice face and sweet words? How do you start with the benefits and not focus on the high money? How do you talk about changing prices, the oil for generators, and how? One of the things that you expect us to be able to focus on is that the insulator is not only him, I mean, if he has electricity, don't put the no, I mean, there are rooms that people know about in the summer, and the no, the no, it's not refreshing. So if someone has a two-story house, it becomes a one-story house, so we provide you with a second floor for the whole house because it was covered with insulation. So, all these convincing things, we collect them, and these are the first three days. What are you convincing? How do people fill in methods, I mean, buying and selling and I don’t know what? What is insulation, how does it work? Physics? What are the materials? What are they? The places that one can work in, walls, roofs, windows, is that something else? \r\n\r\n00:28:09 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. I mean, I forgot, \r\n\r\n00:28:11 BILAL \r\n, is there anything else? \r\n\r\n00:28:12 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. No, no, no, everything, your information is good \r\n\r\n00:28:14 BILAL \r\n. Right, just three things because if we work in houses, yes, they exist \r\n\r\n00:28:20 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. And we are trying \r\n\r\n00:28:20 BILAL \r\nto improve the insulation ratio. We will focus on the walls, the walls, the walls, the walls, and I don't care. So, what do you call this? The one who puts the artist on the wall, the plastering material, the plastering material, I mean, this is what his condition is on the plastering material, the insulating material, the material that there are certain companies that make mixes that are useful for insulation, and we will focus on the installation. This is permissible now. You want to talk, I thought that let me invite an artist and bring a wall that comes, I mean any wall, I mean \r\n\r\n00:29:01 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. We can build \r\n\r\n00:29:02 BILAL \r\n. We build a wall \r\n\r\n00:29:02 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Existing. Existing, existing \r\n\r\n00:29:06 BILAL \r\nThe education is not that they are the ones who do the work, but their job is to supervise the work and know you \r\n\r\n00:29:13 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. They see with their own eyes what is happening \r\n\r\n00:29:15 BILAL \r\nWhat color will it be? And what color? Is it necessary that you know what is good? Tell me all the wrong things that you can export and do, so that even they can notice them? \r\n\r\n00:29:27 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nWhat can they do? \r\n\r\n00:29:27 BILAL \r\nWhose mistake happens? One works with an artist? Or he puts the scum on the wall, what is the matter with him? \r\n\r\n00:29:34 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. The problems, the problems that always happen again here are that it is the mixer that mixes the material with the mixer, there is a certain speed or a certain time on the cities of the mixer, so the group has a routine that works, it's done, here it is, you have to stick to the time and not rush the story, he likes to rush to get more work done so that he runs out of time, and he goes home more on time, meaning these things need a bit of patience, meaning I know how any other thing, let him say the problem is eternal, I always suffer from it either with the data, the sheet of the materials available, he says this material when you work with it in the mixer or leave it for two minutes. The lines do not wait, finish the material that I chose, my love, it does not happen, he said it needs a bit, but you wait, is there patience in the matter, no I am busy, I have to go to another house, and so on, this is what always happens, meaning I know how or washing. Washing the walls before work, for example, or sweeping them before work, you know, take care of each other. You're on a construction site, there's dust and air everywhere. There has to be cleaning before this comes, before applying the material, while it doesn't go, no my dear, you have to have engineering steps. Here, I told you, the role of the engineer, here the role of the engineer is to follow this routine that is completed by the foreman, the engineer follows him \r\n\r\n00:31:03 BILAL \r\n. So we have to let them study. I like training when we give them information, we tell them go out, this artist is going to make three problems, who is going to find them? Who is he going to find them, so we let him go quickly, so he doesn't hit, it's enough to let him, I mean he doesn't wait, enough time, maybe two minutes, he waits just a minute \r\n\r\n00:31:26 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nIt's possible. It's possible, as a suggestion from Professor M, it's possible on these available days that we choose a specific day after they have taken the information, M, like you said. He goes home and reads it the next day, for example. The next day is simple. Simple for the attendees, meaning here there will not be a lecture, but an awareness raising session where they are just starving for a specific topic, so one question, two questions, what do you think? What are the negatives in the data? What? The answers in the data or the mistakes that you need to advise even if it is not like this? \r\n\r\n00:32:03 BILAL \r\n. It's good, I mean I think it's beneficial for everyone, it's beneficial for everyone. For the user \r\n\r\n00:32:12 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nOr as you mentioned, what are the mistakes that the student falls into? What should he do or what should he not do through the second thing, of course, for example, what should be, yes, for a period of 1/5 minute to 7 minutes, yes, you leave the material after engaging for 2 to 4 minutes, I mean, I understand now, my dear, this is a good thing, maybe it will happen \r\n\r\n00:32:37 BILAL \r\n. Sweet, hey, it's like a reading test, it's a data sheet, not like a book, not like Instagram, meaning someone has to focus on it to understand it. \r\n\r\n00:32:48 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Of course. Of course, of course. \r\n\r\n00:32:49 BILAL \r\n. Yes, this is. This is a day. An important day. And I mean, what do I mean? Always remember the goal. We think about the goal now. They passed. A picture. A general form. \r\n\r\n00:33:01 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Then \r\n\r\n00:33:02 BILAL \r\n. They went into detail about all the details, where they can work in the house, roofs, windows, walls, and I said, we chose the walls and we will do a practical and theoretical application with it, and an artist, and we will build them a wall, and they will read the data, something, you know, what we can do, we will give them yes, yes, maybe 34, okay. Everyone has to read them, they all choose the one they will use, this is the first test, there is a possibility that this is what I imagine that I do not know, you know better than me, I do not know how many subjects, there are, either one is better or one is not better, so what is there? If we want four subjects and that's it, one will work Tic Tac Tac, give me names and details. Okay, what is its name? Esterbol? Okay, yes, cork \r\n\r\n00:34:00 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Can you leave the cork because they know it as cork, right? Maybe the building unit which is brick. Right, brick, insulating materials, and plaster material. Plaster material is a plaster material. Let's call it yes. Okay, yes, and do you have the a? Glass wool \r\n\r\n00:34:27 BILAL \r\n. Glass surfaces \r\n\r\n00:34:30 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nGlass wool, corrugated board, or maybe rock wool as well. They are both heat insulators. Now this is a new topic. Yes, okay? \r\n\r\n00:34:42 BILAL \r\nThis is good, but now you want me to think? If we're going to focus on the remaining materials, where are they useful? Why aren't they useful in this? This existing home area that we want to insulate? \r\n\r\n00:34:57 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Here it will stay. It's either high or low, so from here it will choose in addition to the. I mean, today I want to insulate. But I don't have money, so I'll just insulate. Can I choose cork? That's it? I do have the ability today. I like to do it. Yes, it's not him. Look at the four brands. Exactly, the four brands depend on price, quality, and durability. And the insulation efficiency \r\n\r\n00:35:49 BILAL \r\n. Yes \r\n\r\n00:35:50 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nIt's cheap and its insulation is excellent. But it doesn't last. It's permanent and the insulation is excellent, but it's expensive. Do you know what that means here? \r\n\r\n00:36:04 BILAL \r\nBenefit, so this means that this material insulates well and is cheap, but it doesn't last. Where, where, where is its correct use? \r\n\r\n00:36:12 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nYes, this could be the facade cork. If you see that there is cork on the facades, it makes the decor nice and tidy and everything, and it's very elegant and its insulation is excellent, but it doesn't last for a year or three. It starts to open and hurts, and if there is a specific joint, it likes to collect insects. Okay, maybe birds get inside sometimes and scratch it? Aha, these are its disadvantages, but it looks nice. Yes, and Costa means its cost is okay, suitable. \r\n\r\n00:36:44 BILAL \r\n. Yes, F. F. \r\n\r\n00:36:45 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Hey, one of the \r\n\r\n00:36:46 BILAL \r\n, what does he expect? It will last, I mean, maybe he wants to replace it after two years. I mean, it's decorative, I mean, he can replace it. He can replace it, so let it be something that isn't expensive. And he's determined to use it? \r\n\r\n00:36:57 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Exactly, exactly. Is it possible that the plaster materials are possible? It's beautiful, with additional decorative materials, so it's beautiful and durable, because let's say it lasts for ten to 15 years, and its insulation is very efficient, but there it will be high, yes. \r\n\r\n00:37:19 BILAL \r\nIt is on. Is the plaster or not? \r\n\r\n00:37:21 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Roughly, this is the highest quality material available. \r\n\r\n00:37:26 BILAL \r\n. These are people, this is a very important one, they know all the things, and we leave them alone, they say, where is this? Where is this used? Where is this used? So, yes, we have \r\n\r\n00:37:35 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. It's good. \r\n\r\n00:37:37 BILAL \r\nThe durability of it is with us, the price, and what third thing do we have? \r\n\r\n00:37:42 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nThe efficiency and the insulation percentage? \r\n\r\n00:37:44 BILAL \r\nYes, yes, the efficiency and the insulation percentage are good, so we have four. Yes, so yes, we give them materials that they have a difference in all of these Wednesdays, and they have to choose, yes, one, yes, so yes, one, regarding the houses of the yes, the yes, the in Mosul, which will benefit the one that you sell them, right? You know the people who put it in, what is it? What is it that is disturbing to the people? And what does it have the most, I mean, the cheapest and most interactive, I mean, regarding the lack of use and things that are cheaper, yes, even people take us to encourage \r\n\r\n00:38:25 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nHere, we have in Mosul three layers of living standards, yes. The lowest class, let's say the lowest, or we don't want to say the term \"accessible,\" I mean, it is not right to say the term \"low,\" the lowest class, the poor lowest class, we call it, or the lowest class, they can use cork. And even on the roofs, they can leave it on the bottom with tiles and so on. Because it is cheap. And he is convinced that this is an insulator, it has a very low percentage of insulation, but he is convinced that this technician is an insulator, that's it, I mean there are some closed minds, so you can't educate them more after that, M. You have the class, the, the, the, the capable class, the fully capable class, now we will come to the middle class, also from the first thing the capable class uses the highly efficient material, and the important question \r\n\r\n00:39:17 BILAL \r\n. Yes, the stupid \r\n\r\n00:39:18 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nwhy is he capable? I mean, after that, yes, exactly, exactly, you have the middle class, yes, the middle class can be divided into two parts, excuse me? \r\n\r\n00:39:31 BILAL \r\n. This. This is the majority of people who have arrived are in the middle \r\n\r\n00:39:34 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Ah, here the middle class in Mosul is divided into two parts. One part, we call it as a term, “Yetada’e” I don’t know if you understand this term or not, no \r\n\r\n00:39:45 BILAL \r\n. I don’t hear “Yetada’e” \r\n\r\n00:39:47 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Don’t you understand Mustafa? The middle class, my professor, in Mosul, yes, there are those who are cowardly or say that I am afraid, for example, I don’t take out a loan or anything, I will go towards the cheap. Yes, I am afraid of this in the middle class. No, he says that I have done and done. Let me go into debt, or take a loan period from the government or take something, or take installments. Jordan has the installments that are available now in the market and it goes towards the expensive. I mean. I mean, we have a main division, right? And the middle part is somewhere in between. Ee. Ee. Ee. Half here. Yes, depending on the audacity here, yes there is an offspring \r\n\r\n00:40:29 BILAL \r\nhere, conviction, and it is true that there is a possibility that the thing that will benefit him the most is the mind. I mean, the long view is expensive because it is sustainable and it means that it has little energy, so it will be cheaper for him, I mean, honestly, it will be cheaper for him in the end, so that he is convinced that it will be cheap. Someone must tell him that it is not just cheap, I mean, how much do you pay for your health, I mean, like \r\n\r\n00:40:53 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. She says \r\n\r\n00:40:54 BILAL \r\n, there are things in it, I mean, it is endemic. This is something, I mean, if someone thinks about it, right? It is expensive, hahaha, someone will get sick, \r\n\r\n00:41:03 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Right? Yes, my dear professor, there is a very important point, I will mention it now, in training or awareness, but that this material is expensive. The insulation percentage is not strong, right? But it is a relatively expensive material, right? Let's call this material by numbers. This material gives me an insulation percentage of 90%, right? Right? It's expensive \r\n\r\n00:41:29 BILAL \r\n. Um \r\n\r\n00:41:44 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. You need the end of the layer, you need 99 things. You need to use it nine times to reach a percentage of 90, \r\n\r\nright? \r\n\r\n00:41:54 BILAL . Right? \r\n00:41:55 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Right, these are ten, these are 90, you have to use them nine times, right? For example, this one costs one dinar, and this one costs five dinars. This price is to equal this insulation. This one should be priced at one dinar and this one should be priced at five dinars. Come on \r\n\r\n00:42:15 BILAL \r\n. What should happen? Should I go buy a layer of eggs and see the prices? There is one with 10 and one with 12. When we go and see it with 10 and see the price is cheap, it's great, but we don't see it as a matter of eggs. We see that this is the cheapest one, so we have to help people. They see that they are paying not only for the device, it's the same if the material they want to pay for its efficiency, its ability to be an insulator, in the price for the insulation. We don't put the price on the good materials. \r\n\r\n00:42:46 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Your words are the insulation percentage \r\n\r\n. 00:42:47 BILAL \r\n. I mean, it's not one, but 11. They have to know how to compare this, right? Right. Right. Right, right. This. \r\n\r\n00:42:54 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. The role here is the engineer's, frankly. I mean, this is one of the methods of persuasion, yes. \r\n\r\n00:43:01 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes. \r\n\r\n00:43:02 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. It is. It's me, when I convince him, I tell him that even if you get this insulation, you have to use this nine times, and use this one once, right? This one? You use it once, its price is low, but if you use this one nine times, it will be very expensive, right \r\n\r\n00:43:14 BILAL \r\n. And not only that, but you think about it, if this needs to be replaced every two years and you have ten years, right? So, then you will buy it five times, that is something you buy \r\n\r\n00:43:26 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Once \r\n\r\n00:43:27 BILAL \r\n. So A. Right, discount it by five. So all of this has to be done in a manner, money, money, money, sale \r\n\r\n00:43:33 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Exactly, exactly \r\n\r\n00:43:34 BILAL \r\nI really liked this website and the training method, that people read these data sheets for everyone, and they deliver these awareness messages, and maybe the same thing as what you did now, people need to think, is this one or maybe from the middle ground? If someone has everything, I mean, does he neglect every penny, I mean, does he leave a penny, and how will we deal with them? And with these people, what does it mean if someone lives in this house? Yes, I expect we need here if we can see the details, when someone goes to see a house and wants to give advice on isolating the ESH, what notes will he take? What numbers will he study? \r\n\r\n00:44:20 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Here? Aaa, are there towns with the materials in general? He tells you this material works, if the wall is like this, if it was a wall, for example, if the wall was painted or had a sealant before, then this must be removed and then this new material is applied, yes, so here there are several factors, frankly, yes, it will cost, yes, it will affect the cost, yes, why does it have to come back, I mean, it is expensive exactly, exactly, today if I come to a used house, and he comes and tells me I want to buy insulation from you, I will go and see an inspection. I will look at the site and see the direction of the house, what is it? Does it deserve insulation, yes? Or? Does it have neighbors? I mean, a building with a neighbor, you know if it is a building with a neighbor, then it does not need insulation, because it is insulated, meaning your neighbors are your protector, yes, yes . \r\n\r\n00:45:11 BILAL \r\n. Yes, \r\n\r\n00:45:12 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Right, right? Then let's see what insulation we can do from the outside. What's the best way? If it's from the inside, what's the best way is to insulate from the outside. It benefits from the inside in the summer and benefits from the winter. Yes, why from the outside? If you insulate, it will prevent the sun's rays from entering the house. Yes, yes, it's perfect. So the house will be a natural guard and isolated from the sun's rays. But if the insulation is from the inside, it will become the external building unit. It will absorb the sun's rays. Then the insulating material will start to prevent them from entering. So here it will become a bit like an army that you are preventing. If you are preventing it from inside the kingdom. An enemy army, you are coming \r\n\r\n00:46:00 BILAL \r\n. Mosul needs both cold times in the winter, and sometimes it's always hot, but in \r\n\r\n00:46:04 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nThe conversation between us is that I'm really tired during this period, really really tired, I mean why? Through convincing people, yes, I started to give examples and talk, hahaha, I got tired. The marketing idea is difficult, yes. \r\n\r\n00:46:20 BILAL \r\nSo, in your house, is it insulated from the outside inside, just inside or outside? \r\n\r\n00:46:26 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nOutside, this is my house, yes, this is one of the walls that, excuse me, okay, it's normal, these are the walls that are insulated from the heat, and also this ceiling is very thermally insulated. You see, you noticed that I didn't even make a secondary ceiling, it's directly a ceiling, and yes, all of this means that I didn't do this in the house, to be honest, you can \r\n\r\n00:46:49 BILAL \r\nProcrastination. I mean, and throwing the house, I mean, is it built from the inside? \r\n\r\n00:46:55 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. No, no, this is only during construction \r\n\r\n00:46:58 BILAL \r\nI mean, can't you imagine the way he installs tiles like tiles and we install tiles, I mean? \r\n\r\n00:47:03 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nNo, no, no, yes, it's the same, it's all, yes, after he finishes the construction of the house, the completion, yes, yes, material \r\n\r\n00:47:12 BILAL \r\n. What? Huh? Yes. But it has to be during construction, I mean, I imagine, if this is done, why can't we do it later? Maybe people have to go and not enter the room for a week, if anything, but we do it, we manage it, professor \r\n\r\n00:47:41 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. If the house is used, yes, the old cooking, which was not an insulating material, but just a whitewash, must be removed and then the insulating material is applied. Yes, I mean, it is not something, it is not impossible, but it is difficult, difficult. And this, I mean, if this was, if this was ordinary whitewash, yes, and I want to apply insulation, I would come and break all of this and throw it to the bottom, and if its place is washed, then I would apply the insulating material. It can be done, but fine . \r\n\r\n00:48:10 BILAL \r\n. This means that there is a benefit if. I mean, in the end, its cost will not be returned in ten years, I mean, it will be expensive later. \r\n\r\n00:48:18 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Yes, my dear sir, it certainly has a benefit, but I told you about insulation. There is what is called internal insulation, meaning it is covered from below, and there is external insulation, it is the ceiling from above, from the roof, I mean, yes, fine. Yes, yes, each one has its advantages and disadvantages. \r\n\r\n00:48:36 BILAL \r\nWhat? \r\n\r\n00:48:37 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Exactly. External insulation is usually useful in the summer, while internal insulation is useful in the winter. Now, I told you that when I go to inspect a certain site to know what problems the homeowner is suffering from, and what components I rely on to insulate them, I told you that I go first and see the house, is it new, I mean this construction or is it old, that's when it comes to the second thing. The homeowner has strong capabilities, if he doesn't have the capabilities, if he has the capabilities, he withdraws the entire house and does it. If he doesn't have the capabilities, I advise him on the weak points only. Yes, \r\n\r\n00:49:10 BILAL , \r\nright? \r\n\r\n00:49:12 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. What? It depends if the house is used and has certain paints applied to the wall. I must advise that this paint must be removed, and then the insulating material is applied, because if the material on this layer does not work or is exactly like this, in this place you will do ceramic or porcelain, if you leave it like this, or do whitewash so I know what to give it, I mean solutions. Here the role of the engineer is very necessary in this place \r\n\r\n00:49:44 BILAL \r\nI mean the surfaces from. From the outside I hear that there is a material that you can paint, I mean small glass with it, so that it reflects the sun, if it is white. Do you see this as a benefit? If not at all, I mean its effect? \r\n\r\n00:49:57 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Yes, here there will be a little difference in marketing, and in some of the existing brands. It is the insulating material, we all know if there is an insulating material. In the mind, when someone says there is a slight leak in the plate, one millimeter, is this the insulator or a thick layer? Thick? Two centimeters? Is this the insulator logically? Yes, two centimeters, right? There are products in the market, a hobby, that tells you I have paint, just paint, but you do it, this becomes an insulator M, he is right, but it is not an insulator, it is a heat reflector \r\n\r\n00:50:36 BILAL \r\n. Yes, yes \r\n\r\n00:50:37 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. We are in the salon today \r\n\r\n00:50:38 BILAL \r\n. I mean, it has an effect, I mean, in the comfort of the house, if I did not have a strong effect \r\n\r\n00:50:42 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Now, yes. I will tell you, okay, the paint will be the color of the Lord of the Worlds, everyone agrees that the white color reflects the heat, yes, and the black color is the heat absorber, right? That's right, so when you make a white layer on a surface, for example, on walls, it won't insulate, but it will reflect the heat. If you're directing a beam of light at 40 degrees Celsius, and it reflects 10% of it, what might get in? 30% gets in, so that tells you this is an insulator, it's not an insulator, it just reflects some of the heat directed at it, right? This is the opposite of the decision. There are simple materials. Excuse me, there are simple materials that are involved, and with these revelations, of course, in companies there, it doesn't prevent us from making them with chemical materials, of course, to reflect more and remove very simply. I mean, these materials are industrial citizens in Iraq, and from personal experience, I make them. Because it's a manufactured material. Anything made by man, which is experience? \r\n\r\n00:51:58 BILAL \r\n. Right? Right? We want it. \r\n\r\n00:51:59 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Time, but anything made by the Lord of the Worlds? No, you know this, for sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, today if someone made a car, 10, 20, 30 years. It will become a spare part for you. For sure, if someone made a juice drink, it will become a spare part for you, why? I made it with my own hands? This is not normal \r\n\r\n00:52:18 BILAL \r\n. Right. Right. Right \r\n\r\n00:52:19 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. So, here. This divorce will lose its properties in the hot sun. This is ours, yes, once or twice, 34 years. At most, only two years. What will its property become? It will become a normal heat-reflective paint. White paint. It will become exactly \r\n\r\n00:52:37 BILAL \r\nOkay. So, what about this? \r\n\r\n00:52:38 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. While there are materials \r\n\r\n00:52:40 BILAL \r\n. You say that this is the. The surface and the white paint, I mean, where do we focus on it in the training? I mean, this is the only thing we don't focus on, eh, eh, eh, \r\n\r\n00:52:48 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Right, yeah, these are the materials here, excuse me, and what I'm telling you about here is, I mean, we call it promotional engineering only . \r\n\r\n00:52:58 BILAL \r\n. Hmm, eh, eh, eh, eh. Other than that, the data authority, sheet E. Umm. \r\n\r\n00:53:15 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Correct, every thing has its advantages and disadvantages and \r\n\r\n00:53:20 BILAL \r\n. Okay, now we understand this, I just want to tell you, unfortunately, in 10 minutes I expect I have another call. \r\n\r\n00:53:27 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI, \r\nbut it's very normal, normal? \r\n\r\n00:53:29 BILAL \r\n. It was very beneficial. And if I learn a hobby and I get along with you, I think \r\n\r\n00:53:34 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nI mean, am I even on your mind? I’ve known you for ten years? \r\n\r\n00:53:36 BILAL \r\nI mean. Hahaha, thank God. Thank God chocolate. Hey, you're right, you're right. He's having fun with you. And there are a lot of these issues. So, see, there are good ways that we can do this training. I mean, like them, we do this. We do it, like we do an Excel spreadsheet. Is this worth it? The price of this is based on the period, and this has the effectiveness of this. So, do we do this? People know all the things that they can work on. Where, where? Is there a possibility that they will work on it? I mean, not at all. I know how to answer the one question. I mean, if we do it from outside, not in the summer, not in the winter, but is it worth doing both? If the problem is that Mosul needs two, what do we do? \r\n\r\n00:54:32 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. This question? Is it very good, professor? As for this question, I'm speaking quickly in a mood. You have your time. The material, the material that I'm talking about now, this remaining unit says that you have to make your house from the inside and outside in order to insulate it in the summer and to preserve it and retain heat inside. \r\n\r\n00:54:57 BILAL \r\nYes, right? \r\n\r\n00:54:59 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. I mean, when I make a house from the inside, if I make my house from the inside, a heat insulator, what will happen? So, if I work with a split system, yes, I work with a cool split system. Is it good? If electricity is required, the room will remain cold. Why? Because it is insulated from the inside, yes, like a freezer, like outside. Yes, yes, there is no leakage. I mean, the cold, let's call this cold. The cold, when it goes to the wall, it doesn't come back. Why? Because I'm doing it from the inside \r\n\r\n00:55:29 BILAL \r\nOkay, okay, yeah, I'm going to ask you the second two questions, and you can choose one, answer, the timer is a little, if you send me a voice note, the question about the A, you started with it, I started with it, it's the things that came to me from the Lord of the Worlds, I mean, I'll search for something in it, and if you see the traditional Musalla building, I mean, you know, you live without air conditioning, you live without a split, right? So there's anything in the market that uses the same A ideas, the old houses that have natural materials and things from the heritage, if not, just things, I mean \r\n\r\n00:56:11 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. What is it? I mean, the raw material that's available in the markets, right? Regardless of the names of the material, it's a material that's volcanic rocks, right? Materials about. Gypsum stones, sexual stones, yes, very well, some of the binding materials on a stapler stick yes with fiberglass, of course, natural, so all of these materials are natural, but when they are combined as a mass with certain engineering specifications and certain engineering proportions, yes, they will form a resolve for you, this insulator will be 100% natural, nice \r\n\r\n00:56:42 BILAL \r\n. Nice \r\n\r\n00:56:42 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. I mean, it doesn't have any carcinogenic effects. There are some insulators, if the sun shines on them, the other side releases carcinogenic materials, right, like the A on the espresso mask that they call, I don't know if you know it or not. This is completely carcinogenic. These materials, if they are cold or hot, don't react and don't give you any effect. I mean, they are just \r\n\r\n00:57:01 BILAL \r\n. A rock, they became \r\n\r\n00:57:02 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Something exactly still, something completely still, no effect, no magnetic waves or anything, on the contrary, basically there is something going on every now and then with this insulating material, you know that I am at home now, if I make a call on the network, the network is weak, why? Because this urgent material, because it is natural, insulates heat and sound waves and the waves of its regions and the waves of everything, I mean the router, the router, the house I have is a small house, I honestly have two routers, why? Because. Exactly, because the wall is a number of these materials are originally very nice, these materials will be \r\n\r\n00:57:44 BILAL \r\nimportant health benefits, so, this is something very nice, so oh oh good, and the last question is if you could give me a revolutionary bag, I mean oh oh oh what is its name, oh before and after what was the consumption of the house? What's the difference between insulation, plaster, walls? I mean, they come, I mean, a percentage of a hundred. Yes, they used to spend maybe 50 dollars, I mean, yes, and I don't know what? And after that, they pay 40 dollars, I mean, you can give me a house, you know it from before and after \r\n\r\n. 00:58:28 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nI'm telling you. \r\n\r\n00:58:29 BILAL \r\nYes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, right? Umm, what? \r\n\r\n00:58:46 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nWe filled the subject with the rent mood with electricity, because the rent is not paid and is postponed, and it can be paid in installments, and for this reason, the citizen takes it easy. I am now this right, I am now the national electricity, I am not working, \r\n\r\n00:58:59 BILAL \r\n. Yes, what \r\n\r\n00:59:00 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\nThe operator of the cooling unit, which is the cooler, you know the cooler, yes, why? The coolers draw two amps. Yes, the split draws 15 amps, right? I'm satisfied with the cooler, why? Because the house is insulated. Yes, of course, I'm hot now to talk and focused on myself, but that's normal. No, it's normal, as is the weather now, that the house is completely, okay, I mean, all of its insulation is suitable, yes, only one amp for the whole house, and yes, the whole house \r\n\r\n00:59:33 BILAL \r\n. What, the house has 600 meters, so that's 300 meters. Yes, yes, no, no saving, and the air that comes out of it has a strange taste compared to \r\n\r\n00:59:56 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. By. I mean, if the girl is busy, I'm thirsty, I like to drink water, because it's dry, or \r\n\r\n01:00:04 BILAL \r\n. Okay, I'm very sorry, they're waiting for me now, but there's a possibility, I mean \r\n\r\n01:00:12 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. I'll send you a message, okay. Okay \r\n\r\n01:00:13 BILAL \r\n. Whoever designed it, if I have any questions, if that's okay, they can send you a voice note, it's simple, \r\n\r\n01:00:18 MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI \r\n. Any time you want to message me, I'm available. My dear, Professor A, can I have some questions that I can ask you later? Okay? On my head, Professor Habib, Professor, nice opportunity, goodbye"

The daily average temperature was 27 °C. At fan OFF condition, the highest temperature recorded at normal attic was 47.7 °C. At fan ON condition, the highest temperature recorded at attic with SPAVF was 39.3 °C. This proves the effectiveness of fan usage at attic, by reducing the highest temperature by 8.1 °C.\nFigure 2.4: The Recorded Temperature (Yu and Moore, 2015).\n\nhttp://eprints.utar.edu.my/5308/1/1606413_fyp_report_%2D_MUN_LING_HO.pdf\nSo cool: https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1651&context=fsec \n\nTools and Materials for Training Program\nItem\nCategory\nType\nMinimum Required\nRecommended\nPrice\nSolar Panels\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInverter\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCharge Controller\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nBattery (Lead-acid or Lithium)\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCable (DC/AC)\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nMC4 Connectors\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nRoof Mounting Kit\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nMultimeter\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nClamp Meter (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nSolar Installation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nDrill with Bits\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nWrench Set\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nScrewdrivers (Flat & Philips)\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nSafety Gloves\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInsulation Tape\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nPolystyrene Panels\nMaterial\nInsulation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCool Roof Coating\nMaterial\nInsulation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nReflective Foil\nMaterial\nInsulation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nSealing Foam\nMaterial\nInsulation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCaulking Gun\nTool\nInsulation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInsulation Board Cutter\nTool\nInsulation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nThermal Camera (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nInsulation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nBlower Door Test Kit (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nInsulation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExhaust Fan\nMaterial\nArchitecture\nYes\nYes\n\n\nFlexible Ducting\nMaterial\nArchitecture\nYes\nYes\n\n\nMesh Grills\nMaterial\nArchitecture\nYes\nYes\n\n\nTemperature/Humidity Logger (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nArchitecture\nNo\nYes\n\n\nAirflow Meter (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nArchitecture\nNo\nYes\n\n\nMeasuring Tape\nTool\nGeneral\nYes\nYes\n\n\nSpirit Level\nTool\nGeneral\nYes\nYes\n\n\nUtility Knife\nTool\nGeneral\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n\nHands-on kits: confirm 4 complete mini-systems so each team of 4 gets time on the tools.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "content": " Looking at these rich interview transcripts and the training framework, I can see several powerful insights that can elevate the insulation module. Let me analyze the key themes and provide specific improvements while maintaining the 3-part daily structure.\n\n## Key Insights from the Interviews:\n\n### 1. **The \"Culture Zero\" Problem**\nMultiple trainers emphasize that public awareness of insulation is \"almost zero\" in Mosul. This isn't just about technical knowledge - it's about fundamental mindset change.\n\n### 2. **The Electricity Paradox**\nMuthanna reveals a critical insight: many people see electricity as \"free\" (they delay/avoid paying bills), which undermines the cost-saving argument for insulation.\n\n### 3. **The Second Floor Abandonment**\nGhassan notes that 90% of people abandon their second floors in summer due to heat - this is a powerful, relatable problem.\n\n### 4. **Beauty Over Function**\nOmar points out that people spend $30,000 on facades but refuse $3,000 for insulation - a crucial psychological barrier.\n\n## Enhanced 5-Day Insulation Module\n\n### Day 1: Experience the Problem, Discover Solutions\n**Learn (45-60 min):** \n- Start with the \"Second Floor Story\" - have trainees share their heat experiences\n- Temperature demonstration: Use Ghassan's data (58°C before, 42°C after insulation)\n- Introduce the \"Three Heat Enemies\": Conduction, Convection, Radiation (as Ghassan emphasizes)\n- Show failure photos: White paint that people think is insulation\n\n**Apply (90 min):**\n- Station 1: Touch different materials at room temperature vs. heated (wood, metal, insulated block)\n- Station 2: Use infrared thermometer to measure actual wall temperatures\n- Station 3: Air leak detection with incense (Aya's technique)\n- Calculate: How many rooms does your family actually use in summer?\n\n**Sell (60+ min):**\n- Role-play: \"My cousin abandoned his second floor\" conversation\n- Create personal heat map of their own home\n- Practice the \"comfort not cost\" pitch (following Muthanna's insight)\n\n### Day 2: The Roof - Your Biggest Enemy and Opportunity\n**Learn (45-60 min):**\n- \"60-70% of heat comes through the roof\" (Ghassan's data)\n- Compare materials with actual data sheets (following Muthanna's suggestion)\n- The \"Kashi removal problem\" - when it costs $4,000-5,000 just to remove tiles\n\n**Apply (90 min):**\n- Build mock roof sections with different materials\n- Apply coatings to sample tiles - test coverage rates\n- Measure temperature drop in real-time\n- Common mistakes workshop: rushed mixing, dirty surfaces\n\n**Sell (60+ min):**\n- Calculate true costs including tile removal\n- Role-play: \"But white paint is cheaper!\" objection\n- Develop \"test patch\" offer strategy\n- Create WhatsApp-friendly before/after photo templates\n\n### Day 3: Walls - The Affordable Win\n**Learn (45-60 min):**\n- ICF/Cork systems (Aya's 100-house track record)\n- Perlite plaster \"Labkh\" - the local affordable option\n- Show Ghassan's wall insulation paying back in 2 years\n- Address fire/durability myths with burn tests\n\n**Apply (90 min):**\n- Mix perlite plaster with proper timing (address rushing problem)\n- Apply to practice walls with different existing finishes\n- Install exterior cork panels\n- Test adhesion on dusty vs. clean surfaces\n\n**Sell (60+ min):**\n- The \"AC Downsizing Pitch\" (2-ton to 1-ton after insulation)\n- Practice measuring and quoting real rooms\n- Role-play dealing with competing offices' criticism\n- Calculate payback including comfort value\n\n### Day 4: Windows, Ventilation & Integration\n**Learn (45-60 min):**\n- Why oversized south-facing windows are killing comfort (Aya's insight)\n- Natural ventilation strategies from heritage buildings\n- The \"10% heat loss\" through openings\n- Solar fans and passive cooling\n\n**Apply (90 min):**\n- Seal windows with proper gaskets and caulk\n- Install and test exhaust fans\n- Create cross-ventilation in mock room\n- Measure airflow and temperature changes\n\n**Sell (60+ min):**\n- Develop \"Comfort Package\" combining all interventions\n- Address privacy concerns with ventilation (Aya's cultural insight)\n- Create tiered pricing for different budgets\n- Practice the \"phased approach\" for limited budgets\n\n### Day 5: Business Launch & Client Psychology\n**Learn (45-60 min):**\n- Understanding Mosul's three economic tiers (Muthanna's framework)\n- The psychology of \"beauty over function\"\n- Building trust through measurement and proof\n- Creating your business identity\n\n**Apply (90 min):**\n- Complete insulation of demo room\n- Document with thermal camera/data logger\n- Create portfolio with actual temperature data\n- Practice quality control inspection\n\n**Sell (60+ min):**\n- Present to real clients (invited building owners)\n- Temperature guarantee offers (Ghassan's 10-degree promise)\n- Develop referral network strategy\n- Plan first month's activities\n\n### Day 6 (Optional): Field Implementation\n- Visit graduates' first job sites\n- Troubleshoot real installation challenges\n- Share temperature measurement results\n- Build WhatsApp support network\n\n## Key Pedagogical Improvements:\n\n1. **Start with Emotion, Not Economics**: Following the interviews, lead with comfort and abandoning rooms, not cost savings.\n\n2. **Use Local Proof**: Feature the 100 ICF houses, the wedding hall example, and real temperature data throughout.\n\n3. **Address Cultural Barriers**: Include specific modules on dealing with beauty-over-function mindset and peer pressure.\n\n4. **Measurement as Persuasion**: Provide every trainee with a basic infrared thermometer (following multiple trainers' emphasis on proof).\n\n5. **Myth-Busting Labs**: Hands-on demonstrations addressing fire fears, durability concerns, and the \"white paint misconception.\"\n\n6. **Graduated Complexity**: Start with simple wall treatments, build to integrated whole-house solutions.\n\n7. **Real Material Costs**: Use actual local prices and include hidden costs like tile removal.\n\nThis enhanced curriculum directly addresses the real barriers identified by experienced practitioners while maintaining practical, hands-on learning that leads to employment.",

      "content": " ## Day-by-Day Stories for the Insulation Training Module\n\n### Day 1: Experience the Problem, Discover Solutions\n\n**The Second Floor Abandonment Story** (Opening Story)\n*Based on Ghassan's insight: \"90% of people abandon their second floors in summer\"*\n\n\"Let me tell you about Abu Ahmed from the Al-Zuhoor neighborhood. He built his dream house in 2018 - 250 square meters, two floors, beautiful marble facade that cost him 40 million dinars. His plan was simple: ground floor for guests and daily living, second floor for the family bedrooms.\n\nBut by the first summer, something strange happened. Every evening, you'd see mattresses being carried downstairs. His children refused to sleep upstairs. His wife would go up to get clothes and come down drenched in sweat. By July, the entire second floor - half his house - was abandoned. \n\nAbu Ahmed tried everything. He bought the biggest air conditioner - 2.5 tons. The electricity bill jumped to 200,000 dinars a month just for that one AC, running 24 hours, and still the room felt like an oven. His cousin joked, 'Brother, you built a 250-meter house but you live in 125 meters!'\n\nLast year, he finally listened to an engineer who measured his ceiling temperature: 58 degrees Celsius at 3 PM. After installing thermal insulation, that same spot measured 42 degrees. His family moved back upstairs. The 2.5-ton AC? He sold it and bought a 1-ton unit. Now he tells everyone, 'I paid 3 million dinars to get back half my house.'\"\n\n**The Generator Owner's Confession** (For the Sell segment)\n*Addresses the \"free electricity\" misconception*\n\n\"Hassan runs a neighborhood generator in East Mosul. One day, a customer complained about his bill. Hassan said, 'Let me show you something.' He took him to see two identical houses, side by side. 'This one,' he pointed to the left, 'pulls 16 amps in summer. The one on the right? Only 8 amps. Same size, same family size. The difference? The owner on the right installed insulation last year. He pays half what you pay, and his house is more comfortable.'\"\n\n### Day 2: The Roof - Your Biggest Enemy and Opportunity\n\n**The Tile Removal Disaster** (Learn segment - the hidden cost story)\n*Based on Ghassan's $4,000-5,000 tile removal cost insight*\n\n\"Engineer Mustafa had a client in 2021 who wanted to insulate his roof. 'No problem,' the client said, 'I budgeted 2 million dinars.' But when they started removing the decorative tiles to apply insulation, disaster struck. Each tile cracked as they lifted it. The removal alone cost 5 million dinars. The client was furious: 'You told me insulation costs 2 million!' \n\nMustafa learned his lesson. Now he always asks: 'What's on your roof?' If it's expensive tiles, he explains: 'We have two options. Remove everything - expensive but best insulation. Or we work from inside - less effective but preserves your tiles.' The client chose interior insulation. Not perfect, but his bedroom temperature dropped 8 degrees.\"\n\n**The White Paint Deception** (Apply segment - failure story)\n*Based on multiple interviews mentioning this misconception*\n\n\"In 2020, a paint salesman convinced the entire Al-Wahda neighborhood that his 'thermal paint' would solve their heat problems. 'Just paint it white, reflects 90% of heat!' he promised. Thirty houses painted their roofs. \n\nBy 2022, Ibrahim, one of the homeowners, called a real insulation contractor. 'This paint did nothing!' he complained. When they checked, the 'thermal paint' had already degraded. The contractor showed him: 'Look, your roof is 55 degrees. Your neighbor with real insulation? 38 degrees. Paint reflects some light, but insulation blocks heat transfer. Like the difference between wearing a white shirt in summer versus a proper jacket in winter.'\"\n\n### Day 3: Walls - The Affordable Win\n\n**The 100-House Pioneer** (Learn segment - success story)\n*Based on Aya's ICF experience*\n\n\"Engineer Aya faced skepticism in 2018 when she proposed ICF (foam-concrete) walls. 'Foam? Like disposable cups? That will burn!' people said. She built a demonstration: held a blowtorch to the material for 5 minutes. No fire. Then she built the general manager's house with it.\n\nThat summer, the manager invited skeptics for tea. Outside: 47 degrees. Inside his ICF house: 29 degrees with one small AC. 'I turn off the cooling for an hour, the room stays comfortable,' he demonstrated. Word spread through family networks. Now Aswar Al-Mosul has built over 100 houses. The wedding hall in Al-Nour neighborhood? ICF walls. The noise stays inside, the heat stays outside.\"\n\n**The Fuel Bill Revelation** (Sell segment - ROI story)\n*Based on Ghassan's 400-500 liter to 200-250 liter reduction*\n\n\"Khalid in Al-Mansour tracked his heating costs obsessively. Winter 2019: 450 liters of kerosene, about 300,000 dinars. His wife always complained about cold walls. In 2020, he ins",

      "content": "what are the common myths, where will we see heat paths, i think everyone knows metal is hotter than wood in the sumer, how can we make this more relevant and interesting?\nI don't think aya uses incense - i mentioned it not her\nhow do we documnet findings systematically? should we share with them a printable spreadsheet for home assessment? \n* *Muthanna warns*: \"But they think electricity is free!\"\n   * everyone knows this, this is their community!\ncomfort, house size, divorce rates, illness, - maybe we can do a dialog on what other pain points we can identify, research, empathize, ask each other, build a list with stiky notes on the wall\n* then practice sale\n* homework is home audit that's good\n\nWhy the roof is a big deal, the science\nomar's warning, we need to verify, i wonder if we can find some evidence, what oculd possibly go wrong, are there paint's with warrenties? \n\nwhy we can't do the best thing (insulate the roof) so we do the second best things areate and coat with white paint\nUnexpected cross linkage with solar \n\nwhere is the video of 17o drop, who's project was it, let's see if we can get some kind of evidence\n\nmeasure coverage rates, don't skimp, have high standards, this will make a difference for your customers, do work with ihsan and get good results and people will talke\ncalculate material needs and start calculating costs \n\nRest on a dusty surface, not sure we can do that, maybe teacher an make a demo of a panel painted on a dusty surface and ask the room to scratch it off and then another good panel and attempt to scratch\n\nRoof without the tile removal is impossible, we can only do painting, we cant add roof insulation (that's what people say for now, i think it's possible... we can add styrofoam and cement panels to hold it down like tiles... and not sure i should add my ideas like that here without validation)\n\nwhat is a roof assessment checklist? \n\nDay 3 - ghassan should give us more details \nshould a fannan \"artist\" or trades person come to od the mixing?\n\nonly 10% more expensive, how do we deal with the challenge of people saying it wont be strong enough for the weight of the house? what is icf, where else is it used? \n\nac downsizing, what can we learn? you can buy the ac from them and install a smaller one once the job is done and they don't need it anymore. this way you can reduce the cost difference from their price and sell the larger ac on the resale market\n\nhow do we install icf, isn't it a brick? is there another material, they've been talking about \"filline\" which i think i styrofoam that they use as tiles? or i'm not sure, what do the interviews say?\n\nthe ghassan success story isn't meaningful without context, what was it beofre, what did he do to get there, etc\n\nwhat are the fire/structural concerns?\n\nwhat's an integrated comfort package? \n\nday 4\nair infiltration costs - more than you think, how much? same in iraq as america? how can it be different? where might we want to focus that might be suprising?\n\nbig windows closed curtains, what are the curtains made out of?\nwhat is natural ventilation without sacrificing privacy? we're talking about insulation and ventilation, gardens we can mention yet it might not be core to the curriculum, maybe we talk about roof vents, where else might a vent be useful in a mosul home? what about the kitchen? \n(integration of all interviews means what?)\n\n**Sealing & Ventilation Lab** (90 min) \n* \n Looks like a lot for 90 mins, do we split up? we only have a trainer and one assistant, what else can we do to make this work\n\nHow can we create cross ventilation paths, how do we know when it's smarter to close and seal all windows and doors and when to create cross ventillation?  \ncan we model this ? \n\nday 4 evening is nice, although day three is supposed to help build up the case for their potential buisness using one or some of these methods and also to build up an ROI/Comfort customer home diagnostic sales toolkit which they can use to discuss with customers and help them find and address pain points within their budgets and needs\n\nmuthana's market teirs need to be rephrased - what do we do about it, do we focus on the middle , if we do then why think about it at all? I guess to point out that wealthy people might need to be sold to differently because they don't care how much they pay for electricity, they might be more convinced about the health benefits or...\n\nwhat data? how do we collect the data in a way that builds credibility?\n\nyay day 5 we got the financial literacy plan in there\n\nWhat can we do for day five evening, this is where they should be getting certified, we need to be able to assess them for some practical things, and to connect them to the job market, i had intended to have professionals come and review their work, although it's different than the solar training, there's no one thing to do, i wonder how to do this best, ideas? \n\nDay 6 homeowner is the person themself or their father, the idea is to design the best intervention for your home and perhaps to \"be sold on it\" yourself. It might be interesting to allocate 500$ to be used for home insulation improvements for the participant with the highest scores, most engagement, best design, not sure what else could be nice to use so there's some competition and we allocate 250$ for the top 3 participants to do an actual install? or 500 and 250 for #2\n\nDay 6 is optional so we can't put the certification in it. the actual client is the person themself or people close to them they can access their homes (privacy is a big deal, not everyone can go to anyone's home)\n\ni like the alumni network whatsapp feedback from senior practitioners the trainer is that person, although it'd be nice to have more folk\n\nthere i sno interest in mosul, it's ofrbidden so we don't put it on the Financial literacy exam, roi, business model concepts, \n\nOk, here's my feedback, review, think about how to address each element in 2-3 orthogonal ways pick the best one and then update the document in full",

I guess to point out that wealthy people might need to be sold to differently because they don't care how much they pay for electricity, they might be more convinced about the health benefits or...\n\nwhat data? how do we collect the data in a way that builds credibility?\n\nyay day 5 we got the financial literacy plan in there\n\nWhat can we do for day five evening, this is where they should be getting certified, we need to be able to assess them for some practical things, and to connect them to the job market, i had intended to have professionals come and review their work, although it's different than the solar training, there's no one thing to do, i wonder how to do this best, ideas? \n\nDay 6 homeowner is the person themself or their father, the idea is to design the best intervention for your home and perhaps to \"be sold on it\" yourself. It might be interesting to allocate 500$ to be used for home insulation improvements for the participant with the highest scores, most engagement, best design, not sure what else could be nice to use so there's some competition and we allocate 250$ for the top 3 participants to do an actual install? or 500 and 250 for #2\n\nDay 6 is optional so we can't put the certification in it. the actual client is the person themself or people close to them they can access their homes (privacy is a big deal, not everyone can go to anyone's home)\n\ni like the alumni network whatsapp feedback from senior practitioners the trainer is that person, although it'd be nice to have more folk\n\nthere i sno interest in mosul, it's ofrbidden so we don't put it on the Financial literacy exam, roi, business model concepts, \n\nOk, here's my feedback, review, think about how to address each element in 2-3 orthogonal ways pick the best one and then update the document in full",

I don't see that element represented in the 3rd part of the day regularly, i sort of have this idea that each day they deepen and expand their sheet so initially they only have ROI for one, and then all of them. then the ROI starts including thigns other than financial, then we talk about the two main (no need for 3) kinds of customers, price sensitive and price insensitive - and it means we focus on different ROI Then we also want them to figure out things like BOM, costs for labor, time estimation, othe rbusiness expenses and make a financial model and business model for a potential business, how many of each would they need to do a month, how mnay people are in mosul, the north of iraq, etc how can they find them/market? what would they like hteir nieche to be, which of the different interventions, does it make business sense, what investment do they need to start, can the training organization provide shared tool library (i think so) for any research please add references 2024 NTU study. what's an anemometer and do we talk about the potential ROI of rooftop venting, it's an underutilized thing in mosul i guess i do see you've set up the last part of the day to be business related not bad The point of attending the clients wedding was to say, if you do a quality job with high standards, you will have a long life as an installer and word of mouth grows I would like to add an optional blower door assessment (depending on if we can get one)]]]\nWhat else would be useful to add in our curriculum design? what can we do with these interviews, if eel lik ethey're super useful and we can really benefit from them and i'm not sure how",

I don't see that element represented in the 3rd part of the day regularly, i sort of have this idea that each day they deepen and expand their sheet so initially they only have ROI for one, and then all of them. then the ROI starts including thigns other than financial, then we talk about the two main (no need for 3) kinds of customers, price sensitive and price insensitive - and it means we focus on different ROI Then we also want them to figure out things like BOM, costs for labor, time estimation, othe rbusiness expenses and make a financial model and business model for a potential business, how many of each would they need to do a month, how mnay people are in mosul, the north of iraq, etc how can they find them/market? what would they like hteir nieche to be, which of the different interventions, does it make business sense, what investment do they need to start, can the training organization provide shared tool library (i think so) for any research please add references 2024 NTU study. what's an anemometer and do we talk about the potential ROI of rooftop venting, it's an underutilized thing in mosul i guess i do see you've set up the last part of the day to be business related not bad The point of attending the clients wedding was to say, if you do a quality job with high standards, you will have a long life as an installer and word of mouth grows I would like to add an optional blower door assessment (depending on if we can get one)]]]\nWhat else would be useful to add in our curriculum design? what can we do with these interviews, if eel lik ethey're super useful and we can really benefit from them and i'm not sure how",
