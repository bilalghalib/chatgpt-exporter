      "content": "Bonjour Bilal 🌰🙂  \n\nYes, that happens easily — chestnuts have much less fat than, say, hazelnuts, so if you just bake them dry they go mealy or powdery. The key is **steam + controlled roasting** so they cook through and stay moist. Here are some reliable ways:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Boiled then Roasted (French style)**\n- Cut an **X** into the flat side of each chestnut (so they don’t explode).  \n- Boil in salted water for **10–15 minutes** until they’re just starting to soften.  \n- Drain, then roast at **200°C** for another **10–15 minutes**.  \n👉 This keeps the inside moist but gives you the roasted aroma.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Oven with Steam**\n- Preheat oven to **200–220°C**.  \n- Cut an **X** into each nut.  \n- Place in a tray with a splash of water or over a shallow pan of water (to create steam).  \n- Roast for **20–25 minutes**, shaking the pan halfway.  \n👉 The steam prevents them from drying into powder.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Pan Roasted (like in souks in the Levant or streets of Paris)**\n- Use a heavy pan or cast iron skillet.  \n- Cut the **X**.  \n- Add chestnuts and cover with a lid.  \n- Roast over medium heat, shaking often, for **15–20 minutes** until the skins peel back.  \n👉 Moisture stays trapped under the lid.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Boiled Only (for purée or stuffing)**\n- Cut the shell, boil in salted water **20–30 minutes** until tender.  \n- Peel while warm (easier when hot).  \n- Use directly in cooking, mash with butter/honey, or freeze.  \n\n---\n\n💡 **Tips so they don’t dry out**:\n- Always score the shell before cooking.  \n- Don’t over-roast — once the skins split and they smell nutty, they’re done.  \n- Wrap them in a kitchen towel for 10 minutes after cooking — the steam loosens skins and keeps them soft.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want to eat them just as a snack (street-style roasted chestnuts) 🍂, or are you thinking of using them in a dish (like a purée, stuffing, or dessert)?",
