If, however, he were to try with all his might to pull these traits out by the roots, he would prove able only to destroy its strength and restore it to moderation. Therefore the correct course of action is for him to intend to uproot it, which will permit him to change it to the required level. This secret, however, should not be revealed to the aspirant, for a foolish man might be deceived by it, and think that his anger and his withholding of his money were just.\n\n[22.4]\nA General Exposition of the Means by which Good Character may be Acquired\n\nYOU have come to know that goodness of character proceeds from an equilibrium in the rational faculty brought about through sound wisdom, and in the irascible and appetitive faculties through their submission to the intellect and the Law. This equilibrium may come about in two ways.\n\nOne of these is through Divine grace, and completeness of innate disposition [kamāl fiṭrī], whereby a man is born and created with a sound intellect and a good character, and is preserved from the powers of desire and anger, which are created in him moderate and submissive to the intellect and the Law. Thus he becomes learned without an instructor, and disciplined without being subject to any discipline, in the manner of Jesus, the son of Mary, and John, the son of Zacharias, and all the other prophets (may the blessings of God be upon them all). Yet it is not to be deemed improbable that certain things should exist in a man's nature and disposition which can be obtained through acquisition: some children are created truthful, generous and courageous, while in others the opposite characteristics have been set, so that [in this case] good qualities can only be acquired through habituation and associating with those who possess them, and also through education.\n\nThe second is the acquisition of these traits of character by\n\n^ For this special virtue in Jesus see below, p.54.\n\n30\n31\n\n---\n\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\n\nmeans of spiritual struggle and exercise. By this I mean the constraining of the soul to perform the actions which necessarily proceed from the trait desired. For example, a man who wishes to acquire the quality of generosity must oblige himself to do generous things; that is, to give of what he owns, and must continue in this wise, affecting this thing and struggling with his soul until his nature conforms to it and it becomes easy, at which point he will have become a generous person. Similarly in the case of the man dominated by arrogance who wishes to inculcate in his soul the quality of modesty: he should persist for a lengthy period in imitating the behaviour of the modest and struggling against his soul until such behaviour becomes one of his traits and part of his nature, at which time it will come easily. Every one of the qualities which the Law deems praiseworthy is acquired by these means, the end point of which is that the act should be pleasurable. For the generous man is he that takes pleasure in giving money, not he who gives it reluctantly; and in the same way, the modest man is he who finds modesty delightful.\n\nThe religious traits of character cannot take firm root in the soul until it has grown accustomed to every good habit, renounced every evil one, and persevered in this in the wise of one who feels a love for and takes pleasure in beautiful deeds, and loathes and is hurt by ugly ones. As God's Emissary (may God bless him and grant him peace) said: 'Prayer has been made my delight'. As long as worship and the renunciation of forbidden things are felt to be unpleasant and burdensome their performance will be defective, and cannot bring one to full felicity. Certainly, to struggle to persevere with them is a good thing, but only in comparison with abandoning them, not in comparison with doing them willingly. It is in this context that God (Exalted is He!) has said, Seek help in perseverance and in prayer, and truly it is hard save for the humble-minded. And His Emissary (may God bless him and grant him peace) has said, 'Worship God with pleasure, and if you cannot, then with perseverance, for perseverance in something which you dislike contains much good'. Neither is it\n\n32\n\n---\n\nDisciplining the Soul\n\nsufficient to obtain the felicity consequent upon good character that obedience to God should be found delightful and disobedience unpleasant at some times and not others; rather this should be constant and remain with one throughout one's life, so that the longer a man's life extends, the more solid and complete will be his virtue. This is why the Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) replied, when asked about felicity: 'It is a long life in the obedience of God'. This is also why the Prophets and the Ṣūfīs disliked death. 'For this world is the sowing-ground of the next'. The more acts of worship one performs through living a long life, the greater will be the reward, the purer and clearer the soul, and the stronger and more deeply-rooted the good traits of character. For the sole purpose of acts of worship is to influence the heart, and this influence will only grow strong when they are persistently repeated.\n\nThe purpose of such traits of character is to cut the love of this world away from the heart, and to set firmly therein the love of God (Exalted is He!), so that one would love nothing so much as the meeting with Him. Such a man will then employ his wealth only in ways which will bring him to Him; likewise with his anger and desires, since these will be at his command, and weighed up in the scales of the intellect and the Law so that he is contented and happy with them. It is wrong to deem it unlikely that one's delight might be in prayer and that one's worship might become delectable, for everyday life draws more wondrous things from the soul: we see kings and the voluptuous rich in constant misery, and the bankrupt gambler so overcome with delight and joy during his gambling that one might well discount the possibility of man's gaining any pleasure without this practice, even after it had taken away his wealth, ruined his home and left God quite penniless, for he will still love and enjoy it by reason of his soul's long familiarity with it. Similarly with the man whose hobby is\n\n^ For this proverb, sometimes held to be a ḥadīth, see Sakhāwī, 351; for Ghazālī's extensive use of it see Lazarus-Yafeh, 312-4.\n\n33\n\n---\n\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\n\npigeons, who may stand all day in the hot sun without feeling any pain due to the pleasure he takes in his birds, and their movements, flight and soaring around in the sky. And there is the sly criminal who boasts of the blows and stabs he receives, and of his steadfastness under the whip, and who goes up to the cross or the gibbet bragging about his endurance of these [punishments], considering this to be a source of pride: he may be torn limb from limb in an attempt to make him confess to his crime or to that committed by another man with his knowledge, and persevere in his denial, and pay no heed to the punishments because of his joy at what he considers to be his courage and virility. Despite the torment provided by his circumstances, he is delighted by them and finds them a source of pride. And there is no condition more ugly and despicable than that of an effeminate man, who imitates women by plucking out his hair, tattooing his face, and keeping their company, so that you see him rejoicing in his state and boasting of the perfection of his effeminacy to other such men. Even the cuppers and sweepers can be seen boasting to one another just as much as the kings and scholars. All of this is the result of habit and persisting in one course for a long period and seeing the same thing in one's acquaintances.\n\nSince the soul commonly takes pleasure even in vain things and inclines towards ugliness, how could it not take pleasure in the Truth were it to be restored to it for a while and made to persevere therein? The soul's inclination to these disgusting\n\n^ A sport popular in medieval Islamic culture; see for instance Ibn Abī'l-Dunyā, Dhamm al-malāhī, ed. 'Aṭā, 50-1, ed. Robson, 59; Sakhāwī, 630-1; F. Rosenthal, 'Child psychology in Islam', 4. Ghazālī is assuming that his readers regard it as a rather frivolous and undignified pursuit; as is suggested by the above sources. According to one early jurist, the testimony of a pigeon breeder cannot be accepted in court, for the same reason (Ziadeh, 'Integrity ('Adālah) in Classical Islamic Law', 82). The hobby did, however, find practical application in the carrier pigeon trade; it is interesting to note in passing that the use of carrier pigeons was first introduced to Europe by knights returned from the Crusades: cf. Holmes, 'Life among the Europeans in Palestine and Syria', 31.\nᴮ For this vice see note A on p.175 below.\n\n34\n\n---\n\nDisciplining the Soul\n\nthings is unnatural, and resembles an inclination to the eating of mud; yet even this may gain control over some people and become a habit. As for the inclination to wisdom and the love, knowledge and worship of God, this resembles the inclination towards food and drink. It is an expression of the heart's nature, and is a divine command, while an inclination to the demands of one's desires is in itself something strange, and is not part of its nature. The heart's food is wisdom, knowledge and the love of God (Exalted is He!), yet it diverges from these demands often when afflicted by some disease, just as the stomach may be afflicted by an illness which prevents it from desiring the food and drink which give it life. Thus every man's heart which inclines to anything but the love of God (Exalted is He!) is afflicted by a disease in proportion to this inclination, unless he love a thing because it helps him to love God and to practice his religion—which is not the symptom of an illness.\n\nFrom the foregoing you come to know beyond all doubt that good traits of character may be acquired through self-discipline, by means of imitating, at the outset, the actions which result from such traits so that they may ultimately become part of one's nature. This is one of the wonders of the relationship between the heart and the members [jawāriḥ], by which I mean the soul and the body: the effect of every attribute which appears in the heart must emanate onto the members, so that these move only in conformity to it; similarly, every act performed by the members, at first, makes its way up to the heart, thereby constituting a form of circular movement. To understand this thing a metaphor may be employed, as follows.\n\nA man who wishes his soul to acquire the attribute of skilful calligraphy is that he becomes a calligrapher by nature and dis-\n\n^ As remarked in the same context by Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, VII.v.3.\nᴮ The reference to kitāba may instead be to the simple act of writing, together with such ancillary skills as were required of the secretarial class. Ghazālī seems to have drawn this illustration of the process of habituation from al-Fārābī (Fuṣūl, 100).\n\n35\n\n---\n\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\n\nposition must do with the member which is the hand those things which the calligrapher does, and devote himself assiduously to this for a long period, during which he imitates the calligrapher by copying his fine script. He continues to persevere in this until it becomes a firmly-rooted attribute in his soul, and, at last, he comes to write naturally with a beautiful hand, whereas he had earlier done so only artificially. It was fine calligraphy itself which rendered his own calligraphy fine, at first through a difficult simulation, the effect of which nevertheless rose to his heart and then descended again from the heart to the member in question to enable him to write well naturally. The case of a man who wishes to become a sage of the soul is similar: he is obliged to do the things which such sages do, namely, a constance application to sagacity, until this attribute becomes attached to his heart and he becomes a sage of the soul.\n\nThe case of the man who wishes to become generous, continent, and unassuming is identical: he must perform by simulation the actions associated with these qualities until they become part of his habitual nature. This is the only treatment available. And just as the one who wishes to become a sage of the soul does not despair of achieving his goal when he has wasted one night, but will not reach it if he does so repeatedly for many nights, similarly he who desires to purify his soul and to adorn it with good qualities will neither achieve his goal by worshipping for one day nor be barred from it because for one day he\n\n^ Ar. faqīh al-nafs. A characteristically Ghazālian term applied to a sincere expert in the religious art of reforming souls. This, or its cognate expression the faqīh al-dīn ('sage of religion') is contrasted with the faqīh al-dunyā, the \"worldly jurist\", who knows the formal requirements of liturgy and law, and yet has no appreciation of their true spiritual function. Ghazālī chose the root f.q.h to remind people of the original sense of 'understanding', which had become obscured as the word fiqh became increasingly applied to legal casuistry. Cf. Iḥyā', IV. 342-3 (K. al-Murāqaba, Bayān ḥaqīqat al-mutafaqqih), I. 28-9 (K. al-'Ilm, bāb 3, Bayān mā buddil min alfāẓ al-'ulamā'). The word fuqahā' had, however, already been used, e.g. by Tustarī (Mu'ārada, 4-5), to denote people learned in spiritual matters.\n\n36\n\n---\n\nDisciplining the Soul\n\nsinned. This is the purport of our [credal] statement that one mortal sin does not necessarily lead to eternal damnation. However, one day of idleness will invite [the student] to the next, and then, little by little, to others, until his soul takes pleasure in laziness and abandons studying altogether so that the merit which attaches to being a sage passes him by. Similarly, one venial sin leads to another, until the basis for salvation is lost through the destruction of the basis of faith at the moment of death. And just as the effect of a single night on the acquisition of the status of sage of the soul is not decisive since this status which appears little by little, like the growth and increasing height of the body; similarly the effect of one act of devotion on the purification and cleansing of the soul is not immediately perceptible. Nonetheless, one should not undervalue even a small amount of devotion, for a large quantity, which is made up of individual small acts, has an effect, so that each one of them must exercise an influence. There is not a single act of devotion but that it has an effect, even though it be concealed, and it must therefore necessarily entail some reward, since reward is in proportion to its effect; and this is the case with sin also. How many sages there are who deem the wasting of a day and a night a paltry thing, and continue to do so, procrastinating day after day until at last their natures depart from the acquisition of understanding: likewise is it with the man who underestimates small sins, and procrastinates and delays his repentance day after day, until such time as death suddenly seizes him, or the darkness of his sins wraps up in his heart so that he is unable to repent (for a little ever invites one to abundance), and his heart becomes loaded with the chains of desires, from which he is unable to release himself. This is what is meant by the 'closing of the gate of\n\n^ This is the orthodox Ash'arī position, which contrasts with that of the Khawārij and Mu'tazila, who taught that the commission of a mortal sin necessarily entails eternal punishment. (Ash'arī, Maqālāt, 124; Laqqānī, 147; Ghazālī, Iḥyā', I. 104 [K. Qawā'id al-'aqā'id, faṣl 4, mabḥath 3; tr. Faris, Foundations, 105].)\n\n37\n\n---\n\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\n\nrepentance', and by God's statement (Exalted is He!): And We have set a barrier before them and a barrier behind them [to the end of] the verse. And in the same wise, 'Alī (may God ennoble his face) said, 'Faith appears in the heart as a white gleam. As faith grows, so does its whiteness, until, when the bondsman's faith is complete, the whiteness covers his entire heart. And hypocrisy appears as a black speck, the blackness of which grows in proportion to it, until, when the hypocrisy becomes complete, the heart becomes entirely black.'\n\nYou have therefore come to know that good character proceeds sometimes from one's nature and innate disposition [fiṭra], sometimes from accustoming oneself to beautiful deeds, and sometimes from seeing and keeping the company of people who perform them, who are the companions of charity and the brethren of righteousness. For one nature can purloin both good and evil from another. The man in whom all three aspects are manifest, so that he is virtuous by nature, by habituation and by education, is possessed of the supreme virtue; similarly, he who is by nature ignoble, and chances to fall in with bad company from which he learns, and for whom the means of evildoing are readily available so that he grows accustomed to wickedness, is the most distant of men from God (Exalted is He!). Between these two degrees there are people of disparate participation in these three aspects, each of whom is possessed of a degree of proximity or remoteness in accordance with his quality and state. Whoso works an atom's weight of good shall see it, and whoso works an atom's weight of ill shall see it also. And God wronged them not; rather did they wrong themselves.\n\n^ Although repentance until the last moment of life is possible for every individual, it is said that the 'gate of repentance is closed' when the heart is so overgrown with corruption and heedlessness that repentance is very improbable. Cf. Zabīdī, VII. 341.\nᴮ The verse continues: and have covered them so that they see not.\nᶜ Zabīdī (VII. 342) reminds us here of the popular proverb al-ṭab' al-salīm samāq: 'a sound nature is a thief', meaning that it acquires the traits of the people with whom it associates.\n\n38\n\n---\n\n[22.5]\nAn Exposition Detailing the Method Used in Refining the Character\n\nYOU have learnt from the foregoing that an equilibrium of the traits of character causes the soul to be healthy, while any deviation from this equilibrium constitutes a sickness and a disorder within it, just as an equilibrium of the humours of the body leads to its health, and an imbalance entails its sickness. Let us therefore take the human body as our metaphor, and proceed with our discourse as follows.\n\nThe soul, in being divested of ugly traits and qualities and given virtuous and beautiful ones, is like a body, which may be cured through the removal of diseases and the restoration of health. Just as the basic constitution is usually in equilibrium, which a transforming disorder afflicts through the effects of food, air and other circumstances, so also every child is born in equilibrium and with a sound innate disposition: it is only his parents who make of him a Jew, a Christian or a Zoroastrian; that is, it is through familiarity and education that ugly customs are acquired. And just as the body is not initially created complete, but rather moves towards completion and strength through its growth (provided by nourishment) and upbringing, so too the soul is created deficient, with its completion and perfection being present in a latent form, and will only become perfected through training [tarbiya], the refinement of the character, and being nourished with knowledge. Just as when the body is healthy the physician should establish the canon\n\n^ See above, p.18A.\n\n39\n\n---\n\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\n\nwhich will maintain this health; and when it is ill he should restore it to health: similarly, when your soul is pure, clean and of good character you should strive to keep it in this way and strengthen and purify it yet further, and when it is not, you should struggle to make it so. And just as a disorder which changes the body's equilibrium and brings about its sickness may only be treated through its opposite (if it proceeds from heat then through something cooling, and vice versa); similarly, the ugliness which is the heart's sickness can only be treated with its own opposite, so that the disease of ignorance is treated by education, that of avarice by giving money away, that of pride by self-effacement, and that of greed by forcibly restraining oneself from the things one craves. The curing of a sick body requires that one endure the bitter taste of the medicine and persevere in renouncing certain things one desires; and in like fashion, in the treatment of the heart's sickness one must endure the bitterness of struggle and steadfastness—this is even more the case, in truth, since one can escape a bodily illness through death, whereas the sickness of the heart (and we seek refuge with God!) is a sickness which abides even after death, and for all eternity.\n\nA cooling medicine will not be sufficient to effect the cure of a disorder caused by heat unless it be administered in a certain measure, which will vary according to the severity or mildness of the complaint and the length of time for which it has been present. It is essential that there be a standard measure for this by which the efficient amount to be given may be known, since if the wrong quantity is administered the disorder will be exacerbated. The opposites with which the traits of character are treated must also be provided with a standard measure: just as the quantity of medicine used is taken in accordance with the sickness, so that the physician will not give any treatment until he knows whether the disease is caused by heat or cold, and has ascertained the degree to which the temperature is high or low, and will only then turn to the conditions of the body and the\n\n40\n\n---\n\nDisciplining the Soul\n\nweather, the profession, age and other circumstances of the patient, and will then, in accordance with all this, begin his treatment; so also the guiding Shaykh, who is the physician of his aspirants' souls and the treater of the hearts of those who wish for guidance, should not impose any specific duties and forms of self-discipline upon them until he has learnt about their characters and ascertained the diseases from which they suffer.\n\nWere a physician to treat all of his patients with a single medicine he would kill most of them; and so it is with the Shaykh, who, were he to charge all his aspirants with one kind of exercise, would destroy them and kill their hearts. Rather, attention should be paid to the illness of each aspirant, his circumstances, his age, his constitution, and the capacity of his body to perform such exercises, which should be prescribed on this basis. If the aspirant is a beginner, and is ignorant of the provisions of the Law, he should first be taught about ritual purity and prayer, and the external acts of worship. If he is occupied in gaining money from forbidden sources or is regularly perpetrating some wrongdoing, he should be asked first to forsake this. And when he is made outwardly beautiful through acts of worship, and his members have been purified from external transgressions, the Shaykh should look, through the evidence provided by his states, to what lies within him in order to ascertain his character and the diseases of his heart. At this point, should he perceive that he has wealth in excess of what he needs, he should take it from him and give it in charity in order to empty his heart of it and to prevent him from being distracted. Should he perceive that frivolity, pride and self-esteem have taken hold of him he should instruct him to go to the marketplaces and beg, since self-esteem and love of authority can only be broken by humiliation, of which begging is the most intense form. He will require him to persist in this for a period until his pride and self-esteem are destroyed, for pride, and also frivolity, are among the illnesses which lead to destruction.\n\n41\n\n---\n\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\n\nShould the Shaykh see that the body and dress of the aspirant are usually clean, and that his heart inclines to this and is pleased with it, he will give him a job as a latrine attendant and cleaner, and instruct him to sweep filthy places, and to remain in the kitchen and places where there is smoke until the attachment he has to cleanliness departs. For someone who cleans and adorns his clothes, and makes requests for clean' patched garments [muraqqa'āt] and coloured prayer-carpets is no different from a bride who spends the entire day decorating herself. There is no difference at all between a man who worships himself and one who worships an idol: inasmuch as one worships anything other than God one is veiled from Him. Therefore, anyone who pays attention to anything in his dress, apart from its being from a legitimate source and ritually pure, in a way which turns his heart towards it, is occupied with his own self.\n\nIt is one of the subtle aspects of discipline that if an aspirant does not permit himself to renounce frivolity or some other trait at all, and will not allow himself its opposite all at once, he should move from one blameworthy trait of character to another which is less harmful, in the manner of a man who washes off blood with urine, and then rinses off the urine with water, if water would not have removed the blood; and like a schoolboy who loves to play with balls and sticks and suchlike things, and then is progressively drawn from such play by being encouraged to improve his appearance and to wear fine clothes, and then from this by being encouraged to seek\n\n^ The distinctive wear of Sufis in many medieval Islamic societies. (Cf. Hujwīrī, 45-57; Anawatī and Gardet, 37.) On the spiritual veil which lies in distraction by appearances, Ghazālī writes elsewhere of those who, veiled by the vice of spiritual illusion (ghurūr), 'renounce silk and other fine stuffs, and ask instead for expensive patched garments [...] and dyed carpets [...] and think that they are Sufis simply because of the colour of their clothes and the fact that it is patched, forgetting that the Sufis only wear patched garments because their clothes are threadbare'. (Iḥyā', III. 348 [K. Dhamm al-ghurūr, ṣinf 3].)\n\n42\n\n---\n\nDisciplining the Soul\n\ninfluence and authority, and then by being encouraged to long for the Afterlife. The case of the man whose soul does not permit him to abandon his illusion all at once is similar: let him move on to a lesser form of this vice. And so it is with the remaining traits.\n\nShould the Shaykh see that the aspirant is usually under the influence of greed for food, he should oblige him to fast and to reduce the amount he eats. Next, he should instruct him to prepare delicious meals and serve them to others without tasting them himself, until his soul becomes stronger and he becomes used to forbearance, whereupon his greed will have been subjugated. And should he see that the aspirant is a young man longing to be married, but cannot afford to do so, he should instruct him to fast. Should this not do away with his sexual desire, he should tell him to break his fast with water and no bread or vice versa on alternate evenings, and forbid him to eat meat or any other thing with his bread, until his soul is reduced to submission and his sexual desire broken. For at the beginning of aspirancy there is no cure more effective than hunger.\n\nIf he sees that his is a predominantly irascible disposition he should oblige him always to be gentle and quiet, and should make him serve and keep the company of an ill-mannered man in order that he might train his soul to tolerate him. One of the Sufis habituated his soul to mildness and freed himself from excessive anger by hiring a man to insult him in public: he forced himself to be forbearing and to suppress his anger, continuing in this way until his nature became characterised by a proverbial gentleness. Another of them felt the presence of\n\n^ Ghazālī's direct or indirect source for this section seems to have been an ethical tract now conserved at the Qarawiyyīn Library in Fez, which has been attributed to Nicolaus of Laodicea, an obscure Aristotelian with mild neo-Platonic interests who lived at the time of Julian the Apostate (M.C. Lyons, 'A Greek Ethical Treatise'.) The person hired in this particular story was a woman called طلوبس من أهل طليوس. (Ed. Badawi, in appendix I to his edition of the Arabic Nicomachean Ethic, p.414.)\n\n43\n\n---\n\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\n\ncowardice and faint-heartedness in his soul, and, wishing to acquire the trait of bravery, made it his practice to put to sea in the wintertime when the swell was at its roughest. The ascetics used to treat laziness in worship by standing up all night on pillars. And one of the Shaykhs at the outset of his own aspirancy, finding that his soul was lazy during his night devotions, for this reason forced himself to stand on his head all night so that his soul would willingly accept standing on his feet. Another treated his love of wealth by selling all that he owned and throwing the proceeds into the sea, fearing that if he gave it to other people he would be afflicted by self-satisfaction and a desire to be seen doing this.\n\nThese examples should teach you the way to treat hearts. It is not our intention to mention the medicine for each sickness, for this will be done in the remaining Books; rather what we intend to do here is to draw the reader's attention to the fact that the general technique consists in doing the opposite of everything\n\n^ It appears that this particular anecdote was originally—and perhaps oddly—attributed to Dionysios. ('Nicolaus', ed. Badawi, 413; see Lyons, 'A Greek Ethical Treatise', 46.) It is also told in Miskawayh's Tahdhīb.\nᴮ Cited by 'Nicolaus' (ed. Badawi, 414; tr. Lyons, 46).\nᶜ Cf. 'Nicolaus' (ed. Badawi, 414; tr. Lyons, 46): 'An example of that was the man who sold all that he owned and threw the purchase money into the sea—Crates was his name. After that he cried, \"Crates frees himself!\"' Hujwīrī (Kashf al-maḥjūb, tr. Nicholson, 228) believes that the protagonist of the story was the eccentric Baghdad mystic al-Shiblī. Ibn al-Jawzī, although unaware of its pedigree, has doubts about the ethical value of the tale; these are, however, credibly dispelled by Zabīdī (Itḥāf, I. 37-8), who explains that such lessons are not cited as general principles of conduct, but merely illustrate ways in which the religious obligation of attaining tawakkul, true reliance upon God, may for certain individuals under the guidance of a Shaykh sometimes take precedence over those usages of religion which, while recommended, are not obligatory. Cf. also Kably, 'Satan dans l'Iḥyā'', 36-7, where Ibn al-Jawzī's remarks are similarly dismissed.\n\n44\n\n---\n\nDisciplining the Soul\n\nthat the soul inclines to and craves. God (Exalted is He!) has summed up all of these things in His statement: And whoever fears the standing before his Lord, and forbids his soul its whim, for him Heaven shall be the refuge of rest.\n\nThe important principle in the spiritual struggle is to carry out what one has determined upon: if one determines to renounce a desire, then the means to pursue it will be made easier; this is a trial and a test from God, and one should therefore have fortitude and perseverance. If one habituates oneself to violating one's own resolution the soul will come to take pleasure in this and will be corrupted. Should it happen that a man does violate his resolution, he should compel his soul to accept a punishment for this, as we have already mentioned in [the section on] the chastisement of the soul in the Book of Self-Examination and Vigilance: if he does not intimidate it through the presence of a punishment it will defeat him and make the following of the desire seem good, and this will corrupt his self-discipline entirely.\n\n^ Iḥyā', IV. 346-8 (K. al-Murāqaba, Murābata 4), a list of incidents which includes the well-known story in which Junayd forced himself to bathe fully-clothed in cold water as a punishment for his nafs, which had demanded that he delay the required ablutions for his prayers until hot water became available.\n\n45",

If, however, he were to try with all his might to pull these traits out by the roots, he would prove able only to destroy its strength and restore it to moderation. Therefore the correct course of action is for him to intend to uproot it, which will permit him to change it to the required level. This secret, however, should not be revealed to the aspirant, for a foolish man might be deceived by it, and think that his anger and his withholding of his money were just.\\n\\n[22.4]\\nA General Exposition of the Means by which Good Character may be Acquired\\n\\nYOU have come to know that goodness of character proceeds from an equilibrium in the rational faculty brought about through sound wisdom, and in the irascible and appetitive faculties through their submission to the intellect and the Law. This equilibrium may come about in two ways.\\n\\nOne of these is through Divine grace, and completeness of innate disposition [kam\\u0101l fi\\u1e6dr\\u012b], whereby a man is born and created with a sound intellect and a good character, and is preserved from the powers of desire and anger, which are created in him moderate and submissive to the intellect and the Law. Thus he becomes learned without an instructor, and disciplined without being subject to any discipline, in the manner of Jesus, the son of Mary, and John, the son of Zacharias, and all the other prophets (may the blessings of God be upon them all). Yet it is not to be deemed improbable that certain things should exist in a man's nature and disposition which can be obtained through acquisition: some children are created truthful, generous and courageous, while in others the opposite characteristics have been set, so that [in this case] good qualities can only be acquired through habituation and associating with those who possess them, and also through education.\\n\\nThe second is the acquisition of these traits of character by\\n\\n^ For this special virtue in Jesus see below, p.54.\\n\\n30\\n31\\n\\n---\\n\\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\\n\\nmeans of spiritual struggle and exercise. By this I mean the constraining of the soul to perform the actions which necessarily proceed from the trait desired. For example, a man who wishes to acquire the quality of generosity must oblige himself to do generous things; that is, to give of what he owns, and must continue in this wise, affecting this thing and struggling with his soul until his nature conforms to it and it becomes easy, at which point he will have become a generous person. Similarly in the case of the man dominated by arrogance who wishes to inculcate in his soul the quality of modesty: he should persist for a lengthy period in imitating the behaviour of the modest and struggling against his soul until such behaviour becomes one of his traits and part of his nature, at which time it will come easily. Every one of the qualities which the Law deems praiseworthy is acquired by these means, the end point of which is that the act should be pleasurable. For the generous man is he that takes pleasure in giving money, not he who gives it reluctantly; and in the same way, the modest man is he who finds modesty delightful.\\n\\nThe religious traits of character cannot take firm root in the soul until it has grown accustomed to every good habit, renounced every evil one, and persevered in this in the wise of one who feels a love for and takes pleasure in beautiful deeds, and loathes and is hurt by ugly ones. As God's Emissary (may God bless him and grant him peace) said: 'Prayer has been made my delight'. As long as worship and the renunciation of forbidden things are felt to be unpleasant and burdensome their performance will be defective, and cannot bring one to full felicity. Certainly, to struggle to persevere with them is a good thing, but only in comparison with abandoning them, not in comparison with doing them willingly. It is in this context that God (Exalted is He!) has said, Seek help in perseverance and in prayer, and truly it is hard save for the humble-minded. And His Emissary (may God bless him and grant him peace) has said, 'Worship God with pleasure, and if you cannot, then with perseverance, for perseverance in something which you dislike contains much good'. Neither is it\\n\\n32\\n\\n---\\n\\nDisciplining the Soul\\n\\nsufficient to obtain the felicity consequent upon good character that obedience to God should be found delightful and disobedience unpleasant at some times and not others; rather this should be constant and remain with one throughout one's life, so that the longer a man's life extends, the more solid and complete will be his virtue. This is why the Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) replied, when asked about felicity: 'It is a long life in the obedience of God'. This is also why the Prophets and the \\u1e62\\u016bf\\u012bs disliked death. 'For this world is the sowing-ground of the next'. The more acts of worship one performs through living a long life, the greater will be the reward, the purer and clearer the soul, and the stronger and more deeply-rooted the good traits of character. For the sole purpose of acts of worship is to influence the heart, and this influence will only grow strong when they are persistently repeated.\\n\\nThe purpose of such traits of character is to cut the love of this world away from the heart, and to set firmly therein the love of God (Exalted is He!), so that one would love nothing so much as the meeting with Him. Such a man will then employ his wealth only in ways which will bring him to Him; likewise with his anger and desires, since these will be at his command, and weighed up in the scales of the intellect and the Law so that he is contented and happy with them. It is wrong to deem it unlikely that one's delight might be in prayer and that one's worship might become delectable, for everyday life draws more wondrous things from the soul: we see kings and the voluptuous rich in constant misery, and the bankrupt gambler so overcome with delight and joy during his gambling that one might well discount the possibility of man's gaining any pleasure without this practice, even after it had taken away his wealth, ruined his home and left God quite penniless, for he will still love and enjoy it by reason of his soul's long familiarity with it. Similarly with the man whose hobby is\\n\\n^ For this proverb, sometimes held to be a \\u1e25ad\\u012bth, see Sakh\\u0101w\\u012b, 351; for Ghaz\\u0101l\\u012b's extensive use of it see Lazarus-Yafeh, 312-4.\\n\\n33\\n\\n---\\n\\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\\n\\npigeons, who may stand all day in the hot sun without feeling any pain due to the pleasure he takes in his birds, and their movements, flight and soaring around in the sky. And there is the sly criminal who boasts of the blows and stabs he receives, and of his steadfastness under the whip, and who goes up to the cross or the gibbet bragging about his endurance of these [punishments], considering this to be a source of pride: he may be torn limb from limb in an attempt to make him confess to his crime or to that committed by another man with his knowledge, and persevere in his denial, and pay no heed to the punishments because of his joy at what he considers to be his courage and virility. Despite the torment provided by his circumstances, he is delighted by them and finds them a source of pride. And there is no condition more ugly and despicable than that of an effeminate man, who imitates women by plucking out his hair, tattooing his face, and keeping their company, so that you see him rejoicing in his state and boasting of the perfection of his effeminacy to other such men. Even the cuppers and sweepers can be seen boasting to one another just as much as the kings and scholars. All of this is the result of habit and persisting in one course for a long period and seeing the same thing in one's acquaintances.\\n\\nSince the soul commonly takes pleasure even in vain things and inclines towards ugliness, how could it not take pleasure in the Truth were it to be restored to it for a while and made to persevere therein? The soul's inclination to these disgusting\\n\\n^ A sport popular in medieval Islamic culture; see for instance Ibn Ab\\u012b'l-Duny\\u0101, Dhamm al-mal\\u0101h\\u012b, ed.

Ghaz\\u0101l\\u012b is assuming that his readers regard it as a rather frivolous and undignified pursuit; as is suggested by the above sources. According to one early jurist, the testimony of a pigeon breeder cannot be accepted in court, for the same reason (Ziadeh, 'Integrity ('Ad\\u0101lah) in Classical Islamic Law', 82). The hobby did, however, find practical application in the carrier pigeon trade; it is interesting to note in passing that the use of carrier pigeons was first introduced to Europe by knights returned from the Crusades: cf. Holmes, 'Life among the Europeans in Palestine and Syria', 31.\\n\\u1d2e For this vice see note A on p.175 below.\\n\\n34\\n\\n---\\n\\nDisciplining the Soul\\n\\nthings is unnatural, and resembles an inclination to the eating of mud; yet even this may gain control over some people and become a habit. As for the inclination to wisdom and the love, knowledge and worship of God, this resembles the inclination towards food and drink. It is an expression of the heart's nature, and is a divine command, while an inclination to the demands of one's desires is in itself something strange, and is not part of its nature. The heart's food is wisdom, knowledge and the love of God (Exalted is He!), yet it diverges from these demands often when afflicted by some disease, just as the stomach may be afflicted by an illness which prevents it from desiring the food and drink which give it life. Thus every man's heart which inclines to anything but the love of God (Exalted is He!) is afflicted by a disease in proportion to this inclination, unless he love a thing because it helps him to love God and to practice his religion\\u2014which is not the symptom of an illness.\\n\\nFrom the foregoing you come to know beyond all doubt that good traits of character may be acquired through self-discipline, by means of imitating, at the outset, the actions which result from such traits so that they may ultimately become part of one's nature. This is one of the wonders of the relationship between the heart and the members [jaw\\u0101ri\\u1e25], by which I mean the soul and the body: the effect of every attribute which appears in the heart must emanate onto the members, so that these move only in conformity to it; similarly, every act performed by the members, at first, makes its way up to the heart, thereby constituting a form of circular movement. To understand this thing a metaphor may be employed, as follows.\\n\\nA man who wishes his soul to acquire the attribute of skilful calligraphy is that he becomes a calligrapher by nature and dis-\\n\\n^ As remarked in the same context by Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, VII.v.3.\\n\\u1d2e The reference to kit\\u0101ba may instead be to the simple act of writing, together with such ancillary skills as were required of the secretarial class. Ghaz\\u0101l\\u012b seems to have drawn this illustration of the process of habituation from al-F\\u0101r\\u0101b\\u012b (Fu\\u1e63\\u016bl, 100).\\n\\n35\\n\\n---\\n\\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\\n\\nposition must do with the member which is the hand those things which the calligrapher does, and devote himself assiduously to this for a long period, during which he imitates the calligrapher by copying his fine script. He continues to persevere in this until it becomes a firmly-rooted attribute in his soul, and, at last, he comes to write naturally with a beautiful hand, whereas he had earlier done so only artificially. It was fine calligraphy itself which rendered his own calligraphy fine, at first through a difficult simulation, the effect of which nevertheless rose to his heart and then descended again from the heart to the member in question to enable him to write well naturally. The case of a man who wishes to become a sage of the soul is similar: he is obliged to do the things which such sages do, namely, a constance application to sagacity, until this attribute becomes attached to his heart and he becomes a sage of the soul.\\n\\nThe case of the man who wishes to become generous, continent, and unassuming is identical: he must perform by simulation the actions associated with these qualities until they become part of his habitual nature. This is the only treatment available. And just as the one who wishes to become a sage of the soul does not despair of achieving his goal when he has wasted one night, but will not reach it if he does so repeatedly for many nights, similarly he who desires to purify his soul and to adorn it with good qualities will neither achieve his goal by worshipping for one day nor be barred from it because for one day he\\n\\n^ Ar. faq\\u012bh al-nafs. A characteristically Ghaz\\u0101lian term applied to a sincere expert in the religious art of reforming souls. This, or its cognate expression the faq\\u012bh al-d\\u012bn ('sage of religion') is contrasted with the faq\\u012bh al-duny\\u0101, the \\\"worldly jurist\\\", who knows the formal requirements of liturgy and law, and yet has no appreciation of their true spiritual function. Ghaz\\u0101l\\u012b chose the root f.q.h to remind people of the original sense of 'understanding', which had become obscured as the word fiqh became increasingly applied to legal casuistry. Cf. I\\u1e25y\\u0101', IV. 342-3 (K. al-Mur\\u0101qaba, Bay\\u0101n \\u1e25aq\\u012bqat al-mutafaqqih), I. 28-9 (K. al-'Ilm, b\\u0101b 3, Bay\\u0101n m\\u0101 buddil min alf\\u0101\\u1e93 al-'ulam\\u0101'). The word fuqah\\u0101' had, however, already been used, e.g. by Tustar\\u012b (Mu'\\u0101rada, 4-5), to denote people learned in spiritual matters.\\n\\n36\\n\\n---\\n\\nDisciplining the Soul\\n\\nsinned. This is the purport of our [credal] statement that one mortal sin does not necessarily lead to eternal damnation. However, one day of idleness will invite [the student] to the next, and then, little by little, to others, until his soul takes pleasure in laziness and abandons studying altogether so that the merit which attaches to being a sage passes him by. Similarly, one venial sin leads to another, until the basis for salvation is lost through the destruction of the basis of faith at the moment of death. And just as the effect of a single night on the acquisition of the status of sage of the soul is not decisive since this status which appears little by little, like the growth and increasing height of the body; similarly the effect of one act of devotion on the purification and cleansing of the soul is not immediately perceptible. Nonetheless, one should not undervalue even a small amount of devotion, for a large quantity, which is made up of individual small acts, has an effect, so that each one of them must exercise an influence. There is not a single act of devotion but that it has an effect, even though it be concealed, and it must therefore necessarily entail some reward, since reward is in proportion to its effect; and this is the case with sin also. How many sages there are who deem the wasting of a day and a night a paltry thing, and continue to do so, procrastinating day after day until at last their natures depart from the acquisition of understanding: likewise is it with the man who underestimates small sins, and procrastinates and delays his repentance day after day, until such time as death suddenly seizes him, or the darkness of his sins wraps up in his heart so that he is unable to repent (for a little ever invites one to abundance), and his heart becomes loaded with the chains of desires, from which he is unable to release himself. This is what is meant by the 'closing of the gate of\\n\\n^ This is the orthodox Ash'ar\\u012b position, which contrasts with that of the Khaw\\u0101rij and Mu'tazila, who taught that the commission of a mortal sin necessarily entails eternal punishment.

And in the same wise, 'Al\\u012b (may God ennoble his face) said, 'Faith appears in the heart as a white gleam. As faith grows, so does its whiteness, until, when the bondsman's faith is complete, the whiteness covers his entire heart. And hypocrisy appears as a black speck, the blackness of which grows in proportion to it, until, when the hypocrisy becomes complete, the heart becomes entirely black.'\\n\\nYou have therefore come to know that good character proceeds sometimes from one's nature and innate disposition [fi\\u1e6dra], sometimes from accustoming oneself to beautiful deeds, and sometimes from seeing and keeping the company of people who perform them, who are the companions of charity and the brethren of righteousness. For one nature can purloin both good and evil from another. The man in whom all three aspects are manifest, so that he is virtuous by nature, by habituation and by education, is possessed of the supreme virtue; similarly, he who is by nature ignoble, and chances to fall in with bad company from which he learns, and for whom the means of evildoing are readily available so that he grows accustomed to wickedness, is the most distant of men from God (Exalted is He!). Between these two degrees there are people of disparate participation in these three aspects, each of whom is possessed of a degree of proximity or remoteness in accordance with his quality and state. Whoso works an atom's weight of good shall see it, and whoso works an atom's weight of ill shall see it also. And God wronged them not; rather did they wrong themselves.\\n\\n^ Although repentance until the last moment of life is possible for every individual, it is said that the 'gate of repentance is closed' when the heart is so overgrown with corruption and heedlessness that repentance is very improbable. Cf. Zab\\u012bd\\u012b, VII. 341.\\n\\u1d2e The verse continues: and have covered them so that they see not.\\n\\u1d9c Zab\\u012bd\\u012b (VII. 342) reminds us here of the popular proverb al-\\u1e6dab' al-sal\\u012bm sam\\u0101q: 'a sound nature is a thief', meaning that it acquires the traits of the people with whom it associates.\\n\\n38\\n\\n---\\n\\n[22.5]\\nAn Exposition Detailing the Method Used in Refining the Character\\n\\nYOU have learnt from the foregoing that an equilibrium of the traits of character causes the soul to be healthy, while any deviation from this equilibrium constitutes a sickness and a disorder within it, just as an equilibrium of the humours of the body leads to its health, and an imbalance entails its sickness. Let us therefore take the human body as our metaphor, and proceed with our discourse as follows.\\n\\nThe soul, in being divested of ugly traits and qualities and given virtuous and beautiful ones, is like a body, which may be cured through the removal of diseases and the restoration of health. Just as the basic constitution is usually in equilibrium, which a transforming disorder afflicts through the effects of food, air and other circumstances, so also every child is born in equilibrium and with a sound innate disposition: it is only his parents who make of him a Jew, a Christian or a Zoroastrian; that is, it is through familiarity and education that ugly customs are acquired. And just as the body is not initially created complete, but rather moves towards completion and strength through its growth (provided by nourishment) and upbringing, so too the soul is created deficient, with its completion and perfection being present in a latent form, and will only become perfected through training [tarbiya], the refinement of the character, and being nourished with knowledge. Just as when the body is healthy the physician should establish the canon\\n\\n^ See above, p.18A.\\n\\n39\\n\\n---\\n\\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\\n\\nwhich will maintain this health; and when it is ill he should restore it to health: similarly, when your soul is pure, clean and of good character you should strive to keep it in this way and strengthen and purify it yet further, and when it is not, you should struggle to make it so. And just as a disorder which changes the body's equilibrium and brings about its sickness may only be treated through its opposite (if it proceeds from heat then through something cooling, and vice versa); similarly, the ugliness which is the heart's sickness can only be treated with its own opposite, so that the disease of ignorance is treated by education, that of avarice by giving money away, that of pride by self-effacement, and that of greed by forcibly restraining oneself from the things one craves. The curing of a sick body requires that one endure the bitter taste of the medicine and persevere in renouncing certain things one desires; and in like fashion, in the treatment of the heart's sickness one must endure the bitterness of struggle and steadfastness\\u2014this is even more the case, in truth, since one can escape a bodily illness through death, whereas the sickness of the heart (and we seek refuge with God!) is a sickness which abides even after death, and for all eternity.\\n\\nA cooling medicine will not be sufficient to effect the cure of a disorder caused by heat unless it be administered in a certain measure, which will vary according to the severity or mildness of the complaint and the length of time for which it has been present. It is essential that there be a standard measure for this by which the efficient amount to be given may be known, since if the wrong quantity is administered the disorder will be exacerbated. The opposites with which the traits of character are treated must also be provided with a standard measure: just as the quantity of medicine used is taken in accordance with the sickness, so that the physician will not give any treatment until he knows whether the disease is caused by heat or cold, and has ascertained the degree to which the temperature is high or low, and will only then turn to the conditions of the body and the\\n\\n40\\n\\n---\\n\\nDisciplining the Soul\\n\\nweather, the profession, age and other circumstances of the patient, and will then, in accordance with all this, begin his treatment; so also the guiding Shaykh, who is the physician of his aspirants' souls and the treater of the hearts of those who wish for guidance, should not impose any specific duties and forms of self-discipline upon them until he has learnt about their characters and ascertained the diseases from which they suffer.\\n\\nWere a physician to treat all of his patients with a single medicine he would kill most of them; and so it is with the Shaykh, who, were he to charge all his aspirants with one kind of exercise, would destroy them and kill their hearts. Rather, attention should be paid to the illness of each aspirant, his circumstances, his age, his constitution, and the capacity of his body to perform such exercises, which should be prescribed on this basis. If the aspirant is a beginner, and is ignorant of the provisions of the Law, he should first be taught about ritual purity and prayer, and the external acts of worship. If he is occupied in gaining money from forbidden sources or is regularly perpetrating some wrongdoing, he should be asked first to forsake this. And when he is made outwardly beautiful through acts of worship, and his members have been purified from external transgressions, the Shaykh should look, through the evidence provided by his states, to what lies within him in order to ascertain his character and the diseases of his heart. At this point, should he perceive that he has wealth in excess of what he needs, he should take it from him and give it in charity in order to empty his heart of it and to prevent him from being distracted. Should he perceive that frivolity, pride and self-esteem have taken hold of him he should instruct him to go to the marketplaces and beg, since self-esteem and love of authority can only be broken by humiliation, of which begging is the most intense form. He will require him to persist in this for a period until his pride and self-esteem are destroyed, for pride, and also frivolity, are among the illnesses which lead to destruction.\\n\\n41\\n\\n---\\n\\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\\n\\nShould the Shaykh see that the body and dress of the aspirant are usually clean, and that his heart inclines to this and is pleased with it, he will give him a job as a latrine attendant and cleaner, and instruct him to sweep filthy places, and to remain in the kitchen and places where there is smoke until the attachment he has to cleanliness departs. For someone who cleans and adorns his clothes, and makes requests for clean' patched garments [muraqqa'\\u0101t] and coloured prayer-carpets is no different from a bride who spends the entire day decorating herself. There is no difference at all between a man who worships himself and one who worships an idol: inasmuch as one worships anything other than God one is veiled from Him. Therefore, anyone who pays attention to anything in his dress, apart from its being from a legitimate source and ritually pure, in a way which turns his heart towards it, is occupied with his own self.\\n\\nIt is one of the subtle aspects of discipline that if an aspirant does not permit himself to renounce frivolity or some other trait at all, and will not allow himself its opposite all at once, he should move from one blameworthy trait of character to another which is less harmful, in the manner of a man who washes off blood with urine, and then rinses off the urine with water, if water would not have removed the blood; and like a schoolboy who loves to play with balls and sticks and suchlike things, and then is progressively drawn from such play by being encouraged to improve his appearance and to wear fine clothes, and then from this by being encouraged to seek\\n\\n^ The distinctive wear of Sufis in many medieval Islamic societies.

On the spiritual veil which lies in distraction by appearances, Ghaz\\u0101l\\u012b writes elsewhere of those who, veiled by the vice of spiritual illusion (ghur\\u016br), 'renounce silk and other fine stuffs, and ask instead for expensive patched garments [...] and dyed carpets [...] and think that they are Sufis simply because of the colour of their clothes and the fact that it is patched, forgetting that the Sufis only wear patched garments because their clothes are threadbare'. (I\\u1e25y\\u0101', III. 348 [K. Dhamm al-ghur\\u016br, \\u1e63inf 3].)\\n\\n42\\n\\n---\\n\\nDisciplining the Soul\\n\\ninfluence and authority, and then by being encouraged to long for the Afterlife. The case of the man whose soul does not permit him to abandon his illusion all at once is similar: let him move on to a lesser form of this vice. And so it is with the remaining traits.\\n\\nShould the Shaykh see that the aspirant is usually under the influence of greed for food, he should oblige him to fast and to reduce the amount he eats. Next, he should instruct him to prepare delicious meals and serve them to others without tasting them himself, until his soul becomes stronger and he becomes used to forbearance, whereupon his greed will have been subjugated. And should he see that the aspirant is a young man longing to be married, but cannot afford to do so, he should instruct him to fast. Should this not do away with his sexual desire, he should tell him to break his fast with water and no bread or vice versa on alternate evenings, and forbid him to eat meat or any other thing with his bread, until his soul is reduced to submission and his sexual desire broken. For at the beginning of aspirancy there is no cure more effective than hunger.\\n\\nIf he sees that his is a predominantly irascible disposition he should oblige him always to be gentle and quiet, and should make him serve and keep the company of an ill-mannered man in order that he might train his soul to tolerate him. One of the Sufis habituated his soul to mildness and freed himself from excessive anger by hiring a man to insult him in public: he forced himself to be forbearing and to suppress his anger, continuing in this way until his nature became characterised by a proverbial gentleness. Another of them felt the presence of\\n\\n^ Ghaz\\u0101l\\u012b's direct or indirect source for this section seems to have been an ethical tract now conserved at the Qarawiyy\\u012bn Library in Fez, which has been attributed to Nicolaus of Laodicea, an obscure Aristotelian with mild neo-Platonic interests who lived at the time of Julian the Apostate (M.C. Lyons, 'A Greek Ethical Treatise'.) The person hired in this particular story was a woman called \\u0637\\u0644\\u0648\\u0628\\u0633 \\u0645\\u0646 \\u0623\\u0647\\u0644 \\u0637\\u0644\\u064a\\u0648\\u0633. (Ed. Badawi, in appendix I to his edition of the Arabic Nicomachean Ethic, p.414.)\\n\\n43\\n\\n---\\n\\nSPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE\\n\\ncowardice and faint-heartedness in his soul, and, wishing to acquire the trait of bravery, made it his practice to put to sea in the wintertime when the swell was at its roughest. The ascetics used to treat laziness in worship by standing up all night on pillars. And one of the Shaykhs at the outset of his own aspirancy, finding that his soul was lazy during his night devotions, for this reason forced himself to stand on his head all night so that his soul would willingly accept standing on his feet. Another treated his love of wealth by selling all that he owned and throwing the proceeds into the sea, fearing that if he gave it to other people he would be afflicted by self-satisfaction and a desire to be seen doing this.\\n\\nThese examples should teach you the way to treat hearts. It is not our intention to mention the medicine for each sickness, for this will be done in the remaining Books; rather what we intend to do here is to draw the reader's attention to the fact that the general technique consists in doing the opposite of everything\\n\\n^ It appears that this particular anecdote was originally\\u2014and perhaps oddly\\u2014attributed to Dionysios. ('Nicolaus', ed. Badawi, 413; see Lyons, 'A Greek Ethical Treatise', 46.) It is also told in Miskawayh's Tahdh\\u012bb.\\n\\u1d2e Cited by 'Nicolaus' (ed. Badawi, 414; tr. Lyons, 46).\\n\\u1d9c Cf. 'Nicolaus' (ed. Badawi, 414; tr. Lyons, 46): 'An example of that was the man who sold all that he owned and threw the purchase money into the sea\\u2014Crates was his name. After that he cried, \\\"Crates frees himself!\\\"' Hujw\\u012br\\u012b (Kashf al-ma\\u1e25j\\u016bb, tr. Nicholson, 228) believes that the protagonist of the story was the eccentric Baghdad mystic al-Shibl\\u012b. Ibn al-Jawz\\u012b, although unaware of its pedigree, has doubts about the ethical value of the tale; these are, however, credibly dispelled by Zab\\u012bd\\u012b (It\\u1e25\\u0101f, I. 37-8), who explains that such lessons are not cited as general principles of conduct, but merely illustrate ways in which the religious obligation of attaining tawakkul, true reliance upon God, may for certain individuals under the guidance of a Shaykh sometimes take precedence over those usages of religion which, while recommended, are not obligatory. Cf. also Kably, 'Satan dans l'I\\u1e25y\\u0101'', 36-7, where Ibn al-Jawz\\u012b's remarks are similarly dismissed.\\n\\n44\\n\\n---\\n\\nDisciplining the Soul\\n\\nthat the soul inclines to and craves. God (Exalted is He!) has summed up all of these things in His statement: And whoever fears the standing before his Lord, and forbids his soul its whim, for him Heaven shall be the refuge of rest.\\n\\nThe important principle in the spiritual struggle is to carry out what one has determined upon: if one determines to renounce a desire, then the means to pursue it will be made easier; this is a trial and a test from God, and one should therefore have fortitude and perseverance. If one habituates oneself to violating one's own resolution the soul will come to take pleasure in this and will be corrupted. Should it happen that a man does violate his resolution, he should compel his soul to accept a punishment for this, as we have already mentioned in [the section on] the chastisement of the soul in the Book of Self-Examination and Vigilance: if he does not intimidate it through the presence of a punishment it will defeat him and make the following of the desire seem good, and this will corrupt his self-discipline entirely.\\n\\n^ I\\u1e25y\\u0101', IV. 346-8 (K. al-Mur\\u0101qaba, Mur\\u0101bata 4), a list of incidents which includes the well-known story in which Junayd forced himself to bathe fully-clothed in cold water as a punishment for his nafs, which had demanded that he delay the required ablutions for his prayers until hot water became available.\\n\\n45\", \"filename\": \"/home/claude/al-ghazali-text-extracted.txt\"}"
