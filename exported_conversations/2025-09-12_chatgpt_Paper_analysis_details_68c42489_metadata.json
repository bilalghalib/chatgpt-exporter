  "executive_summary": "September 2025 - Bilal analyzing Iraq electricity bill and asking foundational questions about watts and solar energy (1000 watts per square meter). Bill is from Engineers' Housing Complex, Iraq. Connection to Solar Iraq training program - this is either prep work or follow-up. Shows hands-on learning/teaching approach using real local infrastructure examples.",
  "significance": "PATTERN VALIDATION - Solar Iraq work (July 2025) continues into September with practical analysis of local electricity infrastructure. Uses real bills as teaching/learning materials. Shows pedagogical approach: start with concrete local examples.",
