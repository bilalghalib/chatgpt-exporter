      "content": "If you’ve got a chicken thigh with skin on, spiced, in a pan with oil at about **medium-high heat (7/10)**, here’s a good approach:  \n\n### Step 1: Start skin-side down  \n- Put it in the pan skin-side down first (don’t move it right away).  \n- Let it cook **7–8 minutes** without flipping, until the skin is golden-brown and crisp.  \n- Don’t flip too early—if the skin sticks, it’s not ready yet.  \n\n### Step 2: Flip and finish  \n- Flip to the other side, lower heat slightly (to 5–6/10), and cook another **6–8 minutes**.  \n- Depending on size, total time is usually **14–18 minutes**.  \n\n### Step 3: Check doneness  \n- Internal temp should reach **74°C / 165°F** near the bone.  \n- If you don’t have a thermometer: pierce near the bone—juices should run clear, not pink.  \n\n👉 Trick: After browning both sides, you can cover the pan for the last few minutes to help it cook through without burning the outside.  \n\nDo you want the skin extra crispy (restaurant-style), or more tender/juicy with spices soaked in?",
