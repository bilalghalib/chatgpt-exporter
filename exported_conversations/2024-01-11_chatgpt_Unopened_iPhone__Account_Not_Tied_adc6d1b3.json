      "content": "It's generally okay to buy a new iPhone and then sell it immediately. Apple won't get mad at you for doing this. Once you purchase a product, it's yours to keep, give away, or sell. However, it's important to sell it through legitimate channels and ensure that the transaction is legal and ethical. Additionally, be aware of any terms and conditions that might apply when you first purchase the iPhone, especially if it's bought under a contract or financing plan.",
