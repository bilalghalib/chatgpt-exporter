Here's a breakdown of the main elements:\n\n1. Sustainable Construction:\n   - Focuses on new affordable housing construction and green building techniques.\n\n2. Repairs & Maintenance:\n   - Covers building maintenance and renovation skills.\n\n3. Resource Efficiency:\n   - Includes energy efficiency, water conservation, and material optimization.\n\n4. Financial Literacy:\n   - Encompasses business financial management, investment planning, and cost-benefit analysis.\n\n5. Climate-Smart Solutions:\n   - Addresses climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in construction.\n\n6. Innovative Construction Technology:\n   - Covers digital technologies, advanced materials, and modern construction methods.\n\nThis visualization provides a clear overview of the main areas you need to focus on in your assessment and curriculum development. It aligns with the key elements mentioned in your TOR, particularly the focus on sustainable practices, innovation, and financial literacy in the construction sector.\n\nYou can use this diagram to:\n\n1. Structure your interview questions and ensure you cover all key areas.\n2. Organize the information you gather from your Grofin call and other research.\n3. Guide the development of your curriculum modules.\n4. Communicate the scope of your project to stakeholders.\n\nIs there any aspect of this visualization you'd like me to modify or expand upon? Or would you like suggestions on how to incorporate these pillars into your conversation with the Grofin representative?",

Thank you, Abdulrani.\n\n00:00:07 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd yeah, we were just reflecting a little bit just a second ago on the fact that we met 12 years ago.\n\n00:00:15 ABDAL GHANY\nIt was 2012 I think.\n\n00:00:19 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, 2012. And it was, you know, the only other time I was in Iraq was when I was six years old.\n\n00:00:26 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd I always remembered the fig trees, the smell of the diesel and the orange blossoms. And I've been interested in working in IDOC for so many years.\n\n00:00:38 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd during the the era, it was the era of Tarex, Baghdad, young people like yourself back then, like myself back then, we're we're working on cool things. And before we get into Growfin and talk about Yanni, what you're doing now these days, I'm really interested to to see kind of the arc like what happened from Ted X and and what what's been your journey from there to to Growfin?\n\n00:01:03 BILAL GHALIB\nYou can. You can pick the, yeah.\n\n00:01:05 ABDAL GHANY\nSo it's been an interesting one actually, Honey, I moved to Basra. I I I worked with the US consulate there in the commercial section and the but Ian Esteralat Fisherikat this a lot fever, that kind of position.\n\n00:01:31 ABDAL GHANY\nIt's somehow happens which I was not looking any ready for it. So it was actually the best year of my life where I diagnosed my weaknesses, which was a lot.\n\n00:01:47 ABDAL GHANY\nI was just put in in in a position it's like I should not be. I could not deliver a lot of things.\n\n00:01:56 ABDAL GHANY\nHowever, there were like also mismanagement everywhere. So from the sea level also there were like mismanaging the company.\n\n00:02:04 ABDAL GHANY\nBut for me it was a life changing position because I just could reflect on myself and my ability, what I need, what I miss and after that I start working on it. So I moved to Belgium in 2013.\n\n00:02:22 ABDAL GHANY\nI think I studied their Master of management. I back to work with the growth in 2000 after a few years and Basra again.\n\n00:02:34 ABDAL GHANY\nI spent five years in Basra and all over the way I was do a continuous education. So I just finished my third master.\n\n00:02:45 ABDAL GHANY\nIt was in development studies in Geneva last last February, Geneva Graduate Institute. And yeah, so I started with them as investment manager with a girlfriend, which was, she's my passion, actually development finance.\n\n00:03:06 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd then I am now the leading Dayra Corporation as a senior investment manager. So yeah, so that's, I mean, I think it was interesting.\n\n00:03:18 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, I think it is. It sounds very interesting as well to me.\n\n00:03:23 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd especially relevant is since what we're doing right now is exploring the curriculum, you know, we want to make sure that the people wind up coming to grow Fin have the skills and competencies necessary. So that girl Fin's like, yes, you, you are the, you're a great candidate for one of our programs or one of our investments.\n\n00:03:43 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd it sounded like you had a really wonderful period of being confronted with your growth areas and doing a lot of, first of all, continuous education. And I'm wondering what kind of support did you have to be able to take that.\n\n00:03:59 BILAL GHALIB\nThat was so challenging? You know, some people could just crumble, right?\n\n00:04:02 BILAL GHALIB\nYou know, you go in, I don't know how to do anything. This is very difficult.\n\n00:04:06 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd some people, apparently, like yourself, thrive in the after a difficult. Like that.\n\n00:04:11 BILAL GHALIB\nSo what do you think were some of the supportive elements in Iraq, you know, for you in that time?\n\n00:04:16 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah, I think, I think family number one can support such decisions. 2nd is the financial means, like if you have some financial means, you can try things you are not really, you know, aware of losing your money or something like that.\n\n00:04:33 ABDAL GHANY\nI mean, you can, you have some so you can lose some and the risk taking will be, you know, more, you will take more risk if you have some money. So I think these two was important.\n\n00:04:47 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd then you're passionate. So I remember like I always from the beginning of my career, after graduation, I always take some money.\n\n00:04:56 ABDAL GHANY\nEven at the beginning it was really like a small amount of money. But I, I set apart something for development.\n\n00:05:04 ABDAL GHANY\nSo every month I put something in. Then I participate in training course or, or anything I find I find it important for me.\n\n00:05:14 ABDAL GHANY\nSo I think this is also some, I mean personal preferences.\n\n00:05:19 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, but it also seems like you were aware of of different development options and, you know, being a part of the TEDx Baghdad community there, you're a part of ecosystems. How do you first get into these ecosystems?\n\n00:05:33 ABDAL GHANY\nI think my first was with, well, it's not with TEDx about that. So the first it was my neighbourhood in Karada and Baghdad.\n\n00:05:41 ABDAL GHANY\nSo there were an international relief NGO, so it's called IRD, International Relief Developments and American NGO. So they had the projects back in 2000, maybe 6-7, they had the projects that working with identifying a new, identifying what the area needs by contacting the, the, the, the, the citizen.\n\n00:06:07 ABDAL GHANY\nSo that was my first interaction with, with NGOs. And then after that I'm in the real start to activate that, which was a life changing also for me.\n\n00:06:18 ABDAL GHANY\nI, I get to know a lot of people. Yeah.\n\n00:06:23 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd from there, like I, I kept allowing all the initiatives and activities.\n\n00:06:30 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah. Are you, are you still in touch with any of the people from that early community?\n\n00:06:35 ABDAL GHANY\nYes, I mean, most of them. So yeah, yeah, from TEDx Baghdad.\n\n00:06:39 ABDAL GHANY\nHe's in Erbil now. Really.\n\n00:06:42 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah, he's based in Erbil. And yeah, a lot of people are.\n\n00:06:46 ABDAL GHANY\nSo yeah, maybe not working with anymore, but yeah, we are still in touch from time to time.\n\n00:06:53 BILAL GHALIB\nI know. I just realized that I didn't get an introduction.\n\n00:06:57 BILAL GHALIB\nYour name and your position and and kind of what you do these days. Yeah, you just.\n\n00:07:04 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So Senior Investment Manager at the growth, we do impact finance and form of debt, debt finance for small and medium enterprises.\n\n00:07:15 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd your name and kind of like what, what does a week look like for you? Like what are you doing on a, a week to week basis?\n\n00:07:21 BILAL GHALIB\nBasically, you know, I've been involved in the innovation ecosystem and the education ecosystem and I'm glad you're one of the first the people that I'm talking to about the Bates project because the finance section and the investment section, my weakest area honestly, but I'm going to be just be quiet.\n\n00:07:42 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So yeah, I am Abdul Anil Hassani.\n\n00:07:46 ABDAL GHANY\nI'm based in RB networking. As I said with the growth and as senior investment manager, growth is a regional or yeah it's a regional fund manager.\n\n00:07:59 ABDAL GHANY\nSo we are working in 15 countries most in Africa and in the Middle East we have or in Arab world we have Iraq, Jordan, Oman and Egypt. So we received development money.\n\n00:08:15 ABDAL GHANY\nWe have our know how experience in deploying it for SMEs in these countries and the underserved, you know the underserved segment. If we're talking about Iraq, usually many companies in Iraq do cannot, I mean even bigger companies cannot get finance credit from from banks because of different factors.\n\n00:08:38 ABDAL GHANY\nBut one of them is that the banks are risk averse banks is they are using the collateral based lending. So if you want to to take $1 million loan, you will need to provide at least two million $3,000,000 collapse, which is real estate.\n\n00:09:03 ABDAL GHANY\nSo almost I mean we are in the bottom of the credits that affect private sector. So we are just above the Yemen and and the Arab board.\n\n00:09:15 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd I mean, you know, it's actually cannot, we cannot really compare because we have oil, we have resources. So that should be not the case.\n\n00:09:25 ABDAL GHANY\nBut yeah, unfortunately the banks are trying. There's some regional banks now are playing more important role than others like FBI, some Lebanese banks.\n\n00:09:38 ABDAL GHANY\nSo these are providing let's let's say new, new methodology of work, maybe new projects. They are doing their risk assessment, proper risk assessment.\n\n00:09:51 ABDAL GHANY\nSo usually when you go to any bank, they just ask for your collateral. They don't care how we will utilize the fund or something like that.\n\n00:10:00 BILAL GHALIB\nSo it sounds like the more well in this new climate that's developing and with growth in especially the more prepared ASME or small or medium sized enterprise is at presenting a a coherent plan and a competent team, the more likely it is inshallah that they'll be able to access some funds. And I'm curious because we're talking about training and sustainable finance training.\n\n00:10:31 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd I'm wondering what are some of the things that you think that the population in Iraq that comes to growth in is doing well and they have good knowledge at? And which elements do you feel like if there was going to be a training on inclusive finance and like, what would we be needing to support people in Iraq on?\n\n00:10:54 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So I think I mean now we are talking about business.\n\n00:10:58 ABDAL GHANY\nLet me tell you about our offering. So we used to give up to $2,000,000 per transaction per loan that back in Basra.\n\n00:11:06 ABDAL GHANY\nBut then when we moved to to Irvine covering the north, the northern area. So we, we adjust our investment strategy, we are now giving up to 250,000 and up to four years.\n\n00:11:25 ABDAL GHANY\nSo this meant a new segment for us smaller businesses, but usually they have higher impact. So you give for example, you give $1 million to a company who has 40 employees or you give it to six companies, each one may have 20.\n\n00:11:44 ABDAL GHANY\nSo you end up like doubling or tripling the the impact especially that's one of our important metrics is job creation or job sustainability. So we'll report that back to our donor.\n\n00:11:59 ABDAL GHANY\nUsually when it come to to the businesses first they are unregistered. This is sometimes provide, I mean it is a problem we used to deal with it.\n\n00:12:11 ABDAL GHANY\nI mean we are not requiring the proper registration. We are just asking even for a work permit, which is not, I mean, in Iraq, you will see that it's, you can't do any business without any permits.\n\n00:12:26 ABDAL GHANY\nSo you can be even a big businesses without any registration or any even work permit unless for example, you're a restaurant, you will need a health permit. But if you go to trade, if you go to construction, you can do anything without any registration.\n\n00:12:42 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd I mean any, no, no single paper. So because I mean, yeah, you can do unless you want to work with the government, they will ask for you.\n\n00:12:50 ABDAL GHANY\nSo and people try of course to avoid the the taxes so they don't register, but we are asking for a minimum of work permit and of course if it's an LLLC, it will be better for us in terms of formalization. The second things that I notice is the financials.\n\n00:13:15 ABDAL GHANY\nPeople don't know anything about financials, about their financials and this is a big headache for us. I mean we create these financials for them.\n\n00:13:27 ABDAL GHANY\nBut also the problem that we need, I mean, because in a growth and we just don't provide just finance, we provide business support, Technical Support. So business support.\n\n00:13:37 ABDAL GHANY\nWe we have two, two parts, it's pre investment and post investment. The pre investment which when someone approach us and we we see it, it's a viable business we can work with, we do some business support, we make them investments ready.\n\n00:13:55 ABDAL GHANY\nSo we work with them to create a good application financials business case to be presented to the financial, financial comments. But usually when we when we are dealing with the financials it's very hard to get numbers.\n\n00:14:13 ABDAL GHANY\nSo they, there is two types, either they are don't have any. So they work as a Layani business is good.\n\n00:14:22 ABDAL GHANY\nI'm living my, my hey, my family's living and we are doing good, which we cannot work with. I mean, if, if this is the case, usually we cannot work with some other people who have some kind of, you know, Excel sheets death terrorists.\n\n00:14:40 ABDAL GHANY\nIt will be sometimes we can work if they have a good details. We, we work with them usually and there is a few, let's say maybe 10 to 20% who already has financial records.\n\n00:14:58 ABDAL GHANY\nThe problem is there was a majority, the majority who has, who has records. But you need to dig deeper to understand it.\n\n00:15:07 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd sometimes they have double record one for the government, one for for themselves and even the one for themselves that you need to dig deeper to get the actual number. And he will be hesitating, for example, telling you that myself is $3,000,000 five million dollar barrier.\n\n00:15:23 ABDAL GHANY\nHe will think that's, you know, it's a secret. He should not just close even for a creditor.\n\n00:15:30 ABDAL GHANY\nSo we need to work really with them, educate them. So that's that's kind of I think the the financial literacy is something very important there.\n\n00:15:41 ABDAL GHANY\nThere there's strong aspect or or area is always a lot of people really will know a lot of information about the industry they work in. So you rarely see someone who don't, I mean who just start the business or do something.\n\n00:16:00 ABDAL GHANY\nIt's either family business or they have been working with someone within the same industry for years and now they are starting a new new venture. So something like that, we usually don't work, don't work with start-ups.\n\n00:16:20 ABDAL GHANY\nWe work with more mature business. We, we are asking for two years of operation.\n\n00:16:27 ABDAL GHANY\nI need to be able to build a good model forecast based on historical data. So we are requesting that we have a small project from the Dutch, sponsored by the Dutch government, which is called the Orange Corner Innovation Fund.\n\n00:16:44 ABDAL GHANY\nIt's a complementary project of Orange Corner. So there is an Orange Corner situation project.\n\n00:16:52 ABDAL GHANY\nAfter they graduated, while they are studying again within the cohort, we provide more trainings and more financial support. So we give the grants monthly allowance prototype of grants until they graduate.\n\n00:17:07 ABDAL GHANY\nThey enter tractor support, we call tractor support, which is a larger fund of around up to €50,000 per per per participants. We choose three to five each cohort.\n\n00:17:22 ABDAL GHANY\nThey will have access to more training. And this fund which is 70% is a grant non repayable, 30% is the 0 interest loan.\n\n00:17:33 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd so this is this is for earlier stage or is this still for the same no.\n\n00:17:38 ABDAL GHANY\nThis is for earlier stages start up so.\n\n00:17:43 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd and how's the pipeline? It sounds like so specifically the Bates project is about sustainable reconstruction.\n\n00:17:52 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd also, you know, one of the impact measures that you guys are looking for are employment measures. But specifically this is going to be for youth and women and for youth and women working in sustainability.\n\n00:18:02 BILAL GHALIB\nSo the Bates project is more likely, as far as I can tell, it's going to be newer businesses, especially since they're going to be younger people earlier in their in their track record and you know, alongside employment. One of my questions is what are the other impact measures that you are looking for at Growth in employment is important, but what are the other elements?\n\n00:18:27 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So, so we are tracking the youth employment.\n\n00:18:32 ABDAL GHANY\nSo it's not, I mean in general that's unemployment in general. But then we have youth and women employment.\n\n00:18:40 ABDAL GHANY\nWe are also tracking if the business is women managed or owned or youth managed and the one, yeah. So this kind of of, yeah.\n\n00:18:55 BILAL GHALIB\nOK. So there's you're not monitoring anything around sustainability practices, solar projects, so.\n\n00:19:04 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So actually it's one of our, it's within our process to to look for ESG.\n\n00:19:15 ABDAL GHANY\nSo we provided, for example, we provide ESG policy for our clients to understand & and implement. So I would say yes, but it's indirect, indirect metrics.\n\n00:19:32 BILAL GHALIB\nSo indirect, meaning it's a part of the selection process or.\n\n00:19:36 ABDAL GHANY\nIt's part of the investment process. So if you want to take a loan from us, first you have to have like an ESG practices and then you have to implement a policy which we provided to you which is the basic of ESG and you know, not something let's say complex, but.\n\n00:19:58 BILAL GHALIB\nIs that something you find similar to the the, the finances where it's not very clear or is it something that Iraqi companies have already prepared when they come to growth in their ESG practices?\n\n00:20:13 ABDAL GHANY\nNo, not really. But usually we are really asking for a minimum thing.\n\n00:20:17 ABDAL GHANY\nSo for example, some companies used not to have contracts with their with their people. So with their stuff they just give salaries and that's it.\n\n00:20:28 ABDAL GHANY\nBut we are we encourage them to have a contract and this contract leads to Social Security contribution or registration and so on. So from these, I mean, if the company, for example, in food industry, we would check the the the health and safety practices and we will provide them with with let's say with the guides or with some consultation around that.\n\n00:21:00 ABDAL GHANY\nThat's for the normal, that's for the normal pipeline for us. If it's, it's different.\n\n00:21:06 ABDAL GHANY\nSo for example, what we can do is we what what's I think what's the positive about the Ruffin is we are agile and we can we have the know how in the finance sector, but we also can can design projects based on the donor requirements. So that's what's happened with the Dutch.\n\n00:21:26 ABDAL GHANY\nUsually we don't deal with with start up. They are too risky for us and we are only giving loans.\n\n00:21:33 ABDAL GHANY\nSo this the Dutch claim came and they say, OK, we want 70% grant, 30% loan, you design the selection, we want to deal with this signet. So you design the projects, give us a budget and apply.\n\n00:21:51 ABDAL GHANY\nSo we did and we, we got it. The same in some other countries, like for example, in Jordan, we worked with Syrian refugees, which is also something not easy to work with, especially if you're if we're talking about financial risks.\n\n00:22:05 ABDAL GHANY\nSo this like it's not not really easy if you are talking about refugees or formal sector, something like that. So I mean we have the know how we can design any anything needed.\n\n00:22:21 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah. One of the things that you were mentioning earlier is that you work with the teams to support them to become investment ready.\n\n00:22:32 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd I was wondering if in that process you formalize the know how into templates or workshops or videos or if you're working with them one-on-one and you have kind of like a case manager that works with the team.\n\n00:22:46 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So it's, it's usually the the investment manager.\n\n00:22:51 ABDAL GHANY\nI mean we don't. I mean sometimes you provide like training sessions, but usually it's 1:00 to 1:00.\n\n00:22:59 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd we did, we did and we did. And an exercise audit exercise years ago, apparently most of them, they don't think it's a business support, They don't realize it's a business support.\n\n00:23:14 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd this is one, I mean, this is a problem from our side. They, they took it for granted like they took it as we are doing our job to give them the loan.\n\n00:23:25 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd maybe it's, it's a lack of communication because it's not a structured way of training, you know, so we, for example, if I will, I will, let's say spend two months with one company to make them investment ready and they think that I'm just doing the report for my company. So this kind of of of thing, yeah, we are trying to communicate clearly that this is the business support we are providing.\n\n00:23:55 ABDAL GHANY\nBut of course, I mean, I think from my perspective, when, whenever it's it's a training session or it's a structure session, a structured session, it will be much easier to recognize as business, of course.\n\n00:24:10 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, that's, that's interesting. It sounds like it's actually a mindset shift because it's like until they leave me alone, you know, and instead thinking about like, wait a second.\n\n00:24:30 BILAL GHALIB\nIf I actually had a better understanding of my financial flows and I would understand how my business is operating, I would know a lot more about the health of my business. You know right now Allah is.\n\n00:24:45 BILAL GHALIB\nYou can't really grow a business if you don't know its momentum, right?\n\n00:24:50 ABDAL GHANY\nExactly, and that's what I mean. For example, we are also asking them to provide us with their financial monthly financial financials, so we can just follow up and see the trends.\n\n00:25:02 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd for the first few months they are doing it for us. But after that, when I go, for example, every quarter at least I, I visit them once and I, I, I just present their numbers and show them the trend, show them what's going on, what's the rest?\n\n00:25:21 ABDAL GHANY\nAnd then they realize, they start realizing that's OK, why I don't do that. So that's yeah, that's exactly what's happened.\n\n00:25:29 BILAL GHALIB\nDo do you think a part of it, this is just a small question is related to operating in cash versus operating digital like having digital transactions because the transactions are record necessarily almost so?\n\n00:25:46 ABDAL GHANY\nThat's yeah, that's one of of, I mean it's widely still until now it's widely cash based economy. Yeah, you don't see any, I mean from from business perspective, yeah, we don't rarely see someone who's fully using his bank account.\n\n00:26:08 ABDAL GHANY\nThey are using the bank account when they need it only to do some international transfers if they have international supplier. Other than that, no.\n\n00:26:17 ABDAL GHANY\nBut I mean, now I don't know if you know, but there is like a booming in the, you know, card payments in Iraq. Yeah.\n\n00:26:30 ABDAL GHANY\nSo hopefully it will check soon.\n\n00:26:33 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, it's yeah, it's the it's about time, Inshallah. OK, so the we, we're getting it.\n\n00:26:42 BILAL GHALIB\nSo this is one of the, the main ideas that I'm developing for the curriculum is more than just skills. The mindset shift is a critical elements of the the learning.\n\n00:26:54 BILAL GHALIB\nAnd it's really interesting to see that it's even a part of the financial literacy element. And I was wondering, do you know off the top of your head like what percentage of the businesses that are going through your, your investments are related to construction and housing and solar installation and and kind of sustainable reconstruction?\n\n00:27:20 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So I think we have, I mean you have a few clients, you have one in most of the big company, construction company.\n\n00:27:30 ABDAL GHANY\nWe have one supplier for tiles and paintings and different construction, two actually one in Basra, but he's defaulted unfortunately. And one in Erbil is new.\n\n00:27:44 ABDAL GHANY\nHe's he has a very high quality projects, Italian projects. We have solar which called Kesk, KESK that's well known in Erbil, the owner, yeah.\n\n00:27:59 ABDAL GHANY\nSo they provide the solar installation and they have solar AC for offices without batteries. So you use it only on on working hours?\n\n00:28:13 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So I I don't recall all of them, but it's there is a few.\n\n00:28:18 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah. So we we don't have a whole lot of time.\n\n00:28:23 BILAL GHALIB\nI wanted to keep a quick short introductory meeting. But Akid inshallah, I hope you don't mind.\n\n00:28:27 BILAL GHALIB\nI'm going to be, you know, developing this curriculum and getting some ideas from you. And potentially, I don't know if it makes sense, but we're also looking for partners in, in the training, some kind of collaboration in the future and hopefully preparing people to be ready for growth in without a lot of hand holding from from your side through this Bates project.\n\n00:28:51 BILAL GHALIB\nIt's it's a, it's a, you know, it's going to be coming down the pipeline for the next four years and hopefully maybe two years after they start, they might be ready. So we want to make sure that we're getting insights from you guys along the way.\n\n00:29:05 BILAL GHALIB\n111 question for me because it's kind of related to Ted X is from your work with Grofin. Is it helping you feel more hopeful about the future of Idol?\n\n00:29:15 BILAL GHALIB\nBecause TEDx was like gathering the people of the dreamers, right? The people that are want to create something.\n\n00:29:20 BILAL GHALIB\nIs there something similar happening for you at this job?\n\n00:29:24 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. I mean, yes, yes, of course, when you are talking, when you are working with development, I mean there is hope always, but I see a progress.\n\n00:29:36 ABDAL GHANY\nIt is I, I always call it natural progress. So we have to be here after 20 years, 30 years.\n\n00:29:45 ABDAL GHANY\nI mean, this is the stage where we have to, we are not doing something special. But I think in general the security is much better even in Baghdad and other provinces.\n\n00:29:59 ABDAL GHANY\nThe for example, this is the government is really providing services. So they are working on on services.\n\n00:30:07 ABDAL GHANY\nKurdistan is a special case. It's a better situation from all over Iraq that I think you will see when you when you argue.\n\n00:30:15 ABDAL GHANY\nSo yeah, there is hope, of course.\n\n00:30:21 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, I think I have actually. Before coming, I prepared a bunch of questions that I didn't use at all.\n\n00:30:29 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, specific areas, topics, interest in training curriculum. Yeah, I think, I think this is this is a good introduction and Nishal Allah, Yani Hamdallah, it turns out that we have this 12 year history and I'll definitely see when I come to Erbil that's yeah.\n\n00:30:48 BILAL GHALIB\nI'm hoping to stay in touch with with you and stay in touch with Grofin to see if maybe there's some collaboration opportunities in this project and yeah, maybe at least.\n\n00:30:59 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So I think I, I talked to David before on the team and I met them even in Geneve.\n\n00:31:05 ABDAL GHANY\nBut yeah, I mean, we, we agreed to have an MOU at some point, but then I think this was really lost with all the time. Yeah.\n\n00:31:16 ABDAL GHANY\nBut I think there is, I mean if there is any potential partnership here, definitely we can.\n\n00:31:23 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, we can. Yeah, I'm a consultant working on the training, but if I can do anything.\n\n00:31:33 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. I think the good thing they mentioned that they worked with the growth in Africa some 10 years back.\n\n00:31:40 ABDAL GHANY\nSo we already passed their vetting. So that's something they were very happy when they knew that because I think the vetting process taking months, if not two years.\n\n00:31:51 ABDAL GHANY\nYeah. So, yeah, well, I think we, I mean, yeah, of course there will be an opportunity maybe in the future projects or this project.\n\n00:32:00 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, actually, actually I just realized, you know, like I gather people interested in a common topic and see if we can find relationships. So I'm doing that when I come to Muslim, maybe I'll do another gathering in Erbil.\n\n00:32:18 BILAL GHALIB\nBut so any of these companies that are working in sustainable developments, I'm doing it like a sustainable reconstruction meet up. Yeah, either way, I had under technology or the KESK.\n\n00:32:28 BILAL GHALIB\nObviously Basima, she'll be inviting her and yeah, I just want to see the landscape and I want people to see each other. But if you have any businesses or if you want to come, it's going to be a small session.\n\n00:32:43 BILAL GHALIB\nInitially it was going to be in Muslim, but yeah, that's the idea is to begin to help the ecosystem working in sustainable reconstruction, to get to know each other and to, yeah, build, build some connections there. It'll be sometime in the week of the 17th Inshallah, but mostly.\n\n00:33:04 ABDAL GHANY\nLet's let's talk about it and let me know. So you will be based in RB.\n\n00:33:09 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, yeah, depends on meetings. I'm going to be meeting with Grofen and I'll be meeting with Basima and and others.\n\n00:33:20 BILAL GHALIB\nSo some in Erbil. But the the meet up, I think we're going to be doing it in Mosul space because the the main initiative is in Mosul, the reconstruction.\n\n00:33:28 ABDAL GHANY\nSo let's, let's keep it out of formality. Just anytime, please let me know.\n\n00:33:33 ABDAL GHANY\nI will show you the city.\n\n00:33:35 BILAL GHALIB\nI don't know if you have.\n\n00:33:37 ABDAL GHANY\nA movement restriction in Erbil? I don't think so.\n\n00:33:40 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, and the Joel Safer Iraqi.\n\n00:33:43 ABDAL GHANY\nOh, you.\n\n00:33:44 BILAL GHALIB\nDon't understand yeah I mean it's been the high but it's tough. I'm going to come in on my idol a passport or I the only one I go to mostly the this whole UN contract.\n\n00:33:57 BILAL GHALIB\nThey want me to send more to my let's wait a minute. Let's go hang out.\n\n00:34:05 BILAL GHALIB\nI was there last in 2019. Let's yeah, let's see like I wonder how many other people you know like recognize space or any there's new generations coming.\n\n00:34:31 BILAL GHALIB\nYeah, it's great. It was great to see you man, and I'll see you definitely very soon.\n\n00:34:37 ABDAL GHANY\nSure, maybe.\n\n00:34:40 BILAL GHALIB\nHave a good day man, thank you for your time.\n\n\n\n"
