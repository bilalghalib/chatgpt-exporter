      "content": "To make your bulgur stick together, try the following methods:\n\n1. **Cook it with less water:** Bulgur that's too dry won't stick together. Add slightly more water than usual and allow the bulgur to cook until it absorbs the liquid fully. The additional moisture can help it bind better.\n\n2. **Mix with a binding agent:**\n   - Add a small amount of flour (like all-purpose or chickpea flour) and mix while it's warm. This will act as a binder when it cools.\n   - Use mashed potatoes or a bit of bread crumbs for a natural binder.\n   - Add an egg if you're making something like patties; the egg will hold the grains together once cooked.\n\n3. **Let it cool slightly:** Bulgur sticks better when it's warm but not too hot. Let it rest for a few minutes after cooking to help it bind.\n\n4. **Mash lightly:** Use a fork or a potato masher to gently mash the bulgur. This will release some starches, making it stickier.\n\n5. **Add a fat or liquid:**\n   - Mix in a bit of olive oil, melted butter, or yogurt to help it stick together.\n   - A small splash of stock or warm water mixed in can also make it more cohesive.\n\nThese techniques should help make your bulgur more cohesive, depending on your recipe. Let me know how it turns out!",
