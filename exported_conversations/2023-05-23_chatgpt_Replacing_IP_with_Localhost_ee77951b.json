Server Configuration: Double-check that the server is properly configured to listen on the localhost IP address (127.0.0.1) and port 5000. Ensure that the server is running and actively serving the desired content.\n\n2. Firewall or Security Settings: It's possible that there are firewall rules or security settings in place that are preventing Safari from accessing the local server at \"localhost.\" Check your system's firewall settings and any security software to ensure they allow connections to the specified port.\n\n3. Browser Cache or Cookies: Clear your browser cache and cookies to eliminate any potential conflicts that may prevent Safari from accessing the URL.\n\n4. Proxy Settings: Check if you have any proxy settings configured in Safari. Incorrect proxy settings can interfere with accessing local URLs.\n\n5. Application-Specific Issues: If the server is running a specific application or framework, there may be application-specific settings or configurations that need to be adjusted to allow access via \"localhost.\" Consult the documentation or support resources for the specific application or framework you are using.\n\nBy investigating these potential issues, you should be able to determine why accessing the URL with \"localhost\" is not working in Safari and take appropriate steps to resolve the problem.",

      "content": "The reason why \"http://127.0.0.1:5000/result/bab74bcf-2861-455a-9e87-bbe1f3fa56ed\" works and \"http://localhost:5000/result/bab74bcf-2861-455a-9e87-bbe1f3fa56ed\" doesn't may be related to how the server is configured or how the DNS resolution is handled on your system.\n\nWhen you use \"http://127.0.0.1:5000,\" you are directly accessing the loopback IP address of your machine. This IP address always refers to the local machine itself. It bypasses any DNS resolution and connects directly to the local network interface, which is why it works in most cases.\n\nOn the other hand, when you use \"http://localhost:5000,\" the URL relies on DNS resolution to map the hostname \"localhost\" to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1. In most cases, this mapping is done automatically by the system's hosts file. However, if there is any misconfiguration in the hosts file or if the DNS resolution is not set up properly on your system, the \"localhost\" hostname may not resolve to the loopback IP address, resulting in the URL not working.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Double-check the system's hosts file: Make sure that the hosts file contains an entry mapping \"localhost\" to the IP address 127.0.0.1. The hosts file location varies depending on the operating system you are using.\n\n2. Flush DNS cache: Clear the DNS cache on your system to ensure that any previous DNS resolution is cleared. The process for flushing the DNS cache varies based on the operating system as well.\n\n3. Check proxy settings: Verify if there are any proxy settings configured in your browser or system that may be interfering with the DNS resolution for \"localhost.\"\n\nBy investigating these possibilities, you should be able to determine why \"http://localhost:5000/result/bab74bcf-2861-455a-9e87-bbe1f3fa56ed\" is not working and take appropriate steps to resolve the issue.",

Open File Explorer and go to the following location: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc`.\n     2. Find the file named `hosts` and open it with a text editor (e.g., Notepad) as an administrator.\n     3. Ensure that there is a line in the file that reads: `127.0.0.1       localhost`.\n     4. If the line is missing or commented out (prefixed with `#`), add or uncomment it.\n     5. Save the changes to the hosts file.\n\n   - On macOS and Linux:\n     1. Open the Terminal application.\n     2. Enter the following command to open the hosts file in a text editor: `sudo nano /etc/hosts`.\n     3. Ensure that there is a line in the file that reads: `127.0.0.1       localhost`.\n     4. If the line is missing or commented out (prefixed with `#`), add or uncomment it.\n     5. Save the changes by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and finally press `Enter` to confirm the filename.\n\n2. Flushing the DNS cache:\n   - On Windows:\n     1. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.\n     2. Run the command: `ipconfig /flushdns`.\n     3. You should see a message indicating that the DNS Resolver Cache was successfully flushed.\n\n   - On macOS:\n     1. Open the Terminal application.\n     2. Run the command: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`.\n     3. You may need to enter your user password.\n     4. You should see a message indicating that the DNS cache has been flushed.\n\n   - On Linux:\n     1. Open the Terminal application.\n     2. Run the command: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`.\n     3. You should see a message indicating that the DNS cache has been flushed.\n\nAfter performing these steps, try accessing \"http://localhost:5000/result/bab74bcf-2861-455a-9e87-bbe1f3fa56ed\" again in Safari and see if it works correctly.",
