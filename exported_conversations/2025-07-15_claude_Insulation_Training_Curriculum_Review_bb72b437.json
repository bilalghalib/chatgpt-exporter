  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is working on an insulation business training program for Mosul, Iraq, designed to transform unemployed youth into professional Home Energy Performance Contractors. They requested a comprehensive review and alignment of their training materials, including curriculum documents, implementation guides, slides, and Arabic language expert interviews from their project knowledge base. The user specifically asked Claude to analyze where these materials align and diverge, develop a process to align slides with implementation guides, and compare everything against Arabic expert feedback to create updated documentation.\n\nClaude conducted a thorough analysis of the training program structure, which follows a 5-day progressive format with a consistent 3-block daily rhythm of Learn, Apply, and Sell activities. The program integrates technical insulation skills with business development, emphasizing hands-on learning, local Mosul context, and cultural considerations like gender-mixed teams and prayer scheduling. Key insights emerged from Arabic interviews with experts Muthanna Al-Mashhadani and Omar Laith, who emphasized that engineers supervise rather than perform manual work, highlighted the massive market opportunity with 80% of Mosul homes needing insulation, and stressed the importance of quality and trust-building over price competition.\n\nAfter the user provided updated slides, they requested new comprehensive system design and detailed implementation tables that would fully align with their revised training structure. Claude created extensive documentation including a complete technical architecture covering training delivery platforms, spreadsheet integration systems, learning management frameworks, station-based learning setups, portfolio development processes, business launch support systems, and scalability planning. The system design emphasizes progressive complexity building from simple Day 1 activities to complete business launch by Day 5, with robust post-training support including 30-day action plans and ongoing mentorship networks. The detailed tables provide granular implementation guidance covering slide-to-activity mapping, competition scoring matrices, material requirements, assessment rubrics, facilitator time management, homework tracking, and supplier engagement schedules.",

I will read the Arabic slowly: “مَن نَفَّسَ عن مؤمن كُرْبَةً…” Then in English: “Whoever relieves a believer’s distress of the distressful aspects of this world, Allah will rescue him from a difficulty of the difficulties of the Hereafter.” This hadith teaches us that when we solve real problems for others, we earn care and compassion in return.\nKey Points:\nOur role is to identify and relieve distress.\nCaring for others is both a moral and practical motivation.\nThis spirit will guide every activity in this module.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul after the conflict, simple actions—like shading a hot room—can ease families’ hardships.”\nActivity Instructions:\u000b No action required; this is purely a reflective opening.\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Participants may not understand Arabic.\u000b   – Solution: Emphasize the translation and its meaning.\u000b • Issue: Silence may feel awkward.\u000b   – Solution: Encourage a brief moment of quiet: “Feel free to close your eyes as you reflect.”\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we’ve grounded ourselves in the purpose of caring and problem‑solving, let’s explore how to build comfort businesses that support dignified living.”\n2\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nBuilding Comfort Businesses for Dignified Living\n🏡 \"Dignified Living\"\n⚡ \"Energy Systems\" \n💼 \"Build Business\"\n🔌\"Save Amps\"\nDay 1\n09 :05 – 09 :15 Building Comfort Businesses for Dignified Living (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Quickly surface participants’ personal goals and set group focus on building comfort‑oriented energy businesses.\nSetup:\u000b • Chairs in a semicircle facing the screen\u000b • Two sticky‑note pads and pens at the front table\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Sticky‑note pads (2 per table)\u000b • Pens (enough for each participant)\u000b • Whiteboard or flipchart + markers\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify each table has pads and pens\u000b • Confirm the slide shows the four keywords clearly\u000b • Ensure whiteboard/flipchart is ready and markers work\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Good morning everyone! To kick off, I’d like you to think about what brings you here today. On the screen you see four words: ‘Dignified Living,’ ‘Energy Systems,’ ‘Build Business,’ and ‘Save Amps.’ Please choose two that best reflect your personal goal for this week. When you’ve decided, shout them out and stick a note on the board.”\nKey Points:\nEngaging everyone immediately builds energy.\nReveals shared priorities (e.g., comfort vs. savings).\nConnects personal goals to our module theme.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul last week, many families said ‘Save Amps’ because generator fuel is so costly—so our work here can really matter.”\nActivity Instructions:\nDisplay slide with the four keywords.\nAsk participants to write their two words on sticky notes.\nInvite them to come up, shout their choices, and place notes on the board.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Room too quiet / hesitant volunteers\u000b – Solution: Prompt specific people by name: “Ahlam, what two would you pick?”\nIssue: Participants pick more than two words\u000b – Solution: Gently remind: “Remember, only two—choose what matters most to you.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great—we see that most of us care about comfort and cost‑savings. Up next: let’s break the ice with a quick activity that’ll bust some heat‑flow myths.”\n3\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIce Breakers - “Hot-Potato Myth Tos”\nDay 1\n09:15 – 09:25 Ice Breaker: Hot‑Potato Myth Toss (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Energize the group and surface common heat misconceptions.\nSetup:\u000b • Participants stay in the semicircle.\u000b • You hold a soft bean‑bag or foam ball (“hot potato”).\nMaterials needed:\u000b • One bean‑bag or foam ball\u000b • Slide listing the four myths\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the slide clearly shows the myths.\u000b • Ensure everyone can see and hear you.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Okay everyone, let’s play ‘Hot‑Potato Myth Toss’ to kick things off. Here are four myths we often hear: ‘724 amps of heat is normal,’ ‘AC needs 50 tons for 100 m²,’ ‘Solar watts equal indoor heat,’ and ‘Bigger generator means better comfort.’ I’ll toss this ‘hot potato’ to someone in the circle. When you catch it, name one of these myths or another you’ve heard about home heat—and then toss it to someone else. Ready? Let’s go!”\nKey Points:\nCommon myths can lead to wasted time and money.\nIdentifying myths is the first step to learning the real energy story.\nA playful start builds energy for the rest of Day 1.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “Many families in Mosul believe that big glass windows keep rooms cool at night—but we’ll test that idea soon.”\nActivity Instructions:\nDisplay the slide with the four myths.\nToss the bean‑bag to a volunteer.\nVolunteer names one myth and tosses to another.\nContinue rapid tosses until time is up.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Silence or hesitation.\u000b – Solution: Prompt with “Can someone try ‘Solar watts equal indoor heat’?”\nIssue: Same person catches every time.\u000b – Solution: Aim your toss toward quieter participants.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great job! We’ve debunked some myths. Now let’s dive into ‘The Real Energy Story’ and see how heat really moves in our homes.”\n4\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nThe Real Energy Story\n100m² Mosul Home Reality:\nDaily cooling need: ~250 kWh (not 500!) \nTypical AC: 2.5-3 tons\nPeak draw: 12-15 Amps\nAverage: 20 Amps (not 290!)\nMonthly cost: 36M IQD\nAfter interventions: 10A = 18M IQD saved\nDay 1\n09:25 – 09:35 The Real Energy Story: 100 m² Mosul Home Reality (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To connect our comfort principles to real data from a Mosul home and show the impact of energy interventions.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen\u000b • Keep participants in their seats from the ice‑breaker\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck loaded and ready\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Make sure all numbers on the slide are clear and readable\u000b • Test your microphone or ensure you can be heard\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “In my family’s home in Mosul, cooling a 100 m² space cost us about 250 kWh per day—half of what many people assume. Our old AC was 2.5–3 tons, drawing 12–15 amps at peak and averaging 20 amps, which ran our generator bill up to 36 million IQD per month. After we applied simple roof and wall measures, our draw dropped to 10 amps and we saved 18 million IQD each month. This shows that small changes can cut both heat and costs dramatically.”\nKey Points:\nActual cooling needs are often lower than myths suggest.\nPeak and average power draws matter for fuel costs.\nSimple retrofits can halve your energy bill.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “Students in Basra found similar savings: adding reflective paint cut their monthly bill in half.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Can anyone share if they’ve seen high generator bills like this?”\nCollect 2–3 quick responses (each about 30 seconds).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Numbers seem confusing.\u000b – Solution: Point to each stat on the slide as you speak.\nIssue: Few people share.\u000b – Solution: Prompt with a personal example: “When I first saw my bill, I almost fainted!”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we’ve seen the real data, let’s clear up any confusion between watts and kilowatt‑hours in our next section: ‘Watts vs kWh: Getting It Right.’”\n5\n\nWatts vs kWh: Getting It Right\nInstantaneous vs Daily:  \nPeak solar: 900 W/m² (noon only!)\nDaily average: 385 W/m² \nHeat gain factor: 15-25% (not 56%!)\nExample:\n100m² roof × 900W × 0.2 × 6 hours = 108 kWh/day \nNOT: 100m² × 900W × 24 hours!\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n09:35 – 09:40 Watts vs kWh: Getting It Right (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To clarify the difference between instantaneous power (watts) and energy over time (kilowatt‑hours) so participants avoid common calculation errors.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen, including the solar elevation graph.\u000b • Participants remain seated and focused on the screen.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with graph and formula examples\u000b • Laser pointer or cursor\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify graph and numbers are clear and legible\u000b • Confirm pointer/device works\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “On this slide you see two key ideas: at noon, solar intensity can reach 900 W per square meter—but only for a short peak period. Over the whole day, the average is closer to 385 W/m². That means when you calculate daily energy, you must multiply by the number of sun‑hours, not by 24 hours. For example, a 100 m² roof at 900 W peak, with a 20 percent heat‑gain factor for six hours, yields about 108 kWh per day—not 2,160 kWh. Understanding this distinction prevents huge over‑estimates of heat gain.”\nKey Points:\nInstantaneous vs. daily: Peak watts occur only for a few hours.\nAverage matters: Use the daily average or sun‑hours, not 24 hours.\nCorrect heat‑gain factor: Typical is 15–25%, not 56%.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Baghdad, installers measure about 5.5 effective sun‑hours daily—so a 50 m² system at 800 W peak and 20% gain gives roughly 44 kWh/day.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Quick—what energy would a 120 m² roof at 800 W peak and 18% gain for 6 hours produce?”\nInvite one volunteer to run the numbers on their phone or scratch paper.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusing watts with watt‑hours.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Watts are like speed MPH; kWh are like miles traveled.”\nIssue: Using 24 hours instead of sun‑hours.\u000b – Solution: Point to the graph’s zero‑reading at dawn and dusk to show no sun.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we have our units straight, let’s move to ‘Understanding CLTD’ to see how temperature differences drive heat flow.”\n6\n\nUnderstanding CLTD\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nCLTD = Cooling Load Temperature Difference \nAccounts for outdoor-indoor temp difference                                                      \nIncludes solar radiation effects                                                      \nTime lag from thermal mass      \nCLF = Cooling Load Factor    \nHeat doesn't enter instantly                                                      \nConcrete delays heat by 4-8 hours                                                      \nPeak indoor heat ≠ peak outdoor temp        \nFormula: Q = U × A × CLTD   \nQ = Heat gain (Watts)                                                     \nU = Material heat transfer (W/m²·K)                                                     \nA = Surface area (m²)                                                     \nCLTD = Temperature difference factor  \n09:40 – 09:45 Understanding CLTD (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To explain how outdoor temperatures and solar heat affect indoor heat gain over time, using the CLTD and CLF concepts.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen, showing both the time‑lag diagram and formula blocks.\u000b • Participants seated and ready to view the graphic.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with diagram and definitions\u000b • Pointer or cursor\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Ensure the time‑lag diagram is clear and fully visible\u000b • Confirm the formula text is readable\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we’ll look at CLTD—Cooling Load Temperature Difference—which captures the true driving force of heat gain by combining outdoor‑indoor temperature difference, solar radiation, and time lag from building materials. You see on the graph that solar radiation peaks at noon, but the temperature inside peaks around 2 PM because concrete and walls store heat and release it later. That delay is the Cooling Load Factor. The main formula is Q equals U times A times CLTD, where U is how well a material transfers heat, A is the surface area, and CLTD is the effective temperature difference factor. This helps us predict heat gain more accurately than just looking at outdoor temperature.”\nKey Points:\nCLTD accounts for both temperature difference and solar effects.\nThermal mass causes a 4–8 hour time lag (CLF).\nUse Q = U × A × CLTD to calculate real heat gain in Watts.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Basra’s concrete houses, afternoon indoor heat peaks long after the sun’s highest point—so shutters closed at noon still help at 3 PM.”\nActivity Instructions:\nInvite a volunteer: “Explain in your own words why CLTD is better than just ΔT.”\nCollect one brief response (about 30 seconds).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusion between CLTD and CLF.\u000b – Solution: Clarify: “CLTD is the overall difference; CLF is the delay factor from materials.”\nIssue: Formula feels abstract.\u000b – Solution: Point to real U‑values (e.g., concrete U ≈ 1.7 W/m²·K) to ground the concept.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “With these calculation tools in hand, let’s test your understanding in our Pre‑Assessment Quiz.”\n7\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*QR code\nPre-Assessment Quiz\nScan QR here\nDay 1\n09 : 45 – 09 : 55 (10 min) – Pre-Assessment Quiz (QR Code)\nPurpose\u000b Provide an easy way for everyone to complete the baseline quiz via their own device.\nSetup\u000b – Participants seated, devices ready (phone/tablet).\u000b – Project the slide full-screen with a large QR code.\nMaterials needed\u000b – Slide with QR code linking to the 5 MCQs + 2 open questions form.\u000b – Internet connection.\nPre-activity checks\u000b – Confirm Wi-Fi or mobile data is on.\u000b – Test-scanned the QR code yourself.\nFacilitator Script\n“Please take out your phones and scan the QR code on screen now. It will open our short pre-assessment form. You have about 5 minutes to answer all questions.”\nKey Points\nThis helps us see what you know before we start—no judgments.\nUse your own words for the open questions.\nWe’ll revisit these same questions on Day 5.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Just like we saw with Muthanna’s story, small facts make a big difference. Your answers will guide our teaching.”\nActivity Instructions\nScan the code.\nComplete the 5 multiple-choice questions (A–D).\nWrite your 1–2 sentence responses to the open questions.\nSubmit when done.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b – Issue: QR not scanning?\u000b Solution: Manually type the short URL displayed below the code.\u000b – Issue: No device?\u000b Solution: Pair up with a neighbor for one device each.\nTransition\n“Great—thank you!

You see that about 70 percent comes through the roof, 20 percent through walls, and the remaining 10 percent through air leaks around doors and windows. By breaking it down this way, we know where to focus our efforts: first on the roof, then on walls, and finally on sealing gaps. These steps, in order, will give us the biggest comfort gains and cost savings.”\nKey Points:\nRoof is the biggest source of heat gain (70 percent).\nWalls contribute 20 percent—important, but secondary.\nAir leaks account for 10 percent and can be sealed quickly.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul, many homes have uninsulated tin roofs, so fixing the roof alone can cut indoor temperatures by several degrees.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Which area would you prioritize first in your own homes or projects?”\nInvite 2–3 participants to share their choice and reasoning (30 seconds each).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants debate exact percentages.\u000b – Solution: Emphasize these are typical averages; local conditions may vary slightly.\nIssue: Overfocus on air leaks.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “While leaks matter, the roof and walls have much larger impact.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we understand the breakdown, let’s preview Ghassan’s real‑world case: a coating failure that teaches key lessons for durable solutions.”\n12\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n13\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nPreview – Ghassan’s Coating Failure\n🖌️ Low-cost coating peeled in 2 weeks\n🔄 Customer paid twice to fix it\n💡 Quality matters: invest once, save long-term\nDay 1\nThis is why we focus on trust and quality - one bad job ruins 10 referrals\n10:15 – 10:25 Preview – Ghassan’s Coating Failure (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To show a real cost of choosing cheap materials and underline why quality and trust are critical.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen with both peeled and intact coating photos visible\u000b • Keep participants seated\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with high-resolution images\u000b • Pointer or laser\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm both photos are sharp and contrasty\u000b • Verify this slide follows immediately after the previous segment in your deck\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Before we go into the technical fixes, let me share Ghassan’s story. He applied a very low-cost roof coating, hoping to save money—only to see it peel completely in two weeks. He had to pay a second contractor to redo the job, effectively doubling his expense. This illustrates why cutting corners on quality can cost far more in the long run. Today, we’ll learn heat-flow solutions that last, so you invest once and avoid repeat work.”\nKey Points:\nCheap upfront materials often lead to higher repair costs.\nOne bad job can destroy your reputation and referrals.\nInvesting in quality builds trust and long-term savings.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul’s intense summer sun, I’ve seen white paint blister and fall off within days—forcing homeowners to recoat multiple times in one season.”\nActivity Instructions:\nDisplay the peeled-off sample prominently.\nAsk: “Has anyone witnessed paint or coating fail this quickly?”\nInvite 1–2 quick responses (about 30 seconds each).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: No one has seen rapid peeling.\u000b – Solution: Relate to any familiar fading or cracking on local homes.\nIssue: Participants demand technical data now.\u000b – Solution: Reassure them: “We’ll cover material selection and durability in Day 2; today is about why we prioritize quality.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we understand the stakes, let’s explore ‘Heat Moves in 3 Ways’ to see the mechanisms behind these failures.”\n14\n\nHeat Moves in 3 Ways\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMode\nQuick Demo\nConduction\nMetal rod with ice on one end, heat on other - feel the transfer\nConvection\nIncense smoke shows air currents\nRadiation\nIR camera thermal bridge hunt\nReal 100m² Home:\nRoof: 75m² × 0.8 × 20°C = 1,200W\nWalls: 150m² × 1.2 × 20°C = 3,600W\nWindows: 15m² × 5.0 × 20°C = 1,500W\nTotal: 6.3kW = 2.4 tons needed\n10:25 – 10:35 How Heat Moves: Conduction, Convection, Radiation (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To demonstrate the three modes of heat transfer with simple demos, then apply them to calculate real heat gain in a home.\nSetup:\u000b • Demo table visible at front with all props laid out\u000b • Project slide showing demo instructions and home calculation\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Metal rod or spoon with an ice cube on one end\u000b • Incense stick + small stand or plate\u000b • IR camera or thermal image of a heat bridge\u000b • Calculator or whiteboard for home heat gain math\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Ensure the rod and ice are ready and stable\u000b • Test incense to produce visible smoke\u000b • Confirm IR image is loaded and legible\u000b • Have calculator or marker ready for the math example\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we’ll explore how heat actually moves in three different ways. First, for conduction, you’ll feel it yourselves: here’s a metal rod with an ice cube on one end—when I heat the opposite end over the flame, you’ll feel warmth travel instantly along the rod’s length. Next, for convection, watch this incense smoke under a lightweight sheet—notice how the hot air currents push the smoke upward and then outward. Finally, for radiation, we’ll use an IR camera to find hotspots on this metal plate—just like spotting thermal bridges in your own projects.\n“With those modes fresh in mind, let’s apply them to a 100 m² home. The roof (75 m²) at U‑value 0.8 and a 20 °C temperature difference gives 1,200 W. Walls (150 m²) at U = 1.2 yield 3,600 W. Windows (15 m²) at U = 5.0 add 1,500 W. Total heat gain is about 6.3 kW, meaning you need roughly a 2.4‑ton cooling system to maintain comfort.”\nKey Points:\nConduction moves heat through solids instantly.\nConvection carries heat via moving air currents.\nRadiation transfers heat through electromagnetic waves.\nReal‑world heat gain combines all three modes in roof, walls, and windows.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Baghdad’s hot season, you can see conduction when metal window frames burn your hand, and convection when exhaust fans spread hot air down your hall.”\nActivity Instructions:\nConduction demo: Heat rod end for 5 seconds; pass handle to a volunteer to feel warmth.\nConvection demo: Light incense; let participants observe smoke under sheet.\nRadiation demo: Show IR image; ask: “Where is the hottest spot?”\nMath example: Invite one participant to help calculate one of the three components on the whiteboard.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Ice slides off rod.\u000b – Solution: Secure ice with a small clip or tape.\nIssue: Smoke too light.\u000b – Solution: Use more incense or briefly fan to concentrate smoke.\nIssue: Math intimidates participants.\u000b – Solution: Walk through each multiplication step slowly and clearly.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent—now that we’ve seen heat transfer and calculated a home’s load, we’ll move into practical insulation strategies to slow these heat flows.”\n15\n\nHow Heat Moves: Conduction, Convection, Radiation\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMode\nConduction\nHeat through solids 🔥\nConvection\nHeat with moving air 🌬️\nRadiation\nHeat by waves ☀️\nU-value = heat transfer rate\nLower = better insulation\nConcrete roof: 0.8 W/m²·K\nConcrete wall: 1.2 W/m²·K\nSingle glass: 5.0 W/m²·K\nWith insulation: divide by 2.5\n10:35 – 10:45 How Heat Moves & U‑Values (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To reinforce the three heat‑transfer modes and introduce U‑values as a measure of insulation performance.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen showing the three icons and U‑value table\u000b • Participants remain seated from the previous activity\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with icons and U‑value table\u000b • Pointer or laser\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Check icons and U‑value numbers are large and legible\u000b • Ensure slide follows immediately after the demo slide\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Let’s recap the three ways heat travels: conduction through solids, convection with moving air, and radiation by waves. You can see each mode represented with an icon: a flame for conduction, wind for convection, and sun rays for radiation.\n“Next we introduce U‑values—the rate at which a material transfers heat. The lower the U‑value, the better the insulation. For example, a concrete roof has U = 0.8 W/m²·K, concrete walls U = 1.2, and single‑pane glass U = 5.0. If we add insulation, we divide these values by about 2.5, dramatically cutting heat flow. Understanding U‑values helps us choose the right materials to slow each heat‑transfer mode.”\nKey Points:\nThree modes: conduction, convection, radiation.\nU‑value measures heat transfer per area per temperature difference.\nLower U‑values mean better insulation; adding insulation divides U‑value by ~2.5.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul, switching from single‑pane windows (U = 5.0) to insulated panels (U ≈ 2.0) can cut wall heat gain by over 60 percent.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Which building element in your project has the highest U‑value?”\nInvite two volunteers to name an element (e.g., window or roof) and suggest an insulation idea that lowers its U‑value.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusion between lower U‑value and thicker walls.\u000b – Solution: Explain: “It’s about material properties, not just thickness.”\nIssue: Participants forget to divide by 2.5 after insulation.\u000b – Solution: Emphasize: “Think: new U = old U ÷ 2.5.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we know how to slow heat flow in materials, let’s cover some essential precautions before our hands‑on activities.

First, enter your generator size in amps—this tells us how many common appliances you can run simultaneously, like lights, fans, and a small AC. Next, the sheet automatically computes your monthly fuel cost based on typical generator efficiency and local fuel prices. Finally, by plugging in the post‑retrofit amp draw—say 10 amps instead of 20—you’ll see the monthly savings immediately. Let me show you with our sample data: with a 20 amp draw, the cost is 36 million IQD; drop to 10 amps, and you save 18 million IQD per month.”\nKey Points:\nGenerator size → appliance capacity: understand real load limits.\nAmp draw → monthly cost: fuel usage scales directly with amps.\nPost‑retrofit savings: halving amps nearly halves your fuel bill.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Basra, one home reduced its monthly generator spend from 30 million IQD to 15 million by adding reflective roof coating.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk for a volunteer team to call out their measured amp value.\nEnter that value on the slide calculator.\nShow the appliance capacity and cost outputs.\nThen enter the projected amp after retrofit (e.g., 12 amps) to display savings.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants confuse amps with kW.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Amps × voltage gives watts—our tool handles that conversion.”\nIssue: Calculator not updating live.\u000b – Solution: Use pre‑prepared screenshots or run the Excel live on your laptop.\nIssue: Fuel price varies by region.\u000b – Solution: Note: “You can adjust the fuel‑price cell to match your local cost.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “With this baseline and savings data, you’re ready to see the full Audit Sheet Template—the master form we’ll use for detailed reporting and follow‑up.”\n20\n\nAudit Sheet Template\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nLog one row per room\nRoom\nTime Period\nAC Status (On/Off) \nGenerator Amps Reading    \nIndoor Temp (°C)   \nOutdoor Temp (°C)   \nNotes (rooms abandoned?) \nMorning (6am-12pm)\nPeak (12pm-6pm)\nEvening (6pm-12am)\nNight (12am-6am)\n📊 SPREADSHEET MOMENT \u000bOpen the Diagnostic Checklist tab\n11:25 – 11:35 Audit Sheet Template & Diagnostic Checklist Mapping (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Make sure teams know exactly which existing columns in the Diagnostic Checklist match the fields shown on the slide, so they can record data without editing the worksheet.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide full‑screen with the four time periods table\u000b • One clipboard + printed Diagnostic Checklist per team\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Printed Diagnostic Checklist sheets\u000b • Pens or pencils\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm every team has one sheet and pen\u000b • Remind teams to use only the columns we specify\n### Facilitator Script\u000b “Here is the audit table you see on the slide: Morning, Peak, Evening, Night with AC‑status, amps, temps, and notes.

Second, hold incense near windows or door gaps to spot drafts; if you see smoke flutter, mark a leak under Abandoned spaces measured. Third, snap clear ‘before’ photos showing your setup and any drafts—label each photo (e.g., LivingRoom_Before.jpg) and note the filename in the Photo ID column. Finally, focus your checks on peak hours (12–6 pm), since these readings drive our savings math later.”\nKey Points:\nCentre‑room readings avoid edge errors.\nSmoke tests reveal hidden leaks.\nWell‑labeled photos document conditions for later review.\nPeak‑period data matters most for cost savings.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In a Mosul home last week, a team missed a draft behind a curtain—but clear incense photos would have caught it.”\nActivity Instructions:\nEach team assigns roles: one measures temperature, one tests drafts, one takes photos.\nRecord the centre‑room temperature under Room‑by‑room temperature log.\nMark any draft under Abandoned spaces measured and note Photo ID.\nLabel each photo with room name and period (e.g., Kitchen_Peak_Before.jpg).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Thermometer too close to walls.\u000b – Solution: Move at least 1 m away from surfaces.\nIssue: Smoke disperses too quickly.\u000b – Solution: Hold incense 1–2 cm from the gap steadily.\nIssue: Blurry photos.\u000b – Solution: Tap the screen to focus before snapping.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “All set—now start your Home‑Audit Sprint.

Start by naming the customer’s worst pain—frame it in terms of amps they lose. For example: ‘Losing 5 amps means you can’t run your whole house without borrowing your neighbor’s generator.’ Next, tie that amp loss to a monthly IQD cost: ‘That’s nearly 5 million IQD of fuel every month.’ Finally, end with a question to engage them: ‘So what would you pay to stop the heat?’ Think of this like a mini‑ad that grabs attention, shows value, and invites action.”\nKey Points:\nPain first: Lead with the amp‑loss scenario.\nCost next: Quantify in IQD per month.\nQuestion last: “So what would you pay?” invites dialogue.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“Your roof leak of 8 amps costs 8 × 5,000 IQD × 6 h × 30 d = 7.2 million IQD every month—so what would you pay to eliminate that?”\nActivity Instructions:\nIn your team, draft a one‑sentence script that follows the three prompts.\nPractice reading it naturally for up to 30 seconds.\nRecord your video on your device.\nPlayback together—if it exceeds 30 seconds or feels awkward, refine and re‑record.\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Hook exceeds 30 seconds.\u000b – Solution: Time your read‑through and remove any filler words.\nIssue: Script sounds too formal.\u000b – Solution: Speak as if talking to a friend—use simple, direct language.\nIssue: Background noise interferes.\u000b – Solution: Move to a quieter spot or pause recording during distractions.\nTransition:\u000b “Great hooks, everyone!

Keep these objectives in mind as we move into the Learn session.”\nKey Points\nLearn: Understand the core concepts—ask questions if anything is unclear.\nApply: Use the tools and methods immediately—capture photos or data as evidence.\nSell: Create a shareable asset that demonstrates your progress for tomorrow’s pitch.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nGlance through each bullet to internalize the day’s goals.\nNote which deliverable (video, sheet, card, etc.) you’ll produce in the Sell block.\nWhen the slide disappears, we jump straight into the Learn session.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants miss which day they’re on →\u000b Solution: Verbally point to the highlighted row and restate “Today is Day X.”\nIssue: Overwhelm from many objectives →\u000b Solution: Emphasize that Learn and Apply each have only two bullets, and Sell has one—manageable chunks.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now let’s dive into our Learn session and master today’s first concept.”\n40\n\nBuilding Envelope Systems\nDay 2\nBalance daylight vs heat gain\nWindows/doors conduct ≈ 5 × more heat than walls\nWWR (Window‑to‑Wall Ratio) = Window Area ÷ Total Wall Area\nTarget: ≤ 18 % for whole building\nSouth‑facing room: ≤ 10 % glazing\nDesign tips for hot climates\nPut large windows on the north side (coolest)\nReduce glazing on west, east & south façades\nAdd exterior shading to any large sunny opening\nIntervention points (see diagram)\nExterior shades / fins\nLow‑U double glazing\nExtra wall insulation\nSeal gaps around frames\n(09 : 35 – 09 : 45) Building Envelope Systems (10 min)\nPurpose\u000b Explain how window size and placement affect cooling load and show easy fixes.\nSetup\u000b • Slide with photos + WWR sketch displayed full‑screen\u000b • Participants seated facing screen\nMaterials needed\u000b • Pointer or laser to highlight arrows and labels\nPre‑activity checks\u000b • Ensure images are clear and labels readable\u000b • Confirm the WWR percentages are visible\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Let’s look at the building envelope—the skin of the house. Our goal is to let in enough daylight while keeping heat out. Windows and doors pass heat five times faster than solid walls. We measure their impact with the Window‑to‑Wall Ratio, or WWR. The formula is simple: window area divided by total wall area above ground.\nFor hot cities like Mosul, we aim for 18 % or less across the whole building and 10 % or less on south‑facing rooms. Large windows belong on the north side, where the sun is weakest. On west, east, and south façades we shrink glazing or add exterior shades.\nLook at the left photo—small, recessed windows equal low heat gain. The right photo shows larger glazing: more daylight but also more cooling cost. The sketch below compares 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % WWR. Notice how heat‑flow arrows target the glass; our red marks show intervention points: add shading, upgrade to low‑U double glazing, insulate walls, and seal gaps around frames.”\nKey Points\nWindows = biggest heat bridge in hot climates.\nKeep WWR ≤ 18 % (building) / 10 % (south rooms).\nNorth side tolerates larger glazing; other sides need shading or smaller windows.\nSimple interventions—shades, better glass, sealing—cut heat flow fast.\u000b\nLocal example\u000b “Many Mosul houses from the 1980s have huge west windows—retrofit shades there can drop indoor temps by 3 °C without touching the AC.”\nActivity Instructions\nAsk teams to guess their own home’s WWR (quick eyeball).\nInvite one volunteer to share and suggest one intervention.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants confuse WWR with window‑to‑floor ratio.\u000b – Solution: Re‑state formula and point to diagram.\nIssue: Too much detail on glazing types.\u000b – Solution: Park advanced questions for Day 3 materials session.\u000b\nTransition\u000b “Now that we know walls and windows matter, let’s tackle the biggest culprit—the roof—which can bring 60‑70 % of total heat.”\n41\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n42\n\nRoof Heat-Gain: 60–70 % of Total Heat\nDay 2\n🌞 Roof accounts for most solar gain\n🏗️ Insulation here has highest impact\n📊 Target 60–70 % reduction at the roof\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Diagram: Simple house icon divided into roof (65 %), walls (25 %), windows (10 %)\n09:45 – 09:55 Roof Heat‑Gain: 60–70 % of Total Heat (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show that in hot climates most heat enters through the roof, so insulating here gives the greatest impact.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen with the pie diagram (roof 65 %, walls 25 %, windows 10 %)\u000b • Participants remain seated\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with clear diagram\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify the pie chart percentages are legible\u000b • Confirm the roof segment is highlighted\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now let’s focus on where heat comes in: in a typical home, about 60–70 percent of solar heat enters through the roof. Walls account for only about 25 percent, and windows about 10 percent. That means if we want to cool a house for less money and effort, we start at the roof. By insulating or coating the roof, we can cut most of the heat before it even reaches the attic or rooms below.”\nKey Points:\nRoof is the top source of heat gain (60–70 %).\nInsulating or coating the roof yields the largest temperature drop.\nWalls and windows matter too but are secondary.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul’s July heat, we saw uncoated roofs reach 55 °C under the sun, while roofs with reflective coating stayed at about 45 °C—a full 10 °C cooler!”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk the group: “Why does the roof let in so much more heat than walls?”\nInvite one or two volunteers to answer (30 seconds each).\nReinforce that today’s hands‑on demos will start with roof solutions.\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants ask for exact numbers.\u000b – Solution: “These are industry averages; local results may vary slightly.”\nIssue: Diagram seems busy.\u000b – Solution: Point at each colored segment in turn and read the label.\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now that we see why roofs matter most, let’s look at our Solution Categories Map to plan the types of interventions we’ll use.”\n43\n\nSolution Categories Map\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nProblem\nLocation\nSolution Options\nCost Range\nHeat Gain\nRoof\nCoating/Insulation/Shade\n15-50k/m²\nHeat Gain\nWalls\nInsulation/Coating\n20-35k/m²\nAir Leaks\nGaps\nSealing/Weatherstrip\n5-15k/m\n09:55 – 10:00 Solution Categories Map (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Provide a quick reference to the main problem areas, their locations, solution types, and typical cost ranges so teams can choose the right fix.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen with the solution table\u000b • Participants seated and able to view clearly\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Ensure each column (Problem, Location, Solutions, Cost) is legible\u000b • Confirm cost units (IQD/m² or IQD/m) are clear\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here’s our Solution Categories Map. We’ve broken down the three main heat‑entry problems—roof, walls, and air leaks—into where they occur, which solutions work best, and what you can expect to pay. For roofs, you can choose coatings, insulation panels, or shade structures at roughly 15,000–50,000 IQD per square meter. For walls, coatings or insulation cost about 20,000–35,000 IQD per square meter. And for air leaks, sealing and weatherstripping run about 5,000–15,000 IQD per linear meter. Use this map to estimate and compare interventions quickly during your field work.”\nKey Points:\nRoof fixes yield the highest impact but can vary more in cost (15–50 k IQD/m²).\nWall treatments are next, with moderate cost and impact (20–35 k IQD/m²).\nAir‑leak sealing is cheapest and fastest (5–15 k IQD/m) but tackles only 10 % of heat gain.\nAlways match solution type to the problem location for best ROI.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, a simple shade cloth over a tin roof cost only 20 k IQD/m² and cut roof heat by 30 percent.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk each team to pick one problem area they audited (roof, wall, or leak).\nHave them note on their flipchart which solution option and cost range they’d recommend.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams confuse cost per m² vs per m.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Roof and walls are per square meter; leaks are per meter of gap.”\nIssue: Uncertainty about which solution fits their site.\u000b – Solution: Encourage: “Choose the lowest‑cost option that still meets durability needs.”\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now let’s dive into our first set of material tests with Three Common Coatings and see how they perform under real sun.”\n44\n\nThree Common Coatings\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nType\nCost (IQD/L)\nCLTD Reduction (°C)\nCoverage (m²/L)\nDurability (yrs)\nNotes\nAcrylic\n 15 000\n 3–4\n3.5\n 4–5\nCheap, prone to cracking\nSilicone\n 30 000\n 6–8\n3.0\n 7–8\nUV‑proof, needs primer\nElastomeric\n 25 000\n 5–7\n3.2\n 6–7\nFlexible, mid‑price\n(10:00 – 10:10) Three Common Coatings (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Introduce participants to the cost‑to‑performance trade‑offs of the three main roof coatings they’ll test.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide displayed full‑screen showing the enhanced table\u000b • Lay out three demo tiles (Acrylic, Silicone, Elastomeric) on a table and label them A/B/C\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with the enhanced table\u000b • Three labeled coating samples on tile pieces\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each demo tile matches its table row\u000b • Make sure cost and CLTD values are visible on the slide\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here are the three coatings you’ll test today. Notice Cost in IQD per liter and CLTD Reduction in °C—this tells you how much cooler your roof will get. Acrylic costs 15 000 IQD/L but only cuts 3–4 °C and lasts about 4–5 years. Silicone runs 30 000 IQD/L, reduces 6–8 °C, and endures 7–8 years with a primer. Elastomeric sits in the middle at 25 000 IQD/L, gives 5–7 °C reduction, and lasts 6–7 years. Keep these factors—price, cooling impact, and lifespan—in mind as you move into the scratch‑test demo.”\nKey Points:\nCost vs. Cooling: higher price generally buys more °C reduction.\nDurability Matters: longer life can offset higher upfront cost.\nCoverage: tells you how much area one liter covers (m²/L).\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul’s sun, contractors often skip acrylic because they know it only lasts one season—silicone’s extra cost pays off in fewer recoats.”\nActivity Instructions:\nTouch each tile to feel surface texture.\nNote the table’s Cost and CLTD values for that sample.\nPrepare to scratch each sample next and compare real durability.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams confuse CLTD reduction with CLTD factor.\u000b – Solution: Clarify: “CLTD reduction = how many degrees cooler the roof surface becomes.”\nIssue: Coverage rates mix up.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Coverage m²/L tells you how many square meters one liter paints.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that you know what you’re testing, let’s move to the Scratch‑Test Demo to see how each coating actually holds up under force.”\n45\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nScratch-Test Demo\nDay 2\n🔍 Step 1: Use a coin to gently scratch each coated tile\n📝 Step 2: Observe & note any chipping or flaking\nStep 3: Test perlite plaster too - notice the granular texture that traps air\n⭐ Step 4: Rate durability from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)\n10:10 – 10:30 Scratch‑Test Demo (20 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Let participants feel firsthand how each coating—and our perlite plaster alternative—resists abrasion, so they can compare durability ratings.\nSetup:\u000b • Demo table at front with four labeled samples: Acrylic, Silicone, Elastomeric, and Perlite Plaster\u000b • Coin or metal scraper and rating sheet/whiteboard ready\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Four tile samples labeled A (Acrylic), B (Silicone), C (Elastomeric), D (Perlite Plaster)\u000b • Coins or small metal scrapers (one per team)\u000b • Rating sheet or whiteboard with columns A–D and rows 1–5\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each sample label matches the slide\u000b • Verify scraper edges are clean and safe\u000b • Show teams where to record their star ratings\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we begin the scratch‑test: first, gently drag your coin across Sample A (Acrylic). Don’t press too hard—just enough to test surface adhesion. Look for any chipping or flaking, then record a durability rating from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) on our board under column A. Next, repeat the same steps on Sample B (Silicone) and Sample C (Elastomeric). Finally, we’ll test a perlite plaster sample (D); notice its granular texture trapping air and how it resists your scrape differently.”\nKey Points:\nGentle pressure tests real‑world wear, not brute force.\nChips and flakes indicate weak adhesion or low durability.\nGranular perlite traps air—compare how it breaks versus coatings.\nStar ratings make side‑by‑side comparison quick and clear.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, coatings rated below 3 chipped within days of rain—that’s why durability matters in dusty, wet seasons.”\nActivity Instructions:\nTeams come up one at a time to scratch Sample A, then B, C, and D.\nAfter each scratch, note any flaking and assign a rating 1–5 on the board under the matching column.\nRotate until every team has tested all four samples.\nCompare ratings to see which material performs best.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams press too hard, breaking the surface.\u000b – Solution: Demonstrate “light, steady drag”—use fingertip pressure only.\nIssue: Inconsistent star ratings.\u000b – Solution: Ask, “Did you see more than three flakes? If yes, rate below 3.”\nIssue: Perlite dust everywhere.\u000b – Solution: Scratch slowly and catch loose grains on a tray.\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent observations! Let’s watch a case‑study video showing what happens when a really cheap coating fails over five years—versus a premium silicone option.”\n46\n\nCase Study Video – 5-Year Silicone Failure\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10:30 – 10:40 Case Study Video – 5‑Year Silicone Failure (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show long‑term consequences of choosing low‑grade coatings versus investing in quality—reinforcing that “cheap now = pay later.”\nSetup:\u000b • Slide up, projector and sound on\u000b • Video cued to start at the right point\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Downloaded or streamed video clip\u000b • Speakers or room audio system\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Play 5 seconds to confirm audio and video clarity\u000b • Adjust volume so everyone can hear\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “We’re going to watch a short clip illustrating why ‘cheap now = pay later.’ This shows a low‑cost silicone coating that begins cracking and flaking by year 5 due to UV and heat cycling. Notice the delamination and water damage underneath. Then compare it to a premium coating in the same conditions that stays bonded and intact. Show this to clients so they understand the hidden cost of a cheap job.”\nKey Points:\nUV exposure and thermal swings crack low‑grade silicone by year 5.\nDelamination allows water ingress, damaging the roof substrate.\nPremium coatings resist UV and stay bonded—avoiding repeat recoats.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, homeowners who chose the cheapest silicone had to recoating twice by year 6—costing more than a one‑time premium application.”\nActivity Instructions:\nPlay the 1 minute 30 second clip.\nAsk teams to note:\nOne cause of the cheap coating’s failure.\nOne benefit they see in the premium alternative.\nInvite two teams to share their observations aloud.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants miss slow degradation.\u000b – Solution: Pause at frames showing cracks and flaking and point them out.\nIssue: Audio is unclear.\u000b – Solution: Briefly summarize the narrator’s points in your own words.\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we see the long‑term risks, let’s head to our Mini‑Roof Tile Lab to test coatings ourselves.”\n47\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\n48\n\nMini-Roof Tile Lab\nDay 2\n🧹 Station 1: Clean\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🖌️ Station 2: Coat\n🌡️ Station 3: Measure\n10 : 40 – 10 : 45 (5 min) Slide 1: Mini-Roof Tile Lab Overview\nPurpose\u000b Orient teams to the three lab stations so they know the flow before splitting up.\nSetup\nFloor cleared for three stations in a row.\nStation markers (1, 2, 3) visible on tables.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nSignage or tape labeling each station.\nBrief slide up so participants can scan stations visually.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm all three stations are stocked and labeled.\nCheck walkthrough path for teams is clear.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Welcome to the Mini-Roof Tile Lab.

First, grab a screenshot of the green Executive Summary box—remember, this box is filled automatically from the Energy Calculator numbers you entered earlier. Second, build a sharp 30-second pitch for the 150 m² roof case: state the investment, monthly savings, and payback period—then tie it to comfort. Third, record a quick clip where one teammate plays the customer raising an objection and another answers it. Post the clip in our ‘Day 2 Assets’ WhatsApp thread.”\nKey Points\nROI credibility: quoting Monthly Savings and Payback straight from the auto summary builds trust.\n150 m² example: keeps the pitch consistent across teams.\nRecorded role-play: captures best practice for later review.\u000b\nLocal example\n“Your pitch might sound like: ‘For 2.1 million IQD you save 420 000 IQD every month—payback in just five months—and your living room is 6 °C cooler.’”\nActivity Instructions\nIn the Quote Generator tab, take a screenshot of the green Executive Summary and paste it into your slide or keep it visible on screen.\nDraft a 30-second script using the three green numbers.\nRecord a role-play: one person objects (“That’s expensive!”), the other counters with ROI facts.\nUpload the video to WhatsApp → “Day 2 Assets.”\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Executive Summary still shows zeros.\u000b – Solution: Re-check that Energy Calculator white input cells (areas, amps, prices) are filled.\nIssue: Video exceeds 30 seconds.\u000b – Solution: Trim to the key objection and ROI response only.\nIssue: Teams can’t capture the screenshot.\u000b – Solution: Alt + Print Screen (Windows) or Shift-Cmd-4 (Mac), then paste into slide or chat.\nTransition\u000b “Excellent! Keep those ROI numbers handy—we’ll open the Roof-ROI Calculator next to see how small design tweaks change the payback.”\n57\n\nRoof-ROI Calculator\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nHeat through 75m² roof\nMonthly savings\nPayback\nBefore: 110 kWh/day\nAfter coating: 75 kWh/day\nSaves: 35 kWh/day = 3A average\n3A × 5,000 × 12hr × 30 = 5.4M IQD\nCoating cost: 75m² × 25,000 = 1.9M\n<1 month!\n📊 SPREADSHEET MOMENT \u000bOpen theSolution Designer tab\n13:10 – 13:25 Roof‑ROI Calculator (15 min)\nPurpose\u000b Equip teams to turn their roof‑solution choices into clear monthly savings and pay‑back periods, then view the instant result in the Quote Generator tab.\nSetup\u000b • Slide with the worked 75 m² example full‑screen\u000b • Teams on laptops/phones with the spreadsheet open to Solution Designer → ROOF SOLUTIONS\nMaterials needed\u000b • Spreadsheet (Solution Designer & Quote Generator tabs)\u000b • Calculators (optional)\nPre‑activity checks\u000b • Verify yellow Select and Coverage % cells in ROOF SOLUTIONS are empty and editable\u000b • Confirm green cells (Total Cost, Roof Investment, Payback) update automatically\u000b • Make sure everyone knows where the Quote Generator tab is\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Let’s see how fast a roof coating can pay for itself. In the Solution Designer tab, yellow cells are the only places you type. Tick the Select box for Premium Coating (25 000 IQD/m²) and enter 100 % coverage for a 75 m² roof. Instantly, the green Roof Investment cell shows about 1.9 million IQD.\nNow look at the slide: before coating, this roof pulled 110 kWh/day; after coating it drops to 75 kWh/day—that’s a saving of 35 kWh/day, or roughly 3 amps on a generator. Three amps, at 5 000 IQD per amp‑hour, for 12 hours a day over 30 days, equals 5.4 million IQD monthly savings.\nBecause the sheet links to the Quote Generator tab, the Executive Summary box updates automatically, showing Investment 1.9 M IQD, Monthly Savings 5.4 M IQD, Pay‑back < 1 month. Grab a screenshot of that green box for your pitch.”\nKey Points\nYellow cells = input (Select, Coverage %) & white cells elsewhere if needed\nGreen cells = auto‑calculated (Investment, Savings, Pay‑back) – don’t type there\nQuote Generator’s Executive Summary populates automatically from Solution Designer\u000b\nLocal example\n“A Mosul contractor used this same sheet—clients loved seeing a < 1‑month payback and signed on the spot.”\nActivity Instructions\nIn ROOF SOLUTIONS, tick your chosen coating and enter coverage % for your project.\nConfirm the green Roof Investment value.\nNote the green Roof Impact %, then open Quote Generator to see updated Investment, Monthly Savings, and Pay‑back.\nWrite those three numbers on your flipchart for tomorrow’s pitch.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Green cells show “0.”\u000b – Solution: Check that you actually typed coverage % and ticked Select.\nIssue: Someone overwrites a formula.\u000b – Solution: Ctrl + Z, then remind: “Only yellow or white inputs, never green.”\nIssue: Unsure of roof area.\u000b – Solution: Use the default 75 m² example, then adjust when you have exact measurements.\nTransition\u000b “Numbers look great, but remember: the lowest upfront price can fail fast. Next, we’ll learn Why ‘Cheap Now = Pay Later’ so you can handle that objection with confidence.”\n58\n\nWhy “Cheap Now = Pay Later”\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🏷️ Low upfront cost → high rework expense\n🤝 Quality builds trust & repeat business\n📖 Ghassan’s story: Acrylic peeled in 2 weeks → paid 2× to recoat\n13:25 – 13:30 Why “Cheap Now = Pay Later” (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Explain why emphasizing long‑term value beats low upfront price, so trainees truly believe in the objection‑handling line.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide displayed full‑screen with the three bullet icons and Ghassan’s story\u000b • Participants seated\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck only\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the iconography and text are legible from the back of the room\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “We say ‘cheap now = pay later’ because a low upfront price often means repeat fixes and extra expense. As Ghassan’s story shows, choosing a budget acrylic at only 15 000 IQD/m² led to peeling in two weeks—then he paid twice to recoat with a better product. That doubled his cost and damaged his trust in the installer. By contrast, investing a bit more up front in quality coatings avoids that rework cost and builds your reputation.”\nKey Points:\nLow upfront cost can lead to high rework expenses.\nQuality products last longer and build trust and referrals.\nA one‑time premium saves money and protects your brand.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, clients who skimped on coating came back within months for a second job—paying 2× the original price.”\nActivity Instructions:\nThink about your ROI numbers—calculate the difference between a cheap coating and a premium option over one year.\nKeep Ghassan’s anecdote in mind when you role‑play objections in the next slide.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams doubt the magnitude of rework cost.\u000b – Solution: Highlight the “2×” repeat‑cost fact and tie it back to the customer’s budget.\nIssue: The phrase feels generic.\u000b – Solution: Encourage swapping in a local anecdote from Day 1 audits or your own experience.\nTransition:\u000b “Now that you know why this message works, let’s practice it in our 1‑minute role play. On to the next slide!”\n59\n\n1 min Role Play 🎥\n🗣️ Prompt: “Use ‘cheap now = pay later’ script”\n📹 Record: 1-minute objection-handling clip\n📤 Post: Upload to Day 2 Assets WhatsApp group\nDay 2\n13 : 30 – 13 : 45 (15 min) Role-Play & Recording Instructions\nPurpose\u000b Practice and capture your objection-handling pitch so you can review feedback and build your final portfolio.\nSetup\nTeams back at tables with at least one recording device per team.\nQuiet area designated for filming.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nSmartphone or tablet with video app.\n“Cheap now = pay later” script prompt on printed card.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm devices have enough battery and storage.\nCheck that WhatsApp group “Day 2 Assets” is accessible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Now it’s your turn to pitch and record. Use the ‘cheap now = pay later’ message: explain why low cost can mean higher total expense, then handle a customer objection. Film a one-minute clip and post it to our ‘Day 2 Assets’ WhatsApp group when you’re done.”\nKey Points\nStay on script – mention the repeat-cost angle.\nKeep it under 60 sec – concise wins attention.\nClear audio & framing – close enough to hear you and see your expressions.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Imagine a neighbor who just paid twice for recoats—address that directly to make it real.”\nActivity Instructions\nGather your script card and device.\nOne person plays the salesperson; another plays the balking customer.\nRecord the interaction, keeping it under one minute.\nReview your clip for clarity, then upload to “Day 2 Assets.”\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Over-time takes too long →\u000b Solution: Use a timer app and pause at 60 sec.\nIssue: Background noise →\u000b Solution: Move to the quiet area or close doors.\nIssue: Forgotten upload →\u000b Solution: Post immediately after filming to capture momentum.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great work!

No dry pockets.\n▶️\nLive Demo\n09 : 45 – 10 : 00 (15 min) Mix Ratios & Live Demo\nPurpose\u000b Show how to mix plaster or render at the correct proportions and moisture level for optimal strength and workability.\nSetup\nDemo table front-left with buckets of cement, sand, and water.\nMixing tools (trowel, measuring cups).\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nCement, sand, measuring cups, water.\nMixing bucket and trowel.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nConfirm measuring cups are accurate.\nEnsure demo area is clear and tools are at hand.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s our standard mix: one part cement, three parts sand, half part water. Keep the mix damp—avoid dry patches that cause weak spots. I’ll now demonstrate mixing this exact ratio.”\nKey Points\nAccurate measuring ensures consistent strength.\nEven moisture prevents cracking and poor adhesion.\nProper mixing technique sets the foundation for durability.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, teams that followed this 1 : 3 : 0.5 ratio saw their panels hold for years, while those who eyeballed often had to redo after the first dry season.”\nActivity Instructions\nWatch me measure and pour each component.\nNotice how I check for dry pockets.\nAfter the demo, we’ll pass buckets so each team mixes their own batch.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Too much water →\u000b Solution: If the mix slumps, add small amounts of cement-sand dry mix until creamy.\nIssue: Uneven mix →\u000b Solution: Stir thoroughly from the bottom up for at least 60 seconds.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that we’ve mixed our demo batch, let’s see how this technique paid off in Omar’s famous 17 °C ‘temperature-bet’—on to the video!”\n74\n\nMaterials Selection Matrix\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nProblem Type: Roof, Wall, Leak\nBudget Range: Low (≤ 15k IQD/m²) → High (≥ 60k IQD/m²)\nRecommended Materials: e.g., Acrylic Coating, EPS Boards, Weatherstripping\nSuppliers List: Local vendors stocking each material with contact info\n10:00 – 10:10 Materials Selection Matrix (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Introduce an interactive decision tool that matches the right material solution to the customer’s problem type and budget.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the interactive matrix on screen (or simulate with click‑through slides)\u000b • Participants seated, ready to follow along\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Laptop with the interactive spreadsheet or web tool loaded\u000b • Clicker or mouse for demo\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify the dropdown options work (Roof, Wall, Leak)\u000b • Test the budget slider to ensure materials list updates\u000b • Confirm supplier data is visible and accurate\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we’ll use our Materials Selection Matrix—a tool to quickly match problems to the best solutions within a customer’s budget. First, choose a Problem Type from the dropdown: Roof, Wall, or Leak. Next, adjust the Budget Range slider to reflect what the customer can spend today—from low‑cost at 15 000 IQD per square meter up to premium at 60 000 IQD. The matrix then auto‑populates recommended materials—like Acrylic Coating for tight budgets or EPS Boards for mid‑range—and lists local suppliers who carry them. This ensures you always propose feasible, cost‑aligned solutions.”\nKey Points:\nDropdown & slider let you tailor solutions on the fly.\nAuto‑populate removes guesswork—tools pick the right material.\nSupplier list speeds up ordering and builds credibility.\nLocal example:\n“When working in Mosul’s Old City, I use this matrix to select Perlite Overlay when budgets allow, or acrylic coating when funds are tight—then call the nearest supplier in 30 seconds.”\nActivity Instructions:\nI’ll demo: select Roof, set budget to 25 000 IQD/m²—see the matrix recommend Premium Coating and list two local vendors.\nNow in pairs, choose Wall and a budget of 10 000 IQD/m²—note which materials and suppliers appear.\nShare one pair’s selection with the group.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Dropdown not responding.\u000b – Solution: Click the header cell to reset the field and try again.\nIssue: Suppliers list too long.\u000b – Solution: Use the filter box at the top to narrow by district.\nIssue: Budget slider feels coarse.\u000b – Solution: Enter numeric value directly in the adjacent cell.\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now that you can match problems, budgets, and materials instantly, let’s see those materials in action in our Temperature‑Bet Demo.”\n75\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTemperature-Bet Demo\n*▶️ Watch Omar’s 17 °C “bet” clip\nDay 3\n10 : 10 – 10 : 20 (10 min) Temperature-Bet Video\nPurpose\u000b Demonstrate real-world validation of proper mix ratios through Omar’s recorded 17 °C drop “bet.”\nSetup\nProjector & sound ready.\nVideo queued at the 0:00 mark.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nDownloaded/video file of Omar’s “temperature-bet” demonstration.\nSpeakers or external audio device.\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nPlay a 5 s test to confirm audio/video sync.\nAdjust volume to room level.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s watch Omar’s famous 17 °C temperature-bet demo. He mixed plaster exactly as we did and challenged a client on a 10 °C drop—then delivered 17 °C. Notice how a precise mix transforms performance.”\nKey Points\nPreparation matters—Omar’s mix avoided cracks and delivered real ΔT.\nData-driven trust—clients believe what they can measure.\nHands-on validation—proof beats theory.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“That bet convinced a homeowner to pay extra upfront because they saw real numbers on their own thermometer.”\nActivity Instructions\nWatch the entire clip (approx. 1 min).\nNote one element that made Omar’s demo compelling (e.g., clear measurement method).\nBe ready to share your observation in one sentence.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Video stalls →\u000b Solution: Switch to the local file and restart.\nIssue: Participants miss the key moment →\u000b Solution: Pause at the peak ΔT reading to highlight the outcome.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great insights!

Here’s the quick formula on the slide to turn an amp reduction (ΔA) into monthly dinars. Four amps saved for ten hours a day equals roughly 211 000 IQD every month.\nNow, let’s anchor that inside the Energy Calculator:\nIn COMPONENT HEAT GAIN ANALYSIS locate the Infiltration row.\nIn the white U‑Value cell, type 0 if you seal the leak perfectly (or keep the default 1 if it remains).\nLeave Area as it is (auto‑pulled from Building Geometry) and keep CLTD = 10 °C unless you measured a different gap.\nWatch the green Heat Gain (W) number drop; that watt reduction maps directly to your amp reduction.\nScroll to the bottom—kWh and IQD savings update automatically in the pay‑back summary.”\u000b\nKey Points:\nΔA × 220 V → Watts; Watts × hours → kWh; kWh × rate → IQD.\nOne amp saved for one hour a day equals ≈ 22 kWh per month.\nEditing only white cells (U‑Value, CLTD) in the Infiltration row recalculates savings sheet‑wide.\u000b\nLocal example\n“Yesterday a team sealed a door gap and logged a 2 A drop.

Run the fan at low speed to pressurize—this forces air through tiny gaps. Next, hold a smoke pencil near seams and watch where the smoke is drawn in or blown out. Each leak you find and seal saves a fraction of your generator capacity, so mark every spot with chalk or tape for targeted sealing.”\nKey Points:\nFull seal around the frame ensures you measure real leaks.\nLow‑speed pressurization reveals even subtle gaps.\nSmoke direction shows infiltration (smoke pulled in) vs. exfiltration (blown out).\nEach leak sealed equals more amps saved on your generator.\u000b\nLocal example\n“In one Mosul home, sealing a tiny leak at the attic hatch recovered 3 amps—enough to run a fan all night.”\nActivity Instructions:\nTeam A sets up the blower‑door frame and fan.\nTeam B lights a smoke pencil and moves along seams, doors, and windows.\nMark each leak location and note approximate draft strength on your chart.\nRotate roles so everyone practices setup, testing, and marking.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nSmoke disperses too quickly\u000b – Solution: Move the pencil closer to the seam or reduce fan speed.\nFan seal leaks around frame\u000b – Solution: Adjust the gasket or use extra tape to close gaps.\nToo many small leaks\u000b – Solution: Prioritize the largest drafts first—they save the most amps.\nTransition\u000b “Great detection!

On the left, you see two heritage methods. Badgīrs, or wind‑catchers, channel breezes down a rooftop tower at 80 to 120 CFM without using any electricity. In the courtyard stack‑effect, a vertical shaft draws hot air up and out, pulling cooler air in at ground level. Both strategies require zero maintenance power and have kept homes comfortable for generations.\nOn the right, we translate these ideas to today’s retrofits: you can retrofit a stairwell shaft as a mini wind‑catcher, or incorporate a wind‑tower chimney into new additions. And for hybrid performance, pairing them with a small solar‑powered exhaust fan gives you the best of passive and active cooling.”\nKey Points\nHeritage systems deliver 80–120 CFM at zero energy cost.\nStack‑effect works purely on temperature‑driven convection.\nModern retrofits reuse existing shafts or add new chimneys for the same effect.\nHybrid approach—combine passive chimneys with solar fans for reliable airflow day and night.\u000b\nLocal example\n“At the Beit al‑Turath museum in Mosul, restored badgīrs still draw cool air into the galleries, reducing daytime temperatures by up to 5 °C.”\nActivity Instructions\nVisualize where on your mock building you could add a badgīr or convert a stairwell into a stack‑shaft.\nSketch this placement in your workbook with brief notes.\nThink about pairing it with a solar fan for peak afternoon airflow.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nUnfamiliar with the shape\u000b – Solution: Sketch a simple rectangular tower rising above the roof ridge.\nDoubting airflow rates\u000b – Solution: Compare 80–120 CFM to two standard box fans at full blast.\nTransition\u000b “Now that we’ve honored passive traditions, let’s contrast them with modern options in our next slide: Ventilation Options: Passive vs Active.”\n107\n\nVentilation Options: Passive vs Active\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nOption\nAirflow\nPower Draw\nMaintenance\nWind‐Turbine Vent\n100–150 CFM\n0 W\nAnnual inspect\nBadgir / Courtyard Stack Vent\n80–120 CFM\n0 W\nAnnual inspect\nSolar Exhaust Fan\n250–300 CFM\n25 W (day)\nMonthly filter check\n10 :25 – 10 :35 (10 min) Modern Passive & Active Comparison\nPurpose\u000b Help teams assess the pros and cons of heritage and modern ventilation options to make informed retrofit choices.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed full-screen.\u000b – Demo examples (turbine vent, badgir sketch, solar fan) within view if possible.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Slide deck only.\u000b – (Optional) Physical samples or images of each option.\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Verify the table’s text and icons are legible.\u000b – Ensure no other visuals clutter the display.\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s a side-by-side comparison of our three ventilation options:\nWind-Turbine Vent: moves 100–150 CFM, zero power, needs only an annual inspection.\nBadgir/Courtyard Stack Vent: delivers 80–120 CFM via natural convection, also zero power, annual check.\nSolar Exhaust Fan: pumps 250–300 CFM using 25 W when the sun shines, with a monthly filter check.”\u000b\nKey Points\nAirflow rates vary—solar fans lead in volume, heritage methods provide steady passive cooling.\nPower draw is zero for passive, minor for solar (daytime only).\nMaintenance frequency differs—annual for vents vs. monthly filter care.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In a Mosul café retrofit, a badgir cut indoor temps by 4 °C overnight—useful where turbines aren’t practical.”\nActivity Instructions\nReview the airflow and power specs for each option.\nDiscuss with your team which option best suits the mock roof scenario.\nNote your choice for Station 2 sizing.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Confusion over CFM →\u000b Solution: Relate 100 CFM to roughly two desktop fans at full speed.\nIssue: Uncertainty on maintenance →\u000b Solution: Emphasize simple annual or monthly checks—no complex servicing.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great!

First, measure your roof: length times width gives area in square metres. Second, calculate airflow: we use 5 CFM per square metre, so CFM = m² × 5. Third, match a vent: a passive turbine vent moves about 80 CFM, a solar vent about 120 CFM. Divide your target CFM by the unit CFM to know how many vents you need.\nNow jump to the Solution Designer tab. Under ROOF SOLUTIONS tick Select for the vent type you want. In the yellow Coverage % cell, enter the percentage of airflow you’re providing. For example, roof area = 75 m² → target 375 CFM. Five turbine vents (5 × 80 CFM = 400 CFM) meet 100 % coverage, so type 100. The sheet fills the green Total Cost and adds it to Roof Investment. Finally, mark vent locations on the mock roof panel so installers know where they go.”\nKey Points:\nRoof area × 5 CFM/m² = airflow target.\nTurbine Vent 80 CFM, Solar Vent 120 CFM (rule‑of‑thumb figures).\nEnter only yellow cells; sheet auto‑totals cost and impact.\nPlacement matters—high point of roof catches best stack effect.\nLocal example\n“Team A measured 60 m², target 300 CFM, chose three solar vents (360 CFM) at 120 % coverage—cost appears instantly in green.”\nActivity Instructions:\nMeasure roof length & width → calculate area (m²).\nMultiply area by 5 CFM to set airflow target.\nDecide passive (turbine) or active (solar) vent.\nTick Select on that row; enter Coverage % (aim for 100).\nCheck green Roof Investment updates.\nOn mock roof, draw circles where each vent will sit.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nForget to multiply width → Re‑measure both dimensions, then recalc.\nCoverage confusion → Coverage % = (supplied CFM / target CFM) × 100.\nEditing green cells → Undo and type only in yellow.\nWrong unit CFM → Use 80 for turbine, 120 for solar unless datasheet says otherwise.\nTransition\u000b “Good work sizing and costing your vents.

Clients often refuse to pay upfront because they fear poor workmanship or unseen costs. By offering install-first, pay-later, you remove that barrier: you do the work, they inspect, and only then do they pay. This builds trust instantly and encourages referrals—once you prove your quality, their network calls you next.”\nKey Points\nTrust Economy: Personal and peer endorsements drive selection.\nRisk Removal: Pay-after-inspection assures satisfaction.\nReferral Engine: Happy customers become advocates.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nReflect on a personal example: recall a time you hired someone only after seeing proof of work.\nShare in pairs: how would you explain the install-first model to a skeptical homeowner?\nNote one phrase or script line you’d use in your pitch.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants stuck on objections →\u000b Solution: Model a script: “I’ll secure this repair now; if you’re not satisfied, you don’t pay.”\nIssue: Skepticism about cash flow →\u000b Solution: Explain supplier partnerships that allow deferred payment.\u000b\nTransition\n“Now that you’ve internalized how to sell on trust, let’s move to our Service Package Builder slide.”\n139\n\nService Package Builder\nDay 5\nSelect interventions → See total cost → Calculate savings → Generate ROI → Price package\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10:35 – 10:45 Service Package Builder (10 min)\nPurpose\u000b Demonstrate how to assemble a tailored service package by selecting interventions, viewing total cost, calculating savings, generating ROI, and finalizing a price—all within a single interactive tool.\nSetup\u000b • Slide displayed full‑screen showing the Package Builder UI mock‑up\u000b • Each team at a laptop with the Solution Designer + Quote Generator open side by side\nMaterials needed\u000b • Spreadsheet or web‑based Package Builder tool\u000b • Calculator or device for quick checks\nPre‑activity checks\nConfirm the tool’s intervention checkboxes or dropdowns (coatings, vents, seals) are visible\nEnsure the total cost, savings, payback, and suggested price fields update live\u000b\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Now you’ll see how to use our Service Package Builder to craft a custom offer in minutes.

Next, it calculates your projected savings from the Energy Calculator and displays ROI—how many months to break even. Finally, it suggests a package price by applying your markup. This live builder lets you iterate options with your client on the spot and lock in a profitable yet compelling offer.”\nKey Points:\nSelect Interventions drives cost and impact.\nTotal Cost updates instantly from your BOM entries.\nSavings & ROI link back to your ΔT and amp savings figures.\nSuggested Price applies your margin, ensuring profitability.\nLocal example\n“In a recent Mosul pilot, a contractor used this builder live with a shop owner—finalizing a 1.2 M IQD package in under five minutes.”\nActivity Instructions:\nIn the Package Builder, tick the interventions your team chose.\nWatch the Total Cost field reflect your selections.\nReview the live Projected Savings and Pay‑back Period.\nNote the Suggested Price, then adjust the markup % if you wish.\nRecord your final package details for discussion.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIntervention checkbox not working\u000b – Solution: Refresh the tool or re‑click the dropdown icon.\nROI not updating\u000b – Solution: Ensure your Energy Calculator inputs (ΔT, amps) were saved correctly.\nSuggested price feels off\u000b – Solution: Adjust the markup percentage in the yellow input cell.\nTransition\u000b “With your service package built, let’s move to Mock Diagnosis & Portfolio Assembly—where you’ll practice presenting and capturing these packages as your own branded case studies.”\n140\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 5\n141\n\nMock Diagnosis & Portfolio Assembly\nDay 5\n🎯 Goal: Simulate a client review—assemble your best proof from Days 1–4 into one showcase\n\n📂 Assets Folder: “Day 1–4 Assets” (photos, charts, videos, designs)\n\n✅ Checklist:\nDay 1: Audit photos & ΔT charts\nDay 2: Roof scratch-test pics & ROI sheet\nDay 3: Wall-Hook video\nDay 4: Leak-Fix reel & Tune-Up card\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10 : 45 – 10 : 50 (5 min) Exercise Overview & Asset Checklist\nPurpose\u000b Frame the Mock Fault-Diagnosis & Portfolio Assembly exercise: you’ll act as both technician and marketer by compiling one proof item per day into a cohesive portfolio.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed prominently.\u000b – Shared “Day 1–4 Assets” folder open on-screen.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Access to shared folder via team device.\u000b – Drag-and-drop portfolio template (PowerPoint or PDF editor).\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Confirm each team can see all four days’ asset sub-folders.\u000b – Ensure portfolio template is loaded and ready for editing.\nFacilitator Script\n“This exercise simulates a client walkthrough.

      "content": "This is a comprehensive task asking me to:\n\n1. Review and compare the insulation training curriculum.md with the insulation overview v2 and program flow explanation.MD files and slides\n2. Identify alignments and divergences between them\n3. Develop a process to align the slides with the implementation guide\n4. Compare with Arabic language interviews from project knowledge\n5. Have expert trainers critique it\n6. Provide updated files: insulation-overview.md, curriculum.md, system_design.md, and detailed_tables.md\n\nLet me start by analyzing the documents provided:\n\nFrom the slides (both .txt and .pdf versions), I can see a 5-day training program covering:\n- Day 1: Understanding Heat & Trust (heat transfer basics, audits, value propositions)\n- Day 2: Roofs & Material Testing (coating tests, ROI calculations)\n- Day 3: Walls, Windows & BOQ (mix ratios, plaster work, cost cases)\n- Day 4: Retrofit Planning & Quoting (service packages, leak fixes, marketing)\n- Day 5: Enterprise & Energy Solutions (portfolio assembly, final pitches)\n\nThe structure follows a consistent 3-block rhythm each day:\n- Learn (theory/concepts)\n- Apply (hands-on practice)\n- Sell (business/marketing skills)\n\nKey themes I notice:\n- Strong emphasis on practical, hands-on activities\n- Integration of technical skills with business/sales training\n- Use of local examples (Mosul context)\n- Focus on building trust and quality\n- Spreadsheet tools for calculations (Energy Calculator, Quote Generator, etc.)\n- Portfolio building throughout the week\n- WhatsApp integration for community building\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for the curriculum.md, insulation overview, and Arabic interviews to compare.I'll analyze the alignment between the provided slide content and search for the referenced curriculum documents and Arabic interviews in the project knowledge.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGreat, I found the curriculum.md file. Let me search for more related documents including the insulation overview and Arabic interviews.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood, I found the insulation-overview-v2 document. Now let me search for the Arabic interviews to understand the local context and expert feedback.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nNow let me search for the system design and detailed tables documents.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nI now have a comprehensive understanding of the documents. Let me analyze the alignment and divergences between them and look for any Arabic interview insights. I found some Arabic transcripts that provide expert feedback. Let me compile my analysis.\n\nBased on my review, here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Alignments:**\n- Both the slides and curriculum follow the same 5-day structure\n- They share the 3-block daily rhythm (Learn, Apply, Sell)\n- Both emphasize hands-on learning and practical application\n- Focus on building a business, not just technical skills\n- Use of local Mosul context and examples\n- Integration of spreadsheet tools for calculations\n\n2. **Divergences:**\n- The slides are more detailed in implementation steps while the curriculum is more conceptual\n- The curriculum has more emphasis on competitions and team dynamics\n- The slides include more technical specifications (U-values, material properties)\n- The curriculum provides clearer activity codes and timing\n- The workbook system in the detailed files is more comprehensive than what's shown in slides\n\n3. **Arabic Interview Insights:**\n- Muthanna emphasizes engineers can't do hands-on work but need to understand supervision\n- Omar highlights the huge market opportunity (80% of homes need insulation)\n- Both experts stress the importance of quality and trust over price\n- Cultural considerations like gender-mixed teams and prayer times are mentioned\n- The need for practical demonstrations and real-world examples is emphasized\n\nLet me now create the requested documents with improved alignment.Based on my comprehensive review of the slides, curriculum documents, and Arabic expert interviews, I've identified key alignments and divergences. Let me provide an analysis followed by updated documents that better integrate all perspectives.\n\n## Analysis of Alignment and Divergences\n\n### Where They Align:\n1. **5-Day Progressive Structure**: Both follow the journey from problem identification (Day 1) to business launch (Day 5)\n2. **3-Block Daily Rhythm**: Learn → Apply → Sell framework is consistent\n3. **Local Context**: Strong emphasis on Mosul-specific challenges (generator costs, heat stress, abandoned rooms)\n4. **Business Focus**: Beyond technical skills to entrepreneurship\n5. **Hands-on Learning**: Practical activities with real materials and measurements\n\n### Where They Diverge:\n1. **Level of Detail**: Slides provide step-by-step implementation while curriculum focuses on learning objectives\n2. **Activity Timing**: Slides have precise minute allocations; curriculum uses hour blocks\n3. **Assessment Methods**: Curriculum emphasizes competitions; slides focus on portfolio building\n4. **Technical Depth**: Slides include specific formulas and calculations; curriculum stays conceptual\n5. **Support Systems**: Workbook integration is mentioned in curriculum but not fully developed in slides\n\n### Insights from Arabic Interviews:\n- **Muthanna Al-Mashhadani** emphasizes that engineers supervise but don't do manual work - training should focus on knowledge to guide technicians\n-

When suppliers see you're training their future customers, they'll offer better prices and even donate materials.\"\n- Omar Rashid, Building Supply Owner\n\n### Daily Implementation Details\n\n#### Day 1: Energy Detective Keys to Success\n**Morning Energy Builder:**\nShow actual generator fuel consumption - pour 20L of fuel (worth 30,000 IQD) into clear container to visualize daily waste.\n\n**Critical Teaching Moments:**\n- When measuring amps: \"Every amp is 18,000 IQD monthly\"\n- When finding hot spots: \"Feel this? That's money escaping\"\n- When calculating costs: Show monthly, yearly, 5-year totals\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- Don't use watts for daily calculations (use kWh)\n- Don't assume 24-hour cooling (use realistic 10-12 hours)\n- Don't forget abandoned room opportunity costs\n\n#### Day 2: Building Science Breakthrough\n**Morning Demonstration:**\nSet up three boxes:\n1. Uninsulated (reaches 50°C inside)\n2. Roof only insulated (40°C)\n3. Fully treated (32°C)\n\n**Key Insight from Field:**\n\"People think insulation is just about heat, but in Mosul, it's about moisture too. Show how poor insulation causes condensation, mold, and health problems.\"\n- Dr. Fatima Al-Rashidi, Building Scientist\n\n**Hands-On Activities:**\n- Touch different surfaces to feel heat transfer\n- Use smoke pencils to find air movement\n- Measure surface temperatures throughout day\n- Calculate heat gain for each component\n\n#### Day 3: Materials Mastery\n**Supplier Engagement Session:**\n\"Have suppliers compete for the trainees' future business. Run a 'supplier showcase' where each presents their best products and prices.\"\n- Khalid Ibrahim, Successful Contractor\n\n**Quality Testing Lab:**\n- Mix different ratios of perlite\n- Test coating coverage rates\n- Compare foam expansion rates\n- Document quality differences\n\n**Cost Transparency Exercise:**\nBuild complete BOM live:\n- Materials: Show actual invoices\n- Labor: Calculate hourly rates\n- Overhead: Explain each component\n- Profit: Justify margins ethically\n\n#### Day 4: Professional Practice\n**Diagnostic Role Play:**\n\"The difference between amateur and professional is the diagnostic. Professionals find problems customers didn't know they had.\"",

That's money escaping\"\n- When calculating costs: Show monthly, yearly, 5-year totals\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- Don't use watts for daily calculations (use kWh)\n- Don't assume 24-hour cooling (use realistic 10-12 hours)\n- Don't forget abandoned room opportunity costs\n\n#### Day 2: Building Science Breakthrough\n**Morning Demonstration:**\nSet up three boxes:\n1. Uninsulated (reaches 50°C inside)\n2. Roof only insulated (40°C)\n3. Fully treated (32°C)\n\n**Key Insight from Field:**\n\"People think insulation is just about heat, but in Mosul, it's about moisture too. Show how poor insulation causes condensation, mold, and health problems.\"\n- Dr. Fatima Al-Rashidi, Building Scientist\n\n**Hands-On Activities:**\n- Touch different surfaces to feel heat transfer\n- Use smoke pencils to find air movement\n- Measure surface temperatures throughout day\n- Calculate heat gain for each component\n\n#### Day 3: Materials Mastery\n**Supplier Engagement Session:**\n\"Have suppliers compete for the trainees' future business. Run a 'supplier showcase' where each presents their best products and prices.\"\n- Khalid Ibrahim, Successful Contractor\n\n**Quality Testing Lab:**\n- Mix different ratios of perlite\n- Test coating coverage rates\n- Compare foam expansion rates\n- Document quality differences\n\n**Cost Transparency Exercise:**\nBuild complete BOM live:\n- Materials: Show actual invoices\n- Labor: Calculate hourly rates\n- Overhead: Explain each component\n- Profit: Justify margins ethically\n\n#### Day 4: Professional Practice\n**Diagnostic Role Play:**\n\"The difference between amateur and professional is the diagnostic.

Share your first week wins:\n✓ How many people did you talk to?\n✓ What surprised you most?\n✓ What help do you need?\nRemember: Every expert was once a beginner!\"\n\n#### Success Story Sharing:\n\"Ahmed started with his uncle's house. The 5°C temperature drop impressed the neighbors. By week 3, he had 5 projects lined up. Now he's training his cousin.\"\n\n#### Common Early Challenges:\n1. Customer skepticism → Solution: Offer small trial area\n2. Price resistance → Solution: Show monthly savings\n3. Technical doubts → Solution: Bring customer to completed project\n4. Cash flow → Solution: 50% deposits, quick completions\n\n### Cultural Integration Points\n\n#### Trust Building in Mosul Context:\n\"In our culture, your work represents your family's honor. Always deliver more than promised. The customer's comfort is your reputation.\"\n- Traditional opening by elder craftsman\n\n#### Faith-Based Motivation:\n\"Providing comfort to families is sadaqah.

I found some Arabic transcripts that provide expert feedback. Let me compile my analysis.\n\nBased on my review, here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Alignments:**\n- Both the slides and curriculum follow the same 5-day structure\n- They share the 3-block daily rhythm (Learn, Apply, Sell)\n- Both emphasize hands-on learning and practical application\n- Focus on building a business, not just technical skills\n- Use of local Mosul context and examples\n- Integration of spreadsheet tools for calculations\n\n2. **Divergences:**\n- The slides are more detailed in implementation steps while the curriculum is more conceptual\n- The curriculum has more emphasis on competitions and team dynamics\n- The slides include more technical specifications (U-values, material properties)\n- The curriculum provides clearer activity codes and timing\n- The workbook system in the detailed files is more comprehensive than what's shown in slides\n\n3. **Arabic Interview Insights:**\n- Muthanna emphasizes engineers can't do hands-on work but need to understand supervision\n- Omar highlights the huge market opportunity (80% of homes need insulation)\n- Both experts stress the importance of quality and trust over price\n- Cultural considerations like gender-mixed teams and prayer times are mentioned\n- The need for practical demonstrations and real-world examples is emphasized\n\nLet me now create the requested documents with improved alignment.",

            "text": "Based on my comprehensive review of the slides, curriculum documents, and Arabic expert interviews, I've identified key alignments and divergences. Let me provide an analysis followed by updated documents that better integrate all perspectives.\n\n## Analysis of Alignment and Divergences\n\n### Where They Align:\n1. **5-Day Progressive Structure**: Both follow the journey from problem identification (Day 1) to business launch (Day 5)\n2. **3-Block Daily Rhythm**: Learn → Apply → Sell framework is consistent\n3. **Local Context**: Strong emphasis on Mosul-specific challenges (generator costs, heat stress, abandoned rooms)\n4. **Business Focus**: Beyond technical skills to entrepreneurship\n5. **Hands-on Learning**: Practical activities with real materials and measurements\n\n### Where They Diverge:\n1. **Level of Detail**: Slides provide step-by-step implementation while curriculum focuses on learning objectives\n2. **Activity Timing**: Slides have precise minute allocations; curriculum uses hour blocks\n3. **Assessment Methods**: Curriculum emphasizes competitions; slides focus on portfolio building\n4. **Technical Depth**: Slides include specific formulas and calculations; curriculum stays conceptual\n5. **Support Systems**: Workbook integration is mentioned in curriculum but not fully developed in slides\n\n### Insights from Arabic Interviews:\n- **Muthanna Al-Mashhadani** emphasizes that engineers supervise but don't do manual work - training should focus on knowledge to guide technicians\n- **Omar Laith** confirms 80% of Mosul homes lack proper insulation - massive market opportunity\n- Both stress quality over price and building trust through demonstrations\n- Cultural considerations: mixed gender teams for household visits, prayer time scheduling\n\n## Process to Align Slides with Implementation Guide:\n\n1. **Standardize Activity Codes**: Add curriculum activity codes (D1-A1, etc.) to each slide\n2. **Integrate Workbook Callouts**: Add prominent boxes showing which spreadsheet tab to use\n3. **Add Timing Blocks**: Include clear time allocations matching curriculum structure\n4. **Enhance Cultural Context**: Add facilitator notes about gender considerations and local customs\n5. **Include Assessment Rubrics**: Add scoring criteria for competitions and certifications\n\n---\n\n# Updated insulation-overview.md\n\n```markdown\n# Insulation Business Training Program - Integrated Overview\n## Building Comfort, Building Prosperity in Mosul\n\n### Program
