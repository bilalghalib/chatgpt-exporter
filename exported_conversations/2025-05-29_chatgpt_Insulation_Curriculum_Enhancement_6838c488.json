I guess to point out that wealthy people might need to be sold to differently because they don't care how much they pay for electricity, they might be more convinced about the health benefits or...\n\nwhat data? how do we collect the data in a way that builds credibility?\n\nyay day 5 we got the financial literacy plan in there\n\nWhat can we do for day five evening, this is where they should be getting certified, we need to be able to assess them for some practical things, and to connect them to the job market, i had intended to have professionals come and review their work, although it's different than the solar training, there's no one thing to do, i wonder how to do this best, ideas? \n\nDay 6 homeowner is the person themself or their father, the idea is to design the best intervention for your home and perhaps to \"be sold on it\" yourself. It might be interesting to allocate 500$ to be used for home insulation improvements for the participant with the highest scores, most engagement, best design, not sure what else could be nice to use so there's some competition and we allocate 250$ for the top 3 participants to do an actual install? or 500 and 250 for #2\n\nDay 6 is optional so we can't put the certification in it. the actual client is the person themself or people close to them they can access their homes (privacy is a big deal, not everyone can go to anyone's home)\n\ni like the alumni network whatsapp feedback from senior practitioners the trainer is that person, although it'd be nice to have more folk\n\nthere i sno interest in mosul, it's ofrbidden so we don't put it on the Financial literacy exam, roi, business model concepts, \n\nOk, here's my feedback, review, think about how to address each element in 2-3 orthogonal ways pick the best one and then update the document in full\n]]]",

      "content": "The insulation curriculum has been updated in full to integrate your detailed feedback and the insights from all trainer interviews. Here’s what’s changed and improved:\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 **Key Enhancements Made:**\n\n1. **Relevance and Engagement Boosted on Day 1**:\n   - Added myths people actually believe (e.g., white paint = insulation).\n   - Shifted focus to emotional/health impacts (e.g., divorce, illness, floor abandonment) via a sticky-note empathy map.\n   - Replaced incense reference with a trainer-led airflow demo.\n\n2. **Stronger Tool & Documentation Practice**:\n   - Introduced a printable spreadsheet for home audits.\n   - Clarified what “document findings systematically” means.\n\n3. **Roof + Solar Integration & Realism**:\n   - Roof insulation framed as ideal but rare; coating taught as the second-best method.\n   - Cross-link with solar savings introduced.\n   - Demo of paint-on-dust failure added.\n\n4. **Practicality Over Perfection in Material Use**:\n   - Added perlite/labkh plaster lab with a skilled tradesperson.\n   - Clarified ICF use, cost, structural doubts, and installability (including “filline” questions for validation).\n\n5. **Stronger Business Modeling + AC Strategy**:\n   - Introduced resale of oversized AC units as part of customer sales pitch and ROI strategy.\n   - Included Comfort Package builder and client tier sales tactics.\n\n6. **Ventilation Nuance**:\n   - Modeled when to seal vs. when to ventilate.\n   - Outlined practical uses of vents beyond standard windows (e.g., kitchens, stairs, roof).\n\n7. **Sales Mastery & Market Fit**:\n   - Reworked “market tiers” framing to guide actual behavior: wealthy need health framing; middle-class respond to comfort/ROI.\n\n8. **Improved Certification Plan**:\n   - Moved certification to Day 5 (practical & peer-reviewed).\n   - Day 6 made competitive with funding incentives for real home insulation.\n\n9. **Post-Training Engagement**:\n   - WhatsApp alumni network sustained.\n   - Added 30-day follow-up requirements (results, photos, client reports).\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like:\n- A visual one-pager of the new curriculum.\n- A printable home energy audit form.\n- A workshop kit list with budget.\n- A trainer onboarding guide.\n\nReady when you are.",
