Leveraging them makes learning and doing new things easier and more fun.\n\nIn Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strength”. It is a strength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when it’s used rather than taking effort.\n\nUsing our Signature Strengths can help us bring energy and promotes wellbeing at work.\n\nThe assessment represents an analysis of virtues and values held by people around the world. Twenty-four Character Strengths are unequivocally known to be good.

We leverage a mix of enterprise assessments and personal skill/strength assessment tools to help guide people and teams on a path of growth and impact.\n\nBloom is also actively developing **methods and online tools** that can be used by other training programs to boost impact.\n\n**Mentors, Experts & Fellows**\n\nWe engage mentors, experts & fellows worldwide to provide targeted support to our enterprises and programs in 4 primary domains: **1 Sector experts** (education, migration, health, etc); **2 Technical experts** (big data, IoS/hardware, digital media/comms, etc); **3 Enterprise / organizational growth experts** (for HR, design/UX/UI, revenue models, marketing, etc); & **4 Personal growth & universal skills development**.\n\nTeams often work with multiple mentors, experts and fellows simultaneously, or evolving over time, depending on their needs.\n\n**2**\n\n**Our Team**\n\n**development of essential personal**\n\nBloom’s lead trainers individually have **9-12 years experience (each) training and supporting innovation and entrepreneurship** across the MENA region, including substantial experience working with people from marginalized, underrepresented, migrant, and refugee communities.\n\nThey also have substantial prior experience in entrepreneurship, tech, education, and community building in the US.\n\n**Our Track Record**\n\nWe’ve worked with **over 850 teams over the last 8 years** in Lebanon and the region, with a focus on early-stage startups and social enterprises, through online and offline programs.\n\nOur teams have mobilized **over $7m in next-stage funding,** won prizes (national, regional, and global), and gained acceptance in top accelerators in Lebanon and worldwide.\n\nWe’ve collaborated with **leading local, regional and international partners** in the tech, accelerator, corporate, government, INGO, and university sectors.\n\n**Our Mission 3**\n\nOur mission at Bloom is to detach opportunity from geography/identity/biography by making holistic entrepreneurship education universal, enabling collective action to address global challenges and build a more equal world.\n\n**Program Analysis: The Lebanon Growth Accelerator Program (LGA)**\n\n**4**\n\nThe Lebanon Growth Accelerator is an initiative to re-ignite and boost the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Lebanon.\n\nIt aims to create employment through direct enterprise and\n\n.\n\naccelerator programs\n\nThe **goal is to improve opportunities** short-term and long-term for **Lebanese and refugees,** especially vulnerable and marginalized communities.\n\nThis program is supported by The European Regional Development and Protection Programme for Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq (RDPP II).\n\nenhancing\n\necosystem collaboration, resources and capacities\n\n**Celebrating The Lebanon Growth Accelerator Accomplishments.**\n\n5\n\n**Our Bloom Strategies 6**\n\n**Platform:** A combined “project management tool” for teams and a “program management tool” for project-based learning and implementation programs, for entrepreneurship education programs, accelerators, or companies. Core focus on encouraging and engaging cross-border mentorship. Allowing remotely run programs by high quality facilitators to expand reach. Enabling teams, mentors and program managers with data via assessments & analytics.\n\n**Library of Assessments & Activities:** Developing metrics-driven tools for individuals, teams and programs to create custom learning journeys and offer recommended learning activities.\n\n**Programs:** Both programs for teams, and programs for programs (supporting accelerators & communities of practice); we define our success by how much we can help others become successful.\n\n**Community:** We are strongly community-focused, engaging and supporting the ecosystem, while also focusing on social impact and sustainability, primarily through the lens of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)\n\n**Our Online Approach 7**\n\nOur shift to online programs happened in tandem with our affiliated efforts to build and launch Bloom, an online platform for projects, programs and accelerated learning and growth.\n\n**Online programs expand access for people outside of main cities and enable us to reach marginalized and refugee communities, and people with other time constraints (work, family, studies, etc) or social/mobility constraints.**\n\n**Our objective is to make online programs more engaging and more impactful than offline programs.**\n\nIf all it took was knowledge, we’d all be billionaires with six-pack abs.\n\n\\-Derek Sivers\n\n**Bloom Program Experience 9**\n\nBloom cycles take the best from **agile** and **design thinking methodologies** to create a **learning by doing experience.**.
