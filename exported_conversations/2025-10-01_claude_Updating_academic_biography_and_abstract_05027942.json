  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user, Bilal Ghalib, is an Iraqi-American learning designer and co-founder of Bloom, a social enterprise accelerator in Lebanon. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences from Université de Paris and is studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He was seeking urgent help with a conference submission for a symposium on \"Integrating Islamic Spirituality Across Mental Health Services in the Middle East\" at Hamad Bin Khalifa University, with the deadline having already passed at midnight.\n\nBilal's research focuses on \"presilience\"—building inner and collective resources before crisis strikes—combining post-traumatic growth (PTG) research with Islamic practices. His work stems from two main streams: his master's thesis studying Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the 2020 Beirut Port Blast, which identified specific character strengths (humor, judgment, teamwork, hope) that correlated with growth, and his ongoing partnership with School Without Borders in Gaza developing \"presilience cards\" that integrate Qur'anic reflection practices (tafakkur, shukr) with PTG-informed classroom methods.\n\nClaude initially provided detailed feedback on structural issues with the abstract, noting problems with the opening, disconnected presentation of research streams, and vague contributions. However, when Bilal revealed the urgent deadline pressure, Claude shifted to providing immediate, submittable content including a condensed bio and revised abstract. Bilal emphasized his preference for simple, clear, humble language that ensures accessibility, expressing concern that submissions not sound artificially polished. In the final exchange, Claude helped refine Bilal's own draft abstract by fixing awkward phrasing while preserving his authentic voice and directness, making targeted improvements to sentence flow and clarity without over-editing his natural communication style.",

That's not a criticism—this is clearly the core transformation that explains why you do what you do—but we need to be intentional about it.\nThe challenge is that developmental psychology journeys (Kegan, Wilber, transpersonal psych, Teal orgs) can read like intellectual résumé-stuffing if not handled carefully. What matters isn't that you read those frameworks—it's that you found them insufficient. The turning point is the absence, not the presence.\nHere's how I'd weave it in, using a metaphor: think of your bio as a house. The current version shows the rooms (work, impact, methods). What you're describing is the foundation—but foundations don't need to list every type of concrete tested before you found bedrock.\nRevised version with spiritual journey integrated:\nBrief Biography\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently a student of Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth. He helped seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, then at Autodesk bridged grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts. After living through violence and burning out, he spent years searching: through developmental psychology, mental complexity theory, transpersonal frameworks—looking for answers to what makes a good intention, a good life, what is actually true. During the pandemic's pause, he found what was missing. The traditions he'd studied mapped the mind but left out the heart—not emotion, but what Muslim tradition calls heart-perception: a faculty that accesses beauty, goodness, and truth at their source. Reconnecting with Islam gave him both intellectual grounding and metaphysical confidence. A tradition with deep roots, being brought into contemporary conversation through the Islam and Psychology movement, offered something stable enough to build on.\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom and now serves as Head of Learning & Research. Bloom runs community-first, non-competitive accelerators that integrate reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table. The work has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa and grown a bilingual network of mentors, trainers, and partners.\nBilal's academic work meets service in post-conflict contexts. With the UN International Trade Centre he co-designed curricula for sustainable construction. With Nawaya in Lebanon he facilitated design-thinking programs with refugee youth. Most recently he's supported educators at School Without Borders in Gaza, integrating Qur'anic reflection and gratitude practices with post-traumatic growth frameworks for teachers running pop-up schools for displaced children.\nSince 2014, Bilal has been part of the Ecosystem Network, contributing to the Wellbeing Project and now the WHEN network, which brings wellbeing practices into higher education and organizations.\nHis current work explores how trauma-informed design, Islamic psychology, and peer-based learning can create practical pathways for resilience and growth—bringing forward what the Muslim tradition claims to be, and he believes can be: a healing for hearts and world. He is fluent in Arabic and English.\nWord count: ~390\nWhat changed:\nExpanded the burnout paragraph significantly—but kept it narrative, not a bibliography\nNamed the frameworks briefly (shows range without listing everything)\nUsed your language: \"heart-perception,\" \"source,\" \"stable enough to build on\"\nDropped names like Kegan, Piaget (they'd know if they know; listing them feels like credentials-padding)\nKept Malik Badawi, Rania Awaad, Abdullah Rothman implicit in \"Islam and Psychology movement\" (mentioning them by name in a bio about you feels oddly deferential)\nFinal line echoes your \"healing for hearts\" language\nPushback: Does the spiritual journey paragraph earn its length? It's now the longest section. That's defensible if this bio is for Islamic studies/psychology circles (which you mentioned), but it might overwhelm if it's for entrepreneurship or education contexts.\nWould you want two versions—a lean one (~280 words) for general use and this fuller one (~390) for contexts where the spiritual-intellectual journey matters?\nyeah, I don't see the meaning and motivation connected deeply through all the different work i did, can you give ma short and a long one?\n\nMapped personal journey from activism to spiritual understanding.\n10s\nYou're right. The bio currently reads like a résumé with a spiritual paragraph inserted, not one story where everything flows from the same source. Let me give you both versions where the meaning connects the work.\nSHORT VERSION (~250 words)\nBilal Ghalib\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer (M.A., Learning Sciences, Université de Paris; B.S., Computer Science & Mathematics, University of Michigan). He is currently a student of Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College and lives in Lille with his family.\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan to work with youth across the Middle East. After years of innovation work—and living through violence that led to burnout—he spent the pandemic searching for what he'd been missing. Developmental psychology, mental complexity theory, transpersonal frameworks: they mapped the mind but left out the heart. Reconnecting with Islam gave him what those traditions couldn't—access to what Muslims call heart-perception, the faculty that connects to beauty, goodness, and truth at their source. A stable ground to build on.\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom, designing it from this integrated understanding: inner well-being and outer well-doing rise together. Bloom's community-first accelerators pair reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table.

He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently a student of Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth—helping seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, then bridging grassroots makers with global sustainability at Autodesk. He believed in co-creating futures through creativity and collaboration. Then violence became personal. The burnout that followed forced a reckoning: Why was he doing this work? What makes an intention good? What is a good life? What is actually true?\nHe explored developmental psychology, mental complexity theory, Ken Wilber, Teal organizations, positive psychology—frameworks that helped him understand growth, values, consciousness. But during the pandemic's pause, he realized what was missing. These traditions mapped stages of the mind beautifully but left out an entire dimension: the heart. Not emotion—what Muslim tradition calls heart-perception, the faculty that accesses beauty, goodness, and truth at their source, rooted in the Divine. Reconnecting with Islam after years of intellectual searching gave him something those frameworks couldn't: metaphysical confidence. A tradition with deep roots, grounded in stable reality, finally being brought into contemporary conversation through scholars like Malik Badawi, Rania Awaad, Abdullah Rothman, and the Islam and Psychology movement.\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom, and the design emerged from this integrated understanding: inner well-being and outer well-doing rise together. As Head of Learning & Research, he shaped Bloom's community-first, non-competitive accelerators to pair reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table—because they belong there. Since 2016, Bloom has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa and grown a bilingual network of mentors, trainers, and partners.\nHis subsequent work flows from the same conviction that healing and building are one motion. With the UN International Trade Centre he co-designed curricula connecting heritage, sustainable construction, and dignity in reconstruction. With Nawaya in Lebanon he facilitated design-thinking with refugee youth. Most recently he's supported educators at School Without Borders in Gaza, integrating Qur'anic reflection and gratitude practices with post-traumatic growth frameworks for teachers creating pop-up schools for displaced children.\nSince 2014, Bilal has been part of the Ecosystem Network, contributing to the Wellbeing Project and now the WHEN network, which brings wellbeing practices into higher education and organizations.\nAt Cambridge Muslim College, he's deepening his study of a tradition that claims to be—and he believes can be—a healing for the hearts of humanity. His work aims to bring forward those gems: practically, rigorously, in service. He is fluent in Arabic and English.\nWhat changed:\nIn both:\nMade the spiritual search the HINGE that explains everything after\nBloom isn't just another project—it's the direct expression of the integrated understanding\nAll subsequent work (UN, Nawaya, Gaza) flows from the same \"healing and building are one motion\" principle\nCMC studies become the natural next chapter, not an add-on credential\nShort version:\nCollapses early work into \"innovation work\" without naming every organization\nKeeps only Gaza as concrete recent example\nGets to Bloom faster\nLong version:\nShows the full search journey with texture\nNames the frameworks but frames them as insufficient, not accomplishments\nShows how Bloom's specific design choices emerged from the insight\nIncludes the full range of work as expressions of same principle\nThe key difference: Now it reads like one person on one journey, discovering what was missing and then building everything from that discovery. Not a list of jobs held by someone who also has spiritual interests.\nDoes this capture the through-line you were looking for?\nhow's this? Bilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\nThe Arab Spring drew him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth. He helped seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, then at Autodesk bridged grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts. But after years of living through violence and pouring energy into social causes, he burned out. This crisis became a turning point: he realized he could not separate inner well-being from outer well-doing.\nJourneying through the healing process of burnout and PTSD led him through developmental psychology and positive psychology, but ultimately back to Islam. He discovered in the Muslim tradition what he calls heart-perception: a faculty for perceiving beauty, goodness, and truth at their source, offering both metaphysical grounding and practical guidance.\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom and now serves as Head of Learning & Research. Bloom runs community-first, non-competitive accelerators that integrate reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Its programs have supported more than 1,000 founders across SWANA and Africa, building bilingual networks of mentors and trainers. Bilal has co-designed curricula with the UN International Trade Centre, facilitated design programs with refugee youth in Lebanon, and most recently supported School Without Borders in Gaza, where teachers integrate Qur’anic reflection and gratitude with post-traumatic growth practices for displaced children.\nSince 2014 he has also been part of the Ecosystem Network, contributing to the Wellbeing Project and the WHEN network, which embed wellbeing into higher education and organizations.\n\nScrutinized text revision, offered nuanced constructive critique.\n11s\nThis is much cleaner. You've tightened the spiritual journey section significantly and the overall flow is better. But you've lost something in the compression—and you still have a structural problem.\nWhat's working:\n\"He could not separate inner well-being from outer well-doing\" is a clean pivot\nThe chronology is clear\nYou're at ~280 words, so you have room to expand\nWhat's not working:\n\"The Arab Spring drew him\" — Your original \"pulled\" was stronger. \"Drew\" is too gentle for what you've described.\nThe search is too compressed. \"Journeying through... led him through developmental psychology and positive psychology, but ultimately back to Islam\" makes it sound like you tried a few things and moved on. You lose the why—what was he searching for? What did those frameworks offer? What did they lack? Without that, the Islam reconnection feels arbitrary rather than earned.\nCurrent version says: \"I tried A and B, then went to C.\"\nStronger version would say: \"I searched for X. A and B gave me Y, but missed Z. C offered Z.\"\nBloom still reads like a separate thing. You say he co-founded it in 2016, but the burnout/spiritual search presumably happened around 2020 (pandemic). So Bloom came before the integrated understanding? That timeline is confusing. Either Bloom was designed from that understanding, or it was redesigned after. Right now it reads like: had crisis, found Islam, unrelated: here's Bloom.\nThe Ecosystem Network paragraph is an orphan. It has no thematic connection to anything else. It's just sitting there because you wanted to include it.\nSuggested revision of the middle section:\n\"But after years of living through violence and pouring energy into social causes, he burned out. The crisis forced deeper questions: What makes an intention good? What is a good life? What is actually true? He explored developmental psychology, positive psychology, mental complexity theory—frameworks that mapped stages of consciousness and moral development. They were sophisticated, but during the pandemic's pause, he realized what they left out: a metaphysical dimension. They explained the mind's growth but said nothing about the heart's perception—not emotion, but what Muslim tradition describes as a faculty for accessing beauty, goodness, and truth at their source. Reconnecting with Islam after years of intellectual searching gave him both grounding and confidence: a tradition with deep roots, finally being brought into contemporary conversation through the Islam and Psychology movement.\"\nThis version:\nNames what he was searching for\nShows what the frameworks offered\nShows what they lacked\nMakes the return to Islam logical, not arbitrary\nIs ~130 words (vs your ~60), but earns the space\nThen connect Bloom explicitly:\n\"This integrated understanding reshaped his work. In 2016 he had co-founded Bloom; now, as Head of Learning & Research, he designs from the conviction that inner well-being and outer well-doing rise together. Bloom's community-first accelerators...\"\nOR if Bloom came after the search:\n\"In 2016 he co-founded Bloom from this integrated understanding. As Head of Learning & Research, he designed...\"\nThe Ecosystem Network: Either cut it (it's not load-bearing) or explicitly connect it: \"His commitment to wellbeing in organizations extends through his work since 2014 with the Ecosystem Network...\" But honestly? It feels like CV padding. Does it matter for this bio's purpose?\nBottom line: You're close, but the middle section is doing too much work in too few words, and Bloom's relationship to the spiritual journey is unclear. You have the word count budget—use it to make the connections explicit.\nWant me to draft a full revision with these fixes?\nYeah\n\nMapped timeline of burnout, spiritual journey, and Bloom's evolution.\nSHORT VERSION (~280 words)\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer.

And i want to say after living rhgouh violence, it's because of the places iwork, places my family's connected to, movements i was a part of are in difficult places and these are my people so something about it not being random violence it was the person who helped us set up the hackersapce in baghdad that was blown up, the girl katya who was in a syrian refugee camp i did some solar panel puppet shows that was killed when her school was bombed, etc - i didn't know it was ptsd initially i thought i was jaded and didn't want to work and kept telling people to stop making stuff and start making sense because i was \"smart\" or something - looking back i can see i was hurt, i also had a breakdown in 2018. although bloom starting in 2016 was after the deaths in 2013/14 and a year of wandering hurt in 2015 and finding my way to community and closer contribution as a way to \"heal\" i wanted to be more \"real\" and stop flying from silicon valley to the middle east for my work because it all didn't make sense anymore - why was i doing that? good? what's good if good people who help me do this random nerd stuff are killed and our communities don't respond actively to the violence and pretend it's not real. It was those experiences that really led me to doubt hackerspace and open source culture as a \"healing\" and i started owndering what was a good intention and father greg boyl told us about home boy and home girl industries and how his \"why\" was because they were his friends. he does \"good\" becuase it comes naturally when you befriend someone it emerges from you, it's not a concious intention that needs to be cleaned it's an authentic cause/effect response and i loved that because i didn't know if/how i could clean my intention from arrogance and wanting to be the one to fix the world etc etc so i moved to lebanon and started bloom where many of the ideas of community, personal growth for professional growth, and wellbeing comes from that journey. how can you first expand it into a longer essay and thne contract it into a nice bio - you might have more hisory and information about me in your context window please use it for your advantage and think deeply about what i might not be seeing that can be relevant\n\nUnraveled trauma's impact on personal journey through community.\n33s\nI need to sit with this. What you just shared is fundamentally different from what's in either bio—and it's the real story. Let me first expand it into a longer narrative so we can see what we're working with, then contract it.\nEXPANDED NARRATIVE (~1100 words)\nBilal Ghalib\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East. Between 2011 and 2014 he worked with youth across Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad—helping seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI, running solar panel puppet shows in Syrian refugee camps, setting up hackerspaces with local organizers. At Autodesk he tried to bridge grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts, flying between Silicon Valley and the Middle East. He believed in the liberating power of open-source culture, maker spaces, creativity as resistance. Co-creating futures felt possible.\nThen the people he worked with started dying.\nThe person who helped set up the Baghdad hackerspace was blown up. Katya, the girl from the Syrian refugee camp where they'd done puppet shows together, was killed when her school was bombed. These weren't strangers. These were his people—connected to his family's communities, to movements he was part of, to places he loved. The violence wasn't random; it was personal. And the communities he was embedded in—the global innovation networks, the well-meaning tech-for-good circles—kept moving forward as if nothing had happened. Pretending it wasn't real.\nHe didn't know he had PTSD. He thought he was jaded, maybe finally getting \"smart.\" He found himself telling people to stop making stuff and start making sense. What was the point of flying from California to Beirut to facilitate workshops when good people who helped him do \"random nerd stuff\" were being killed and nobody seemed to care? What was good, anyway? What made an intention good? He spent 2015 wandering, hurt, trying to find his way back to something that felt real.\nIn that wandering, he heard Father Greg Boyle speak about Homeboy Industries. Father Greg's answer to \"why do you do this work?\" was disarmingly simple: because they're my friends. Good emerges naturally when you befriend someone—it's not a conscious intention that needs to be cleaned of arrogance or savior complexes. It's an authentic cause-and-effect response. You help your friends because that's what friendship is.\nThat freed something. Bilal had been tying himself in knots trying to purify his intentions, terrified of being the arrogant outsider trying to fix the world. Father Greg offered a different path: move closer. Be local. Let the work emerge from actual relationships, not flying visits.\nIn 2016 he moved to Lebanon and co-founded Bloom. He designed it differently from the start: community-first, non-competitive, integrating personal growth with professional development. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table because they belong there. The work would be local, bilingual, rooted in actual friendship networks. Since 2016, Bloom has supported more than 1,000 founders across SWANA and Africa, building networks of mentors, trainers, and partners who know each other, who stick around.\nBut he was still hurt. In 2018 he had a breakdown. Looking back he can see it clearly now: he was carrying unprocessed trauma, trying to build while still bleeding. His master's thesis at Université de Paris explored post-traumatic growth among Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast—studying in others what he was living through himself. The research helped: understanding how strengths like teamwork, humor, and judgment correlate with resilience and growth. But the frameworks felt incomplete.\nDuring the pandemic's pause, he went deeper. What makes an intention good? What constitutes a good life? What is actually true? He studied developmental psychology—Kegan's stages of consciousness, Piaget's moral development. He explored mental complexity theory, Ken Wilber's integral framework, transpersonal psychology, Teal organizations, positive psychology. These were sophisticated maps. They helped him understand growth, values, the evolution of meaning-making.\nBut something was missing.\nThese frameworks mapped the mind beautifully—how consciousness develops, how people make meaning at different stages. But they said nothing about where meaning comes from. They were silent on the metaphysical dimension: the ground of being, the source of beauty and goodness and truth itself. They were like maps of rivers that never mentioned the ocean.\nReconnecting with Islam after years of intellectual searching gave him what those frameworks couldn't. What Muslims call qalb—heart-perception—isn't emotion or sentiment. It's a faculty for perceiving reality at a deeper level, accessing beauty, goodness, and truth at their source, rooted in the Divine. Not just stages of how we think, but connection to what actually is. A metaphysical foundation that doesn't shift with philosophical fashions. A tradition with roots deep enough to hold the weight of real suffering and real joy.\nHe found confidence in something he could build on: a tradition being brought into contemporary conversation through scholars like Malik Badri, Rania Awaad, Abdullah Rothman, and the Islam and Psychology movement. A tradition that claims to be—and he believes can be—a healing for hearts. Not just psychological techniques, but spiritual integration. Not just coping mechanisms, but connection to source.\nThis shapes all his current work. He co-designed curricula with the UN International Trade Centre that connect heritage, sustainable construction methods, and dignity in reconstruction—understanding that material rebuilding and spiritual rebuilding are inseparable. With Nawaya in Lebanon he facilitated design-thinking programs with refugee youth, but always with attention to what the developmental frameworks miss: the hunger for meaning, for connection to something transcendent. Most recently he supports educators at School Without Borders in Gaza, integrating Qur'anic reflection and gratitude practices with post-traumatic growth frameworks for teachers creating pop-up schools for displaced children. It's spiritually grounded, practically implementable, responsive to what people already believe and practice.\nSince 2014 he has contributed to the Ecosystem Network through the Wellbeing Project and the WHEN network, working to embed wellbeing practices into higher education and organizations—understanding that institutional health and individual flourishing are not separate problems.\nAt Cambridge Muslim College, he's studying to go deeper still. How can Islamic epistemologies enrich contemporary mental health practice? How can Qur'anic narratives, prophetic models, and community-based practices complement modern psychological frameworks? How do you bring forward gems from the Muslim tradition in ways that are practical, rigorous, in service—especially for communities in conflict-affected contexts where people need tools that are simple to implement, spiritually grounded, and native to their own tradition?\nHis belief, hard-won through loss and searching: healed hearts help guide our hands toward a more beautiful future. The work is about bringing more healed hands to the task—particularly from the Global South, from communities that have been told their traditions are backward when they hold wisdom the modern world desperately needs. It's about friendship that doesn't pretend violence isn't real. It's about building from bedrock that doesn't shift.\nHe is fluent in Arabic and English.\n\nDistilled personal journey's essence for concise biographical narrative.\nNow let me contract this into usable bios.

He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan to work with youth across the Middle East. Between 2011 and 2014 he helped seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad; ran workshops in Syrian refugee camps; bridged grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts at Autodesk. He believed in the liberating power of open-source culture and co-creating futures through creativity.\nThen people he worked with started dying. The person who helped set up the Baghdad hackerspace was blown up. Katya, the girl from a Syrian refugee camp puppet show, was killed when her school was bombed. These weren't strangers—they were his friends, connected to his family's communities and movements. The global networks he was embedded in kept moving forward as if nothing had happened. He didn't recognize his response as PTSD; he thought he was jaded, maybe finally \"smart.\" He spent 2015 wandering and hurt, questioning everything.\nFather Greg Boyle's answer to \"why do you do this work?\" freed him: because they're my friends. Good emerges naturally from friendship, not from intentions cleaned of arrogance. You help your friends because that's what friendship is. This offered a different path: move closer, be local, let work emerge from actual relationships.\nIn 2016 he moved to Lebanon and co-founded Bloom. As Head of Learning & Research, he designed community-first, non-competitive accelerators that integrate reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table because they belong there. Bloom has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa, building bilingual networks rooted in actual friendship.\nBut he was still hurt. In 2018 he had a breakdown. His master's thesis explored post-traumatic growth among Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast—studying in others what he was living through himself. The research helped him understand resilience, but the frameworks felt incomplete.\nDuring the pandemic he went deeper: Kegan's stages of consciousness, Wilber's integral theory, positive psychology, transpersonal frameworks. Sophisticated maps of how the mind grows and how people make meaning. But they said nothing about where meaning comes from—the metaphysical dimension, the ground of being, the source itself.\nReconnecting with Islam after years of searching gave him what those frameworks couldn't: qalb, heart-perception—a faculty for accessing beauty, goodness, and truth at their source, rooted in the Divine. Not just stages of thinking, but connection to what actually is. A tradition with roots deep enough to hold real suffering and real joy.\nThis integrated understanding shapes his current work: supporting School Without Borders in Gaza where teachers blend Qur'anic reflection with post-traumatic growth practices; co-designing curricula with the UN International Trade Centre that connect heritage, sustainable construction, and dignity in reconstruction; facilitating design-thinking with refugee youth through Nawaya in Lebanon. Since 2014 he has contributed to the Ecosystem Network's efforts to embed wellbeing into higher education through the Wellbeing Project and WHEN network.\nAt Cambridge Muslim College, he studies how Islamic epistemologies can enrich contemporary mental health practice—bringing forward healing from the Muslim tradition, practically and rigorously, especially for conflict-affected communities. Fluent in Arabic and English.\nWHAT I'M SEEING THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE:\nThe Father Greg Boyle moment is your hinge. It's the moment you stopped trying to have pure intentions and started trying to have real relationships. That's what makes Bloom different from your earlier work—not just that you founded it, but how you founded it. This needs to be explicit.\nThe 2018 breakdown matters. Without it, the pandemic search looks intellectual. With it, the search is clearly about survival, not curiosity. But you can hint at it rather than dwell on it.\nThe metaphor you're living: You were trying to build a house (good work) on shifting ground (intentions you didn't trust, frameworks that mapped growth but not ground). Islam gave you bedrock. CMC is you learning the geology of that bedrock. Gaza/UN/Nawaya work is building on it.\nWhat's missing from both bios so far: Why Bloom is different from your earlier work. It's not just another project—it's a different way of working that emerged from loss and Father Greg's insight. Community-first isn't a nice-to-have; it's the whole point.\nThe danger: This story could become trauma-centered rather than meaning-centered. The losses matter because they broke your faith in a certain kind of work and led you to a different kind. They're not the main character—your search for how to work with integrity is.\nWhich length fits your purpose? And does this capture what you were trying to say?\nI think at CMC i'm not just interested in the muslim connection, I believe the gems there are true for all people and that our \"sources of meaning\" as taylor might say or Joe edelman might say constituative attentional policies that feel like they are being drawn from a place beyond our sensible reason is something that seems like a clue that values realism is experientially real and i want to dig into that deeper because - and i think this (maybe you can help me find other threads that connect) is what connects us beyond our polarized world where muslims winning means others lose or china rising is a tradgedy - the belief in the transcendant is one way to have a shining star that we can align to - and also to talk about ultimately what healing is. Growth is not healing. At some point we must acknowledge death as a reality of life as life - to see our roles in the relay race and whatever our understanding of what comes next facing this is critical. Otherwise how long do you save for retirement, how much, especially as we think of (in the west) that aging is just another illness thas reductionist science will cure. And if it does - and one day you're hit by an asteroid on your way to mars. What a tradgedy. I think the foundations of how we think of building societies and civilizations, that death (of people, ideas, orgs) is not always trajic, that it can be beautiful. To design things to be shared and inherited. lots can/will/and must change. Yet I don't find inspiraiton with the nerds complexity theories of mental complexity and levels of civilizations that moves from authoritarian to some sort of egalitarian everyone's ideas is the same blandification consensus bike shedding problem. We need leadership, we need diversity, we need to see each other not as problems with all our gaps to fill to become better and assessing our strengths and weaknesses and skills and competencies and etc - we can, yes, grow. And we can recognize our positions. To not believe that life is random, that your inclinations and the facilitation you might have in learning languages doesn't //mean// something for ultimate purpose. The long arc of history doesn't necessarily bend towards justice, it sort of wobbles - the important thing is who you become in that process. in the quran it says \"We created man in kabad(difficulty)\" some say it's perhaps we created man and they will live a life of difficulty - i see it differently - you can tell me if other tafseers say anything like this or not. and that we are CREATED - a process happens - when we live difficulity - life has that. That's just real. We dont' want necessailry to make plastic playgrounds where no one can get hurt. Part of the fun was the risk. If the risk isn't real. It's not really fun. Sad and true. at least to me. I want to see how the not coping mechanisms and connection to source in the bio above is something you can connect to father greg boyle. The idea of friendship and action. is it in CAPs constituative attentional policies, when you're with a friend you can't help and attend to xyz scenario where you can \"list a long list of values that emerges from true friendship here - bake them a cake, console them when they're sad, etc\" - it's not that the values happen whenever, it has some prerequsities including creating space for and opening an environment where friendship can enact.... maybe there's something about souls meeting, seeing... signs of God on the horizons is the CAPs we have in nature... we also have signs within ourselves and we are mirrors to each other so perhaps some caps and values happen only then - how do you make a real friend though, what about famiyl (not chosen) that the muslim traiditon puts so much priority on, what about a life that isn't all fun and games and is about responsibiltiy too, how is that meaningful and beautiful and true and good because it needs to be all the same to me. it must help us come alive which is what i'm working on. Can you help me find the logic and ideas and experiences and what i learend and what i'm learning and reweave what you're workig on with these threads and show me what i'm not seeing"

Describe the development of a values-oriented learning by doing program pedagogy for a social\nentrepreneurship education project funded by the Asfari Foundation.\n2. Explore some of the consequences of the above pedagogies and make inferences for pedagogical\nadaptations which are beneficial for educators operating in a time of tumult.\nThe goals of the development of these pedagogies are to support action-oriented learning journeys for\npeople working to positively impact the world. As more education is aligned towards the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals and as the world becomes more unstable. We must develop antifragile learning\npathways that can support growth in the face of uncertainty and positive impact even when confronted\nwith challenges.\nThe experiences and data I have collected throughout this project paint a picture that may help others\nworking on education for positive impact in an era of decline.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n4\nIntroduction\nThe mission of the Interdisciplinary Research Center (CRI) is summarized in the following statement:\nWe have to learn how to take care of oneself, others and the planet\n- François Taddei - Chairman and co-founder of CRI\nI joined the CRI to deepen my knowledge about making that statement a reality within the context of the\nworld of social entrepreneurs in conflict and other underprivileged environments. Bloom is my project\nwhich works on connecting personal and professional growth through our educational experiences for\nentrepreneurs. Last year we ran the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation (ACSI) project for a cohort\nof 15 teams running businesses to provide innovative educational experiences for people in Lebanon.\nMy initial goal for my research was to explore the relationships of values and how bringing them to life\nthrough Character Strengths, as defined by the school of Positive Psychology, can increase the positive\nimpact the social entrepreneurs have through their enterprises while simultaneously improving their\nquality of life.\nYet, during this last year, like many others, my research was impacted by Coronavirus. On top of this,\nthe cohort of teams within ACSI experienced an economic collapse, a stifled political revolution, and an\nexplosion which was assessed by the United States Geological Survey as a seismic event of magnitude\n3.3, and makes history as one of the strongest non-nuclear explosions. Some of our teams experienced\nbodily harm, 3 of our teams have already left Lebanon and 1 is making plans to leave.\nSince my project was designed to capture data on Values and Character Strengths for teams within my\nprogram I found myself in a terrible, yet serendipitous, position for having pre and post-assessment data\nusing a widely used and validated psychometric assessment, the Values in Action Character Strengths\nProfile.\nThis led to exploring a new trajectory, my project is now evolving to identify the pedagogies of\neducation for a time of tumult that supports people to engage in action, through the unpredictability and\nuncertainty, and create the conditions which promote care for oneself and others and the world.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n5\nProject Development and Values-Based Pedagogy Development\nBefore the Beirut blast in August I the program was operating, and I was the lead facilitator. We applied\nfor funding from the Asfari Foundation and received the green light to run the ACSI program to support\nLebanese educational projects. Our team was running with a small operating budget, and we were only\nthree people at this stage, so the work to develop the curriculum was up to me. One of our orientations\nfor our project is to support the people who are usually unsupported. People in places out of city centers,\nwomen who typically can't leave their homes due to obligations, and people who don't consider\nthemselves as \"entrepreneurial material\". These factors are taken into consideration when designing our\ncourse architecture.\nProgram Design Experimentation\nDesigning our programs initially didn’t take into consideration how they would fare in the context of\ncoronavirus, explosions, and other extreme stressors. Yet, as we’ll detail later in this paper, we’ve found\nthat our initial values-oriented design method was supportive for that context. We design our program to\ncreate a context for people to express their support for each other, to find support, to mutually grow\ntowards creating impact through their social enterprise. These principles are encoded into the\nprogrammatic design which we run the program entirely online. It rolls out in three main phases:\n1. 2. 3. Open House: To reach out to people based on their curiosity and invite them to apply\nSprint: To assess the contribution and fit for a participatory online program while giving value.\nAccelerator: To connect with longer-term mentors, conduct training, build community.\nFigure 1. Program Design Flow Diagram\nThese cycles take the best from agile and design thinking methodologies that are being used at leading\ninnovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator programs to help teams\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n6\ndevelop their startup while learning productivity techniques, building tighter-knit communities, and\ndeveloping meta-learning practices.\nOur goals in curriculum design are to be:\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\nHighly participatory\nVirtual or hybrid online + offline, and focus on building community\nConnecting with high-quality mentors anywhere\nHighly customized for individual learning needs (relevant)\nFun!\nKey concepts and rubrics for mentors and trainers:\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\nPraxis - learning by doing.\nMaximize your strengths, don’t improve on your weaknesses.\nGrowth Mindset - 1% better every day means 200% better in 70 days.\nDo one thing. Pick a target. Make it tractable. Get to it. Review it.\nCommunity growth with coaching and cohorts.\nReflecting, I believe that some of the core concepts and methodology we are developing have\ncontributed to a new model for learning in a time of uncertainty. Previously that may have been\npreviously seen as secondary. Learning is for one to “advance” academically to compete with other\nclassmates. The architecture of the learning experience informs student behavior. The curve promotes\ncompetitiveness and cutthroat behaviors while a leaderboard that emphasizes acts of generosity is better\nfor the individual and the group.\nBefore Coronavirus and The Blast, Informed during the years I have worked as an activist in the Middle\nEast, my initial pedagogical framing was strongly informed by my values. During my project, I\ndeveloped a 3 part selection process to help the teams develop a new intuition for what success looks\nlike in our program. We will discuss in the later section the interesting impact these pedagogical\ndecisions may have had on outcomes in the face of this years challenges.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n7\nSelection Criteria Experimentation\nPrinciples for selection:\nEffort Focus. The teams must have a large say in their advancement to the next stage based on the\namount of effort they put in during the sprint.\nCommunity Success. Individual successes are seen through the lens of the whole community\nsucceeding.\nResults Matter. The organizers will use their expert judgment to assess the potential impact.\nTo ensure agency stays with the teams, the principles were measured with the following assessments and\ndisplayed in real-time on a public dashboard. Some of the most challenging parts of my project were to\ndevelop the software hooks between the forum software and the results dashboard.\nMeasurement Approach:\nEffort Focus: We will measure this with their daily check-ins and checkouts on the PW leaderboard.\nThe number will be a ratio from 0-100% derived from the following formula: (days checked in on the\nforum software + days checked out / total number of possible check-ins and checkouts)\nCommunity Success. To assess community contribution and cohesion numerically we can add the\nnumber of posts read and created, the number of interactions on the platform, and total reading time as\nwell as a 0-5 star rating from the Bloom team assessing their interactivity on daily zoom calls. The total\nnumber will be normalized by identifying the highest engagement and qualifying that as 100%.\nResults Matter. To assess how likely the team will create an impact in the domain we are operating in\nwe invite the Asfari Foundation, the Bloom team, and potentially a few domain experts to assess their\ntheory of change and efficiency of spend based on a 0-5 star rating responding to the questions: how\nlikely is this team to reach their goals in making a positive impact in education and lifelong learning and\nhow efficient is their use of funds towards making a positive impact in education and lifelong learning?\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n8\nFigure 2. The real-time updated dashboard shared with all participants in the program.\nImportantly, funding was connected to these benchmarks. A concern that didn’t come true is that people\nwould feel competitive and have tension in the check-in calls. On the contrary, you can see some of the\nfeedback from the teams from these calls below:\n“The invisible ties that bind this community are what makes this program special.”\n“You managed to create this great support group. It’s an environment where we’re always helping each\nother out and making new connections.”\n“As an introvert, I never thought I would enjoy doing so many team calls, but these teams, they are so\nenergetic and they give me so much hope and it’s just a blast talking to them”\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n9\n-ACSI Team Members\nLater in this report, we will consider the potential impacts these pedagogical decisions had on\nparticipants in our program in contrast with people who didn’t go through the entire program.\nQuestions on the selection process\nThe transparency of the system made communications very simple with the team, we suggested that they\ncould in essence “choose themselves” to earn the prize money and at the same time I have some\nconcerns with the approach we took. First of all, how can we prevent people from gaming the system?\nThe idea of connecting the measure of effort was to monitor their daily checking in and checking out.\nAre they asking themselves good questions, are they seeking answers, are they giving and receiving help\nduring the check-ins, we can’t be sure. All we know is that they wrote something on that day and the\nautomated system updated their leaderboard. This leads to potential gaming of the system. Some\nsolutions could be to have the teams rate the depth/authenticity of the check-ins, or to have a program\nmanager score the check-ins. To maintain the simplicity of automation and to prevent teams from raising\nconcern for personal preference on behalf of the Program Manager or other teams there can be simple\nautomation running on the check-ins to assess for repeating patterns vs novel content, as well as length *\ncomplexity analysis, which can be seen as a starting point proxy for the depth of reflection.\nOther issues I’m identifying come from the selection process in the third tier, the “results matter”\nsection. Currently, this section is done with the Program Funder and experts reviewing team\npresentations. This is how many programs operate, selection in a black box where the funder or other\nleading agency selects winners with experts to “analyze” the teams. This is still a problem within our\nstructure as favoritism can come forward along with bias. One of the core things Bloom attempts to\npreserve is a sense of agency. The more we can put a selection in the hands of the people in the program\nthe better in my opinion. In the future, I’d like to find funders who can work with us on identifying new\nmethods for determining aligned results “increase in # of people positively impacted with the alternative\neducation program”. This is harder to make a generic part of the system and is an area to explore in\nfuture programs.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n10\nMentorship\nMentorship is a fundamental pillar of our programming with our teams. This is one area that I am still\nworking to develop. My challenge is to run my project and participate in my academic studies at the\nsame time. While time constraints are one thing, I find that I am inclined to do things before deeply\nunderstanding them and conducting prior research, potentially due to a self reinforcing belief that I am\nincapable of academic rigor. I have an area for growth as well in social competencies where I feel\ninadequate for taking time from people I consider mentors. This said I have worked to learn from and\nadapt the work from Daniel Goleman, Theo Dawson, Dr. James Pennebaker, Robert Kegan, Martin\nSeligman, Christopher Peterson, Eric Ries, Abdullah Rothman, The Buddha, The Prophet Mohammed,\nand many others.\nOne of the models we use is from developmental psychology around the theory of mental complexity,\nthis work comes from Theo Dawson who’s developed a scale to algorithmically determine mental\ncomplexity from text blocks. I’m grateful for her contribution to our cyclical learning models which she\ncalls a “VCol” - rhymes with recall. Her VCol framework combined with the “Startup Sprint” process\nfrom Eric Ries forms the backbone of our learning by doing methodology.\nMentorship is still an area of growth for me and in the coming months I intend to deepen my\nrelationship with my mentors and to attempt to bring my “textbook” mentors into my life by reaching\nout and requesting calls.\nFigure 3. VCoL Set>Seek>Apply>Reflect framework shared from Theo Dawson work on VcoLs.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n11\nData glut is a real concern these days. With google and the internet ideas are widely available,\nknowledge is out there, yet how can we help contextualize it within time, projects and relationships so\nthat learners have highly relevant learning experiences that help them reach their goals. This ties in with\nthe next part I developed this year during my project, the learning framework:\nLearning Framework Development\nFigure 4. The Four Pillars of Bloom’s training methodology.\nIn 2021we are going to be taking our methodology and training others to operate it, this is requiring us\nto take some of our programmatic methodology and make it more concrete and actionable. The diagram\nabove shows the four fundamental pillars all of our educational programming nests into.\n1. Wellbeing / Motivation.\n2. Universal Skills (not described in this document, can be considered “Soft Skills”)\n3. Specialized Skills(not described in this document, can be considered “Hard Skills”)\n4. Business / Social Impact Skills (not described in this document)\nThis framework emerged after a study of the many learning frameworks being developed. Many\norganizations from UNESCO to OECD to groups of educators forming clubs are concerned that what is\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n12\nbeing provided in school isn’t preparing people for the rapidly changing world. There appears to be a\nconsensus forming that the industrial education system is failing our students and our industrial\neconomy is failing our planet. Partnership for 21st Century Skills, the Life Skills and Citizenship\nEducation Conceptual and Programmatic Framework LSCE, the OECD 2030 Learning Compass and\nother similar frameworks have all emerged in the last 10-15 years. I worked to identify themes and\npatterns and to map them to an insight we have through many years of work with teams and with\ninvestors. Investors invest in people, not projects. It’s fundamentally what is internal, the values, the\nmotivations, and the characters of an individual that have a stronger relationship with success metrics. I\nbelieve in an era of dynamism this is even more important, knowledge isn’t as important as the ability to\nfind knowledge and constructive use of that knowledge in support of the self, people and the planet is\nnecessary in a world where automation is replacing jobs, social systems are being disrupted, and climate\nchange threatens our existence. We must start with why and an honest system’s level look at the world\nwe are inhabiting.\nOECD Learning Compass 21st Century Skills - P21 LSCE\nFigure 5. Alternative learning frameworks\nThis is why our first pillar is motivation and wellbeing. Internally we call it the metacognitive pillar\nalthough this name can be confusing for other trainers considering using our methodology. This is where\nself-reflexivity is nurtured, the ability to see oneself clearly, to know one’s values, to see one within\nsystems, to know that one must take care of one’s health to productively engage as an agent within these\nsystems. This is why we call it “Motivations and Values” when we community publicly.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n13\nDuring my project period I have begun to deepen my understanding of the school of Positive\nPsychology and have begun to derive a connection between the PERMA framework and motivations.\nPERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Achievement) is an acronym that the\nschool of Positive Psychology uses as the measures for flourishing or the “Good Life”. A social\nentrepreneur (our main participant) does things for a reason, what is that reason? Why are you reading\nthis report? Why am I doing what I’m doing? In the end, you will realize that there is a single point\nwhere you can no longer ask “why?” anymore. Various philosophers discuss their own definition of this\npoint, this monism:\n1. “The world is the will to power and nothing besides!” – Nietzsche\n2. “The problem of anxiety is the nodal point of many important issues. By solving this issue you\ncan reveal the whole mental life of a human” – Freud\n3. “Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence” –\nAristotle.\nMartin Seligman, from the school of Positive Psychology, proposes that life and purpose can not be\nboiled down to a “single answer” – that people’s last “why” might land in one of five categories\ndescribed in the PERMA framework:\nFigure 7. PERMA Framework\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n14\nThe connection between a social entrepreneur’s personal values and the PERMA framework is an area\nof current exploration for me which we will touch upon in further detail in the next section of this report.\nI would like to explore the relationship between PERMA, the embodied sense of emotions and our\nvalues and how they relate to the first pillar of the framework I developed in the Project, the motivation,\nand wellbeing (AKA the metacognitive) pillar.\nCharacter Strengths Within Our Program\nCharacter Strengths are assessed before people begin our program using an online questionnaire. We are\nusing the validated psychometric profile from the School of Positive Psychology. These strengths are the\npositive parts of your personality that make you feel authentic and engaged, they are thought to be\nvalues brought to life. The research behind the strengths comes from a cross-cultural analysis done by\nChristopher Peterson from the University of Michigan as a part of the early developments of the Positive\nPsychology Project. Positive Psychology attempts to identify the aspects that make life worth living, in\ncontrast with traditional psychology which was more concerned with diagnosing and treating\npsychological ailments.\nWe all possess all 24 character strengths in different degrees, giving you a unique character strengths\nprofile. In (Peterson 2008) Christopher Peterson demonstrated the development of particular Character\nStrengths for individuals who have gone through a traumatic experience at some time in their lives.\nPeterson identified this growth an arbitrarily long time after the traumatic event without conducting an\nintervention\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n15\nFigure 7. 24 Character Strengths from the School of Postive Psychology\nProject Reflection and Impacts of Values Based Pedagogical Choices\nGiven a year of upheaval for our participants I began to wonder, what are the impacts of our pedagogical\nchoices? During the course of my literature review, I realized that I have some fascinating data on my\nhands. I would be able to assess the impact our values-oriented pedagogical decisions have had on the\nteams that participated in the full accelerator program of 6 months in contrast with teams who only\njoined our program for a two-week sprint in the early phases of pre-selection.\nMy project connects with my academic research where I am currently still interviewing participants that\nwent through the full 6 months (originally planned as 4 months) Accelerator Program (May-October\n2020) and those who only went through the 2 weeks Sprint Program (in April 2020) to deepen the\nunderstanding of how people respond to and grow through challenging situations and how those\nresponses differ within a program and outside a program. I’m doing this to identify better the factors\nwhich lead to Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG is defined below) to then include these factors more\ndeeply into our programming. Keep an eye out for my paper when my interviews are done and my\ntheoretical model is complete.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n16\nFor now, with our pedagogy as it is it seems, that there was a buffering effect for participants within the\nACSI program on the measure of Character Strengths overall and a more substantial buffering effect on\nfactors relating to Wellbeing and Life Satisfaction.\nPost-Traumatic Stress vs Post-Traumatic Growth\nTrauma and the accompanying stressors that persist do impact many people who go through an acute\ntraumatic event, like the blast that went off in Beirut last year, or sustained challenges such as those\nemerging from the pandemic, economic collapse, and others. Individuals may have trouble\nconcentrating, flashbacks, sensitivity to similar situations, and other negative experiences that develop\nafter a traumatic event are called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). The research shows that after a\ntraumatic event, there are three main responses:\n●\n●\n●\nA small percentage of people who experience it develop PTSD,\nThe majority of people show resilience and return to the pre-event state,\nAnother minority demonstrates something called Post Traumatic Growth.\nFigure 8. Resilience demonstration (Jeon 2015)\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n17\nIn Post-Traumatic Growth, following a period after a traumatic event that is spent grappling with the\nchallenges - there is a period of growth whereby people develop new strengths, see new possibilities,\ndevelop spiritually, develop closer relationships, and a deeper appreciation for life.\nThese days, more programs are becoming trauma-informed and are adapting accordingly, but there is\nlittle inclusion of this in entrepreneurship programs, and little research focusing on how\nentrepreneurship programs can better support communities during and after traumatic events, and better\nsupport post-traumatic growth. In an age of disruption and “new normals” understanding what supports\nPTG is critical.\nEvidence from the ACSI Program\nTo explore this further in the context of our programs, we have recently analyzed the Character\nStrengths profiles of people who went through our ACSI Sprint+Accelerator program, versus those who\njust went through the ACSI Sprint Program. For this cohort of participants, we have basic quantitative\ndata that was collected at the beginning of the Sprint period (in April 2020). A subset of teams was then\nselected for the longer 4-month Accelerator program, which was extended to six months due to the\nchallenges in Lebanon and beyond. It’s important to note that these are small-scale studies with 13\nparticipants within our accelerator program and 17 participants within the Sprint only program.\nThe same quantitative assessment was conducted in December 2020-January 2021, with the initial\nresults shared here. Follow-on qualitative interviews will be conducted in the following two months.\nFrom an aggregated view, the ACSI program seemed to prevent a drop in overall character strengths. We\ncollected samples of the ACSI Sprinters character Strengths profile at the beginning of the program\nduring the sprint period. We re-assessed again for both people who participated only in the sprint and\nparticipants who completed the ACSI Accelerator program. By comparing the pre/post changes across\nall 24 Character Strengths, we see that the ACSI teams had a small .2 point increase in their aggregated\nscores compared to the teams not a part of the Accelerator program who experienced a .6 point drop.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n18\nFigure 9.

Exploration of leverageable traits for future programming\nThe table above indicates the traits the Research team is putting forward to explore deeper integration\ninto programming. Gratitude is interesting due to the fact that it has a high correlation with wellbeing\nand life satisfaction while it was one of the traits that the program has room to improve on. Hope and\nPersistence have been demonstrated to be malleable Character Strengths (Gander 2019) and also have\nhigh correlations with Entrepreneurial Success (Worell 2011) as well as Life Satisfaction (Park, N.,\nPeterson, C., & Seligman 2004) and Wellbeing (Gander 2019). We hypothesize the combination of the\nmalleability of the trait along with correlations with factors that can support entrepreneurs make these\ntraits good candidates for strengthening over the course of a program.\nPractical Program Applications of our Hypotheses\nA key objective of our programmatic approach in Bloom is to combine these critical aspects of character\nand universal skills development into our entrepreneurial support programs since the success of social\nimpact and traditional enterprises are intimately connected to the capacities of the team, especially\nfounding and early team, of an enterprise. The more effective programs can be on both enterprise and\npersonal development factors, the more impactful the programs can be both in the short-term and\nlong-term. This is even more critical in emerging ecosystems and marginalized/vulnerable communities\nwhere character and skill development opportunities are less available, and where exposure to acute and\nsustained traumatic experiences is more common.\nFurther Exploration\nFurther exploration will be how to deepen the factors supporting these traits and engender post-traumatic\ngrowth for an age of instability and chaos. Some of the factors that are correlated with increased\npotential for Post Traumatic Growth are Social Support as well as Deliberate Rumination (Morris, B. A.,\n& Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011).\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n22\n(Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011).\nThe programmatic implications of the factor analysis above along with the assessment of strengths open\nlines of inquiry about the potential benefit of making conscious the discussion of strengths. Deliberate\nRumination is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has around a traumatic event, for\ninstance, “what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with Intrusive Rumination and\nBrooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to me”.\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first established can\npotentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths that support individuals' sense of life\nsatisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to set a state of mind conducive to positive Deliberate\nRumination. A traumatic event is destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models,\nself-image and worldviews, the possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and\npositive growth for the individual given the right context, environment, and support (Roepke, A. M., &\nSeligman, M. E. P. 2014). Over the course of one’s life, the majority (> 60% across many countries) of\npeople will experience an event which they report as traumatic (Scott, K. M., Koenen 2013).\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n23\nThe chart above shows that traumatic events offer a transformational potential for individuals. Bloom\nbelieves that Social Entrepreneurship programs can provide the scaffolding that can support the\ndevelopment of PTG, personal growth, and positive societal impact. By engaging individuals with New\nPossibilities (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman) through their enterprises, offering positive social\nsupport, facilitating moments of collective positive rumination, as well as making visible and\nencouraging growth of the Character Strengths which promote life satisfaction and wellbeing.\nAlthough our program serendipitously has in its design some of these factors based on a values-based\napproach to pedagogy, I am in the process of developing a model based on the ongoing interviews to\nrefine our pedagogical suggestions for programs hypothesized to support individuals going through\ntrauma and create framing which helps guide them towards becoming personal transformational\nexperiences that lead to societal transformational experiences.\nWork is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 ©2021 Bilal Ghalib\n24\n(Roepke, A. M., & Seligman 2014)\nConcluding Remarks\nI left Lebanon to attend CRI. When I left Lebanon I had no idea how much it would change in a few\nshort years. Over the course of my project and graduate research, I’ve been conducting applied research\nwhile operating a program to support social entrepreneurs working to make Lebanon a better place. I\nnever imagined that I would be exploring the idea of trauma and transformation, the impotence of\nnarrative and community, the exploration of values in action - especially not all in the face of the chaos\nand uncertainty of an economic crisis, explosion, political unrest, and a global pandemic. I believe in\ntransforming systems and starting with the place we all have the highest leverage at. Our own personal\nagency as agents within a system. The projects and research I’m blessed to conduct are first tested\nwithin my own life before being taken into our programs. I intend to continue to conduct applied\nresearch to help the promise we started with, to help people learn to take care of themselves, others, and\nthe planet.

Presilience draws on two sources: post-traumatic growth (PTG) research and Islamic attentional practices rooted in Qur’anic reflection and gratitude. Together, these inform teacher-friendly methods that make classrooms more humane, spiritually nourishing, and resilient in times of crisis.\nThe work builds on two streams:\n1. **Research with Social Entrepreneurs in Lebanon.** My master’s thesis (Université de Paris) studied PTG after the Beirut Port Blast, exploring how narrative, meaning-making, and peer support correlated with flourishing despite profound disruption. The findings highlight reflective storywork and communal practices as vital resources.\n2. **Partnership with School Without Borders in Gaza.** Since 2023, I have been supporting educators running pop-up schools for displaced children. Together we co-designed simple protocols that weave Qur’anic reflection (tafakkur, shukr) with PTG-informed classroom practices. Teacher “presilience cards” translate insights into daily routines: beginning class with gratitude, closing with reflective storytelling, and fostering belonging and cooperative learning alongside academics. Teachers report that these practices help students feel more connected and hopeful, even amid ongoing conflict.\nWhat emerges is not therapy but pedagogy: classrooms as spaces where faith, reflection, and community practices strengthen the human capacity to face difficulty. Qur’anic attentional practices open what Muslim psychology calls the eye of the heart (qalb), while PTG frameworks provide evidence-based scaffolding for reflection and growth.\nThe talk will share early field lessons, practical teacher tools, and reflections on integrating Islamic spirituality into education without medicalizing or pathologizing children’s experiences. By bringing together research, lived experience, and field practice, this contribution offers a vision of spiritually integrated, teacher-led practices that can be adapted across Muslim-majority contexts and beyond.School Without Borders -\n\nPost Traumatic Growth and Resilience in\n\nEducational EnvironmentsCheck-in\n\nReflect on something you’re grateful for from\n\ntoday’s session so far.

Presilience draws on two sources: post-traumatic growth (PTG) research and Islamic attentional practices rooted in Qur’anic reflection and gratitude. Together, these inform teacher-friendly methods that make classrooms more humane, spiritually nourishing, and resilient in times of crisis.\nThe work builds on two streams:\n1. **Research with Social Entrepreneurs in Lebanon.** My master’s thesis (Université de Paris) studied PTG after the Beirut Port Blast, exploring how narrative, meaning-making, and peer support correlated with flourishing despite profound disruption. The findings highlight reflective storywork and communal practices as vital resources.\n2. **Partnership with School Without Borders in Gaza.** Since 2023, I have been supporting educators running pop-up schools for displaced children. Together we co-designed simple protocols that weave Qur’anic reflection (tafakkur, shukr) with PTG-informed classroom practices. Teacher “presilience cards” translate insights into daily routines: beginning class with gratitude, closing with reflective storytelling, and fostering belonging and cooperative learning alongside academics. Teachers report that these practices help students feel more connected and hopeful, even amid ongoing conflict.\nWhat emerges is not therapy but pedagogy: classrooms as spaces where faith, reflection, and community practices strengthen the human capacity to face difficulty. Qur’anic attentional practices open what Muslim psychology calls the eye of the heart (qalb), while PTG frameworks provide evidence-based scaffolding for reflection and growth.\nThe talk will share early field lessons, practical teacher tools, and reflections on integrating Islamic spirituality into education without medicalizing or pathologizing children’s experiences. By bringing together research, lived experience, and field practice, this contribution offers a vision of spiritually integrated, teacher-led practices that can be adapted across Muslim-majority contexts and beyond.School Without Borders -\nPost Traumatic Growth and Resilience in\nEducational EnvironmentsCheck-in\nReflect on something you’re grateful for from\ntoday’s session so far.

Qur’anic attentional practices open what Muslim psychology calls the eye of the heart (qalb), while PTG frameworks provide evidence-based scaffolding for reflection and growth.\nThe talk will share early field lessons, practical teacher tools, and reflections on integrating Islamic spirituality into education without medicalizing or pathologizing children’s experiences. By bringing together research, lived experience, and field practice, this contribution offers a vision of spiritually integrated, teacher-led practices that can be adapted across Muslim-majority contexts and beyond.School Without Borders -\n\nPost Traumatic Growth and Resilience in\n\nEducational EnvironmentsCheck-in\n\nReflect on something you’re grateful for from\n\ntoday’s session so far.

In Lebanon, the addition of an economic collapse and a major explosion in the capital city brought acute stressors, triggering migration ideation. In this study, we identify factors that support social entrepreneur’s access to post traumatic growth (PTG) by analyzing resilience and character strengths within an entrepreneurship training program in Beirut. \nMethods:  Over the course of Dec 2020 and April 2021 we gathered 21 hours and a half interviews with Lebanese social entrepreneurs going through an entrepreneurship training program, all of whom were living in Lebanon and experienced the August 2020 Beirut port explosion. Alongside these interviews we gathered a set of qualitative data including pre-post assessments of Character Strengths (VIA), Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTG-I), Intrusive and Deliberate Rumination (EERI), Entrepreneurial Intent (EI), Resilience (BRCS) and the Impact of Event - Revised (IES-R). Correlations were identified with factors that support PTG and social entrepreneurial ideation. \nResults: Character Strengths are correlated with PTG and there are validated methods for reliably developing strengths of character. One highly leverable strength is humor, and one way humor can support growth is by preventing helplessness. \nConclusions: While each person’s life journey is unique, we have identified that social entrepreneurship ideation is promoted by prior traumatic experiences if followed by opportunities and support for growth. Traumatic experiences are inescapable in life, and the opportunity educators and trainers have is to understand how to shift the trauma response curve towards growth. Deliberate Rumination, thinking and reflecting about one’s life circumstances can happen spontaneously and importantly they can be nurtured by incorporating them into group facilitations for training programs and schools. \nImplications:  The results of this study increases an understanding of the complex decision making individuals face in a crisis, and offers insights into the factors which support posttraumatic growth and social entrepreneurship. We hope the results of this paper inspire facilitators to incorporate humor, positive structured conversation and to enliven their program with character development. \nKeywords: Post Traumatic Growth, Social Entrepreneurship, Trauma, Lebanon, Training and Education, Character Strengths\nIntroduction: \nTrauma conscious pedagogies (Mays 2021) are becoming a widespread topic amongst educators in a post-covid-19 world, and in this paper we explore some factors and methodologies that can support growth during times of collective crisis. In 2020 the Lebanese people experienced the coronavirus pandemic, economic crisis as well as an explosion at the Beirut Port which killed over 200 people and left over 300,000 homeless in its wake. Working as an educator with social entrepreneurs in Lebanon we observed a growing frustration with the idea of resilience, with participants seeing it as a passive way oppressors remain in power while the population deals with the consequences of their mistakes. Rather than bounce back, we  began to explore the factors which promote Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) looking beyond resilience and recovery. We ask how can educators going through times of crisis promote anti-fragility, the ability to use difficulties as opportunities for growth?\n\nPeople respond differently to traumatic events and people’s Character Strengths can provide a framework to understand those responses as well as which traits may support individuals through times of crisis. Character Strengths are 24 relatively stable positive qualities in humans identified through a cross cultural analysis of what makes life worth living. Certain character strengths like kindness, social intelligence and hope have been demonstrated to protect against the negative effects of stress and trauma (Harzer 2015). It was also demonstrated that an overall growth in the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory is correlated with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Peterson et al. 2008). Importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their strengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018). Assessing the behaviors that promote PTG and life satisfaction, we find deliberate rumination as an important vector. (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve, C. L. 2011) \n\nThe purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the factors that promote Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) to support educators working in environments undergoing crisis. Social enterprise support efforts are often funded and established in areas of need and therefore often the participants of these programs are likely to experience difficulties. add our evidence reinforcing the idea that nurturing character strengths as a whole, and hope, judgment, teamwork and humor in particular may increase the likelihood of growth after traumatic events. Previous studies demonstrate that Deliberate Rumination is a contributing factor for PTG and we have been able to identify judgment and teamwork as correlated Character Strengths. Lastly we recommend programs operating in areas and times of crisis to explore interventions to nurture the buffering Character Strengths of hope and humor while cultivating a group dynamic that can promote judgment and teamwork. \n\n\nTHE REST IS NEEDING TO BE CLEANED UP:\nMethodology\nWe’ve used a qualitative analysis method for the exploration of our research, in an attempt to identify potentially unforeseen variables. The author of this paper has been able to utilize their position as the head of Research And Development at Bloom, an organization which operates social enterprise education programs. Prior to the Beirut Port Explosion in August 2020, the participants and applicants for the Bloom social entrepreneurship accelerator program had taken the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory (VIA-IS). At the conclusion of the four months long accelerator, and following the Beirut Explosion, all applicants to the program requested to complete a post-test VIA-IS inventory, those in the program and those not selected.\n\nAn analysis of the pre/post test data for the VIA-IS demonstrated a buffering effect experienced by individuals who were a part of the Bloom program, which led to in-program individuals maintaining their overall VIA average while individuals outside the program experienced a significant drop. To understand this phenomenon was the genesis of this research, and inspired the qualitative/quantitative research methodology described below.\n\nQualitative Analysis: \nThe qualitative analysis consisted of twenty one 1.5 hour long interviews, which were all conducted remotely and recorded digitally. The interviewees were split with 10 people coming from outside the training program and 11 people who had gone through the training program (marked as “In prog.”). The questions for the interview were segmented into the following themes:\nTopic\nKey Insight Explored\nIntroduction and Background\nWork habits and family entrepreneurial background\nEthnographic Questions\nWhat is their educational/ family's income level?\nEntrepreneurial Intent (EI)\nWhat is their level of commitment to entrepreneurship?\nImpact of Event Scale (IES-R)\nWhat was the level of impact of the Beirut Explosion?\nResilience (BRCS)\nWhat is their level of resilience?\nPost Traumatic Growth Index \n(PTGI)\nHow much did people grow after the Beirut Explosion?\nRumination Scales \nWhat is the ratio of deliberate and intrusive rumination?\nConcluding Statements\nWhat does entrepreneurship mean in places facing instability?\n\n\nThe interview consisted of open ended questions as well as questions requesting a qualitative response. Both questions were answered live on the call, allowing the interviewee to offer deeper context into the numerical responses. The audio for the interviews were transcribed manually, and an inductive process was followed to derive codes. The interview corpus was then brought into a software supporting bi-directional links through which code clusters were identified.\n\nQuantitative Data: \nDuring the semi-structured interview process, alongside the open-ended questions, the interviewer also gathered quantitative answers for the following measures:\nPost Traumatic Growth Index (PTGI Tedeschi & Calhoun 1996)\nThe Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS Sinclair and Wallson 2004)\nThe Impact of Event Scale: Revised (IES-R DS Weiss 2007)\nThe Intrusive - Event Related Rumination Inventory (EERI Cann et al., 2011)\nEntrepreneurial Intention (EI) scale derived from Luthje & Frank (2003); Duijn (2009) / Krueger et al. (2000)\nThe VIA Inventory referenced above. Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2004)\n\nA subset of the codes derived from the interview corpus were identified as meaningful segmentation markers, and each interview was then tagged in the database for analysis with the observed value.\n\nSegmentation Tags:\nProperty\nFields\nDescription\nHas_Therepist\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the individual attend therapy?\nInjury_From_Blast\nTrue/False/Unsure\nWas the interviewee injured in the Beirut Port Explosion?\nEntrepreneurial_Family\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the interviewee come from an entrepreneurial family?\nPlacebuilding_Ideation \nTrue/False/Unsure\nIs the interviewee committed to using their working life to contribute to society?\nMigration_Ideation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nIs the interviewee considering migrating out of Lebanon?\nRevolutionary_Ideation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the interviewee politically active, engage in protests, view their work as activism?\nIncome_Simplified\nLower/Middle/Upper\nHow does the participant view their families income bracket?\nMeditation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the participant have an active meditation practice?\n\nResults\nOverview of Data and Background Knowledge\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially described by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory has since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This model now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses to neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an individual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of responses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues that the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018). \nBefore we get into the analysis of the data, please review the prior description of the data and data gathering phase. If you would like to explore the data yourself, you can find a public dataset available to review here: http://bit.ly/cs-data-21 \n\nThe Character Strengths data was gathered as part of the application process for a social entrepreneurship program before the August 4th, 2020 explosion. After the explosion, to understand deeper changes in entrepreneurial ideation we conducted a second VIA-IS as well as a new questionnaire using the new measures described above. To start the exploration as to the factors which support social entrepreneurs we keep in mind the question: who grows as a social entrepreneur in times of adversity and who reprioritizes the notion of their career trajectory to focus more on self preservation. In 2008 Christopher Peterson (Peterson et al. 2008) demonstrated a positive correlation between the VIA-IS Character Strengths Inventory and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The PTGI measures growth on the dimensions of Appreciation, New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Spiritual Enhancement and Personal Strength; interestingly, all of these dimensions are relevant for social entrepreneurial ideation. Comparing PTGI with the Character Strengths assessment we identify that Humor, Teamwork, Spirituality, Prudence and Judgement have a significant correlation for PTGI across the five sub-dimensions, see figures below.\n\nData validity questions. \nWe initially hypothesized that there would be a correlation between CS prepost (Character Strengths Difference in average scores assessed before/after the blast) and Post Traumatic Growth. While there seems to be a slight correlation between CS prepost and PTGI - Appreciation (.33 p-val .14) we cannot at this time with our limited data make any strong statements about Character Strength changes before/after an explosion and PTGI. One factor could be that the time frame for the post test was taken over a 3 month period (December - March 2020) and it might be interesting to study a progression of changes rather than comparing pre and post. Growth takes time and measuring over an extended period confuses the data. Also, assessing people earlier, and therefore closer to the period of the traumatic event may not have left time to metabolize the experience while people who filled in the assessment later have had more opportunities. Another bias that may be influencing the data is potentially the types of people who submit forms early compared to those who wait may also capture proactive people early in the recovery process and procrastinators later in their process. Rather than adding another factor to control for procrastination, I propose future assessments to include deadlines for inclusion into the dataset, or to include time of receipt as an influencing factor. \n \nAnd now, we begin to explore motivation and wellbeing for entrepreneurs following the Fight, Flight and Freeze framework. \nFight\nAfter the Beirut Explosion, many of the interviewees were feeling anger. Although anger may be seen as a negative state, we found that many of the participants used their anger towards a factor we called Revolutionary Ideation, clicking this link will take you to see sections of the interview tagged with this concept. \n\n“Angry at the government, of course. Angry that the city I love was destroyed. The nice things about our city were destroyed in a second because of the irresponsibility of the people governing. Of course I went to the protest that happened immediately after” - Interview 006\n\nSome people went to the streets to protest, while others viewed their entrepreneurial activity as their “action” in response: \n\n“With the revolution came many different revolutions... one of the revolutions we're making is in education. And I say that I'm an activist  and not on the ground - it's our revolution in education. I don't think the revolution is only about going down and doing it violently. It's about rethinking, unlearning, recreating. Putting aside everything traditional / forced upon us / trying to make a difference. not just to make money. Money is not the aim, it's the reward. It's not the reward I'm aiming for. The impact is the aim I want. There's lots, revolutions in media, education, revolution in feminism/sexuality. This awareness is coming out and has been a social revolution not only (taboo). Not just a gov /political revolution, it's everything. This is my revolution.”\n-Interview 019\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, the majority of participants with revolutionary ideation came from people who were not intending to leave Lebanon, even after the blast. While revolutionary thinking and political engagement is not the primary focus of this paper, it is worth being included here since many of the inspiration for social entrepreneurs comes from areas the public sector is lacking in, and can be seen as a form of direct action. Most of the social entrepreneurs interviewed for this paper were operating businesses solving problems in the domain of education. \n\nAnother important reason to consider the idea of “Fighting” and using the feeling of Anger is that it is a fact bound to happen, especially when paired with major traumatic events. So rather than avoiding the feeling, we can sublimate anger to increase the critical factor of engagement to prevent freezing, complacency, and inaction. While the language of fighting is not necessarily positive, it does imply a high degree of activation and purpose, something important to maintain in the face of conflict and insurmountable odds. \n\nThe measure we’ve selected for “Fight” is resilience, labeled BRCS  (Sinclair and Walston 2004), it measures the following questions on a 5 point scale:\nI look for creative ways to alter difficult situations. \nRegardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it. \nI believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with difficult situations. \nI actively look for ways to replace the losses I encounter in life.\n\nActing as an antidote to the potential freezing reflex, resilience inspires action and engagement. While focusing on character strengths development has been shown to support wellbeing factors described by PERMA (Goodman & Kauffman 2017), there appears to be a subset that stands out in our set of interviews. The components of this subset are the following : Hope, Humor, Self-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. We can see that these are especially correlated with resilience, and may be interesting to explore as in future studies. \nWhat might not support direct engagement? The following table presents negative correlations between Revolutionary Ideation that we can find identified in the data, there are no strong positive correlations to present. \n\n\nThe relationships that stand out to me are the relationship between Prudence, having a child and Revolutionary Ideation. Prudent parents are less likely to be engaged in protests and other types of activism. Another strong correlation is with Spirituality. Diving into how one mother responded to the explosion we can see both features at play:\n\n“No, nothing changed. God's will will still happen as it should. Nothing has changed. I worked as a mother to prevent the impact from impacting my children much so they don't stay home alone. I didn't have much capacity to go to the site to volunteer. Fadi my brother was there and saw the fire that became the blast and was more present. I personally focused on making sure my children would cross this situation without harm. Fadi worked on support.”\n-013 Interview Spirituality rank 7/24 & Has_Child True\n\nWhile the strength of Spirituality contributes positively to Post Traumatic Growth through the “Spiritual Enhancement” facet, there is a concern that over-focusing on the strength of spirituality could lead to spiritual bypassing, which is a coping strategy where people use spiritual ideas to avoid facing unresolved emotional issues and development tasks. Spiritual bypassing was coined by John Welwood and developed in (Cashwell, C. S., Glosoff, H. L., & Hammond, C. 2010). \n\n\nInterviewee number 18 expressed the balance between trusting in the “Will of God” and developing and engaging in acts of control like this:\n“We do have control over that, if it's going to happen it's going to happen. If maybe we knew about it, maybe it's going to happen anyway. We're destined to have this. There's a saying in the (The Islamic Spiritual Tradition), aqqqalal (Arabic for use your brain/do something rational) watawakal (Arabic for rely on God) - before submitting (to the will of God) do what you have to do. DO what we should do and at the end of the day what's going to happen is going to happen.”\n-018 Interview \n\nFigure 6 in the figures section below displays an interesting chart exposing some relationships between meditation, spirituality, revolutionary / social ideation. Spirituality is correlated with not having a therapist perhaps indicating that people with a stronger spiritual practice don’t identify with the need to find a therapist. This is interesting because it seems that having a therapist correlates with deliberate rumination and meditation. Reviewing age seems to indicate that the younger generations are more open to therapy and meditation alongside their religious and spiritual beliefs. \n\nOne takeaway from the above analysis is that creating mixed communities of practice where various spiritual, religious, therapeutic ideas are shared openly might create an opportunity for alternative perspectives to be displayed and their results seen, either amplifying or dampening the ideas that the group selects as valuable. This might be an important task for course designers and facilitators to navigate carefully. 013 expressed a value in action by nurturing their child, while 019 demonstrated Bravery and a rallying cry to contribute socially in a time of revolutionary change. In relation to the theme of this section, both of them are putting up a good fight and are engaged in a values informed course of action.\n\nFlight\nTraumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation (WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports that the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. Understanding the decision making process of social entrepreneurs is critical since they are an important part of the population working on creating stability and creating positive reasons for people to stay, either through their services, as employees or customers. \n\nThis snippet of dialog from an interview demonstrates in real time holding multiple perspectives and ends with a contradiction, to desire to want to stay. \n\n“For instance if I had kids. If I was in Beirut/ lost a close family member I may have thought I would leave. Fortunately for me I don't’, it’s related to how much they can take. My brother is leaving for France in September, I can't leave everyone/my family. We have the family business, my father is relatively old. And I want to stay here willingly.”\n-004 Interview\n\nThe research strategy was initially going to divide the population into “those who stay and build” and “those who leave and protect themselves and their families” - during the coding process we found that the decision is emotional some people want to leave and contribute, and some want to stay and contribute, and many others have competing commitments that are unclear. Sometimes the interviewee demonstrates deep self knowledge and desires to leave for strategic reasons, to continue to be able to offer their work life as a service to their community they need to stay safe, sane and alive: \n\n“I won't lie, sometimes I feel like leaving too. Why do I think about it? To keep this engine/enthusiasm/giving to people I have to feel secure. Not that I will die at any instant. So much is online so I can do so much of my work online. I can be effective even if I’m not physically in the country. I think of my safety, my family… and my earnings. Now I’m fine. After a while will I still be fine? I’m investing from my income, will I still be able to invest in my team? That’s the one thing I’m thinking about. I’m investing in the base, raising this “child” so that one day the company will come and pay me back and take care of me when I’m older. Thank goodness God has given me a salary. I see tangible results. We’re going to print the book and sell it and make money from it. I can see it all. It's not like we’re playing and not doing anything.\n-002 Interview\n\nThis powerful snippet from the interview shows the strategic process 002 has taken to rationalize her potential departure from Lebanon. Some questions arise as to how much the combination of the massive spread of the coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown supports people in their migration ideation. It could be that as people have spent much of 2020 indoors people now, like 002, have taken their social entrepreneurship programs online and have less of a physical investment in their physical environments.\n\nOther interviewees have a clearer commitment to leaving and do not seem conflicted in any way:\n“I live with my mom/brother. And we are all affected by the situation of course. Because before that - the port - we already had the economic situation and we were feeling safe since a long time nothing happened security wise. we heard it could happen again. We don't feel safe anymore.\nI don't have foreign nationality, so I decided not to take a French one. It's complicated to find a job, it's a safe thing to do to have a possibility if one has to go outside Lebanon. I would be interested in leaving if I had an opportunity. Someone said for Canada. Someone said it's very far and they don't take Lebanese for my age. For security reasons I could go to France for example. It's a sure avenue, I need a challenge in my life. I don't like routine.”\n-Interview 017\n\n“Participants who maintain calm and develop adaptive self-regulating practices  Actually my thinking is everyone is thinking about leaving. Something inside me that doesn't want to leave despite everything. I don't know why I'm still calm. I see the craziness all around us. The best thing you can do is focus with what you have, and how you can help others with what you have. If you focus on all the bad things around us you can't work. What I decided is to help and doing what I can do and keeping my mental health and family health and that's how to survive everything. Of course we felt very bad and it was very stressful for us and all these feelings. I just wanted to stay calm.”\n-014 Interview\n\nAlbert Bandura’s Social Cognition Theory (Bandura 1989) proposes that a portion of knowledge acquisition comes from social evaluation, from our data we see that people modulate their migration ideation based on many factors, one of which is how and who they speak to about it. Traumatic events disrupt the standard narrative model needing new stories to support meaning, suggests Neimeyer in (Neimeyer, R. A. (2004), how are those narratives reconstructed? In a paper developing a model of Post Traumatic Growth for cancer patients (Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011) identified Deliberate Rumination as a strong influencing factor for PTG. Further research demonstrated the relationship between PTG and life satisfaction through the factor of meaning:\n\nIn the paper (Triplett et al. - 2012), they demonstrated that the disruption of core beliefs (CBIs) triggers both intrusive and deliberate rumination and that the destabilizing aspects of a traumatic event either supports a more meaningful life of satisfaction through deliberately contemplating the experience, or can negatively affect meaning and life satisfaction through intrusive rumination. \n\nDeliberate Rumination is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has around a traumatic event, for instance “what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with Intrusive Rumination and Brooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to me”. We can see both examples in our interview data set. Observe as 018 reflects on discussions had during a group dialog with other social entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurial training program:\n“...First I was thinking if we stay in this country, I can do anything in this country. Nothing limiting me, why would I leave this country.... Why ... maybe I should have a backup country if something unexpected happens. Just having this backup country in mind can help me (with my project). … Then(the start of the program) (projectName) (personName) starting asking which country do you want to go to? And I started thinking, first that ... I have friends, good nature, why leave? Then after the blast I have a different perspective of the country and started thinking of where I can go when/if something unexpected happens.”\n--018 Interview\nOther examples of social cognition supporting someone positively through social media and describing the importance of having a community of positive social support to help create a sense of control and meaning as he adjusts his worldview through the development of spiritual and meditative practices: \n“A lot lot lot lot. After the blast I was majorly helped - writing affirmations. It helped me so much. I was in complete loss, not knowing what's happening, what the point of anything is. Self existence questions that you ask yourself. One of the major affirmations, I am control of my reality even in times of uncertainty.\nThere's a beautiful instagram, called affirmation addict. Girl in California, I don't have the application. I have a journal. I have a routine. Every two weeks. I cleanse my home with spiritual music. I started yoga. More meditation. I did a retreat for 5 days [...]\nI always have curiosity to learn more about these. They came at the right time. I have friends who are more spiritual bess (but) i'm doing it alone. At my own pace. I have a collective of friends around me that I'm inspired by.”\n-020 Interview\n\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first established can potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths which support individuals' sense of life satisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to set a state of mind conducive to positive Deliberate Rumination. \nThe set of character strengths associated with our Deliberate Rumination dimension is Judgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. These traits do intuitively make sense as critical factors for deliberate rumination and working together as a community to make difficult collective decisions about traveling, building and relationships. We hope that by bringing a greater awareness to these strengths of character people and programs will benefit from clearer thinking and more open discussion on what to do after difficulties arise. \nFreeze… or Laugh\nThe third  response individuals have in the face of an overwhelmingly negative situation is to freeze. In our interviews, we identify initial stages after the blast where many people felt stuck through expressing feelings of exasperation and frustration at the situation. Indicating they sense a loss of control. These aspects connect to Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) through negating the opposite, post traumatic stress. Some of the symptoms of PTS are freezing, feeling numbness, an inability to act or care, holding one’s breath, a sense of dread… \n\nWhile it’s important not to overstate the case of PTS, in fact, most people respond quite resiliently as proposed by (Bonanno, G. A. 2004), also in order for people to experience the positive effects of PTG even the challenges and stressors of ordinary life can be enough of a trigger to stimulate benefits (Ewert, A., & Tessneer, S. 2019). Before exploring people’s stress let’s explore the positive correlations between PTGI and Character Strengths:\n\nThe majority of the connection comes through the facet of PTGI-Appreciation. \n\n\n “...It's useless, they are not serving us by doing this. (Sharing news about the situation) They are producing anger that can't turn into anything. The people are already angry from the economic issue. They don't have proof. One can sit and do theories for hours.”\n017 Interview \n\n“Khalas(exasperated form of “enough” in Arabic). I can't control anything… I need to control my feelings thoughts rage. \n-020 Interview\n\nAfter a month, yeah. In the first month I was consuming a lot of news about it and then I decided to stop. I was just depressing myself and I couldn't do anything about it and I disconnected completely and living my life as if nothing was going on. [[Code: Response-Self Protection]] I wasn't in Beirut, It wasn't as traumatic I was in Sawfar\n006 Interview \n\n“I didn't force myself to deal, when I wanted to cry. I was crying, when I didn't feel willing to do anything I didn't do anything.”\n010 Interview\n\nRather than freezing in response, some of the interviewees exhibited avoidant behaviors, which parallel freezing:\n\n“After the blast I didn't go to Beirut until just now. It was too heartbreaking, I didn't want to see it. We were impacted from the protests and the views. I was in a state of denial I didn't want to believe that this has happened. I only went yesterday because I //HAD// to get a vaccine. In some buildings you see the effects of the blast, in other buildings it's been cleaned up.”\n010 Interview\n\nContrast the preceding statements with following statements which demonstrate interviewees engaging in highly motivated activities following the explosion:\n\n“When the blast happened, most businesses closed and people were cleaning up... When I was in gbeili - company, not antwork. I was looking at the employees and was thinking, don't you want to be in beirut helping other people? You could just go there and do something, this paperwork could be done another day.”\n019 Interview \n\n“I still have nightmares, I have PTSD. Do you really want to know what it's like? I had some calls with people from projectName. And suddenly the glass office I was in all collapsed and the couch I was sitting on was full of glass. Allah itlatuf (God intervened with mercy) it was a matter of minutes. I was caught up on my way down to the floor below with my manager having a silly discussion when the blast happened. And the whole lower floor was full of blood, everyone had to be taken to the hospital. We were so scared to move. Because there were two we expected a third. We all thought we were being blasted. Because of this we created a (product in response), it was a determination for us that (curseword) it we're staying. We're doing this for the country despite all the (curse) we're living through. It was created after the blast as a demonstration that we want to manufacture here, we want to create jobs, we want to build something for the kids that are deprived of toys, their childhood even.” https://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntrepreneurialResearch/page/ISYEjUAMD\n\nAggregating the pre-post tests from all the assessments we have before and after the blast, we found that by segmenting our assessments by individuals in the entrepreneurial training program, they have - on average - a one point increase in the measure of Humor in the VIA-IS inventory, over the course of the program. While Humor may be under-studied in academia, it correlates with the CS prepost variable in our dataset. \n\n“CS Prepost” is a measure of the overall change in Character Strength before and after the Beirut Port Explosion. In the following table, we observe that humor and creativity both are factors affecting the preservation of Character Strengths. We used JASP and a classical regression matrix since the variables are all continuous variables.  \n\nSo what is a theory behind humor and this buffering effect? Humor has been linked to adaptive coping and keeping a “light attitude” in the face of adversity (Ruch and Hofmann 2017). Humor is also an active response to take when other options are unavailable: people “break” the silence with laughter, for example. This may be preventing the processes which lead to Learned Helplessness. Learned helplessness is one way to view the opposite of post traumatic growth for people living in highly chaotic and destabilized situations. Initially Learned Helplessness theory implied that dogs experiencing inescapable shocks learned helplessness and persisted in helpless behavior even when the situation became escapable later. \n\nRecent research has shed light on the neurological underpinnings of learned helplessness which has application in uncertain times (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). Previously Learned Helplessness, as the name suggests, theorized that higher level mammals learn helpless behaviors when they are given inescapable negative experiences. Passivity in the face of a changed situation, a situation where it behooves the animal to take action, is the hallmark of learned helplessness. And while that behavior doesn’t change, our understanding of how it comes to be has. Mammals, when confronted with prolonged adverse situations, develop an unlearned response of passivity. It is possible to overcome this bias towards passivity by learning and exerting control. What behaviors are available to act on?\n\nOne additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory (Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive activities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities and capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with the neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of character strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost). Humor stands out as one of the only factors that is directly connected to growth and stands out as a unique lens to look at both PTG(PTGI) and Resilience(BRCS) as it ties them all together as can be seen in the following chart:  \nThe court jester is the only person able to speak the truth when there is a crippling fear gripping the court. Humor breaks the ice and we propose that it may also help sustain the neurological basis for control. Humor is one of the factors we are exploring in this paper along the dimension of growth, the other is self reflection and emotional reappraisal through Deliberate Rumination and the third is Engagement as manifested in anger/political action as well as social entrepreneurial ideation. \nHumor, Engagement & Deliberate Rumination\nDiscussion\n4.1 Implications and future directions\n4.2 Limitations \nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we investigated the Character Strength correlations with Resilience, Post Traumatic Growth and Deliberate Rumination. Since Character Strengths are correlated with Post Traumatic Growth and Wellbeing, and since there is a collection of applied interventions with scientific validity, we hope this analysis helps educators working inside and outside conflict. The idea of “pre-silience” (pre+resilience) applies here with the recommendations for actions being more helpful in situations before there is a traumatic event. \nLet’s review the frame and identify the correlated character strengths:\n\nHeading\n\n\nSDT\nMeasure -> Support\nCorrelated Character Strengths\nFight \nEngagement anger/political social entrepreneurial ideation. \n\n\nAutonomy\nResilience -> Engagement\nHope, Humor, Self-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. \nFlight\nDeliberate Rumination\nself reflection and emotional reappraisal\nRelatedness\nDeliberate Rumination -> Dialog\nJudgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. \nFreeze\nGrowth \nHumor\nCompetency\nPTGI -> Growth\nAppreciation of Beauty, Fairness, Humor, Judgement, Leadership, Modesty/Humility, Perspective, Prudence, Social Intelligence, Spirituality and Teamwork\n\n\nThe strengths that correlate with motivation and wellbeing with the highest correlations are Teamwork, Social Intelligence and Judgement. \n\nThe total list of strengths which emerged from our analysis is:\nAppreciation of Beauty\nFairness\nHope\nHumor\nJudgement \nLeadership\nModesty/Humility\nPrudence\nPerspective\nSelf-Regulation\nSocial Intelligence\nSpirituality \nTeamwork \n\nEveryone makes different decisions after a traumatic event, one size does not fit all in terms of how best to design a pedagogy for social entrepreneurs. We hope this paper inspires more exploration around increasing motivation and wellbeing before the traumatic event, generating “presilience” so that when challenges come the psychological and social support are already in place. \n\nOne thing is becoming more clear, it’s important to create spaces for truth speaking in the social entrepreneurship community, we must talk about our failures and fears as well as our successes. These spaces can be where people explore ways of being and inspire each other through positive open discussion around Character Strengths. These spaces could be a counter to the negativity bias seen on both social and traditional media. They offer a facilitated space to practice deliberate rumination with the positive guidance of facilitators. It also supports the spread of value-laden idioms, aphorisms, and other easily digestible ideas, which become heuristics for decision making. \n\nThe Character Strengths above come from a small sample study and the correlations do not imply causation. I hope this paper inspires others to take an applied approach to character strengths explorations and also publish their data openly to build up a stronger evidence base for Character Strengths interventions. \n\nI hope these findings make their way into communities of practice where social entrepreneurs can collectively support each other to create the next viable steady-state system wherever they are. \nI want to end with two insights, one from one of the participants of the study and one from a famous author:\n\n“...Values are the base of every human reaction and really, there's courage and motivation in every person that's hidden and this very sad event created or awakened values in people. Those of compassion and courage, of motivation of solidarity and nationalism. Inspire nationalism even as people as they leaving the country. The people that are leaving the country, they still say my dream is to come back one day to Lebanon. \nMaybe they will go and come back.”\n--Interview 017\n\n “If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” \n-Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n\nStrengths to develop. The character strengths that have a developmental trajectory; that is, they are least common in youth and need to increase over time through cognitive maturation are: appreciation of beauty & excellence, forgiveness, modesty, open-mindedness (Park & Peterson, 2006a; 2006b).\n\n\n\nIn (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve, C. L. 2011) the researchers described the nodes in the dynamical system of someone going through a traumatic experience as Core Beliefs. Previous research by Christopher Peterson has demonstrated that improvements in Character Strengths are correlated with improvements in the Post Traumatic Growth Index, for people that experience major life difficulties (Peterson 2008). And, importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their strengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018). \n\nThis inquiry eventually allowed us to identify factors which support social entrepreneurs along the three dimensions of responding to the blast: fighting, fleeing or freezing. We’ve mapped them to the Self Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation (Deci & Ryan 2008) (Autonomy, Mastery and Relatedness). \n\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially described by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory has since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This model now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses to neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an individual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of responses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues that the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018). \n\nIn 2008 it was demonstrated that an overall growth in the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory was correlated with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Peterson et al. 2008). Traumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\n\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation (WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports that the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. One additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory (Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive activities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities and capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with the neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of character strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost).\nThe first sentence of the first paragraph should pick up some or most of the words from the title.

To date, no studies have examined the barriers that Palestinian medical students face in accessing hospitals for clinical training. The objectives of this study were to characterize these barriers and understand how they affect Palestinian students’ medical education and quality of life.\nMethods: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 4th-6th year medical students from Al-Quds University to participate in focus group discussions. A total of 36 students participated in the discussions. Transcripts of the discussions were coded to identify major themes.\nResults: Palestinian medical students expressed facing numerous challenges during their clinical training. Students emphasized the difficulties of obtaining permits to train at Jerusalem hospitals, including arbitrary permit rejections and long wait times. Significant delays, searches, and mistreatment at checkpoints during their commute to hospitals were particularly burdensome. The majority of students who participated in the focus groups felt that their education and quality of life had been strongly negatively affected by their experience trying to access hospital training sites.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that medical students living and studying in the occupied Palestinian territories receive sub-optimal training due to ambiguous permit rules, barriers at checkpoints, and the psychological burden of the process. These results highlight the impact that military occupation has on the education and quality of life of Palestinian medical students in a setting in which there is regular violence and many health indicators are already poor.\nKeywords: Occupation, Palestine, Medical education, West Bank, Al-Quds University, Medical students\n\n\n\n\na Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02446, USA b Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA\nc Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA\nARTICLE INFO\nKeywords:\nFemale genital cutting United States Diaspora\nImmigration\nReligion Vacation cutting\nABSTRACT\nThis study documents the perceptions and experiences of immigrant women and men in the US related to female genital cutting (FGC). This paper examines the effects of migration on these perceptions, with the goal of op- timizing health services and informing public policy to support women who have undergone FGC. This quali- tative study consisted of individual interviews conducted from 2014 to 2015 with 42 women and men living in Boston, Massachusetts, who immigrated from a variety of communities where FGC has been practiced. Most participants felt strongly against the continuation of the practice, describing a change in their personal and community viewpoints over time, which they attributed to education, religion and immigration. The men in our study collectively took a stand against FGC and believed that they had a particular duty to raise awareness in their families and their communities about its physical and emotional harms. Our study provides strong support for the inclusion of men, religious leaders, and immigrants in FGC-related efforts. Our unique preliminary ex- ploration of the role of members of the diaspora provides some support for initiatives that would involve emigrants in the effort to curb FGC in their home countries. Changing views in the diaspora could play a sig- nificant role in affecting opinions and practices in contexts where FGC is prevalent. Finally, our findings do not support the fear that “vacation cutting” might be common among US immigrants. We should therefore exercise caution in our promotion of legislation and clinical practices that target this fear.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\n  \nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\nSocial Science & Medicine\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/socscimed\n \nPerspectives on female genital cutting among immigrant women and men in T Boston\nS. Shahawya,∗, H. Amanuelb, N.M. Nourc\n \n1. Introduction\nThe World Health Organization defines “female genital mutilation” as a procedure involving removal of or injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons (WHO, 2008). More than 200 million women and girls have undergone female genital cutting (FGC) globally, with an additional 3 million girls under the age of 18 “at risk” each year (WHO, 2008). While the practice varies widely, much research has shown that women who undergo FGC face negative health and social consequences (Ball, 2008; Utz-Billing and Kentenich, 2008; WHO, 2008). FGC is classified into different types (WHO, 2014): Type 1 in- volves removing part or all of the clitoris or the prepuce. Type 2, in- volves removing part or all of the clitoris and labia minora, with or without the labia majora. Type 3, called infibulation or pharaonic, in- volves removing part or all of the external genitalia and narrowing the vaginal orifice by reapproximating the labia minora and/or labia ma- jora. Type 4 encompasses all other harmful procedures to the genitalia\nfor non-medical reasons. The term sunna, meaning “prophetic tradi- tion”, is generally used to describe non-infibulating forms of FGC.\n1.1. The United States\nIn 1996, the United States Congress banned FGC. In 2000, Brigham and Women's Hospital's African Women's Health Center used census data to estimate that 228,000 girls living in the US had either under- gone or were at risk of FGC. This represented approximately a 35% increase from the 1990 census data (Nour et al., 2006). More recent estimates tell us that 513,000 girls under the age of 18 in the US are now at risk of FGC—more than three times the number in 1990 (Goldberg et al., 2016). Researchers attribute this increase in estimated number of girls at risk to increased migration from FGC-practicing countries as well as a change in the estimation technique to include both first and second generation girls (Goldberg et al., 2016).\n∗ Corresponding author.

The persistence of FGC\nVarious reasons have been cited for the persistence of FGC including its role as a rite of passage, the preservation of chastity, ensuring marriageability, religious requirements, hygiene, and enhancing sexual pleasure for men (Nour, 2008; WHO, 2008; Mackie and LeJeune, 2009). A systematic review of 21 studies of members of communities that practiced FGC but reside in Western countries pointed to six key factors underpinning FGC: cultural traditions, sexual morals, marriageability, religion, health benefits, and male sexual enjoyment (Berg and Dension., 2013). In almost all the studies included in that review, FGC was referred to as a meaningful and valued cultural practice linked to honor and the preservation of chastity, enforced through community mechanisms. The current study seeks to avoid oversimplifying the practice and immigrants’ perceptions of it by presenting complex and often contrasting views among a diverse set of immigrant women and men.\n1.3. Community based research in immigrant populations\nSome research has examined perceptions and experiences of FGC in African diasporic communities in the United States (Akinsulure-Smith, 2014; Connor et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2009; McNeely and Jong, 2016). A qualitative study among 30 female Somali refugees in Min- nesota found that participants endorsed negative attitudes towards FGC, largely secondary to health consequences as well as a new un- derstanding that FGC is not sanctioned religiously (Connor et al., 2016). A qualitative study among 13 Somali refugees in Colorado found that all participants reported having changed their views on FGC after moving, often due to education, migration, and dissociation of the practice from religious beliefs (McNeely and Jong, 2016). Lastly, a study among Somali immigrant women about their challenging FGC- related healthcare experiences in the US emphasized the importance of engaging in community-based participatory research using mixed- methods to build trust-based networks and actively engage community members in the research process (Johnson et al., 2009).\nThere is also research on FGC among African diasporic communities outside the United States (Abdulcadir et al., 2016; Jaldesa and Abdi 2014; Vloeberghs et al. 2012). A study in Nairobi found that Ethiopian immigrants viewed FGC as a tool to curb female sexuality and enforce fixed gender roles upon women; those researchers called for commu- nity-based education programming involving religious leaders, NGOs, government ministries, and other actors (Jaldesa and Abdi 2014). A study of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa residing in Hamburg, Germany found that most immigrants speak out for the abandonment of FGC, but that there is a solid minority who maintain either positive or indifferent attitudes towards the practice (Behrendt, 2011). Other stu- dies also reflect this overwhelming rejection of FGC after immigration (Johnsdotter et al., 2007), while some studies delineate certain groups of immigrants that may tend to have more traditional views towards the practice, such as males, older generations, and new arrivals (Morison et al., 2004). There are differing views on the kind of effect the process of migration has on the viewpoints of immigrants on FGC. One fra- mework might suggest that immigrants may cling more strongly to cultural norms such as FGC in an effort to retain their cultural identity, while an opposing theory might suggest that immigrants are more likely to abandon a practice such as FGC in the process of assimilation (Berry, 1997).\n1.4. Men's perspectives\nFew studies in the US have explored the varied perspectives of men on FGC. A recent study in Somalia indicated that 96% of men preferred to marry women who have undergone FGC but that women were less likely than men to support FGC (Almroth et al., 2001). Similarly, a study in Oslo found that Somali immigrant men were more likely than\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nwomen to support continuation of the practice (Gele et al., 2015). However, a qualitative study in the US found that male Somali refugees were aware of FGC-related morbidities and did not support the practice, while many women seemed supportive (Johnson-Agbakwu et al., 2014). More detailed comparisons of men and women's views in the US are needed to determine how perceptions of FGC itself and FGC-tar- geted interventions might be similar or different across gender lines.\n1.5. Objectives\nThis study documents the FGC-related perceptions and experiences of immigrant women and men in Boston, Massachusetts, and attempts to understand the effect of migration on these perceptions, with the larger goal of optimizing health services and informing public policy to support women who have undergone FGC. Our study is unique in considering not only the views of women who have undergone FGC (not simply all women from FGC-practicing countries), but also the views of immigrant men from the same communities. Furthermore, this study investigates the nature of FGC-related communication between mem- bers of the diaspora and relatives in their communities of origin across Africa and the Middle East—an important facet of the subject that past studies have not investigated.\n2. Methods\nWe designed a qualitative study consisting of individual interviews in Boston, Massachusetts, with immigrant women who experienced FGC themselves and immigrant men with family members who had experienced FGC, to explore their views on the practice and the dis- course surrounding it. We report our qualitative research in accordance with the COREQ criteria (Tong et al., 2007).\n2.1. Ethics, consent, and permissions\nThis study was approved by the Brigham and Women's Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed consent was obtained verbally and participants were provided with a study information sheet. No compensation or incentives were given to study participants.\n2.2. Topic guide\nThe topic guides for the interviews were created by the researchers based on gaps in the literature related to the perspectives and experi- ences of people in the US who immigrated from communities where FGC has been practiced. The topic guides, one tailored to men and the other to women [Appendix A] were reviewed for content, clarity, and cultural sensitivity by Harvard Medical School faculty of both African and Middle Eastern descent. The topic guides consisted of three sec- tions: participants’ personal views on FGC and the cultural and social factors that have affected their views; personal experiences with FGC and its long-term effects; and perceptions of community views of the practice both in their countries of origin and in the US diaspora.\n2.3. Sampling\nConvenience sampling was used to recruit both women and men living in Boston who had immigrated from communities where FGC has been practiced, including parts of Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates. Inclusion cri- teria included women and men above 18 years of age who immigrated from these countries and now live in Boston. For women, it was ne- cessary that they themselves had undergone FGC. For men, it was ne- cessary that they had a family member who had undergone FGC. Individuals who were below 18 years of age or women who had not undergone FGC were excluded.\nHalf of the participants were recruited through the African Women's\n332\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nHealth Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital, an obstetrical and gynecologic clinic for women who have experienced FGC. The re- maining participants were recruited through the local mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center (ISBCC), and the Eritrean Community Center of Greater Boston. In the African Women's Health Center, eligible patients were first introduced to the study in private rooms by nurses. If potential participants were interested in hearing more about the study, they were introduced by the nurses to the re- search team. At the local community and religious centers, center vo- lunteers introduced the study to constituents. Interested community members then met privately with the research team to hear more about the study. Two researchers on the team informed potential participants about the details of the study. If they agreed to participate, they were provided with an information sheet in their language about the study and then gave verbal consent. Interviews were then conducted one-on- one. After the interviews, participants were asked whether their part- ners, relatives, or friends in their communities would be willing to participate (snowball sampling). If so, a separate interview date was set up to consent and interview additional participants.\n2.4. Interviews\nInterviews were conducted in a semi-structured format between July 2014 and 2015 until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews ranged between 20 and 90 minutes in duration. All interviews were conducted either in Arabic, English, Somali, or Tigrinya. The interviews were conducted in the participants’ own languages (one interviewer was fluent in Arabic and another in Tigrinya), and a Somali interpreter was used when needed. 25 interviews were conducted in English and the remaining 17 were conducted in the other languages. The re- searchers took notes and audio-recorded during the interviews then subsequently translated and fully transcribed the interviews in English on an encrypted laptop. All interviews were translated into English to produce written transcripts.\n2.5. Qualitative data analysis\nWe employed Joffe and Yardley's qualitative research guidelines for our thematic analysis (Joffe and Yardley, 2004). Two researchers open- coded the transcripts of the interviews using thematic analysis to identify major underlying themes. The two researchers initially read through a sample of interviews separately and independently drafted a list of recurrent codes derived from the data (inductive coding). All coding was done using MAXQDA 11. Codes were identified in- dependently then refined collaboratively to ensure good inter-coder reliability. The coders discussed discrepancies between their codes until they reached consensus, then finalized a list of reoccurring themes based on the frequency with which each code was identified throughout the interviews. The nuances of these high-frequency codes were then explored. Key themes and illustrative quotations were reviewed by the researchers for consensus.\n3. Results\n3.1. Demographics\nDemographic characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. Of 42 participants interviewed, 20 were women and 22 men ranging in age from 18 to 70 years, with an average age of 39. Twenty- four of the 42 (57.1%) participants were Muslim and the remaining 18 were Christian (42.9%). Fifteen participants were immigrants from Somalia (35.7%), 14 from Eritrea (33.3%), 3 from Ethiopia (7.1%), with the remaining participants coming from Sudan, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, Egypt, and the Arab Gulf. The vast majority of participants were married (38/42, 90.5%) and had at least a high school education (40/ 42, 95.2%). 13 out of the 22 men (59.1%) interviewed had post-\nTable 1\nParticipant characteristics.

Half of the participants had lived in the US for more than 10 years (21/42, 50.0%), a quarter had lived in the US for 5–10 years (11/42, 26.2%), and the remaining quarter for less than 5 years (10/42, 23.8%), with the breakdown being similar among men and women. The range of years living in the US spanned anywhere from 3 months to 44 years.\n3.2. Perceptions of FGC\n3.2.1. Rationales for the practice\nA primary aim of this study was to explore how immigrant women who have undergone FGC and immigrant men conceive of the practice. Participants cited a range of rationales for the creation and perpetua- tion of FGC. In response to the question “Why do you think the practice is performed?,” all 42 participants agreed with the response “preserve chastity,” 24 participants agreed with “culture,” 14 participants agreed with “religion,” 6 participants agreed with “ensure marriage,” 3 parti- cipants agreed with “rite of passage,” 2 participants agreed with “curb sexual desire,” one participant agreed with “enhance sexual pleasure for men,” and 1 participant agreed with “hygiene.” Virtually all parti- cipants considered FGC a primarily cultural rather than religious practice, and some argued that the two—religion and culture—are not distinct categories, as they readily intersect in daily life.\nIn contrast to meta-narratives of FGC as a means to “preserve chastity,” a 68-year-old Eritrean man and a 65-year-old Ethiopian man described how some Eritreans and Ethiopians decide to have their daughters undergo Type III FGC in order to protect them from being raped. A 64-year-old Nigerian man explained that, in his community of origin, people believed that FGC was necessary to reduce the chances of a woman experiencing stillbirth. Lastly, a 42-year-old Malian man de- scribed FGC as both a physical and spiritual ritual of initiation into womanhood.\n3.2.2. Perceived effects of the practice\nMany participants believed that there were no advantages to FGC,\noften explaining that it does more harm than good. A 30-year-old Egyptian woman used strong, human rights-based language in her re- sponse:\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nIt disfigures her body, it harms her emotionally, and it gives her no [sexual] feelings ... This is because sex, as it relates to women in our society, is something rejected. She does not have a right in it...The location for pleasurable feelings, the clitoris, is taken. It makes the woman void of pleasurable feelings. This is a crime.\nIn contrast, other female participants argued that, despite having undergone FGC, they were able to experience sexual pleasure. A 54- year-old Eritrean woman said, “I am not aware of any physical dis- abilities or unwanted consequences or what is called ‘reduced pleasure’ in sex that has to do with clitoris removal...I have no problem in terms of enjoying sex. I don't see my disadvantage.”\nAnother participant, a 21-year-old Ethiopian man, argued that the social acceptability of FGC is specific to its context:\nIt's not just about the person, and the practice of the religion, but it's more about what people in the community think. It [FGC] has a huge social implication that can be negative for people who aren't in that community. But for the people who are in it and who have lived through it, it can be socially beneficial.\nFor one 35-year-old Eritrean woman, for example, having under- gone FGC forms a barrier to social acceptance in Boston, particularly in healthcare settings, as she must face the stigma of FGC as ‘backward’ and ‘primitive.’ Thus, having experienced FGC can serve as both a means of gaining social acceptability and of being socially ostracized, depending on the local power dynamics.\n3.3. Gendered dynamics of FGC: exploring the roles of men\nIn discussions with both women and men about the roles of men in the dynamics of FGC, two primary sub-themes emerged: notions of marriageability in relation to men's preferences and the potential for men to act as advocates against FGC in their families and communities.\n3.3.1. Marriageability and men's preferences\nSome participants argued that at the center of discourses on FGC, marriageability, and men's preferences lies the importance of virginity in the construction of the ‘good,’ ‘desirable’ woman. A 30-year-old Somali woman explained that, in the context of exploring marriage options, discussions around having undergone FGC often serve as a means of discussing virginity, an important quality to her in the larger sociopolitical context of marriage and desirability.\nIn contrast, other participants argued that men desired a woman who had not undergone FGC and therefore had supposedly stronger sexual desires. A 65-year-old Ethiopian man described men's pre- ferences and the stigma against circumcised women in certain parts of Ethiopia: “In some areas, men prefer uncircumcised women [...] Because they think that if she's circumcised, that she's ‘resa’, like a dead body without sexual feeling.” Similarly, one 40-year-old Sudanese man discussed the importance of enjoying sex with his wife, who had un- dergone FGC and was not re-infibulated after giving birth to her first child:\nThey [young men] say that the woman who isn't circumcised is more happy, more heated—she will have more enjoyment with him. So I don't know. [...] They say that when she is circumcised she will not be hot, not be sexy, but I don't feel that. In my experience, I've had a happy and fulfilling life with my wife and we have enjoyment. [...] Even when she had our first son, my friends would say, \"Let her go back to Sudan and get re-circumcised\", but I said, “No. Why?”\nThus, we found a range of men's preferences with respect to FGC and indications that some preferences had changed over time.\n3.3.2. Men as advocates for change\nThe majority of participants, both women and men, highlighted the changing perspectives of men and their potential to serve as advocates\nagainst FGC, especially through their dual roles as family and com- munity members. Both men and women discussed the intimate roles of men as supportive husbands. A 40-year-old Sudanese Muslim man de- scribes his first sexual experience with his wife after they were married:\nWhen we went on our honeymoon, I told her I'm not gonna push her. She took one and a half months with me. [...] In the stories I had heard and the books I read, it [painful sex] can make the woman hate the man. I didn't want her to resent me so I said take it easy and slowly. It took us about 2 months and we were both satisfied.\nBoth male and female immigrants to Boston described how, as hus- bands, the men facilitated their wives' access to healthcare providers at the African Women's Health Center after having negative experiences with physicians with limited awareness of the practice of FGC.\nA 32-year-old Somali man described his stance as the father of a young girl:\nAs a man, it's just a theory. I'm not sure what it [FGC] is. You will never know or understand things unless it happens to you and it's personal. I've heard it's an awful thing...Would I do it to my daughter? No. I have a daughter and it's not part of my agenda and it's not part of anything anyone can convince me to do.\nSimilarly, a 40-year-old Sudanese man spoke of the responsibility of fathers to stop the practice: “I think the role of men is important, especially for fathers. If you're the father and you know this is about to happen to your daughter, ask yourself: why is this happening? And if you don't believe in it, then stop it from happening.” A 32-year-old Eritrean man described his changing position and his role in persuading his mother to prevent his youngest sister from undergoing FGC. Thus, many male participants viewed their roles as fathers and siblings, among others, as critical in FGC-related decision-making regarding the women and girls in their families.\nFurthermore, some participants argued that men, given their dominant position within the hegemonic social order, bear a particular responsibility to advocate against the practice—alongside their part- ners—at both the family and community levels. A 33-year-old Ethiopian man highlighted men's roles as advocates against FGC, ar- guing that their privileged status strongly implicates them in the practice:\nThe involvement of men in the fight against FGC is absolutely im- portant, because of their positions of power. If they are convinced, they can change [other people's] positions. So given the structural relations, I think their involvement is absolutely important. Because, for example, in a particular family if the husband says no, I don't think the practice will continue.\nWhile these participants stressed the roles of men in changing discourse around and practices of FGC, others also highlighted the roles of women. A 30-year-old Somali woman, for instance, explained that de- spite her and her husband's opposition to the practice, two out of five of her daughters underwent FGC because of her mother-in-law's pre- ferences.\n3.4. Religion\n3.4.1. Muslims and Christians\nReligion played an important role in our interviews with both Muslim and Christian participants. The central question for both Christians and Muslims was whether FGC was mandated, condoned, or forbidden by their respective religions. When asked about whether participants felt that FGC was a religious practice, some participants made reference to their primary texts, with some believing that FGC is specifically mentioned in the Bible or the Quran, and others believing that it was not. A 62-year-old Eritrean Christian man commented, “I think that both Christians and Muslims exercise that [FGC]. What I know is that most of them exercise it for cultural reasons.” Many\n334\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nparticipants believed that FGC was unrelated to their religion and was instead a reflection of cultural tradition. One participant, a 65-year-old Eritrean man, remarked, “In religious practice in the Orthodox Church, the priests never spoke about it being done, but I also never heard them condemning it. To me, it comes more from the civilian culture in Eritrea and Ethiopia, especially on the Christian side.” A 35-year-old Eritrean man commented, “I've read a little bit about it in the Bible. The Bible doesn't say anything about a girl being circumcised, only about boys. In our society, especially among the older ones, they mix the culture and religion.” A 43-year-old Somali Muslim man similarly explained, “There is nothing in our religion, nothing that says we should circumcise. It is not in religion or anything.” However, despite controversy over its re- ligious legitimacy, there seemed to be agreement among participants that FGC is practiced by both religious groups, although some Christian participants believed it to be more strictly practiced by Muslims.\n3.4.2. Sunna\nIn discussion with Muslim participants, the question of the practice's religious basis took on an additional dimension in the discourse around the different types of FGC, namely sunna versus the pharaonic type (Type 3). Although the term sunna can be used to describe non-in- fibulating forms of FGC, our population generally used it to refer to Type I FGC. A 26-year-old Somali woman explained, “There are two kinds of practice, one is sunna, set up by the holy Quran and the Prophet Muhammad, and the other is pharaonic, which is totally wrong. That's the one I'm against.” Around a fourth of participants (11/42, 26.2%) shared this view: that Type 3 was unacceptable due to its deleterious effects on women's health and sexuality, but that Type 1 might be ac- ceptable because it is a comparatively minor procedure without any perceived long-term effects. A few participants even mentioned that a common strategy used by some transnational campaigns and religious groups in their countries of origin to discourage severe forms of FGC was to encourage Type I over Type III FGC.\n3.4.3. Religion as a means for change\nMany participants referred to religious leadership as an important factor in swaying public and personal opinion against FGC. A 33-year- old Somali Muslim woman spoke about these dynamics in Somalia: “The situation has changed [...] a lot of sheikhs [Muslim religious scholars] came and spoke out and said how dangerous it is for the girls to be harmed. So they stopped. Very soon, they might even stop the sunna”. A 52-year-old Somali Muslim man said, “Some people still do the procedure, but it's not that popular. I hear that people spoke against the procedure. They said it's torture, if you do this to your daughter, you'll have to answer in the Hereafter, so it's not as popular as befor- e—the religious scholars speak out against it.” Many participants echoed the view that religious leaders play a critical role in influencing public opinions by denouncing the practice. In fact, many participants felt that it was much easier for them to abandon and discourage the practice themselves if they believed it was not religiously mandated. As a 40-year-old Somali Muslim woman recounted:\nWhere I grew up when I was young, they do it. [...] Our parents were not educated, they don't know what it is, they think this is a part of religion, it's like cultural things. But the good news is that after we flee the country, and got educated and found out more that it has nothing to do with our religion, it is very bad, it is not a sunna [Prophetic tradition], no hadith [Prophetic saying], or aya [Quranic verse], so now our people who left the country they don't do it, but those who still in the country they do it. That's why we try to educate each other. Like if you have a sister, and she has daughter we say don't do it, we have kids now, we don't do it. Like, for ex- ample, I have four children born in America so I don't do it because we follow the practice of our religion, and our religion did not say do it at all, so this thing is just cultural, it has nothing to do with our religion.\nMany participants shared similar experiences in which the act of emi- gration itself allowed for a reframing of the relationship between re- ligion and perceptions of FGC, making it easier for them to abandon the practice. A few Muslim participants even noted that immigrating to the United States and meeting Muslims who had emigrated from commu- nities where FGC is not practiced further persuaded them that FGC was not a mandated Islamic practice.\n3.5. Changes in perspectives on and practices of FGC\nThe final theme of our interviews was the potential for change in opinions on FGC, both in immigrants’ communities of origin as well as in the US. The overwhelming majority of participants we interviewed, both men and women, believed that both the prevalence of and popular support for FGC had decreased. Participants attributed this decline to both personal and community-level changes relating to (from most to least commonly attributed) education, urban-rural divides, crim- inalization of FGC, generational differences, emigration, transnational and national campaigns, religious leaders, and medical personnel.\n3.5.1. Sources of change\nThese changes in opinions on FGC were overwhelmingly attributed to increased education, particularly regarding the harms and health risks of FGC. A 31-year-old Somali woman explained succinctly, “There is a faction that says it [FGC] is something necessary to our culture, and there are some people who see it as a backwards practice. The differ- ence between these people are their education levels.” Differences in education were also often linked to generational differences. One 42- year-old Sudanese woman noted, “This [FGC] used to be widespread during the time of our mothers and the generations past but now that people are aware and they know that the circumcision has a lot of complications and that it is not right, people have begun to distance themselves from it.” A 33-year-old Somali woman affirmed, “People now have a lot of education; people my age don't agree with the practice, but people in older generations still support it. But now young people know the risks.”\nIn addition to education, the criminalization of FGC in their coun- tries of origin was cited by participants as a significant factor in the perceived decline in the prevalence of FGC. However, many partici- pants noted that criminalization was not enough. A 55-year-old Eritrean man noted:\nThe government in Eritrea declared a proclamation so that by the law the practice gets punished. Whether people accept the law is a different question. To convince people, you have to do civil educa- tion and education through religious institutions and you have to do different efforts. Just because you have a law, it doesn't mean you will see many changes. [...] There is still much more work that needs to be done. Because with religion and culture, [...] it is dif- ficult and troublesome to change people's perspectives.\nThus, participants stressed the importance of education and advocacy in changing public opinion and the practice of FGC. A 25-year-old Ghanaian Christian man recalled, “For a while growing up, there was a lot of education against it [FGC]. So most communities have done away with it. But unfortunately in some communities it still persists. [...] The good thing was that most people got on board, presidents made public declarations, chief imams [Muslim religious leaders] were some of the biggest people who spoke up against it.”\nMany participants had memories of various media outlets such as TV campaigns, documentaries, and news articles that helped them change their own views on the negative effects of FGC. A 28-year-old Somali woman said that she thought that the prevalence of FGC, especially of Type III, had decreased in Somalia, “because everybody is talking about the health problems like infection, bad periods, problems with peeing. They make community organizations, women tell the men and the moms and tell them to stop the pharaonic type. It's the doctors\n335\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nand gynecologists and midwives who are the ones encouraging this. And this is making changes.” Thus, most participants expressed the opinion that the popularity and prevalence of FGC (especially Type III) had decreased over time in their communities of origin due to a com- bination of factors including education, national campaigns, media, and the efforts of religious leaders, politicians, and medical personnel. They identified the barriers to change as limited education, difficulty in reaching and influencing rural populations, and resistance, especially from older generations, to abandoning this longstanding practice.\n3.5.2. Change through immigration\nAll of the men and women we interviewed were immigrants from communities where FGC is practiced, and many identified immigration itself as an important factor in changing both their personal views on FGC and the views of their immigrant communities in the US. A 68- year-old Eritrean man said, “I think that as we come here to the US and we learn more about the practice, we learn that we should not demand for our daughters or our sisters to be circumcised. We don't even think about it or consider it.” A 33-year-old Somali woman made a similar point:\nWhen you're far away from your country, you view things you used to do differently—what's good, what's beneficial. People had lack of education, they don't even have a good religious education but now it's expanded, [...] now when they know the religion isn't acceptable for this, many people gave it up. [...] People couldn't tell the dif- ference without education between culture versus religion.\nWe specifically examined the views of the 10 more recent immigrants (defined as living in the US for 5 years or less) interviewed in our study and found that, regardless of age, they did not tend to have more tra- ditional views than more established immigrants and that, in fact, they all shared a negative perception of the practice of FGC.\n3.5.3. Vacation cutting\nParticipants were asked about the practice of “vacation cutting,” in which immigrants take their daughters back to their countries of origin to have them undergo FGC. Most participants had heard of the practice in the media but did not personally know anyone who had done it, and some participants doubted that the practice was possible at all. As one participant put it, “Because of the rules in America, a doctor could complain or take the kids away [if they underwent FGC]. People don't take their daughters overseas [for the purpose of FGC] because they know they'll get checked by a doctor when they come back. It's a risk if they come back here.”\n3.6. Role of the diaspora\n3.6.1. Potential influence of the diaspora\nWe asked participants about the ways in which they felt they could\ninfluence views and practices in their communities of origin. A few participants believed that they play a strong role in deterring family and friends in their communities of origin from practicing FGC. A 52- year-old Sudanese Muslim man related, “Whenever one of them has a newborn girl, I tell them ‘Don't listen to your friend, or neighbor or someone else that'll tell you to do this [circumcise your daughter] be- cause you may end up losing your child’. And yes, they listen to me.” A 65-year-old Eritrean man described current community efforts to change perceptions in his home country:\nThe change starts with people who live in the US and so forth. So yeah, I think people who live in other countries can influence people back home and make a difference. Actually, I know an Ethiopian woman who used to live in California and now she tries to educate women back home about these issues. In general, it's health edu- cation. The discussion is not only about circumcision, it's also about women's health.\nMany participants felt they had not yet influenced their relatives, but that they could eventually have an impact on them. A 45-year-old Ethiopian Christian man stated, “If I get the chance, of course I would talk about it [FGC]. [...] It's not only for talk, but also it's my respon- sibility as a medical doctor. I have to teach my communities and my people in my country about how bad it is, and how they can avoid it.”\n3.6.2. Challenges to the influence of the diaspora\nA few participants identified several obstacles to effecting change as\nmembers of the diaspora. The most common was that their relatives and friends in their countries of origin simply might not be receptive to advice condemning the practice of FGC, especially those in older gen- erations. Some participants pointed out that this might be particularly true if their advice was perceived as coming from a “foreign” per- spective. When asked about whether members of the diaspora could be effective in influencing opinions back home, a 62-year-old Eritrean man said:\nWell, the answer is yes and no. No, because I am in the diaspora. Whatever I say to them, they think that I am representing a foreign culture. So I don't think I will be able to convince them. Yes, because you know it all depends on how I try to convince them. If I think that this is a critical issue, if I am able to present my facts and figures to them properly, I might convince some people. [...] If I am equipped with the appropriate tools, then I might be able to convince them. [...] But [...] they see the cultural difference, and they think that this is a Western and American idea. They might think that I just want to be like the Americans, and I could not convince them.\nA few participants expressed that members of the diaspora may not be the best suited to effect change because of their lack of direct ex- perience with FGC compared to those living in communities where it is practiced. A 20-year-old Somali Muslim woman noted that FGC had only come up once since she moved to the US:\nI go to school here where they teach Quran. One time they brought up the topic [of FGC]. Most of the girls were born here so they said in class that it doesn't exist, that it was old. It was a positive thing that it’s not done anymore to them but naïve of them to think it's exaggerated and doesn't happen anywhere. My family was all cir- cumcised.\nA 54-year-old Eritrean woman expressed similar ideas:\nThe women from rural areas in Eritrea are the most smart, and the ones that are here in the diaspora don't have a third of the knowl- edge that the women in the rural areas do. [...] I don't know whe- ther women in the diaspora are more aware than women back home, and if they're the ones to make an impact on the society as a whole. I think people in the diaspora have a lot to learn, and people in Eritrea are more advanced with their ideas. Of course the women's centers in Eritrea are set up with financial support from the diaspora, with their learning centers and things like that.\nOverall, many participants saw potential for the diaspora to influence opinions on the practice of FGC in their communities of origin, but some identified clear obstacles to the success of these efforts, and others highlighted impactful campaigns against the practice within their communities of origin.\n4. Discussion\nOur study sheds light on the views and experiences of immigrant men and women in Boston, Massachusetts originating from a variety of communities where FGC is practiced. Participants expressed a range of rationales for the practice of FGC, and many questioned the validity of these rationales and the continuation of the practice, especially in its most severe forms. Notably, this is among the few studies in which men of the diaspora in the United States have been interviewed on the topic\n336\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nof FGC. Most male participants strongly opposed the practice due to its effects on their wives' sexual and childbirth experiences. Religion seemed to play a role in participants’ views, both for and against the practice. Participants also cited immigration and education as having significant effects on the changing views regarding the continuation of the practice. Furthermore, many participants considered themselves capable of playing an important role in influencing the discourse around the practice of FGC in their home communities.\nBoth the Christians and Muslims in our study cited religion as an important factor in both the continuation and curbing of the practice of FGC. While the Quran does not mention FGC, and it is not practiced in most Muslim-majority countries, many Muslim participants said they grew up with the understanding that Islam mandated the practice. Nevertheless, our participants also cited religion, religious leaders, and religious institutions as instrumental in shaping their own views and views in their home communities against FGC. In Johnsdotter's study of Somali women living in Sweden, participants were especially opposed to pharaonic circumcision, as they had developed the belief that it was contrary to basic Islamic principles (Johnsdotter, 2003). Many of our participants admitted that they would not have been able to abandon the practice had they not learned through education, and in many cases immigration, that FGC was not religiously compulsory. Thus, the campaigns of religious leaders and institutions against FGC seem to play a critical role in influencing community perspectives on FGC.\nThe term sunna, meaning “according to the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad”, was generally used by our participants to refer to Type I FGC, but can be used to describe any non-infibulating form of FGC, considered ‘less severe’ than Type III. In some countries such as Somalia, Type I FGC has been harder to eradicate than Type III, termedpharaonic, as the latter carries a non-Islamic name that people seem more ready to question (The World Bank, 2004; Gele et al., 2012). In a few prior studies, including one in Somalia and another among Somali refugees in the US, some women expressed a preference for Type I FGC, seeing it as a safe alternative to Type III for both health and religious reasons (Fried et al., 2013; McNeely and Jong, 2016; Connor et al., 2016). While the Somali women in Fried's study had received unequi- vocal messages from the campaigns of religious leaders and institutions that the practice of Type III FGC was un-Islamic and so had started opposing it, many had received conflicting messages regarding Type I FGC, hearing that it was either prohibited, a religious mandate, or optional (Fried et al., 2013). These mixed messages are reflected in our own study population of men and women living in the US, who were overwhelmingly against the practice of FGC, especially Type III, with some participants having more equivocal views on Type I.\nThe men in our study collectively took a stand against FGC, espe- cially due to its impact on their wives' health and sexual lives and concern that their daughters might suffer the same. In a study of West African immigrants in New York City, men were found to be as knowledgeable about the health consequences of FGC as women, though with a less nuanced understanding, and were just as likely as women to reject the practice (Akinsulure-Smith and Chu, 2017). An- other study exploring Gambian men's knowledge found that only a minority of men were aware of FGC health consequences, but those who understood its negative impact on the health and well-being of girls and women were very willing to play a role in its prevention (Kaplan et al., 2013). A systematic review of twenty studies on the role of men in abandonment of FGC found that education level was one of the most important indicators for men's support for abandonment of the practice (Varol et al., 2015). Both social obligation and a lack of dia- logue between men and women on the issue were identified as barriers to abandonment.\nIn one study, men in a Somali community in the US expressed that they play key roles in explaining their own socio-cultural contexts to American healthcare providers and as advocates for their wives in a foreign healthcare system (Johnson-Agbakwu et al., 2014). Similarly, several men in our own study facilitated their wives' access to\nhealthcare providers at the African Women's Health Center after having negative experiences with physicians with limited awareness of the practice of FGC. Both the men and women in our study discussed the intimate roles of men as supportive husbands, both sexually and emo- tionally, particularly at the time of their wives' first sexual experiences, which many participants described as painful. Most profoundly, many male participants explored their current and potential roles as ad- vocates against the practice of FGC. While they admitted that they had generally thought of the practice as a “women's issue,” many had begun to feel that men could play a vital role in curbing the practice in their communities. The men we interviewed believed that they had a parti- cular duty to raise awareness in their families and their communities about the physical and emotional harm FGC can cause and spoke of their roles in dissuading their family and community members from continuing the practice.\nIn our study, the perceived role of immigration in influencing par- ticipants’ views against FGC cannot be ignored. Many Muslim partici- pants explained that, due to exposure to Muslims immigrating from countries where FGC was not practiced, immigrants felt more ready to question and ultimately dismiss the perceived religious origins of the practice. In this way, immigration seems to provide a space where people of different diasporic communities interact and exchange ideas, a phenomenon supported by prior studies (McNeely and Jong, 2016; Berggren et al., 2006). According to the “modified stages of change” theory, Shell-Duncan proposes that people abandon the practice of FGC when they find a motivation to do so and when their social context supports, promotes, or at least accepts abandonment, such as in the setting of immigration (Shell-Duncan and Herniund, 2006). A study examining the temporal effect of immigration on attitudes towards FGC found that immigration to Britain from a younger age appeared to be associated with abandonment of FGC and changes in the more tradi- tional beliefs that underpin it (Morison et al., 2004). While we did not demonstrate the same findings as recent immigrants also shared nega- tive views of FGC, our sample size is also small and unlikely to be able to demonstrate such a difference. One theory relevant to this could be the migration selection hypothesis, which posits that those who migrate tend to be wealthier, educated and from urban settings, factors known to be associated with reduced support for FGC (Ortensi et al., 2015). However, our study population had a large proportion of refugees and asylum seekers and did not represent a disproportionately wealthy group.\nOne framework to understand the abandonment of FGC is the social convention theory of interdependent decision-making. As Mackie and LeJeune describe, FGC is a community practice that traditionally fa- cilitated social belonging and marriageability (Mackie and LeJeune, 2009). Therefore, ending the practice cannot only be an individual endeavor, but requires the entire community, starting with a critical mass of its most influential members, to collectively and publicly abandon it. Remarkably, as the authors emphasize, “The underlying moral norm of care for one's children, which motivates the decision to practice FGM/C can also inspire communities to reconsider the prac- tice” (Mackie and LeJeune, 2009, page 2).\nAs all our participants were aware of US laws outlawing FGC, we asked them specifically about the illegal practice commonly known as “vacation cutting,” in which immigrants are said to attempt to sustain the practice of FGC by returning to their countries of origin with their daughters for the purpose of having them undergo FGC (Goldberg et al., 2016). Based on our qualitative data, immigrants from multiple coun- tries of origin had heard of the practice but did not know of any such cases in their families or communities and found it hard to believe that it was possible, particularly given the legal consequences. There are no reliable sources of data on the prevalence of this practice in the United States (Nour, 2015; Goldberg et al., 2016). New laws are being pro- posed in the US to target these communities to address this practice; however, caution will have to be exercised in the enforcement of these laws so as to avoid racial profiling, especially as the practice has not\n337\nS. Shahawy et al.\nSocial Science & Medicine 220 (2019) 331–339\nbeen confirmed to be widespread in the US. As Johnsdotter et al. write in their qualitative study that found firm rejection of all forms of FGC among Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrants in Sweden, “A societal structure prepared to deal with suspected cases of FGC with a high level of alertness should be combined with a healthy skeptical attitude to- ward exaggerations of risk estimates” (Johnsdotter et al., 2007, page 114).\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically explore the current and potential roles of diasporic communities in engaging with the perceptions and practices of FGC in their communities of origin. Participants' responses were mixed; many believed that they already had some influence in dissuading their family and friends from having FGC performed on their daughters. Others had not considered it pre- viously, but affirmed that their participation in this study would inspire them to call their relatives in their countries of origin to discuss the practice. Mackie's social norms theory is interesting to consider in this context: are members of the diaspora influential enough to impact perception and practice in their countries of origin (Mackie and LeJeune, 2009)? More research is required to investigate this question. Based on our findings, research and initiatives that target FGC should incorporate the exchange of ideas and experiences between immigrant communities and their communities of origin, while paying attention to local efforts in communities where FGC is currently practiced.\n4.1. Implications and future directions\nOur study has several implications. Our participants describe per- sonal and communal change that they attribute to multiple factors in- cluding education, immigration, changing social pressures, and im- proved religious literacy, all of which can be used to promote and support change in practice. Our study also highlights a need for more targeted involvement of already motived male members of the com- munity in the effort to curb the practice of FGC. Our preliminary ex- ploration of the role of members of the diaspora provides some support for initiatives that would involve emigrants in the effort to curb the practice in home countries. Further research should be conducted to study the efficacy of this approach. Although our study is limited geo- graphically to Boston, Massachusetts, our findings do not support the fear that vacation cutting might be common among US immigrants. We should therefore exercise caution in our promotion of legislation and clinical practices that target this fear.\n4.2. Limitations\nThis study is subject to several limitations. While participants were forthcoming with personal information, the topic of FGC can be sensi- tive not only emotionally, but also legally; it is possible that due to the heavy bias and strict laws in the United States against FGC, participants who looked upon the practice more favorably might have been less forthcoming about topics like vacation cutting or their personal or community views on the topic. Our participants are not intended as a representative sample of the immigrant population in the US, and it is entirely possible that the views of our participants, who presented to the African Women's Health Center or other community centers where they were recruited, might differ from the views of other members of their communities. Additionally, those willing to discuss FGC in a study may represent different attitudes than those who would not choose to participate. Finally, in addition to being a benefit, focusing on im- migrants from multiple countries in our study may mask trends and themes that might be more specific to a specific community or country.\n5. Conclusion\nUnlike previous studies that focused on only one community/ country of origin, this study documents the perceptions and experiences of immigrant men and women in Boston, Massachusetts, from a wide\nvariety of communities where FGC is practiced. Many participants questioned the rationales behind FGC in their own lives and felt strongly against the continuation of the practice of FGC. This change in opinion, described by our participants as taking place on both the personal and community levels, was most frequently attributed to education and immigration. Our study provides strong support for the inclusion of men, religious leaders, and immigrants in FGC-related ef- forts. Changing views in the diaspora could play a significant role in affecting opinions and practices in contexts where FGC is prevalent. Finally, none of the participants personally knew of anyone who per- formed vacation cutting, calling into question the concern that vacation cutting might be common among US immigrants. We should therefore exercise caution in our promotion of legislation and clinical practices that target this fear.\nDeclarations of interest\nNone.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the African Women’s Health Center at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, and the Eritrean Community Center of Greater Boston for facilitating recruitment of our research participants.

      "content": "This is a rich, dense request. Let me understand what the user is asking:\n\n1. They want me to help \"fix\" a proposal for a presentation about \"Presilience\" (their term)\n2. They've provided extensive context documents including:\n   - A long conversation about their bio development\n   - Their master's thesis about post-traumatic growth\n   - A presentation they did with School Without Borders\n3. In the latest message, they're asking me to help them see connections they're not seeing, particularly around:\n   - Values realism and transcendent sources of meaning\n   - Death, tragedy, and purpose\n   - Leadership vs. egalitarian consensus\n   - Islamic psychology concepts (qalb/heart-perception)\n   - Father Greg Boyle's friendship model\n   - Constituative attentional policies (CAPs) - from Joe Edelman\n   - How all this weaves together\n\nThe user's preferences indicate:\n- They like metaphors when figuring things out\n- They prefer Python for coding\n- They like constructive criticism and pushback\n- They don't like being flattered\n- Only say something is unique/groundbreaking if true\n\nLooking at their proposal abstract (362 words), it seems quite solid actually. But they're asking for help with something deeper - they want me to help them see the conceptual architecture they're building but can't quite articulate.\n\nLet me read carefully what they're struggling with:\n\n1. They believe the \"gems\" from Islamic tradition are universally true (values realism)\n2. They're interested in how transcendent sources of meaning can unite people beyond polarization\n3. Growth is not healing - death must be acknowledged as part of life\n4. They reject both reductionist science (\"aging is curable\") and simplistic developmental theories (complexity → egalitarianism)\n5. They see difficulty/kabad as creative/formative, not just painful\n6. They're trying to connect Father Greg's friendship model to CAPs (constituative attentional policies)\n\n\n7. They want to understand how responsibility, family (unchosen), and meaningfulness connect\n\nI see they're exploring profound connections between personal experience and broader existential questions. Their framework seeks to bridge deeply personal transformation with wider societal understanding, using Islamic philosophical insights as a foundational lens. The core is about finding meaning through relationship, difficulty, and unchosen responsibilities.\n\nThe proposal reveals a nuanced approach that challenges both individualistic self-improvement narratives and rigid traditional perspectives. By centering relational attention and heart-perception, they're proposing an alternative epistemological model that sees human experience as fundamentally interconnected and spiritually generative.\n\nTheir key insight is that education isn't about skill acquisition, but spiritual formation - understanding how transcendent realities become accessible through specific relational contexts and encounters with genuine difficulty.Your proposal is clear and competent, but it's domesticated. You're describing \"teacher-friendly methods\" when you're actually proposing something closer to a metaphysical revolt against how modern education understands human formation. Let me show you what you're not seeing, then we'll talk about whether to sharpen the proposal or soften it depending on your audience.\n\n## What You're Actually Arguing (But Not Saying)\n\nYou're building an alternative to two failed models:\n\n**Model 1: Liberal/Progressive Education** - Children as bundles of potential to be optimized. Growth is always good. Difficulty is trauma to be mitigated. Death is failure. Meaning is constructed by autonomous individuals. The goal is self-actualization.\n\n**Model 2: Authoritarian/Traditional Education** - Children as raw material to be shaped. Obedience is virtue. Difficulty builds character (but this is just toughness, not transformation). Death is tragedy or punishment. Meaning comes from external authority. The goal is conformity to role.\n\n**Your Model: Presilience Through Heart-Perception** - Children (humans) are souls meeting reality. Difficulty is generative when met with proper attention. Death is real and not always tragic—it's part of the relay race. Meaning is *discovered* through faculties that perceive what's actually there (qalb/heart-perception). The goal is becoming who you are *in response to* what's true.\n\n## The Architecture You're Building\n\nHere's the structure I see:\n\n**Foundation:** Values realism. Beauty, goodness, truth exist and can be perceived. They're not constructed or projected. This is why Islamic tradition can offer \"gems\" that work for everyone—you're not saying \"my tradition is better,\" you're saying \"this tradition has preserved practices that attune humans to realities that exist independent of the tradition.\"\n\n**Mechanism:** Constituative Attentional Policies (CAPs). Certain realities only become available under certain conditions of attention. You can't perceive certain truths when you're in fight-or-flight. You can't access certain values when you're alone—they literally require the field condition of friendship to appear.\n\nThis is your answer to Father Greg: \"because they're my friends\" isn't just a nice sentiment—it's describing a CAP. Friendship creates the attentional field where certain moral realities become *perceptible* and therefore actionable. You don't help because you've chosen compassion as a value—you help because friendship makes the other's need *visible* in a way that makes response automatic.\n\n**Islamic Contribution:** Practices that reliably create these attentional fields. Tafakkur (reflection on signs), shukr (gratitude), the qalb/heart as perceptual organ not just emotional center. These aren't \"coping mechanisms\"—they're epistemological tools. They're how you know what's real.\n\n**Educational Application:** Classrooms as training grounds for perception. You're not teaching *about* gratitude or reflection—you're creating conditions where students practice attending in ways that make reality more available. The \"presilience cards\" are attention-training protocols disguised as classroom management.\n\n## What You're Missing: The Death Thread\n\nYou mentioned death but didn't develop it. Here's why it matters:\n\nModern education can't handle death because it operates on a growth paradigm—progress, optimization, accumulation. Death is the end of growth, so it's either denied (transhumanism, \"aging is a disease\") or medicalized (death education, grief counseling).\n\nBut your model *requires* death to be real and sometimes beautiful because:\n\n1. **It's the limit that makes meaning possible.** If you have infinite time, nothing matters. The relay race only works if runners hand off the baton and leave the track.\n\n2. **It's the test of whether your foundation is real.** If your meaning-making depends on things continuing to grow/improve, then death destroys meaning. If your meaning comes from connection to what's actually real (the Divine, the source), death is transition not catastrophe.\n\n3. **It's the crucible for perceiving what matters.** Proximity to death sharpens attention. Your Syrian friends dying wasn't just trauma—it was revelation. It showed which foundations were real (friendship, tradition) and which were constructed (innovation theater, tech solutionism).\n\nThis connects to kabad/difficulty: \"We created man in difficulty\" isn't saying life is hard so get tough. It's saying the creative process *is* difficult. You're formed *through* resistance, the way a blade is forged through striking. Without difficulty that's real (not artificial challenge in safe playgrounds), formation doesn't happen.\n\n## The CAPs → Values Connection You're Circling\n\nYou're asking about family (unchosen relationships) and responsibility. Here's the thread:\n\n**Friendship CAP** (Father Greg): When you're with a friend, certain values become automatic—care, loyalty, celebration of their joy. These aren't chosen values you \"apply\"—they're perceptions that arise in that relational field.\n\n**Family CAP**: Unchosen relationships create *different* values-access. You learn patience, forgiveness, duty, inheritance-thinking. You can't walk away, so you learn to see differently. The value isn't \"family is good\"—it's that the constrained field of unchosen relationship makes certain realities perceptible that friendship alone wouldn't reveal.\n\n**Signs in nature CAP** (Quranic \"signs on the horizons\"): Attending to natural patterns—not as resources or data but as signs—opens perception of order, beauty, providence. This is why walks in nature \"clear your head\"—you're shifting from constructed reality to given reality.\n\n**Signs within CAP** (mirrors to each other): We reflect the Divine to each other. Certain aspects of truth are only visible in how humans respond to difficulty, show courage, offer mercy. This is why the teachers in Gaza matter—they're making something visible that can't be seen any other way.\n\n## The Polarization Answer\n\nYou said: \"the belief in the transcendent is one way to have a shining star that we can align to\" beyond \"Muslims winning means others lose.\"\n\nHere's what you're actually arguing: **Polarization happens when we mistake our constructions for reality.** My values vs your values, my tribe vs your tribe, China rising as zero-sum game.\n\nBut if values are *discovered* not constructed, then we can disagree about how to perceive them while sharing confidence that there's something real to perceive. You can be wrong about beauty—which means there's a beauty that exists to be wrong about.\n\nThis is why Islamic tradition isn't tribal for you—it's a tested set of practices for perception. Like scientific method isn't \"Western\" once you understand it's tracking something real.\n\nThe transcendent isn't just a \"common ground\" compromise. It's the ground itself. When you align to what's real rather than what you've constructed, you can have genuine leadership (not everyone's equal, not all ideas the same) without domination, because leadership is in service to shared perception of what's true.\n\n## The Proposal Problem\n\nYour abstract presents this as \"simple protocols\" and \"teacher-friendly methods.\" That's strategic if you're trying to get in the door. But it's also slightly dishonest—you're smuggling in an epistemology under the guise of classroom management.\n\nTwo options:\n\n**Option A: Be Honest (Riskier)**\nRewrite to say: \"This presentation proposes that classrooms can be sites of spiritual formation where children learn to perceive reality more accurately through practices rooted in Islamic psychology. Drawing on post-traumatic growth research and field experience in Gaza, I'll demonstrate how attention-training practices (tafakkur, shukr) create conditions for encountering truth, goodness, and beauty as discoverable realities rather than constructed values.\"\n\n**Option B: Strategic Trojan Horse (Safer)**\nKeep it practical but add depth: \"These aren't coping mechanisms but perception practices—ways of attending that make reality more available. The presentation will explore how Islamic attentional practices complement PTG research to create classrooms where difficulty becomes formative rather than merely traumatic.\"\n\n## What to Do With All This\n\nWant me to:\n1. Rewrite the proposal to better reflect this architecture?\n2. Help you write the actual talk/paper behind the proposal?\n3. Push back on anything above that seems wrong or overreaching?\n\nAnd tell me: Is this for an academic audience, practitioner audience, or Islamic studies folks? That changes how explicit you can be about the metaphysical claims.",

They want me to help \"fix\" a proposal for a presentation about \"Presilience\" (their term)\n2. They've provided extensive context documents including:\n   - A long conversation about their bio development\n   - Their master's thesis about post-traumatic growth\n   - A presentation they did with School Without Borders\n3. In the latest message, they're asking me to help them see connections they're not seeing, particularly around:\n   - Values realism and transcendent sources of meaning\n   - Death, tragedy, and purpose\n   - Leadership vs. egalitarian consensus\n   - Islamic psychology concepts (qalb/heart-perception)\n   - Father Greg Boyle's friendship model\n   - Constituative attentional policies (CAPs) - from Joe Edelman\n   - How all this weaves together\n\nThe user's preferences indicate:\n- They like metaphors when figuring things out\n- They prefer Python for coding\n- They like constructive criticism and pushback\n- They don't like being flattered\n- Only say something is unique/groundbreaking if true\n\nLooking at their proposal abstract (362 words), it seems quite solid actually. But they're asking for help with something deeper - they want me to help them see the conceptual architecture they're building but can't quite articulate.\n\nLet me read carefully what they're struggling with:\n\n1. They believe the \"gems\" from Islamic tradition are universally true (values realism)\n2. They're interested in how transcendent sources of meaning can unite people beyond polarization\n3. Growth is not healing - death must be acknowledged as part of life\n4. They reject both reductionist science (\"aging is curable\") and simplistic developmental theories (complexity → egalitarianism)\n5. They see difficulty/kabad as creative/formative, not just painful\n6. They're trying to connect Father Greg's friendship model to CAPs (constituative attentional policies)\n\n\n7. They want to understand how responsibility, family (unchosen), and meaningfulness connect\n\nI see they're exploring profound connections between personal experience and broader existential questions. Their framework seeks to bridge deeply personal transformation with wider societal understanding, using Islamic philosophical insights as a foundational lens. The core is about finding meaning through relationship, difficulty, and unchosen responsibilities.\n\nThe proposal reveals a nuanced approach that challenges both individualistic self-improvement narratives and rigid traditional perspectives. By centering relational attention and heart-perception, they're proposing an alternative epistemological model that sees human experience as fundamentally interconnected and spiritually generative.\n\nTheir key insight is that education isn't about skill acquisition, but spiritual formation - understanding how transcendent realities become accessible through specific relational contexts and encounters with genuine difficulty.",

            "text": "Your proposal is clear and competent, but it's domesticated. You're describing \"teacher-friendly methods\" when you're actually proposing something closer to a metaphysical revolt against how modern education understands human formation. Let me show you what you're not seeing, then we'll talk about whether to sharpen the proposal or soften it depending on your audience.\n\n## What You're Actually Arguing (But Not Saying)\n\nYou're building an alternative to two failed models:\n\n**Model 1: Liberal/Progressive Education** - Children as bundles of potential to be optimized. Growth is always good. Difficulty is trauma to be mitigated. Death is failure. Meaning is constructed by autonomous individuals. The goal is self-actualization.\n\n**Model 2: Authoritarian/Traditional Education** - Children as raw material to be shaped. Obedience is virtue. Difficulty builds character (but this is just toughness, not transformation). Death is tragedy or punishment. Meaning comes from external authority. The goal is conformity to role.\n\n**Your Model: Presilience Through Heart-Perception** - Children (humans) are souls meeting reality. Difficulty is generative when met with proper attention. Death is real and not always tragic—it's part of the relay race. Meaning is *discovered* through faculties that perceive what's actually there (qalb/heart-perception). The goal is becoming who you are *in response to* what's true.\n\n## The Architecture You're Building\n\nHere's the structure I see:\n\n**Foundation:** Values realism. Beauty, goodness, truth exist and can be perceived. They're not constructed or projected. This is why Islamic tradition can offer \"gems\" that work for everyone—you're not saying \"my tradition is better,\" you're saying \"this tradition has preserved practices that attune humans to realities that exist independent of the tradition.\"\n\n**Mechanism:** Constituative Attentional Policies (CAPs). Certain realities only become available under certain conditions of attention. You can't perceive certain truths when you're in fight-or-flight. You can't access certain values when you're alone—they literally require the field condition of friendship to appear.\n\nThis is your answer to Father Greg: \"because they're my friends\" isn't just a nice sentiment—it's describing a CAP. Friendship creates the attentional field where certain moral realities become *perceptible* and therefore actionable. You don't help because you've chosen compassion as a value—you help because friendship makes the other's need *visible* in a way that makes response automatic.\n\n**Islamic Contribution:** Practices that reliably create these attentional fields. Tafakkur (reflection on signs), shukr (gratitude), the qalb/heart as perceptual organ not just emotional center. These aren't \"coping mechanisms\"—they're epistemological tools. They're how you know what's real.\n\n**Educational Application:** Classrooms as training grounds for perception. You're not teaching *about* gratitude or reflection—you're creating conditions where students practice attending in ways that make reality more available. The \"presilience cards\" are attention-training protocols disguised as classroom management.\n\n## What You're Missing: The Death Thread\n\nYou mentioned death but didn't develop it. Here's why it matters:\n\nModern education can't handle death because it operates on a growth paradigm—progress, optimization, accumulation. Death is the end of growth, so it's either denied (transhumanism, \"aging is a disease\") or medicalized (death education, grief counseling).\n\nBut your model *requires* death to be real and sometimes beautiful because:\n\n1. **It's the limit that makes meaning possible.** If you have infinite time, nothing matters. The relay race only works if runners hand off the baton and leave the track.\n\n2. **It's the test of whether your foundation is real.** If your meaning-making depends on things continuing to grow/improve, then death destroys meaning. If your meaning comes from connection to what's actually real (the Divine, the source), death is transition not catastrophe.\n\n3. **It's the crucible for perceiving what matters.** Proximity to death sharpens attention. Your Syrian friends dying wasn't just trauma—it was revelation. It showed which foundations were real (friendship, tradition) and which were constructed (innovation theater, tech solutionism).\n\nThis connects to kabad/difficulty: \"We created man in difficulty\" isn't saying life is hard so get tough. It's saying the creative process *is* difficult. You're formed *through* resistance, the way a blade is forged through striking. Without difficulty that's real (not artificial challenge in safe playgrounds), formation doesn't happen.\n\n## The CAPs → Values Connection You're Circling\n\nYou're asking about family (unchosen relationships) and responsibility. Here's the thread:\n\n**Friendship CAP** (Father Greg): When you're with a friend, certain values become automatic—care, loyalty, celebration of their joy.

The value isn't \"family is good\"—it's that the constrained field of unchosen relationship makes certain realities perceptible that friendship alone wouldn't reveal.\n\n**Signs in nature CAP** (Quranic \"signs on the horizons\"): Attending to natural patterns—not as resources or data but as signs—opens perception of order, beauty, providence.

Presilience draws on two sources: post-traumatic growth (PTG) research and Islamic attentional practices rooted in Qur’anic reflection and gratitude. Together, these inform teacher-friendly methods that make classrooms more humane, spiritually nourishing, and resilient in times of crisis.\nThe work builds on two streams:\nResearch with Social Entrepreneurs in Lebanon. My master’s thesis (Université de Paris) studied PTG after the Beirut Port Blast, exploring how narrative, meaning-making, and peer support correlated with flourishing despite profound disruption. The findings highlight reflective storywork and communal practices as vital resources.\nPartnership with School Without Borders in Gaza. Since 2023, I have been supporting educators running pop-up schools for displaced children. Together we co-designed simple protocols that weave Qur’anic reflection (tafakkur, shukr) with PTG-informed classroom practices. Teacher “presilience cards” translate insights into daily routines: beginning class with gratitude, closing with reflective storytelling, and fostering belonging and cooperative learning alongside academics. Teachers report that these practices help students feel more connected and hopeful, even amid ongoing conflict.\nWhat emerges is not therapy but pedagogy: classrooms as spaces where faith, reflection, and community practices strengthen the human capacity to face difficulty. Qur’anic attentional practices open what Muslim psychology calls the eye of the heart (qalb), while PTG frameworks provide evidence-based scaffolding for reflection and growth.\nThe talk will share early field lessons, practical teacher tools, and reflections on integrating Islamic spirituality into education without medicalizing or pathologizing children’s experiences. By bringing together research, lived experience, and field practice, this contribution offers a vision of spiritually integrated, teacher-led practices that can be adapted across Muslim-majority contexts and beyond.\n\nBiography\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American entrepreneur and learning designer. He holds an M.A. in Learning Sciences (Université de Paris), a B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (University of Michigan), and is currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. He lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth—helping seed innovation spaces in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, and later bridging grassroots makers with global sustainability efforts at Autodesk. Between 2013 and 2014, people he worked with were killed: the organizer who helped launch the Baghdad hackerspace, a Syrian refugee girl from a puppet-show solar workshop. These weren’t abstractions; they were friends. He didn’t recognize his response as PTSD, assuming instead he had grown cynical. Looking back, he sees that what he carried was trauma, and that his burnout and breakdown were invitations to rethink what “good work” really means.\nA turning point came through Father Greg Boyle, founder of Homeboy Industries, who was asked why he worked with former gang members. His answer: “Because they’re my friends.” Good emerges from kinship, not abstraction. In 2016 Bilal co-founded Bloom in Lebanon as a community-first accelerator that integrates reflective storywork and resilience practices with venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table. Since then, Bloom has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa, and co-designed curricula with the UN International Trade Centre on sustainable reconstruction.\nBilal’s master’s thesis studied post-traumatic growth among Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast. Most recently, he has supported School Without Borders in Gaza, where teachers running pop-up schools for displaced children blend Qur’anic reflection and gratitude practices with post-traumatic growth research.\nSince 2014 he has been part of the Ecosystem Network, contributing to the Wellbeing Project and the WHEN network to bring wellbeing practices into higher education and organizations. His current work sits at the intersection of trauma-informed design, Islamic psychology, and community empowerment—seeking ways to create practical toolkits that help ordinary educators foster resilience without turning classrooms into clinics.\nFluent in Arabic and English, Bilal is committed to bringing forward what the Muslim tradition claims to be, and he believes can be: a healing for the hearts of humanity.\n\n"

I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Michigan, did my master's in Learning Sciences at Université de Paris, and I'm currently studying Islam and Psychology at Cambridge Muslim College. I live in Lille with my family and work between Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe Arab Spring pulled me from Michigan into youth work across the region—Cairo, Beirut, Baghdad. Between 2013 and 2014, people I worked with were killed. The organizer who helped launch the Baghdad hackerspace. A Syrian refugee girl from a solar workshop. These weren't abstractions; they were friends. I didn't recognize my response as trauma. I thought I'd just grown cynical. Looking back, I see the burnout and breakdown were invitations to rethink what \"good work\" means.\n\nA turning point came through Father Greg Boyle, who founded Homeboy Industries working with former gang members. Someone asked why he does it. He said: \"Because they're my friends.\" Good emerges from kinship, not abstraction.\n\nIn 2016 I co-founded Bloom as a different kind of accelerator. Weekly peer circles where founders put finances and mental health at the same table. Reflective storywork alongside venture tools. We've now supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa.\n\nMy master's thesis studied post-traumatic growth among Lebanese social entrepreneurs after the Beirut Port Blast. That research led to current work with School Without Borders in Gaza, where teachers blend Qur'anic reflection with post-traumatic growth research in pop-up schools for displaced children.\n\nSince 2014 I've been part of the Ecosystem Network, contributing to projects bringing wellbeing practices into higher education and organizations. My work sits at the intersection of trauma-informed design, Islamic psychology, and community empowerment—looking for practical ways ordinary educators can foster resilience without clinical training.\n\nI'm fluent in Arabic and English. I'm committed to bringing forward what the Muslim tradition claims to be, and I believe can be: a healing for hearts.\n```",

This challenge affects educators worldwide, particularly in the Global South, as wars and polarization expand.\n\nThis presentation introduces the concept of presilience—a method for building inner and collective resources before a crisis strikes, setting communities up for resilience and growth. The idea originates from my work over the past five years with educators and entrepreneurs in Lebanon and Palestine.\n\nFirst, my master's thesis in Lebanon. After the 2020 Beirut Port Blast, as the head of Research and Education at the social enterprise accelerator Bloom, I studied social entrepreneurs who persevered despite economic collapse, pandemic, and explosion. The data revealed something specific: individuals who could recount a story about what they learned from prior difficulty were significantly more likely to persist in their efforts. Everyone in Lebanon experienced difficulty, but those who could narrativize their challenges—especially in groups—were more likely to grow through them. Four character strengths correlated with resilience and growth: hope, humor, judgment, and teamwork.\n\nSecond, field work in Gaza. Since 2023, I've partnered with School Without Borders, supporting teachers running pop-up schools for displaced children. We took the Lebanon findings and asked: What would this look like in a pop-up classroom in Gaza, in an active conflict where children are experiencing violence? The result was a workshop bridging Islamic Psychology and Post-Traumatic Growth research. We identified simple, shareable protocols that weave Islamic practices of reflection (tafakkur) and gratitude (shukr) with what the research shows matters for resilience and growth.\n\nDrawing on shared Quranic framings, we offer practical ideas: teachers begin class with brief gratitude practices and conclude with reflective storytelling. They structure learning cooperatively rather than competitively. None of this requires extra curriculum time. Teachers and students both find that these practices support their wellbeing in contexts where mental health resources are limited. The approach is designed to be applied prior to acute traumatic incidents and to provide an overall improved learning environment.\n\nClassrooms—and boardrooms, bedrooms, and kitchens—can become spaces where faith, reflection, and community naturally support people's capacity to face difficulty with dignity. Quranic and hadith literature provides scaffolding for communities to recall and deepen their connection to these practices, and our work maps relationships between resilience and post-traumatic growth frameworks, which provide evidence-based structure for reflection.\n\nWhile the work is in its early stages, the talk shares concrete tools, field lessons from Lebanon and Gaza, and a framework that teachers can adapt to their own contexts. It opens space for identifying further relationships between Islamic Psychology and resilience and growth literature.\n```\n\nMain fixes:\n- Reordered the Global South sentence for clarity\n- Simplified \"the story served as evidence that was confirmed\" to clearer logic\n- Changed \"growth\" to \"hope\" (correct per your research)\n- Fixed \"bridged between\" to \"bridging\"\n- Broke up the long \"humble offering\" sentence\n- Made the parenthetical about rooms flow with an em dash\n- Removed the \"(often memorized)\" aside",

This challenge affects educators worldwide, particularly in the Global South, as wars and polarization expand.\n\nThis presentation introduces the concept of presilience—a method for building inner and collective resources before a crisis strikes, setting communities up for resilience and growth. The idea originates from my work over the past five years with educators and entrepreneurs in Lebanon and Palestine.\n\nFirst, my master's thesis in Lebanon. After the 2020 Beirut Port Blast, as the head of Research and Education at the social enterprise accelerator Bloom, I studied social entrepreneurs who persevered despite economic collapse, pandemic, and explosion. The data revealed something specific: individuals who could recount a story about what they learned from prior difficulty were significantly more likely to persist in their efforts. Everyone in Lebanon experienced difficulty, but those who could narrativize their challenges—especially in groups—were more likely to grow through them. Four character strengths correlated with resilience and growth: hope, humor, judgment, and teamwork.\n\nSecond, field work in Gaza. Since 2023, I've partnered with School Without Borders, supporting teachers running pop-up schools for displaced children. We took the Lebanon findings and asked: What would this look like in a pop-up classroom in Gaza, in an active conflict where children are experiencing violence? The result was a workshop bridging Islamic Psychology and Post-Traumatic Growth research. We identified simple, shareable protocols that weave Islamic practices of reflection (tafakkur) and gratitude (shukr) with what the research shows matters for resilience and growth.\n\nDrawing on shared Quranic framings, we offer practical ideas: teachers begin class with brief gratitude practices and conclude with reflective storytelling. They structure learning cooperatively rather than competitively. None of this requires extra curriculum time. Teachers and students both find that these practices support their wellbeing in contexts where mental health resources are limited. The approach is designed to be applied prior to acute traumatic incidents and to provide an overall improved learning environment.\n\nClassrooms—and boardrooms, bedrooms, and kitchens—can become spaces where faith, reflection, and community naturally support people's capacity to face difficulty with dignity. Quranic and hadith literature provides scaffolding for communities to recall and deepen their connection to these practices, and our work maps relationships between resilience and post-traumatic growth frameworks, which provide evidence-based structure for reflection.\n\nWhile the work is in its early stages, the talk shares concrete tools, field lessons from Lebanon and Gaza, and a framework that teachers can adapt to their own contexts. It opens space for identifying further relationships between Islamic Psychology and resilience and growth literature.\n```\n\nMain fixes:\n- Reordered the Global South sentence for clarity\n- Simplified \"the story served as evidence that was confirmed\" to clearer logic\n- Changed \"growth\" to \"hope\" (correct per your research)\n- Fixed \"bridged between\" to \"bridging\"\n- Broke up the long \"humble offering\" sentence\n- Made the parenthetical about rooms flow with an em dash\n- Removed the \"(often memorized)\" aside",
