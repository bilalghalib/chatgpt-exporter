Some places to draw inspiration that I can think of are names of tools that scholars used that also work as a person's name, the names of scholar helpers or assistants, the name of locations or schools. If you can think of really good names that are more modern, that'd be OK too, we don't have to restrict ourselves to the golden age of the middle east. Don't translate the words to English, keeping them in their original arabic language would be cool (I can read and speak arabic).\n\nHere's an example of a bot name that we used in the past for a similar, but different, community: \"Tahseen\" (تحسين), which is a person's name and it means improvement. People loved that name and they started addressing the bot as if it were a person. Everybody loved Tahseen.\n\nI'd like a name that people would have heard and can love. Something that is salient.",
