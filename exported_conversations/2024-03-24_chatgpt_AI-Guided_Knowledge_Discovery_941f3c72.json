      "content": "I have some thoughts on a method for prompting that I think can help people learn things they don't know they need tolearn. i need help describing it simply for a highschool level audience in a one pager. Here's my content so far:\nyet none of them seem to have gotten expand and contract or the idea that we can see in the dark by navigating using ai to places we don't know how to go to with key words like \"neil postman\" and then asking what neil postman would think about AI because then we get to shine al ight on all his work as relates to another concept he didn't see yet. The navigation through prompting and using langugae to guide us to a place between two points. Let's say you know something about educaiton, you know there's a school where people learn how to become teachers. You know another thing - schools have books and famous educators that teach. With these two knowledge points you can imagine that there's a space in a coordinate space where you can place them and between them is a lot of things you don't know anything about - specifically what kind of books do people study in the school where teachers learn to be teachers. you don't know the word pedagogy, yet you'll discover it there. this is how you can use the points in the coordinate space of things you understand to ifnd the things you don't. the technique to uncover it is to then use language and conversation to \"talk things into existence into the light\" by asking the ai to ask you the things that a person who goes to school to learn to be a teacher might need to know - or to ask it to go to that space and find 10 diverse thinkers in that field who might disagree with each other, to expand into the vector space and then offer the person the ability to see/think/select from that space based on curiosity and current understanding. So both talking and selection based on curiosity helps narrow, the AI's job is to elucidate the unseen and help guide further out into dark areas the users job is to narrow and specifiy and select what's useful and to take things out of the system when they're done. it should feel like a gym, like a brain workout. And then they should make NEW knowledge that's the third step. Go into dark with AI between two points, bring into light by selection or answering questions, and then making thinking tools like journal entrees or workplans or workbooks to fill in and make NEW knowledge not in the map. Think of our initial framework, how does what I just described align and how does it expand or bring thigns afresh. review this text in this prompt compared to the scriber framework and find the 5 things that are similar and the 5 things that are unique. List them  and make a table of similarities and differences \n\n\nSummarize your understanding and write out 3 questions that you didn't understand about it. Ask me 3 questions about it that will help you make a one pager based on this content ",

      "content": "Your method appears to focus on using AI as a navigational tool in the realm of learning and knowledge discovery. The concept is akin to exploring a dark room with a flashlight, where AI illuminates unknown areas within a vast space of information. By using specific keywords or concepts (like \"Neil Postman\" or \"pedagogy\"), the AI helps in uncovering related, yet previously unknown or unexplored information. This process involves three primary steps:\n\n1. Exploration: Using AI to venture into 'dark areas' of knowledge, guided by existing knowledge points.\n2. Illumination and Selection: Bringing new information into 'light' by engaging in a dialogue with AI, allowing it to ask questions and suggest diverse viewpoints. This step involves the user actively choosing what is relevant to them based on their curiosity and understanding.\n3. Creation: Taking the newly discovered information and using it to develop new knowledge or insights, possibly through tools like journals or work plans.\n\nYour method emphasizes the active role of the learner in narrowing down and selecting useful information, while the AI aids in expanding their perspective by illuminating unknown areas.\n\nTo better understand and help create a one-pager for a high school audience, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Could you clarify how you envision the role of the AI in terms of interaction? Is it more of a guide that suggests areas to explore, or does it actively engage in a back-and-forth dialogue with the user?\n2. How does this method help in structuring the new information that the learner discovers? Is there a specific process for organizing or integrating this new knowledge with what they already know?\n3. Regarding the creation of new knowledge, could you provide more examples or clarify what kind of output you expect from learners? Are these outputs like project ideas, essays, or something else?\n\nYour responses to these questions will help in distilling your method into a clear, concise, and engaging format suitable for high school students.",

      "content": "it's a dialog that initially is user driven and this is why I am making a set of principles because the AI engine simply waits for people to talk to it and so it needs good prompting and people don't always prompt well. They prompt for answers not questions\n2. it's like going to the dewey decimle system where you know about 550 earth sciences and 570 life sciences and you can ask the AI ... sooo uhhh what's in 560? and do that more and more granularly. It's like a Map of Everything - a fractal dewey to the last text character on a page where you can navigate with your curiosity \n3. I want people to think their own thoughts and make knowledge theirs, to internalize it. To also then go ONE level deeper in the fractal dewey decimle system where they can add their own 560.04020300000000001 and grow what's possible to be known. Socrates says we have all the knowledge of the universe within us we simply need to navigate to find it, and that implies we can add our own unique contribution to an infinitly deep map of knowledge that expands infinitely between numbers in the dewey system, AND in time. Each year there is a. new year section in the encyclopedia, new history is made, and also fundamentals are still happening. It's like the ship of Theseus. It may be the same ship in terms of rise to power and decline of nations, yet they follow fundamental princples and yet still. We can call it Theseus 2 each time it's totally rebuilt, theseus 3. so the fractal depth is ever deeper and ever longer ",

      "content": "Thank you for the clarifications. Your method involves using AI as a tool for guided exploration and dialogue in the pursuit of knowledge. The key principles include:\n\n1. Dialogue-Driven Exploration: The AI acts as a responsive guide, engaging in a user-driven dialogue that encourages curiosity and exploration. It helps users navigate through a vast knowledge map, similar to the Dewey Decimal System, but much more granular and expansive.\n\n2. Fractal Dewey Decimal System: The knowledge exploration is structured like a fractal version of the Dewey Decimal System. Users can delve into specific categories (like 560 in natural sciences) and get increasingly detailed information. This fractal approach allows for exploration down to very specific subtopics.\n\n3. Creation and Contribution: Users are encouraged to internalize and add to the knowledge they acquire, akin to adding their unique coordinates (e.g., 560.04020300000000001) to the knowledge map. This represents not just learning but also contributing to the ever-expanding domain of knowledge.\n\nBased on this, here are three questions that will further assist in creating the one-pager:\n\n1. How can we best simplify the explanation of the \"Fractal Dewey Decimal System\" for high school students, making it engaging and easy to understand?\n2. What specific examples or scenarios can we use to illustrate the process of dialogue-driven exploration with AI, especially in a high school context?\n3. How can students practically apply this method to their current studies or personal interests? Are there specific tools or platforms they should use, or is this more of a conceptual framework?\n\nYour answers to these questions will help in making the one-pager more relatable and actionable for high school students.",

Each word has an address that takes us places and two words have two different addresses and so there's a lof of unknown space between them - once we go to two places, there's a third space. The space between those two words or phrases or ideas. And we can ask chatGPT to look at the map and describe it. We can't see the map by itself. The map must be traversed to be read so we need to pick points we already know to have the MOE read everything in between those places to trigger new thoughts and new ideas to explore \n2. I asked to create a diverse panel of pedagalogical experts who disagree with eachother to critique my idea of a framework and respond to my questions - it helped me think more clearly\n3. it's a framework they're encouraged to use with chatGPT with example prompts. we'll make a chatbased version on whatsapp so they can just talk to it about their interests and see where it goes",

      "content": "The concept of a \"MicroPHD,\" centered around the guiding question \"What is a question only you can answer?\" is intriguing. It encourages learners to delve into their unique perspectives and experiences to contribute original insights. Here's a summary along with a critique:\n\n### Summary: MicroPHD Framework\n- **Core Idea:** Encourages learners to explore and articulate unique insights based on their personal experiences and knowledge.\n- **Guiding Question:** \"What is a question only you can answer?\" This prompts learners to identify and express original thoughts or solutions, drawing on their individual understanding and creativity.\n- **Application:** It's a method for learners to recognize and value their unique contributions in any field of study, potentially leading to new and original ideas or perspectives.\n- **Relation to Education:** Aligns with the future of education emphasizing individual thought, creativity, and the recognition of personal insights as valuable knowledge.\n\n### Pros:\n1. **Encourages Original Thinking:** Fosters creativity and independent thought in learners.\n2. **Personal Relevance:** Allows learners to connect learning with their personal experiences and views.\n3. **Diversity of Perspectives:** Celebrates and utilizes the varied backgrounds and experiences of learners, enriching the educational landscape.\n4. **Empowerment:** Empowers learners by validating their ability to contribute new ideas.\n5. **Critical Thinking:** Develops critical thinking skills by challenging learners to question and explore their unique understanding.\n\n### Cons:\n1. **Subjectivity:** Risk of valuing personal opinion over established facts or scientific consensus.\n2. **Validation:** Difficulty in objectively validating or assessing the 'new knowledge' created by individuals.\n3. **Scope Limitation:** Might be less effective in highly technical or fact-based fields where innovation is more incremental and based on existing knowledge.\n4. **Expertise Requirement:** Generating truly new, valuable knowledge typically requires a deep understanding of a field, which might be challenging for learners in earlier stages of education.\n5. **Pressure on Learners:** Could place undue pressure on learners to produce 'original' thoughts, potentially leading to anxiety or discouragement.\n\nYour concept of a \"MicroPHD\" embodies a progressive approach to education, focusing on individual insight as a valuable asset. However, balancing this approach with the need for rigorous academic standards and respect for established knowledge is crucial. The challenge lies in encouraging original thought while maintaining a commitment to intellectual rigor and factual accuracy.",
