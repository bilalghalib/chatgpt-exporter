We are excited to present a pilot program designed to support and improve your employees' personal and professional growth, leveraging our extensive experience as a social enterprise accelerator.\nIn 2023, offices around the world are struggling to balance rising employee demand for more remote flexibility, less meeting time, and work-life balance with a need to keep employees engaged, productive, and motivated. At Bloom, we made this transition in 2018, operating our business and delivering services to customers in fully remote or hybrid environments. Using cutting-edge tools, positive reinforcement strategies, and strengths-based development, we have grown our company to 4 continents and 12 hours of time difference while remaining on the leading edge of business acceleration programs in the MENA region. \nWe believe in the power of remote work to transform the ways in which we do business. Remote work, when leveraged correctly, allows companies to save money, boost employee productivity, and improve retention. Using the Bloom Method, we will teach you how.\nSince 2015 we have been developing our values based personal and professional growth methodology for entrepreneurship education fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. Through our programs, we've impacted thousands of individuals, over 850 teams, and mobilized $7 million in funding.\nToday, we're transitioning to work with corporate clients, bringing our experience to empower their teams. We believe Wise Systems to be a good candidate as an early adopter of our corporate offering, bringing values to life at work for skills development, balancing  team well-being and work performance. Working with Wise Systems we hope to deepen our understanding of the differences between startups and corporate environments, and help create a work environment that inspires learning and flourishing.\n",
