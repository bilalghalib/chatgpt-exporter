I can send you the pdf and you can ask 3 questions for help\nHere's the transcript\n\"\"\"\n\n00:00:00 SPK_1\nA frog. And to remember that I have saved scorpions and spiders and everything from my little furry killing machines, hash cats. I can just feel but wonder of all the systems and how they are all necessary. And even though some of these animals are not very welcoming houses, they are still part of us, and we can find very beautiful qualities and beautiful things of all of them.\n\n00:00:41 SPK_1\nAnd I don't know, is there anyone who wants to go next, or. I'm sure Nate. Yes.\n\n00:00:53 SPK_2\nSomething that came up for me is I'm really grateful for the change of seasons. Like now it's like officially autumn in the states. And I just love the beauty of, like, something having a beginning and an ending, and just especially this time of year, I just feel like it's an invitation to kind of just slow down and go a little bit more internal, to just be able to create more space for rest. But I just, I just love the beauty of the seasons and the lessons that each of them teach us.\n\n00:01:20 SPK_2\nSo thanks for this invitation.\n\n00:01:22 Bilal Ghalib\nBeautiful.\n\n00:01:23 SPK_2\nAnd does anyone else have any one need to share? Anybody want to jump in?\n\n00:01:33 Bilal Ghalib\nGo for it, Nihal.\n\n00:01:37 SPK_4\nVery grateful for the support system that I have around me. So even when there's a lot of volatility, even when there is uncertainty, then just having your back, then them just letting you take those steps and knowing that they're around you, these are friends and family members, and just the energies around you. And I've been really blessed to have had that, especially in recent times.\n\n00:02:11 Bilal Ghalib\nBeautiful. Ramzius. I saw that. Yeah, yeah.\n\n00:02:15 SPK_5\nThank you, Nihal. I'm really, really grateful for having my son with me. Uh, he just turned one year old, and I was just telling my wife, like, I recently returned from a wonderful trip, and when I was there, I was thinking of my son and how much I love him, like, just thinking about him, like, picturing him. And then when I'm here, like, being able to hug him and to smell him, it makes me so happy.\n\n00:02:43 SPK_5\nAnd he has really to do nothing but to exist for me to love him. Right? And that's just wonderful. And I'm really grateful for that feeling.\n\n00:02:52 Bilal Ghalib\nThat's beautiful. I'm gonna pick on Nilam, because I know she's shy, but I know that she has a lot to be grateful for too. So maybe so if you'd like to go.\n\n00:03:05 SPK_6\nThank you, Bilal. So maybe for me, first of all, first of all, healthy, I think, because healthy is priceless for us. And then second, lately, I have been getting back into baking. For the past two weekends in a row, I have baked I tried to bake a burn cheesecake, if you know, guys, the final one.\n\n00:03:27 SPK_6\nAnd then I'm so grateful. It succeeded. Maybe that's all. Thank you.\n\n00:03:37 Bilal Ghalib\nAll right, that's, that's great. I'm not sure. Dada was saying that she might not be able to be fully present today and she's got a lot going on, but it's this opportunity now. Actually, abhijit as well.\n\n00:03:51 Bilal Ghalib\nWe're just doing a round of a quick gratitude check in. If you'd like. I could go. I know you just showed up, so how about you settle in a little bit and I can just do mine?\n\n00:04:02 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's really simple and it's related to you being here, so it's very connected. So I have been feeling lonely and then, but I was just sitting here and then just really grateful for all of these faces in front of me. Like I was thinking, I'm lonely, but there's all of these people. Like Nihal was saying that I can reach out to, that I can connect with.\n\n00:04:28 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd it's my choice to either look at my surroundings or I'm in northern France, I just moved here. I don't know my neighbors and feel lonely, or I the opportunity to reach out to Abhijit and invite him to this session and then he shows up. So that's my gratitude checking. I was grateful for the people that show up and for a mind that is sometimes able to make that good decision.\n\n00:04:51 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd we're going to get to that. Actually, it's connected to our talk today.\n\n00:05:01 SPK_7\nIs it my turn to.\n\n00:05:02 Bilal Ghalib\nIf you feel like it, yes.\n\n00:05:04 SPK_7\nYeah. So I have to talk about what I'm grateful for. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n00:05:14 SPK_7\nSo. Well, the last week was a lovely reminder of almost all of my journey, which has been comprising of the most beautiful accidents, including meeting Miha Bilal. Always these wonderful accidents that were never planned, never intended. And the last week was full of wonderful accidents and meeting lovely people without intending to.\n\n00:05:44 SPK_7\nAnd I'm very, very grateful that these accidents keep happening. And I'm grateful for myself to also allow accidents to happen and not get completely sucked into the rigidity of routine. So, yeah, very grateful to these accidents.\n\n00:06:03 Bilal Ghalib\nBeautiful. I'm gonna just say, like, let's, let's keep, you know, that thing that you're grateful for in mind as we go through the session today. Because I think we might be able to take some lessons learned from this check in. Fatima, I don't know if you have.\n\n00:06:20 Bilal Ghalib\nOh, yeah. Hi. It's a short gratitude check in.\n\n00:06:25 SPK_8\nHey, everyone. Thank you. Thank you for opening up this space. Bilal.\n\n00:06:31 SPK_8\nMy name is Fatima Bessray. I am in the social impact space, and something that I'm grateful for is having some space and time in sometimes my very busy life to get creative and to meet people that I would normally not meet. I live in New Haven, Connecticut, on the east coast of the US, and sometimes I get in my little bubble and don't get to leave. So I'm grateful for spaces like Zoom where I can meet people from all over the world.\n\n00:07:13 SPK_8\nSo thank you.\n\n00:07:15 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd Silvana, would you like to check in?\n\n00:07:20 SPK_1\nThank you.\n\n00:07:21 SPK_9\nVille. I've been practicing gratitude for over 20 years. It's my magic pill. I always tell people, if you put one magic pill, it's gratitude, because it cannot coexist with anger or fear.\n\n00:07:36 SPK_9\nOr when you use gratitude as your magic to, it really does wonders. It's incredible. Today I'm feeling very deeply grateful for relationships in general. And you've all touched on one or two relationships, with your coworkers, with zoom, with your kids, with nature.\n\n00:07:59 SPK_9\nAnd just relationships in general are just something that I'm deeply grateful. That connection, that feeling of belonging. And I'm happy to be here as well.\n\n00:08:09 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. Thank you. Thank you, Salvana. And, you know, Fatima just reminded me that we should open up the door of serendipity.\n\n00:08:18 Bilal Ghalib\nLike Abhijit was mentioning, we are actually from all over the world, and there are people here that I've invited that are not a part of the ecosystem network that have no idea about who other people are. So if you feel like just spending a couple of seconds, just tiny intro, name, location, how you're feeling, I guess we just did this check in, but it could be interesting. You never know who you're going to meet when you're in a place like this. Yeah.\n\n00:08:45 Bilal Ghalib\nSo, like maybe name, location, if you want affiliation or however you want to introduce yourself. Oh, yeah. For me, mine can be really short because I'm just about to do a presentation about my areas of interest. So.\n\n00:09:29 Bilal Ghalib\nOkay. So I'll let you guys keep typing and feel free to share whenever ready. And many of you might have seen some of these slides before, although many are new, Fatima was actually one of the first people who prototyped a two day version of this presentation. After I gave that, I just wanted to do it again and make it better.\n\n00:10:01 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd part of that opportunity came during our time with the ecosystem Network and the Hearth Summit and the Gathering in Mexico, when we discussed this idea of workshopping the workshop. And so I'm here today to workshop the workshop, go over kind of the main question that I'm holding with this workshop that I'm developing and opening up space at the end for feedback, because I'm really hoping not to just kind of regurgitate my ideas and just hear myself share things that I've been thinking, but really to get new ideas. So it's called the post traumatic growth and resilience facilitation practices. Workshopping the workshop, it's a real mouthful, but in essence, just to get a feel for it, throughout my work, I started realizing that the spaces we hold as educators, as people facilitating experiences, even program managers or HR professionals, we create spaces that shape people's experiences and affect how they are able to handle stressors or difficulties in their life.\n\n00:11:20 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd for me, as I've been working in Lebanon, which dada is calling from today, which is experiencing daily anxiety, blasts, violence, the question is, how do we hold spaces to make it possible, to be resilient, to grow? And I think it's really possible. And it's possible. I know it's possible because I've seen evidence of it in my own experience.\n\n00:11:48 Bilal Ghalib\nOkay, so we did gratitude check in. And so, yeah, the goal is to share some of the frameworks, to think about these. I'm going to share some experiences from our practices with bloom, which is an accelerator for social enterprises, mostly in the Middle east and Africa. And then I'm going to share a Google form where I want as much information as possible.\n\n00:12:09 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd of course, we're going to open up the floor. The question of the day, how can learning experiences promote the likelihood of growth after trauma? That's the big question. And I wanted to start off with the good news, which is most people are resilient, which is really good news.\n\n00:12:27 Bilal Ghalib\nI think the research shows after even very severe difficulties, the vast majority of people fall into the middle of this curve. There's a small minority, of course, it's an important minority, that have post traumatic stress disorder. So persistent long term negative impacts from a difficulty, and then a small minority have post traumatic growth. And the question that I have is, can we shift this whole curve so that this part that's like, right over here kind of winds up in the PTG lens?\n\n00:13:03 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so the goal of the day is, what are simple modifications to educational experiences that are one very easy to train? So you can just tell it to me today. You go like, bilal, you should start with a gratitude check in. I'm like, yay.\n\n00:13:17 Bilal Ghalib\nGreat, awesome. It's easy to train two, that it promotes post traumatic growth and resilience. And three, it's aligned with whatever you're doing. So, you know, I talk about learning curriculums, but it's also, I think, for, like I mentioned, program managers, people that hold spaces, facilitators.\n\n00:13:36 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so rather than thinking of it as an extra, like, let's yoga Thursdays, how could it possibly be a part of our everydays? And that would be my goal, so that the things that we share with people, it just becomes like, oh, yeah. You know, we just do gratitude check ins every day. When?\n\n00:13:53 Bilal Ghalib\nBefore we start, you know, first grade. How cool would that be if our kids went to school and they started with gratitude first thing? And it was just an integrated part of the practice. So that's the question.\n\n00:14:03 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd why it's, oh, wait, where did you go? I thought I added this additional thing. Oh, I did. Okay, so why is right here?\n\n00:14:15 Bilal Ghalib\nBecause of these people. Oh, not that. Share. This is the madrasa Bella hadoor.\n\n00:14:25 Bilal Ghalib\nYou can see that over here. In Arabic, which means school without borders, it's basically two cardboard boxes stacked on top of each other filled with stuffed animals and noodle sticks. It's a group in Gaza that is doing amazing work trying to keep school going in the middle of the horrible situation that's happening there. And I have an opportunity to share something with them, and they seem really excited to learn from us, from anybody.\n\n00:14:52 Bilal Ghalib\nI feel like it's just a beautiful thing. They're beautiful people, kind hearted souls. And I think, abhijit, probably, like, you would have a lot to share with this crew. Of course, Nihal, everyone here probably has something that they could share, but they're sweet people and I'm connected to them through the global innovation gathering.\n\n00:15:12 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I started thinking, like, oh, maybe that workshop that I was giving to other facilitators could be really helpful for them. And so with this in mind, with this audience in mind, like, let's keep that. When we get to the sharing practices, they're very open. They have puppets, you know, they use, like, little noodles, but they have two cardboard boxes.\n\n00:15:31 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd they're working with kids that are experiencing active trauma. So that's the environment that hopefully the practices that we share will be going into. My previous experience in training with bloom and having an acute period of difficulty, was during the asfari challenge for social innovation. I was the facilitator then, and I think the important part of this slide, which was before a lot of my thinking about trauma and post traumatic growth, was around agency and making sure that people felt like they were in the driver's seat.\n\n00:16:15 Bilal Ghalib\nThat they were learning by doing. It comes from my background in the maker culture, of course, and community building. But, you know, having a sense of agency, learning by doing competency and strengths based and developing community rather than competition, were kind of like the core of the pedagogy that I think, looking at the research, were accidental promoters of PTG and resilience. They were just kind of, oh, I didn't think about it in that way when I was designing it.\n\n00:16:40 Bilal Ghalib\nI was thinking about it in another way, but it looked like it had a buffering effect. And so this is, I was taking something called the values in action, character strengths profile. It was an assessment of essentially flourishing. And so people that we had.\n\n00:16:58 Bilal Ghalib\nIn the beginning of our program, we had about 100 people, and then we selected a small number of them to go through the accelerator. And so the blue is the accelerator, but everyone took the test. And so we. After.\n\n00:17:11 Bilal Ghalib\nAfter the huge explosion in Lebanon, I was able to go back to everyone that took the test and identified this kind of buffering effect. It's not huge, but then it got me really curious. And so I started asking questions like, how do we respond to this? What do we do now as a program?\n\n00:17:30 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so I looked at 74 different dimensions. I conducted long form interviews with many people in the program and outside the program, and this is our table of correlations. And after looking at all of the different things that I was looking at from character strengths, I did a bunch of impact of the assessment scale, resilience scales. The one thing that I found in people that were able to persist and say, no matter what's happening, I'm going to keep going.\n\n00:18:02 Bilal Ghalib\nThis initiative is really important for me was the ability to identify a lesson learned during a previous traumatic experience. And in the beginning, I didn't really understand. What does that imply? Looking at the current literature and post traumatic growth, it implies something called narrative reappraisal or reconstruction, is that they actually are able to tell a story and a positive story about what they've been through and about what they learned.\n\n00:18:33 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so this element of being able to tell stories is really important. So I think it's one of the clues about the different pedagogies that we'll talk about, including, like, arts and stuff like that, and group discussions and why these group discussions could be so important. And then. Yeah, so that was like a big lesson.\n\n00:18:56 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd then I started looking into how people grew. And this is the domains of post traumatic growth. So something can happen and people can develop along can it's possible. So it's not necessary.\n\n00:19:10 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I think it's really important not to make it as if it is expected. You know, it's like, oh, you know, everyone else that went through this is now thriving and flourishing. I think that kind of pressure is absolutely unnecessary and unhelpful, but it's really important to know that it's possible. It's sort of like when you tell people, like when you start thinking about buying a Peugeot, and suddenly every car that you see in the street is a Peugeot car.\n\n00:19:38 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's that having this thing to look for. So I think it's really important to understand that there are these different domains that are possible for everyone. And I think it's really important to do it before an event happens. This is one of my, like, what I really to go into Gaza and work now, but to be working in.\n\n00:20:01 Bilal Ghalib\nIn every educational, every facilitation experience, to try to bring some of these meta pedagogies into it so that people already know these things. Sort of like when we used to think that, you know, once you hit a certain age, your brain doesn't grow anymore. There's no such thing as neuroplasticity. And I think it blocked a lot of people from even thinking about learning a new language after 40.\n\n00:20:22 Bilal Ghalib\nRight. But when the science comes out and it's like, no, neuroplasticity is lifelong, then the awareness that you can learn changes. And that awareness opens agency, if that makes sense. So this is a really important element, I think, for the meta pedagogies is start with sharing this information that is possible to grow in terms of developing appreciation, getting closer to people, identifying your own personal strengths, spiritual development, and the opening of new doors.\n\n00:20:57 Bilal Ghalib\nOkay. And looking at PTG. Then after. After the blast and after I was doing my analysis, I was trying to identify where are all the interesting correlations.\n\n00:21:10 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd the ones that I found were these three, which is, I think, really interesting, because once I started to do the research on what are the factors that promote PCG, I saw that there was a real strong map. So, for instance, there's judgment, teamwork and humor. And I think, where's the one that shows it? Yeah, so let's just go for this one.\n\n00:21:35 Bilal Ghalib\nSo this one. In terms of judgment, there's like, brutally honest optimism. Being optimistic is great, but it needs to be realistic, and that's where the quality of judgment comes through. Self efficacy is something that we've talked about a bunch of times today.\n\n00:21:51 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd how the program was designed at Bloom is to not tell people, like, here's your homework, but to tell people, what do you think is the right thing to do, given our mutual analysis of your position in the program? And so this idea of our training programs and educational spaces not being so much about telling people what to do, but kind of opening up self efficacy, because apparently one really important factor of PTG is perception of control over events. And then there's the relation between the narrative stuff and developing a strong sense of self with spirituality. I wanted to go through the traits, but I don't want to read these out because these are all the different factors in the literature.\n\n00:22:39 Bilal Ghalib\nI think it's important for, like, let's say we're designing a pedagogy that tries to bring as much of these things in as possible to know all of the different elements, but I don't necessarily think we should just go and read them all. So I'm going to share the slides at the end and just read the main heading. So the things that are related to PTG, resilience, I think it's obvious stressors. This is actually important to kind of go through because it turns out that the bigger the stressor, the more likely you will grow.\n\n00:23:11 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd that's related to event centrality. Do people see the event as something pivotal in their lives? And the reason why is because it directs attention. And there's a process where if other things go right, that attention can turn into cognitive reappraisal, narrative, constructing new narratives.\n\n00:23:34 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd it's even okay to start with something called intrusive rumination, like, why is this happening to me? If you do that enough, and if there are other conditions enough, including a strong social support, where you actually might be able to shift into questions of like, okay, now that this has happened, brutally honest, what is now still possible? Where do I have control? And so I think some of these things are kind of counterintuitive.\n\n00:24:00 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's like we don't necessarily want to tell people to look away and don't pay attention to the stressor that happened. We don't necessarily want to numb the stress away or try to keep things buffered. It actually takes a little bit of attention and then moving through that maybe first reaction of intrusive rumination being like, why? To the more deliberate style of questioning that develops into creating new narratives and so on.\n\n00:24:34 Bilal Ghalib\nDifferent coping strategies. This is actually another really important one which relates to an important element which is around the polyvagal theory. This idea that there's fight flight responses and some, there's an active coping strategy where you want to look at things as they are and be brutally honest. But there are even avoidance coping strategies that are helpful, because if you put yourself into a deregulated space, it's impossible to do the rest.\n\n00:25:03 Bilal Ghalib\nSo it's really interesting to see that there's this balance that needs to be made. We don't want to completely avoid stress, but we don't want to get into a kind of freezing state. And it's this dance that's necessary that creates the conditions for the challenge and the grappling with that challenge and the doing it with the other people that leads to the ability to tell a new story of growth. And there are traits, but I'm not so excited about traits because often these can be.\n\n00:25:37 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's, you know, they're not as. As trainable. We're talking. I'm more interested in creating contexts.\n\n00:25:48 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd although it might be possible to develop optimism through gratitude checks inside of. I think I bring it here just to show the different elements of PTG that different traits fall into. And I think, yeah, seeing the importance of optimism was the reason I brought that in, because this is the model of how PTG happens. From Calhoun and Tadeshi, something happens.\n\n00:26:18 Bilal Ghalib\nHow severe is it is a factor that has correlations with social support, coping. So the more severe something is, the more people reach out and connect with each other and get on social media and ask how they can help. And that has correlations to deliberate rumination, intrusive rumination. And here's the narrative reappraisal stuff, the life purpose rumination.\n\n00:26:39 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd one of the strongest components of post traumatic growth is this deliberate rumination. It's the why is this happening and what am I learning and how do I move forward? And the other one is social support. And so these two elements are really important in my thinking about what are the elements that I want to emphasize in a training program.\n\n00:27:05 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd just because we started with gratitude, there's been more and more research that show the mediating effect of gratitude and how it promotes post traumatic growth through deliberate rumination. Okay, so I just want to make sure I haven't lost anybody. And this is. This is where I'm at.\n\n00:27:27 Bilal Ghalib\nThis is like my understanding of PTG, the factors that lead to it, and then the elements within the training modules that we've created so far that lead to that. So in terms of the three main headings. So, social support, we like to do things where there's a lot of community. First, training people answer each other's questions.\n\n00:27:51 Bilal Ghalib\nFirst, we open with circle check ins, where people are sharing how they're doing. Honest feedback and developing cooperative strategies. Narrative reconstruction happens through deliberate rumination, reflection. Have a series of questions that we have as the kind of journal that we've created.\n\n00:28:14 Bilal Ghalib\nMindfulness and self compassion practices. These are more around creating a positive effect, helping people connect socially. We needed to bring some of these in more deliberately after the blast because there was a lot of nervous system overload, stress, dysregulation, and it was impossible to do anything other than kind of the getting regulated before you can then move into other, other practices. Creativity in arts practices is really helpful as well.\n\n00:28:52 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd then encouraging humor. This is one of the standout factors, was how important humor was. And I think it's one of those things that it takes the stress and it relieves it, and it moves the activated nervous system. Playing to people's strengths is another thing.\n\n00:29:15 Bilal Ghalib\nLeveraging people's current competencies, inner capacities, so people have that sense of agency and ability to control the events of their lives. And related to that is smaller units. It's very simple, but breaking things down into smaller pieces. So this is.\n\n00:29:32 Bilal Ghalib\nThese are the elements that are already sort of in our programs. And I think. Let me see, what time is it? Okay, so I wanted to give as much time as possible to getting feedback from people.\n\n00:29:44 Bilal Ghalib\nThese are just going through the fight, flight or freeze thing. This is the idea of the performance and level of stress, and trying to find a way of getting pedagogies to fall into this optimal growth and learning zone. The upside down pyramid supports agency and community and competency. This is a way that Bloom does things where if anybody asks a question, they have to answer it first, and then their peers answer it.\n\n00:30:12 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd then the teacher answers last. Collective intelligence. It's about forming those strong social connections where people are connected to each other in support the kinds of questions. So the deliberate rumination tool that I mentioned is here.\n\n00:30:28 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd if I was doing this with people in the, for instance, with the school without borders, I would be sharing each of these practices and kind of teaching them how to use it with their programs. But our goal today is to kind of just go through them quickly and get your practices. So I'm just kind of going through them quite, quite quick, quite quickly. And then competence is the idea that people have one of these qualities that wants to show up in them readily.\n\n00:30:56 Bilal Ghalib\nIt comes from the school of positive psychology. It's the idea of signature strengths. So for me, it's humor. And so the idea is people can feel confident because they're kind of born with it.\n\n00:31:07 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's not maybelline. And yeah, so then humor, some of the elements of humor. And if this was a session, we would go through these elements of humor mostly just to encourage facilitators to be funny. Like, you can be funny.\n\n00:31:24 Bilal Ghalib\nGo out and be hilarious. Because there's science, you know, like, it's okay to be funny. Science tells you to. And then the last technique that I like to share is art.\n\n00:31:37 Bilal Ghalib\nSo art has that element of connection that we saw was connected to post traumatic growth, empowerment, which also is connected to PTG. And the cool thing about art is there's this element of. There's a relationship between art, mindfulness, and you're never wrong with art. You know, you can always be competent.\n\n00:31:58 Bilal Ghalib\nSo this is. That's it. Those are the different elements. And my digest of what is helpful is start with a belief system.\n\n00:32:10 Bilal Ghalib\nHelp people know that it's possible to grow through trauma, through difficult things like that happens. It's totally possible. And there's some factors. If there's so much stress that there is an dysregulated nervous system, we're not able to have a productive conversation.\n\n00:32:28 Bilal Ghalib\nLet's work on the breathing exercises, mindfulness, body embodiment movements, you know, get. Get out of the fight, flight, or freeze. And then we have the ability to build competence, show people that the world is something we can enact in. Set small goals, show achievements, build authentic community, and then help people tell a new true story.\n\n00:32:53 Bilal Ghalib\nSo this is my understanding, like, my takeaway from all the research that I've been doing on PCG. And I realized in the end that it connects so much with self efficacy. And it turns out that frontiers in psychology has a call for papers on the relationship between post traumatic stress disorder and agency. So, this topic is like an active area of research.\n\n00:33:16 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I do see a big thread between this idea of self efficacy and PTG. And I like to end with this, like, Mister Rogers quote, which, when he was a boy and he would see scary things in the news, my mother would tell you, to me, look for the helpers, you will always find people who are helping, and there's developing agency. By seeing help being modeled one day, you can be the helper. Reduce stress by seeing goodness increase action orientation and then taking action by seeking positive responses, even just going online and not looking up all the horrible things you're looking up, like, who's out there doing good stuff?\n\n00:33:53 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd so, yeah, that's it. So that was the question of the day. This is our goal of the day, if you remember. What are the things that we can do that can promote post traumatic growth and resilience, and our facilitated experiences that are easy to train.\n\n00:34:08 Bilal Ghalib\nOh, moo. Promote post traumatic growth and are aligned with the learning curriculum. And we have this little QR code. And that's it.\n\n00:34:17 Bilal Ghalib\nNow we get into the discussion time. Muj, sorry. I raced through things. I wanted to give as much time as possible to this part.\n\n00:34:27 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I know that I went really quickly through a lot of information, but my goal is just to kind of get you to see the area and to understand some of the core elements. And we can go back to any slide if it would be helpful for you. But now I'd love to learn from you guys. What do you think are really helpful practices that create conditions for withstanding the storms of life within.\n\n00:34:51 Bilal Ghalib\nWithin any facilitated experience. Oh, Nilam, if you can, bring the link to the form, because I want to hear it, but I also want to save. Okay. Hey, moj.\n\n00:35:07 Bilal Ghalib\nOkay, I'm just looking at the slideshow. Oh, sorry. Oh, no. Fatima left just when I.\n\n00:35:19 Bilal Ghalib\nI just wanted her feedback. Okay, that's great. So, I'm curious. I'm not sure, abhijit, did you have any.\n\n00:35:28 Bilal Ghalib\nAny thoughts, like, maybe just reflecting on your training environments or your, like, educational spaces or facilitations, what do you think has been helpful to help people grow?\n\n00:35:45 SPK_7\nYeah, I was thinking of that. I mean, with full disclaimer that I'm. I'm no expert in managing trauma, but at the same time, I've. The two things I have noticed that have helped people.\n\n00:36:02 SPK_7\nOne has been going beyond community support to community belonging. So the community support becomes something difficult to ask for, because then you're putting yourself in a position that needs support, and that is sometimes hard to acknowledge for somebody. Whereas asking for community belonging or people to belong to is almost. Doesn't need language, doesn't need words.\n\n00:36:28 SPK_7\nAnd the right environment can sort of create that sort of wordless, speechless environment where you feel better even without having said anything. And I've seen that in our own spaces where people come from so many backgrounds and so many attitudes and so many histories and backgrounds, that language is actually the lowest form of communication overall amongst them. And so I really admire and. And I'm trying to do that for myself, to use less and less of language and words for experiencing and sharing things.\n\n00:37:17 SPK_7\nBut the second thing is actually based on the language, which is making simple my. My concern usually with. When it comes to mindfulness, like, starting from that word, mindfulness, everything else also starts becoming extremely difficult to understand. And the more complicated the word gets, and, of course, complicated words help us short.\n\n00:37:50 Bilal Ghalib\nYou muted.\n\n00:37:51 SPK_7\nSorry. Yeah, I accidentally. So, as much as complicated words help us to shorten a big concept into a small set of words, they also remove the possibility of imagining it in reality. I keep asking people, like, for example, what are your ideal values for a school?\n\n00:38:16 SPK_7\nAnd usually people have very complex words to explain them. You know, compassion or, you know, multi generational learning. Like, okay, but can you see those words? You can.\n\n00:38:30 SPK_7\nYou can definitely write them, you can say them, but can you see them in a. You know, when. When in that environment? And sure, it's okay to use them between practitioners, but then sometimes.\n\n00:38:43 SPK_7\nThen the meaning of things stays with practitioners, as opposed to going also to the people who are ultimately using it for healing. Right. So how can we sort of empower people? By understanding the practice that is being engaged with them?\n\n00:39:01 SPK_7\nThrough simplification of language. And simplification in no means means, you know, is to think that somebody's too stupid to understand. That's really not the point. Simplification only means that your intelligence need not be measured in your literary genius.\n\n00:39:20 SPK_7\nYou know, that we. That the understanding is far deeper than your understanding of words. So, yeah, these two things. And surely there's no.\n\n00:39:33 SPK_7\nBut I think for now. Yeah.\n\n00:39:43 Bilal Ghalib\nLovely. I'm curious if you want to make the simplest summary of what you got from the talk from Moj.\n\n00:40:01 SPK_7\nYou wanted me to make a summary?\n\n00:40:03 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. With the language that you were mentioning also. Yeah, like a sentence or two.\n\n00:40:11 SPK_7\nYeah. The two points were focusing on belonging as opposed to support and keeping language super simple, so that people need not be beneficiaries. They can actually understand what is this practice being brought to them, you know? So that's.\n\n00:40:33 SPK_7\nYeah, in the simplest. Thank you. I think I also needed that.\n\n00:40:40 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. Anybody else? Just as a reminder, the question is, like, what are. What do you think our practice is?\n\n00:40:49 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I think, I want to be sure that I don't sound like a trauma expert or like this is going to make classrooms a therapy session. My goal is, what are the little interventions that we can do in how we hold space that make it more likely for people to thrive and to flourish even in the face of challenges. So it's not like, oh, let's go to where there's most difficult situations and bring in this kind of trauma informed education. The bigger question is, what's a little thing we can do?\n\n00:41:18 Bilal Ghalib\nFor instance, the gratitude check in. For me, that's a bare minimum. I love this. It's a great way of, like, building that connection, opening that space so people can feel each other and hopefully develop a sense of belonging that, you know, looking into the theory and the research on resilience and post traumatic growth looks like it can shift that curve so more people fall into that kind of flourishing space.\n\n00:41:45 SPK_9\nYeah, I think maybe practical because I wrote in the chat, self knowledge and self awareness, I think it's key to not to overcoming trauma. I think it's the first step in a sense, but maybe coming up with a couple of questions that can assist that introspection of how. What are the triggers? Like, are you?\n\n00:42:08 SPK_9\nFor me, it was very. An aha. Moment was when I was a therapist of mine said, you know, point me into the way for me to realize that I was being a victim and I had the victim mentality, and this mentality was not allowing me to move forward at all. Once I saw that and those patterns that were accompanied by that victim mentality, I was able to say, well, there's agency there, and now I can move forward.\n\n00:42:33 SPK_9\nSo what are simple questions that you can ask in order for the person, because you can't tell them you're being a victim, that, you know, it doesn't work and it's not productive. But maybe there are specific questions that you can ask that will allow for that introspection and insight to come to the surface.\n\n00:42:58 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. And I'm thinking, like, one of the third elements of the question that we have today is, how is it just a part of everyday experience in an educational environment or in a training session? I find, actually, strangely enough, the process of training entrepreneurs is very practical for this, because you have to see things as they are. You can't have this super optimistic vision of things.\n\n00:43:25 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd there's this idea of needing to address things for how they are and not how you want them to be. And so that process of self knowledge and what are my actual skills? What are the knowledge of the skills of the people in my team? These kinds of questions actually become a normal part of the conversation for that kind of program.\n\n00:43:46 Bilal Ghalib\nBut maybe there's other ways of bringing that into other types of spaces and facilitations and educational experiences.\n\n00:44:08 SPK_5\nThe one thing that I wanted to share, Bilal and everyone, is because I've experienced many, many griefs this year. This past year. It's been so painful. Right?\n\n00:44:23 SPK_5\nBut the reason I want to provide that context is because the insight that I came after, I was able to see what I was experiencing, and maybe we all know that this, we all know this already, but your question connected me with my insight of, I didn't want to tell anyone how I was feeling, because it was. It seemed so painful and so intimate and so unique to me. But then I realized that it was the human experience, and the more intimate is and the most personal, the most universal it is. So in that context of, like.\n\n00:45:04 Bilal Ghalib\nPost.\n\n00:45:05 SPK_5\nTraumatic situation and then facilitating for people who are experiencing something very, very painful and individual, just creating the space and the container to realize that we're all going through the same things in slightly different ways, it creates a sense of belonging.\n\n00:45:26 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. And that makes me think maybe a part of the meta pedagogies is, you know, although we do these big check ins, creating private one on one spaces for teams to check in with whatever they want. Right. Like, let's say that we're having a zoom session and we did breakouts, and we even encouraged this by sharing that knowledge.\n\n00:45:43 Bilal Ghalib\nYou know, your experience is a part of the human experience. It's all welcome. You might be surprised to know that there's. Yeah, your sharing will be well received.\n\n00:45:54 Bilal Ghalib\nSo trying to create, like, a space for that, even within, like, learning spaces and things like that, because it might be hard to do it with ten people. Yeah, there's the killer.\n\n00:46:20 SPK_2\nI guess, like, really quickly, something that came up for me, and I really appreciate everything you shared and just, like, the insight and the space to kind of really listen, I found it really insightful and inspiring. But this thought of, like, just being able to breathe, hold, and, like, release kept kind of circling back in my mind as I was listening to you, like, practices that I personally found and that I found to be helpful for others. Just like, just taking a moment to, like, breathe. Whether that's, like, kind of starting with a practice, like, rather, it's just like a box breath where you're holding your breath for 4 seconds and then kind of releasing and then holding again and releasing.\n\n00:46:59 SPK_2\nOr even if it's just something like, hey, before we immediately dive into the content, like, I'm just taking a breath with you, like, just looking at people and acknowledging who's around you, like, what you all may feel, how you all are showing up differently by kind of creating that space and that kind of goes into, like, the whole, like, just before you actually start the conversation or jump into business as usual, creating that space for you to just kind of be silent and kind of sit in that moment regardless of, like, where people are, how they're showing up, like, just really recognizing the integrity and the person in front of you, and then release. Cause I love when you mentioned the art piece, like, the creativity and the mindfulness relationship. I think having, like, a space, rather, it was like art therapy, which is something we were able to kind of practice before in a session I did at COAC, where people were just able to give the space, rather. It's like doodling or painting or drawing, like, really just releasing whatever is within you and recognizing there's right or there's no right or wrong way to do it, or even if it's journaling, like, just having a space where people can get out a few words or thoughts, even if they don't make sense.\n\n00:48:05 SPK_2\nBut to just be able to give some kind of voice to what you're feeling has been really helpful. So, yeah, I just wanted to kind of share, like, those things kind of came up for me, but I really appreciate the lens that you brought to the work that felt really intentional and that there's, like, really no right or wrong way to grow and to heal. It's individual, but it's also so much stronger in the collective. So thank you.\n\n00:48:26 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, and one of the very practical things that a lot of this makes me think is just enough time. So what if our classes weren't an hour? I'm just looking at. We're at the top of the hour, and we're beginning to open up, and who knows?\n\n00:48:39 Bilal Ghalib\nYou could have went off into breakouts. And so spaciousness for the nature, for the breaths, for the, like, wait, you actually have time to open up a conversation that might take a little bit of time. So. Yeah.\n\n00:48:52 Bilal Ghalib\nThank you so much for sharing that. You know, I do wish I had the time to do these practices and get all this feedback and, you know, I think maybe one of the feedback for the facilitators of this workshopping, the workshop, maybe an hour is a little short. Maybe next time it could be a little bit longer. Yeah.\n\n00:49:15 Bilal Ghalib\nBut I already feel like I got a lot out of this and a lot more clarity about the simplest, easiest things that I can suggest for people. Right? Like, in Abhijit's words, like, you know, make space for breathing. How can you help the classroom feel a sense of belonging?\n\n00:49:34 Bilal Ghalib\nLet's spend some time in nature. There's some very simple things, and I think they touch a lot of the main principles. The sense of belonging and community, the de escalation of the nervous system and opening up that space for narrative reconstruction. That's basically what it is after looking at all the different research.\n\n00:49:59 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's us together being like, holy shoot, what just happened? Is this our world? Wait, what is the world? How can we sit with each other and tell a new story?\n\n00:50:11 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd be a part of creating that. That's where the sense of agency and self efficacy comes in. So it's getting clearer for me. Even just, like, sharing this with you and all the different pieces and hearing your feedback, it's just there are very few simple principles, and I might not even have to give the meta pedagogy, so just give that sense.\n\n00:50:28 Bilal Ghalib\nLike, how do we create belonging? How do we. How do we create a sense of, like, ease with each other and a space for conversation? That's it.\n\n00:50:35 Bilal Ghalib\nI think that would cover 80%. 80% is good. Yeah.\n\n00:50:44 SPK_5\nI wanted to say that I totally agree on the percentage or the ratio that you shared, but yet I want to acknowledge and celebrate the amount of research and dedication you have put into understanding through science and data what's relevant. And this is very unique to what's out there. So I really wanted to praise you and your team for the commitment to do this from the right place.\n\n00:51:12 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, yeah. Thank you. But I think it's not possible to get to the 80% until you get to the, like, 95%. So you start scraping the bottom of science hub, you know?\n\n00:51:23 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. And then. And then having a mirror like this, and this is what I was really hoping for. And there have been a couple of quiet people that I'm curious about, but I'm not sure if we have much time.\n\n00:51:36 Bilal Ghalib\nI don't know if Nihal or daughter wants to type something.\n\n00:51:40 SPK_4\nSure, I can go. Yeah. I think it was touched upon in so many ways by so many other people in the room, and there's so much I took away. One thing that I've noticed is sometimes we're just not able to articulate what our core inner need is.\n\n00:52:01 SPK_4\nWhat do we need at this moment? Sometimes we're looking for. We're looking for connection. Sometimes we're looking for touch.\n\n00:52:10 SPK_4\nSometimes we're looking for acceptance. Sometimes we're looking for something. Humor. Right.\n\n00:52:17 SPK_4\nBut when we're in the thick of things, we just don't know what it is. And when I was going through a really dark phase, my therapist just did something so simple. She just gave me a chart of a list of needs. And if you just google a list of needs, you'll find that image.\n\n00:52:39 SPK_4\nIt's just. And all she said is, just look at this, and one will speak up to you more than others. And that sometimes is what you've been craving, but it's just struggling to articulate. And sometimes it's just about finding that and finding who can give it to you or how you can create it with yourself.\n\n00:53:02 SPK_4\nAnd just even. Just being aware that this is what I needed in the first place sometimes just untangle so much.\n\n00:53:13 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, I found a list of needs here, and.\n\n00:53:18 SPK_4\nPerfect. Yeah, that's the one.\n\n00:53:31 Bilal Ghalib\nAll right. I don't. I don't know. You kind of came in a little bit at the end, but you've.\n\n00:53:36 Bilal Ghalib\nYou've been hearing a little bit. I don't know if you want to reflect on anything or if anybody has fallen. Mosh or Dara.\n\n00:53:43 SPK_10\nYeah. I think just, like, really resonated with me. And especially coming from a place where, like, in Iraq, where a lot of these things are not really. Not well understood, like, even needs or feelings.\n\n00:54:02 SPK_10\nAnd, like, I find, unfortunately, the language is not as. I mean, Arabic is a very rich language, but the Arabic we speak is not very rudimentary, very basic. Like, we don't have. We don't use in our daily speech, we don't use the more sophisticated emotions, you know?\n\n00:54:20 SPK_10\nAnd I know that's a problem in English as well, but, like, I think even more so in Arabic. Like, you know, we focus on, like, the generic feelings and the generic needs. Like, sad, happy, like, we don't actually understand the details of it. And I've shown this picture of needs to a lot of people before.\n\n00:54:37 SPK_10\nI actually got it from the NBC model, and it was. I've seen, like, the look on people's faces when they see it for the first time. And a lot of times when I share it with people for the first time, they actually go and spend a lot of time with this and trying to understand what does each of these. It's me, and which one resonates with me.\n\n00:54:57 SPK_10\nAnd I really appreciate that you shared that. So, yeah, I missed a lot of the session earlier, so I can't really speak to that. But that last point was very close to my heart.\n\n00:55:12 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I think actually, just seeing many of the people here, like, Moshe included, their magic touch is creating a space of belonging. Yeah. Including, like, Silvana and Nanda and, like, almost everybody here in terms of when. When you facilitate, when you host, when you hold space.\n\n00:55:29 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd Moj does an amazing job of that, bringing young people from Iraq to Turkey and doing, like, nature based retreats. You know, I think that. Yeah, these things that keep coming up really important to notice this importance of belonging in our learning spaces, in our workspaces. It's so interesting.\n\n00:55:56 Bilal Ghalib\nWe've been so alienated for so long. I feel like you go to work and at least the traditional idea around work, you go to exchange your time for money to go home and have your life. And this idea of belonging hasn't been core. And I feel like even our school systems, for whatever reason, in America at least, they were kind of designed, even architecturally, on prisons.\n\n00:56:20 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd there's, like, this grading process and then the idea of a curve and being graded on a curve, and, like, your fellow colleagues are enemies, because if they do better than you, then you're doing worse. And competitiveness. And I think that might be one of the core issues here, is that education, as it stand, as it stands internationally, is competitive and not cooperative, and that ruins the possibility of belonging and just change. Like, that might be another.\n\n00:56:46 Bilal Ghalib\nReally. That might be the 50% shift, which is a huge shift already. Ah, that was a hug for Dada. Dada's been having a tough time.\n\n00:56:57 Bilal Ghalib\nShe's like, Lebanon is a very stressful place to be these days, and I'm glad that she joined. You know what? Yeah. This thing I mentioned today about approach and withdrawal and that not all withdrawal is unhelpful, that knowing your limits and knowing, like.\n\n00:57:17 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd that's why I invited a bunch of people from Lebanon to this call. I was like, if you need a break and you want to look at something different for a while and have someone distract you from what's going on, like, this might be a positive distraction, and there are such things as positive distractions. So I hope this was helpful for her. All right, thank you, everybody.\n\n00:57:36 Bilal Ghalib\nDoes anybody have, like, a burning thing? They're like, wow, this is really important.\n\n00:57:41 SPK_10\nI have a question. I don't know if there's room for questions. I can leave it as an unanswered question if there's no time for it, but it's one that I like. So with the talk, I think gratitude is a great way for belonging, you know, getting a sense of belonging.\n\n00:58:00 SPK_10\nBut also, I also. I sometimes feel like it's hard to know if it's inappropriate to bring up, like, if it would be belittling of people's, like, hardship. If you're like, let's focus on gratitude. And finding that balance is one of the challenges for me.\n\n00:58:18 SPK_10\nAnd I guess I'm just leaving that as a question. And I don't know if it belongs here or, like, something else, but let's just put it out there.\n\n00:58:27 Bilal Ghalib\nAnybody is open to answer. Nanda, do you have to go?\n\n00:58:40 SPK_1\nBut you are a host now, and you can continue with the session.\n\n00:58:43 Bilal Ghalib\nYes. Okay. I think a couple of people have to leave. Yeah.\n\n00:58:52 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's a good question to end on and just to let you know, I started with gratitude, knowing that dada was here. So you know my answer. And I think it's really important maybe to how you ask it, because I remember when I asked it, I said something like, given no matter what's happening, what's the little sliver that you can be grateful for? And usually it's really.\n\n00:59:20 Bilal Ghalib\nIt might be tough, but even acknowledging that, I think, helps and, you know, like gratitude and shifting your attention a little bit on that. You know, we talked about the importance of first things first, regulating the nervous system and getting out of this fight, fright, or freeze state. And maybe, just maybe that little bit of just looking away from literal bombs that are falling could potentially help. So I'd say I would do it.\n\n00:59:50 Bilal Ghalib\nJust always doing it carefully and being sensitive as much as possible. I don't know if other people have different ideas, but that's mine.\n\n01:00:02 SPK_5\nI wanted to share something around that question, but it is so count. I think the word is counterintuitive, right? It's quite the opposite. As opposed to embracing gratitude, which I love, I totally know why we're doing it.\n\n01:00:17 SPK_5\nBut starting from my experience and not from a clinical place or just my experience, it was not until I was able to embrace my grief, then I was able to embrace other things because I had to disconnect from myself because I was in so much pain and I was feeling so much that I would rather not feel anything at all. And in that sense, I lost the opportunity to even be in touch with the positive things. But when I was able to embrace the sad part, then I was able to embrace other things as well. Yeah, of course, it's hard because to create a space, a safe space, a respectful space, starting with the pain.\n\n01:01:03 SPK_5\nEmbracing the pain is not easy. And I'm not suggesting that we should do that. I'm just saying that in the end, embracing either a or b would also let you eventually embrace the other part.\n\n01:01:20 Bilal Ghalib\nIf you remember the period when we looked into the factors of post traumatic growth, stress, and the importance of the event, and looking at the event as it is, is actually a positive factor, and it really is counterintuitive. But you do have to look at it. You have to, like you were saying, like, see the grief, the structure of today's question, I think, you know, for me, I didn't want to. I don't think it's appropriate and in today's context, to start with, like, the grief stuff, because that might require a lot of time and safety and creating that kind of environment.\n\n01:01:59 Bilal Ghalib\nBut absolutely, I don't think that this always be positive thing that sometimes comes up makes a lot of sense, right? Like, never look at the painful stuff. And it's from the research and from your lived experience and from lots of our lived experience. So.\n\n01:02:25 SPK_5\nIf I may, I wanted to quickly add another idea to what I just shared. So when the heaviness of the world and the heaviness of the situation is too much to bear witness, of course, to invite anyone to embrace it is disrespectful, actually. But actually, I used. Last week, I was in plum village, and I had this beautiful moment wherever a monk said, Ram says, even if you cannot embrace the pain, at least you can embrace the fact that you cannot embrace the pain, but embrace something.\n\n01:03:05 Bilal Ghalib\nAnd I was like, what?\n\n01:03:07 SPK_5\nThis is so genius. And then, because I was able to embrace the fact that I cannot embrace the pain, yet I was still embracing. And that embracing gave me the possibility to embrace the good parts or the gratitude part.\n\n01:03:25 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah. One of the meta ways I think about things is, what does it take to not be stuck? Being stuck is, for me, one of the most horrible feelings, just, like, not knowing what to do. But in this case, it's like, I can't embrace it.\n\n01:03:40 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's just too big. It's like, why don't you embrace that thing that you can? Which is like, recognizing that limitation that you currently have. And it's a movement.\n\n01:03:50 Bilal Ghalib\nIt's an internal movement that. And I think, you know, in the poll polyvagal thing, that's. That's not being stuck. That's getting you into some form of connection with the world.\n\n01:04:01 Bilal Ghalib\nYeah, that's really, really.\n\n01:04:06 SPK_5\nBye, everyone. I have to leave, and I'm so sorry, but it was so beautiful.\n\n01:04:10 Bilal Ghalib\nBut it was really.\n\n01:04:11 SPK_5\nEverybody, thank you. And to reconnect with you.\n\n01:04:14 Bilal Ghalib\nThank you for coming. If you want, I sent you the slides. Yeah. Thank you for the insights.\n\n01:04:20 Bilal Ghalib\nThank you for everyone. Because I feel like I got way more clear on the core things to share. So thank you. Au take care.\n\n\n\"\"\"",

These modifications are designed to be easy to implement and integrate into existing teaching practices, making learning more engaging and supportive in challenging environments.\n\n#### **Target Audience**\nThis workshop is intended for educators, trainers, and facilitators, with a specific focus on the teachers of School Without Borders in Gaza. These teachers are working with children displaced from their classrooms due to recent conflict and are setting up pop-up schools to provide continuity in education.\n\n#### **Core Components**\n- **Engaging Learning Experiences**: The workshop emphasizes that these modifications are not a replacement for trauma therapy nor an attempt to turn schools into therapy centers. Instead, the aim is to make learning experiences more engaging, fun, and supportive of deeper learning while encouraging PTG and resilience.\n  \n- **Belonging and Cooperation**: Historically, education included learning as part of a community—apprenticeships, guilds, and collaboration were key. Modern education, with its focus on competition and grading curves, often neglects this sense of belonging. Our workshop will focus on reversing this trend by emphasizing cooperation, collaboration, and belonging, which are vital for resilience.\n\n- **Reflection and Storytelling**: Participants will learn how to incorporate reflection and storytelling into their classrooms. This includes individual reflection, paired discussions, and group sharing to help students process their experiences. Activities like drawing the conflict, naming challenges, and storytelling help students express their emotions and begin identifying areas of potential growth.\n\n- **Simple, Practical Techniques**: Educators will be provided with practical tools such as:\n  - **Circle Check-ins**: Create a routine for sharing feelings at the beginning or end of the day to foster community belonging.\n  - **Drawing and Art Activities**: Allow children to draw their experiences, which can help externalize and process difficult emotions.\n  - **Humor and Play**: Encourage laughter and playful activities to create positive experiences and regulate the nervous system, essential for resilience.\n  - **Collective Intelligence Practices**: Use cooperative learning methods like the Upside Down Pyramid (student-led questioning followed by group input) to foster a sense of agency and competence in students.\n\n#### **Workshop Structure**\n1. **Introduction**: Welcome participants, share objectives, and emphasize the importance of fostering resilience and PTG.\n2. **Activity 1: Gratitude Circle** - Start with a minute of silence and have participants share something they are grateful for. Discuss how this simple activity can be used with children.\n3. **Activity 2: Reflection and Storytelling** - Practice reflection techniques that help students articulate their experiences in a supportive environment.\n4. **Activity 3: Drawing the Conflict** - Introduce drawing as a method for children to express their emotions and explore their stories creatively.\n5. **Discussion**: Open space for participants to share their own ideas for incorporating these techniques into their classrooms.\n6. **Wrap-Up and Feedback**: Reflect on the key insights from the workshop, and provide a feedback form for participants.\n\n#### **Outcome**\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will have practical, easy-to-implement techniques that foster a sense of belonging, resilience, and post-traumatic growth in their classrooms. These tools will help children navigate their difficult experiences while enriching their learning journey.\n\n#### **Contact Information**\nFor further details, please contact: [partner@bloom.pm](mailto:partner@bloom.pm)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there's anything you'd like to adjust or add to this proposal!",

These modifications are intended to make educational experiences more engaging, supportive, and capable of promoting belonging and growth without adding extra activities.\n\n#### **Target Audience**\nThis workshop is intended for educators, trainers, and facilitators, with a specific focus on teachers at School Without Borders in Gaza. These educators are setting up pop-up schools for children displaced by recent conflict, and the aim is to provide practical, easy-to-adopt methods to create a supportive learning environment in this challenging context.\n\n#### **Core Components**\n- **Belonging and Cooperation**: The workshop emphasizes the importance of fostering a sense of belonging and cooperation within the classroom. Rather than introducing new activities, the focus will be on transforming existing routines to promote a supportive environment. Belonging is key to resilience, and it can be cultivated by emphasizing collaboration and reducing competitiveness.\n\n- **Meta-Pedagogies for Resilience**:\n  - **Movement and Interaction**: Encourage movement during lessons by incorporating activities where students walk and discuss in pairs or small groups. This helps to reduce tension, foster connection, and provide a sense of shared experience.\n  - **Check-in Circles**: Start or end lessons with a quick check-in. Have students share how they feel or something they learned, in pairs or small groups. This can build connection without being overly direct or requiring students to focus explicitly on trauma.\n  - **Storytelling in Context**: Instead of directly addressing difficult experiences, encourage storytelling about challenges in learning or projects they are working on. This indirect method helps students articulate emotions and recognize growth without the pressure of focusing on trauma explicitly.\n\n- **Seamless Integration into Courses**: \n  - **Cooperative Learning Enhancements**: Adjust existing group work to emphasize cooperative goals rather than competitive ones. For example, have students work on a shared project where every contribution is celebrated.\n  - **Reflective Practices**: Include moments for self-reflection that are relevant to the lesson topic. For example, after a science experiment, ask students not only what they learned but how they felt during the process. Did they feel proud of their contribution? This encourages emotional processing in a low-pressure setting.\n  - **Use of Humor and Lightness**: Introduce humor whenever possible, such as playful examples or light-hearted competitions. Humor can act as a social glue, reducing stress and promoting positive emotions that support resilience.\n\n#### **Workshop Structure**\n1. **Introduction**: Welcome participants, share objectives, and explain the concept of integrating PTG-promoting practices without adding extra workload.\n2. **Activity 1: Belonging through Movement** - Demonstrate how to encourage movement within the classroom, such as pairing students for a \"walk and talk\" discussion.\n3. **Activity 2: Cooperative Learning Review** - Work with participants to identify existing group activities and suggest modifications that emphasize cooperation and collective success.\n4. **Activity 3: Storytelling Techniques** - Guide participants on how to introduce storytelling related to course topics, helping students express emotions in an indirect but meaningful way.\n5. **Discussion**: Participants share their current courses and identify where they can integrate the presented methods.\n6. **Wrap-Up and Feedback**: Reflect on the workshop’s key insights, and provide a feedback form for participants to share their thoughts.\n\n#### **Outcome**\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will have a toolkit of meta-pedagogical approaches they can incorporate into their current courses to promote belonging, resilience, and PTG. These modifications are designed to make learning more engaging and supportive without requiring additional activities or overwhelming educators.\n\n#### **Contact Information**\nFor further details, please contact: [partner@bloom.pm](mailto:partner@bloom.pm)\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if this version aligns better with your vision or if further adjustments are needed.",

      "content": "Here's an updated one-page workshop proposal that includes theoretical underpinnings alongside practical approaches:\n\n---\n\n### **Title: Workshopping the Workshop: Integrating Resilience and Post-Traumatic Growth into Education**\n\n#### **Workshop Objective**\nThe primary goal of this workshop is to identify simple, effective modifications that educators can seamlessly integrate into their existing teaching practices to foster post-traumatic growth (PTG) and resilience. These modifications are intended to make educational experiences more engaging, supportive, and capable of promoting belonging and growth, without adding extra activities.\n\n#### **Target Audience**\nThis workshop is designed for educators, trainers, and facilitators, with a specific focus on teachers at School Without Borders in Gaza. These educators are setting up pop-up schools for children displaced by recent conflict, and the aim is to provide practical, easy-to-adopt methods to create a supportive learning environment in this challenging context.\n\n#### **Core Components**\n\n- **Understanding Trauma as a Source of Growth**:\n  - Trauma is not only about difficulty and reduced capacity—it can also be a source of profound personal growth. The concept of **Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)** suggests that, under the right conditions, individuals can come out of traumatic experiences with greater resilience, a deeper sense of personal strength, improved relationships, and a renewed appreciation for life.\n  - **Theoretical Underpinnings**: This workshop will introduce facilitators to key theories, such as **Polyvagal Theory** and **Self-Efficacy**, which explain how creating conditions of safety, belonging, and agency can support growth beyond just resilience. These theories will empower facilitators to adapt their existing practices and even invent new methods tailored to their unique teaching environments.\n\n- **Belonging and Cooperation**:\n  - Modern education's competitive nature can often undermine belonging. This workshop will focus on how to modify existing activities to emphasize cooperation, collaboration, and a sense of belonging—all critical for fostering resilience and PTG.\n  - Facilitators will learn techniques to create an environment where students feel valued and connected, which is foundational for resilience. This includes transforming group work into cooperative learning and encouraging peer support rather than competition.\n\n- **Meta-Pedagogies for Growth**:\n  - **Movement and Interaction**: Facilitate movement during lessons—such as paired \"walk and talk\" discussions—helping students reduce tension and form connections. Movement enhances regulation of the nervous system, which is crucial for creating the conditions for PTG.\n  - **Reflective Practices Embedded in Learning**: Encourage reflection as part of existing lessons. For example, after completing an assignment, ask students to reflect on their emotional journey through the task. This helps in building narrative reconstruction, an important component of PTG.\n  - **Indirect Storytelling**: Replace direct storytelling about trauma with storytelling related to learning challenges. Students can tell stories about the process of solving problems, celebrating both struggles and successes. This approach helps build resilience without the emotional burden of directly addressing their trauma.\n\n- **Empowering Facilitators with Theoretical Knowledge**:\n  - Understanding the conditions that promote PTG—such as a sense of **agency**, strong **social support**, and **reflective narrative construction**—will enable facilitators to innovate. They will be equipped not only with ready-made strategies but also with the underlying principles to design new, context-specific activities that support their students' growth.\n\n#### **Workshop Structure**\n1. **Introduction**: Welcome participants, introduce the concept of PTG, and discuss how trauma can lead to positive change if the right conditions are present.\n2. **Activity 1: Belonging through Movement** - Demonstrate how to encourage movement in the classroom, such as pairing students for a \"walk and talk\" discussion to foster physical and social engagement.\n3. **Activity 2: Reflection and Narrative Building** - Practice embedding reflective questions into regular lessons, encouraging students to narrate their learning experiences.\n4. **Activity 3: Cooperative Learning Adaptation** - Work with participants to identify existing group activities and modify them to emphasize collaboration and mutual support.\n5. **Theoretical Discussion**: Introduce facilitators to **Polyvagal Theory**, **Self-Efficacy**, and other key frameworks that explain how to create optimal conditions for growth. Encourage discussion on how these theories could inspire new activities in participants' specific contexts.\n6. **Wrap-Up and Feedback**: Reflect on the workshop’s key insights and provide a feedback form for participants.\n\n#### **Outcome**\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will understand the theoretical basis for promoting PTG and resilience, and they will have a toolkit of practical modifications they can integrate into their existing courses. Facilitators will feel empowered to design their own activities, creating a classroom environment that nurtures belonging, resilience, and growth without adding extra work.\n\n#### **Contact Information**\nFor further details, please contact: [partner@bloom.pm](mailto:partner@bloom.pm)\n\n---\n\nThis updated version includes the theoretical underpinnings that support PTG, ensuring facilitators understand not only what to do but why, so they feel confident in adapting and innovating their approaches. Let me know if this meets your needs or if there's anything more you'd like to include.",

The concept of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) suggests that, under the right conditions, individuals can come out of traumatic experiences with greater resilience, a deeper sense of personal strength, improved relationships, and a renewed appreciation for life.\nTheoretical Underpinnings: This workshop will introduce facilitators to key theories, such as Polyvagal Theory and Self-Efficacy, which explain how creating conditions of safety, belonging, and agency can support growth beyond just resilience. These theories will empower facilitators to adapt their existing practices and even invent new methods tailored to their unique teaching environments.\nBelonging and Cooperation:\n\nModern education's competitive nature can often undermine belonging. This workshop will focus on how to modify existing activities to emphasize cooperation, collaboration, and a sense of belonging—all critical for fostering resilience and PTG.\nFacilitators will learn techniques to create an environment where students feel valued and connected, which is foundational for resilience. This includes transforming group work into cooperative learning and encouraging peer support rather than competition.\nMeta-Pedagogies for Growth:\n\nMovement and Interaction: Facilitate movement during lessons—such as paired \"walk and talk\" discussions—helping students reduce tension and form connections. Movement enhances regulation of the nervous system, which is crucial for creating the conditions for PTG.\nReflective Practices Embedded in Learning: Encourage reflection as part of existing lessons. For example, after completing an assignment, ask students to reflect on their emotional journey through the task. This helps in building narrative reconstruction, an important component of PTG.\nIndirect Storytelling: Replace direct storytelling about trauma with storytelling related to learning challenges. Students can tell stories about the process of solving problems, celebrating both struggles and successes. This approach helps build resilience without the emotional burden of directly addressing their trauma.\nEmpowering Facilitators with Theoretical Knowledge:\n\nUnderstanding the conditions that promote PTG—such as a sense of agency, strong social support, and reflective narrative construction—will enable facilitators to innovate. They will be equipped not only with ready-made strategies but also with the underlying principles to design new, context-specific activities that support their students' growth.",

This workshop will show how to shift from competitive to cooperative learning, where students feel valued and connected, promoting both resilience and PTG.\n\n- **Meta-Pedagogies for Growth**:\n  - **Movement and Interaction**: Incorporate movement to reduce tension and promote connection (e.g., \"walk and talk\" discussions).\n  - **Reflective Practices Embedded in Learning**: Embed reflective moments in lessons to help students process their emotions.\n  - **Indirect Storytelling**: Focus on storytelling related to learning challenges to build resilience without directly addressing trauma.\n\n#### **Workshop Structure (Two 2-hour Remote Sessions)**\n\n**Session 1: Practical Approaches to Building Resilience**\n\n- **Introduction (15 minutes)**\n  - Welcome participants and introduce the focus on resilience and creating safe learning spaces.\n\n- **Introduction to Practices (30 minutes)**\n  - Guide participants through practical methods like grounding exercises, mindfulness, and cooperative activities to create safety and stability.\n\n- **Theory Overview (15 minutes)**\n  - Share a concise overview of **Polyvagal Theory**, **Self-Efficacy**, and **Narrative Reconstruction**, highlighting their relevance to promoting PTG.\n\n- **Interactive Sharing and Breakout Workshop (60 minutes)**\n  - Educators share their current activities and challenges.\n  - Work collectively in breakout groups to modify a specific lesson or activity, integrating resilience and PTG-promoting practices.\n\n**Session 2: Reviewing Progress and Deepening Understanding**\n\n- **Review and Feedback (30 minutes)**\n  - Discuss results from the previous week’s implementation.\n  - Educators share their experiences, successes, and challenges.\n\n- **Reinforcing Key Principles (30 minutes)**\n  - Review core concepts like **Self-Efficacy**, **Belonging**, and **Narrative Reconstruction**.\n  - Introduce a few more practices that promote these principles in the classroom.\n\n- **Curriculum Modification Iteration (45 minutes)**\n  - In breakouts, educators refine their activities based on insights from the past week.\n  - Trainers support participants in enhancing their curriculum with new resilience-promoting practices.\n\n- **Conclusion and Next Steps (15 minutes)**\n  - Wrap-up discussion and planning for continued implementation.\n  - Provide additional resources for learning and support.\n\n#### **Key Features**\n- **Culturally Sensitive Content**: Delivered in Arabic, adapted to local traditions.\n- **Focus on Safety and Immediate Coping**: Prioritize stabilization and resilience.\n- **Non-Verbal Expression**: Emphasize art, music, and movement-based activities to process experiences indirectly.\n- **Flexible and Low-Resource**: Activities are adaptable to unpredictable environments, ensuring continuity.\n- **Support for Educators**: Balance between supporting students and maintaining educator well-being.\n\n#### **Expected Outcomes**\n- **Safe Learning Environments**: Enhanced ability to create supportive and predictable classroom environments.\n- **Resilience-Building Activities**: Increased repertoire of practical activities to promote resilience.\n- **Improved Emotional Regulation**: Better regulation skills for both educators and students.\n- **Community Among Educators**: Strengthened peer support systems among teachers.\n- **Foundation for Future Growth**: Lay the groundwork for potential post-traumatic growth, recognizing growth may not be immediately visible.\n\n#### **Note**\nThis workshop acknowledges the ongoing nature of trauma in Gaza. While it introduces concepts related to post-traumatic growth, it prioritizes immediate safety, coping, and resilience-building. Growth is presented as a possibility for the future, not an expectation.\n\n#### **Contact Information**\nFor further details, please contact: [partner@bloom.pm](mailto:partner@bloom.pm)\n\n---\n\nThis version incorporates a more concise start, and aligns with the updated structure that focuses on practicing methods, sharing the theoretical background, and facilitating collective breakout workshops. Let me know if this captures your vision or if further refinements are needed.",

The session will include interactive sessions with trainers to learn about their current activities and then breakouts to workshop their activities, identifying ways to integrate resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) promoting practices. In the second week, the workshop will focus on reviewing the results of their attempts, reminding participants about the principles of self-efficacy, belonging, and narrative reconstruction, and introducing a few more practices. The week two session will also include another round of curriculum modification suggestions.",
