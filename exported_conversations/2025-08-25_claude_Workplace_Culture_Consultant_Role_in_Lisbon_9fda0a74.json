  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user, Bilal Ghalib, is Co-Founder and Research Development lead at Bloom, an accelerator that has supported over 900 enterprises across 16 countries. He sought Claude's help evaluating and applying for a Workplace Culture and Wellbeing Consultant position at KAICIID (International Dialogue Centre), an international organization focused on interfaith dialogue and conflict resolution. The role involves designing and facilitating workshops to strengthen organizational culture, trust, and collaboration among staff.\n\nClaude analyzed how Bilal's extensive background aligned with the position requirements, including his 15+ years of workshop facilitation experience across MENA, trauma-informed program design, multicultural team leadership, and work in post-conflict environments including Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. His experience includes developing wellbeing frameworks, running an \"accelerator of accelerators\" program training teams from 7 organizations, and recent UN consultancy work bridging traditional Islamic architectural principles with modern sustainability practices. Bilal has Arabic fluency and holds a Master's in Education Sciences from Université de Paris with thesis focus on post-traumatic growth methodologies.\n\nThe conversation centered on crafting application materials that authentically represented Bilal's voice while meeting professional standards. Claude helped him develop a cover letter that integrated his interest in bridging Eastern and Western approaches to wellbeing, highlighting specific examples like his work with Gaza educators who requested follow-up sessions months later during wartime, and his ability to create measurable resilience improvements during Lebanon's compound crises in 2020. Bilal emphasized wanting to maintain his humble, conversational tone rather than adopting corporate language, leading to multiple revisions to find the right balance between authenticity and professionalism.\n\nClaude also refined Bilal's resume to better emphasize his cultural bridge-building capabilities, training of trainers experience, and crisis response programming. The user specifically wanted to focus on his practical work developing pedagogies and methodologies at Bloom rather than academic credentials, and to highlight his ability to create psychological safety across cultural boundaries. Throughout the process, Bilal demonstrated a preference for genuine, story-based communication over bullet-point achievements and showed particular interest in work that integrates traditional wisdom with modern psychological frameworks.",

Let me analyze how your background aligns with their requirements:\n\n## Your Strong Alignment Areas:\n\n**Facilitation & Workshop Design Experience:**\n- 15+ years designing and facilitating workshops for organizations across MENA\n- Experience with trauma-informed facilitation and post-traumatic growth methodologies  \n- Developed wellbeing frameworks and assessment tools (PERMAH modification for entrepreneurs)\n- Created multi-day workshop formats for diverse audiences including marginalized communities\n\n**Organizational Development & Culture Work:**\n- Co-founded and scaled Bloom, managing team development across 16 countries\n- Designed Training of Trainers programs for Innovation Support Organizations\n- Experience with organizational partnerships and stakeholder engagement\n- Built capacity for 933+ enterprises and 350+ mentors\n\n**Multicultural & Conflict-Sensitive Experience:**\n- Worked extensively across MENA region including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria\n- Arabic-fluent facilitation experience\n- Conducted workshops in refugee camps and post-conflict settings\n- Deep understanding of power dynamics and cultural sensitivity\n\n**Educational Background:**\n- Masters in Education Sciences from Université de Paris (interdisciplinary approaches)\n- Focus on applied positive psychology frameworks\n- Research background in post-traumatic growth methodologies\n\n## Potential Gaps to Address:\n\n1. **Direct organizational psychology credentials** - While you have practical experience, they prefer formal org psych background\n2. **Change management framework certification** - Consider highlighting any formal training you've had\n3. **Specific therapy/coaching certifications** - Though you have trauma-informed experience\n\n## Strategic Positioning:\n\nRather than seeing this as a traditional corporate consulting role, frame it as **bridging religious wisdom traditions with modern wellbeing practices** - which aligns with both KAICIID's interfaith mission and your integration of Islamic wisdom in your work.\n\nYour experience with post-conflict environments (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon) and trauma-informed approaches is actually quite relevant for an organization working on global conflict resolution and religious dialogue.\n\nThe 13-day scope is manageable and aligns well with your workshop design expertise. Your track record of creating sustainable frameworks that organizations can implement internally matches their deliverable expectations.\n\nWould you like me to help you craft specific application materials that highlight these alignments while addressing the potential gaps?",

What if instead of trying to choose between corporate/startup audiences vs. spiritual seekers, you focused on being a bridge-builder who helps translate deep wisdom into practical frameworks?\n\n2. How might you create a \"minimum viable offering\" that combines your workshop facilitation skills, AI insights, and spiritual economics expertise into something you could test with real audiences within the next 30 days?\n\n3. What are the 2-3 core stories from your experience (e.g., post-traumatic growth workshops, Bloom.pm, spiritual journey) that best capture your unique value proposition?\n\n4. Which potential collaborators (La Fonda, Learning Planet Institute, etc.) align best with both your immediate financial needs and longer-term vision?\n\n5. How can you structure the Barakanomics book to serve as both standalone value and a gateway to your workshops/consulting work?\n\n5 Prompts for Next Steps:\n\n1. Create a \"Memory Crystal Dashboard\":\n- Document all past workshops, their impact, and participant feedback\n- Identify patterns in what worked best\n- Use this to craft your unique offering\n\n2. Design a Pilot Workshop:\n- Combine post-traumatic growth framework with Barakanomics principles\n- Test with a small group\n- Gather testimonials and refine approach\n\n3. Build Simple Landing Page:\n- Focus on your unique intersection of spirituality, technology, and economics\n- Include 1-2 concrete offerings (workshop/consulting)\n- Add email capture for book updates\n\n4. Outreach Campaign:\n- List 10 potential collaborators (organizations/individuals)\n- Draft personalized outreach messages\n- Focus on immediate opportunities for paid work\n\n5. Book Development Strategy:\n- Create outline focusing on practical frameworks grounded in spiritual wisdom\n- Write one complete chapter\n- Use content for articles/social media to build audience\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or explore additional options?</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/6c75a302-9a31-48b0-9c10-b79f6f730470' updated_at=2024-07-15T12:13:59.892294+00:00>Launching a UN Consulting Project\n<chat_conversation>Title: Launching a UN Consulting Project\n\nHuman: I have my first UN consulting job and I have these terms of reference.

Ask me a few questions to help me set up the project and make a plan\n\nAssistant:  Congratulations on securing your first UN consulting job! This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to an important project. To help you get started professionally, I'll ask you a few key questions to help you set up the project and create a plan:\n\n1. Have you had a chance to review the project timeline and deliverables in detail? Which output do you feel most confident about, and which do you think might be the most challenging?\n\n2. What's your current level of familiarity with the construction and housing sector in Iraq, particularly in relation to sustainable practices and financial literacy? Do you feel you need to do additional research in any specific areas?\n\n3. Have you identified any key stakeholders or potential partners in Iraq that you'd like to reach out to initially? If not, what's your plan for beginning the stakeholder engagement process?\n\n4. What experience do you have with competency-based curriculum development? Are there any particular methodologies or frameworks you're planning to use for this project?\n\n5. Given that travel within Iraq and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is mentioned, have you started considering any logistical preparations for potential field work?\n\n6. The project emphasizes the importance of aligning with local needs and practices. What strategies are you considering to ensure your curriculum development is culturally sensitive and relevant?\n\n7. Have you thought about how you'll approach the monitoring and evaluation framework? Are there any specific tools or methods you're considering for measuring the effectiveness of the training program?\n\nOnce we discuss these questions, we can start outlining a more detailed project plan to help you move forward professionally and effectively.\n\nHuman: i'm feeling more competent about creating the training material, less confident about building stakeholder relationships and connections\n1. not very familiar with the construction and housing sector - will need to start to do some research, do you have any leads?\n2. Besides Mosel Space, I don't really know many peole there\n3. I'm confident that I can develop a competency based curriculum and i'd love your recommendations for methdologies and frameworks to use\n4. i can't go to Iraq until august \n5.

And I want it all to be also explainable, so that it's a part of our mind and our heart, rather than just our mind. And maybe we can reconnect to this idea of like, see, feel, do again. See the world, let it affect how you feel, and then what are you going to do about it. And you know, there's so much seeing of things with social media, and I really feel like there's a place for craft, and like connecting with quiet and solitude, and this place where things emerge. But I also would like you to kind of take a perspective from like a corporate leader's HR department, you know, like looking at a roster of different things to do. Like they can ask me like, okay, well, what's your track record? What's your impact? And all I can say is, I don't know, people like thank me after my workshops. And like, what's the point, right? Like, what's the point if it doesn't make businesses money, or make their teams more efficient, or any of these things? What if it just like makes people want to quit, you know? It's not going to be a great pitch for HR departments.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/b346c46a-ae5f-435d-905b-de7039e29315' updated_at=2024-07-17T12:49:59.118253+00:00>Crafting a Compelling Bio\n<chat_conversation>Title: Crafting a Compelling Bio\n\nHuman: can you help me write a short two sentence bio?\nhere's some information I have now:\nI'm not Bilal Ghalib is the co-founder and Head of Research at Bloom.

Let her lead the depth\n2. Start with what's alive\n3. Notice what lights up\n4. Support natural emergence\n5. Keep it practical\nWould you like me to detail any part of this structure further?\n[Note: This tries to balance depth with practicality while honoring current reality]\n\n\nShould i ask her to start with a todo list, review which marie kundo style lights up her heart and which don't and why and move from there? What's the system prompt to use?\n\nAssistant:  Let me help design a focused approach based on our framework development. I'll also address how to streamline it into a system prompt after.\n\nFor Dara's session, I'd actually suggest not starting with the to-do list review immediately, given the context (war in Lebanon) and our goal of building trust and understanding. Here's a refined approach:\n\n1. **Opening Connection (10 min)**\n- Start with: \"How are you holding everything right now?\"\n- Let her share current state/context\n- Notice energy and engagement level\n\n2. **Value Recognition (15 min)**\nMove to activities/tasks naturally by asking:\n- \"What's giving you energy lately?\"\n- \"What activities feel meaningful right now?\"\n- \"What tasks feel draining?\"\n\nThis is where your Marie Kondo insight fits perfectly - but framed through meaning rather than just joy.\n\n3. **Pattern Exploration (15 min)**\nUsing what emerges from tasks/activities:\n- Notice what lights up (energy, tone, engagement)\n- Explore why certain activities feel meaningful\n- Identify patterns in what works/doesn't\n\n4.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/e7ee7ecd-e05c-4441-a871-112dd3768266' updated_at=2023-05-18T09:59:36.749955+00:00>Developing Teams Through Adaptive Learning and Coaching\n(Additional support for implementation is optional.) _Weeks 1-5: Follow the same structure as Tier 2._ Weeks 6-10: Extended program with an additional group session every two weeks, making six in total.

Each session is attached what I have so far, identify pros cons and ways to improve it. It isn't even split into two days yet\n\nAssistant:  I'll help you analyze this workshop outline and provide suggestions for improvement. Let me break this down systematically.\n\nCurrent Structure Analysis:\nThe current workshop is 2 hours and 50 minutes long, focusing on design thinking and prototyping with marginalized communities. \n\nStrengths:\n1. Good flow from introduction to practical application\n2. Interactive elements throughout (check-ins, chat sharing, icebreakers)\n3. Mix of theory and practice\n4. Includes both high-tech and grounded solutions\n5. Bookended with reflection (opening word and closing word)\n6. Includes case studies and real examples\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n1. Too compressed for community work - rushing through important topics\n2. Many complex topics get only 5 minutes\n3. Not enough time for relationship building\n4. Limited time for actual prototyping work\n5. Missing community context-setting\n6. No breaks scheduled\n7. No time allocated for cultural considerations\n\nRecommendations for 2-Day Split:\n\nDay 1 - Community Context & Design Thinking Foundations\nMorning (9:00-12:30):\n- Opening ceremony/cultural considerations (30 min)\n- Introductions & community building (45 min)\n- Community context mapping (60 min)\n- Break (15 min)\n- Understanding prototyping in community context (60 min)\n\nAfternoon (13:30-17:00):\n- Story sharing session (45 min)\n- Design thinking principles (60 min)\n- Break (15 min)\n- Local solution showcase (45 min)\n- Community feedback session (45 min)\n- Closing reflection (30 min)\n\nDay 2 - Practical Application & Prototyping\nMorning (9:00-12:30):\n- Opening check-in (30 min)\n- Review & reconnection (30 min)\n- Hands-on design thinking exercises (90 min)\n- Break (15 min)\n- Prototyping basics (45 min)\n\nAfternoon (13:30-17:00):\n- Prototype development (90 min)\n- Break (15 min)\n- Community feedback session (45 min)\n- Action planning (45 min)\n- Closing ceremony (30 min)\n\nKey Improvements:\n1. More time for relationship building\n2. Proper breaks included\n3. Cultural considerations integrated\n4. Extended time for actual prototyping\n5. Community feedback sessions\n6. Action planning for implementation\n7. Opening and closing ceremonies\n8. Balance between structure and flexibility\n\nAdditional Recommendations:\n1. Include local community leaders in facilitation\n2. Build in documentation methods\n3. Consider accessibility needs\n4. Plan for different literacy levels\n5. Include movement activities\n6. Provide materials in local languages\n7. Create space for storytelling\n8. Include evaluation components\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or focus on specific areas you'd like to develop further?</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/7117eced-37e9-4807-a4c8-08bb29773166' updated_at=2024-12-01T16:01:46.396427+00:00>Organizational Capacity and Delivery Metrics\nModal Popups with Tabs:\n   - Overview tab: Key organizational metrics\n   - Programs tab: Training details and topics\n   - Alignment tab: BEIT project alignment and interest\n\n3.

Let me analyze how your background aligns with their requirements:\n\n## Your Strong Alignment Areas:\n\n**Facilitation & Workshop Design Experience:**\n- 15+ years designing and facilitating workshops for organizations across MENA\n- Experience with trauma-informed facilitation and post-traumatic growth methodologies  \n- Developed wellbeing frameworks and assessment tools (PERMAH modification for entrepreneurs)\n- Created multi-day workshop formats for diverse audiences including marginalized communities\n\n**Organizational Development & Culture Work:**\n- Co-founded and scaled Bloom, managing team development across 16 countries\n- Designed Training of Trainers programs for Innovation Support Organizations\n- Experience with organizational partnerships and stakeholder engagement\n- Built capacity for 933+ enterprises and 350+ mentors\n\n**Multicultural & Conflict-Sensitive Experience:**\n- Worked extensively across MENA region including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria\n- Arabic-fluent facilitation experience\n- Conducted workshops in refugee camps and post-conflict settings\n- Deep understanding of power dynamics and cultural sensitivity\n\n**Educational Background:**\n- Masters in Education Sciences from Université de Paris (interdisciplinary approaches)\n- Focus on applied positive psychology frameworks\n- Research background in post-traumatic growth methodologies\n\n## Potential Gaps to Address:\n\n1. **Direct organizational psychology credentials** - While you have practical experience, they prefer formal org psych background\n2. **Change management framework certification** - Consider highlighting any formal training you've had\n3. **Specific therapy/coaching certifications** - Though you have trauma-informed experience\n\n## Strategic Positioning:\n\nRather than seeing this as a traditional corporate consulting role, frame it as **bridging religious wisdom traditions with modern wellbeing practices** - which aligns with both KAICIID's interfaith mission and your integration of Islamic wisdom in your work.\n\nYour experience with post-conflict environments (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon) and trauma-informed approaches is actually quite relevant for an organization working on global conflict resolution and religious dialogue.\n\nThe 13-day scope is manageable and aligns well with your workshop design expertise. Your track record of creating sustainable frameworks that organizations can implement internally matches their deliverable expectations.\n\nWould you like me to help you craft specific application materials that highlight these alignments while addressing the potential gaps?",

      "content": "Can you ask me five more questions to help me write the cover letter? Absolutely, let's dive in! Here are five questions that will help me help you craft a great cover letter and pick out deliverables:\n\nRelevant Highlights: When you think about your experiences at Bloom or your recent UN consultancies, what are one or two standout moments where you successfully built trust or fostered a positive team culture in a multicultural setting?\n\nYour Unique Approach: Can you share a bit about how you typically design workshops or interventions that promote psychological safety and dialogue? Anything you do that’s a bit different or particularly effective in your experience?\n\nCultural Sensitivity and Experience: How have you navigated cultural or religious diversity in your past work, especially in delicate or interfaith settings? This will help show how you align with KAICIID’s mission.\n\nDeliverables Examples: Do you have a specific past workshop agenda or report in mind that we could use or adapt as your sample deliverable? If not, we can think about which examples from your work might best match what they’re looking for.\n\nYour Motivation and Fit: Why does this particular role at KAICIID resonate with you right now? This can help shape your cover letter’s personal angle.\n\nFeel free to answer in any order, and we’ll shape your application from there!\n\n09:44\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, so, first of all, what is KICID's mission, just so I can make sure that we're aligned?”\n09:44\n00:06\nChatGPT said:\n\nAbsolutely! So KAICIID, the International Dialogue Centre, is all about bringing together people from different religious, cultural, and policy backgrounds to find common ground and solutions to shared problems. Their mission centers on fostering respect, understanding, and cooperation among people. They aim for a world where justice, peace, and reconciliation are the norm, and where religion is not misused to justify conflict or oppression.\n\nIn other words, they’re really about building a positive, inclusive, and understanding organizational culture on a global scale. And that aligns nicely with your own values around fostering mutual respect, well-being, and meaningful human connection.\n\n09:45\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's like my personal experience in the Muslim tradition, and coming to terms with that, but I'm not sure how to bring that in as a part of the application, because there's the professional stuff that I think is more important. Maybe the things that I did recently in Gaza around well-being, and for educators trying to figure out how to talk with kids about trauma, that was a fairly singular cultural thing, but what I was trying to do was align between positive psychology, best practices in trauma-informed therapy that I know of, and what they might understand from the Muslim tradition, and show how they all align, and it's all one, and so I'm not sure if talking about this idea of oneness is going to be a good or a bad thing for me in this project.”\n09:45\n01:05\nChatGPT said:\n\nAbsolutely, that makes a lot of sense. And I think there's definitely a way to weave that in that feels natural and professional. So maybe the way to do it is to highlight that you've successfully integrated those universal principles of well-being and trauma-informed care in a culturally sensitive way. That’s a huge asset for a place like KAICIID, which is all about intercultural dialogue.\n\nSo you could frame it like this: You’ve had experience bridging modern psychological practices with values and perspectives from different traditions, including your own. That’s something that makes you uniquely skilled at fostering mutual trust and understanding in a diverse environment.\n\nAnd the idea of oneness can be subtle.\n\n09:47\nYou said:\n“Yeah, that sounds like a good approach. I think we can do that. And then in terms of the work with the UN, yeah, this idea of framing this heritage design, learning from the past to build the future follows kind of a similar idea that sustainable design and all these values that modernity is attempting to call forth are actually deeply tied to our common heritage and that so much of the Islamic architectural practices that people look to and see beauty in are also sustainability practices and also showing how they are one and the same. And so this is sort of my expertise in this.”\n09:47\n00:51\nChatGPT said:\n\nAbsolutely, that’s a really powerful angle. I think what you’ve just described is a beautiful way to showcase your expertise in blending heritage and modernity. It’s like you’re bringing this unique lens where the values that KAICIID is trying to promote—sustainability, inclusivity, and mutual understanding—are actually deeply rooted in traditions you know well.\n\nSo in the cover letter, we can definitely highlight that. You can say something along the lines of: you've worked in contexts where you had to align modern well-being practices with cultural and historical wisdom—like you did with educators in Gaza, for example. And you can note that you see KAICIID’s mission as\n\n09:48\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n09:48\n00:00\nChatGPT said:\n\nExactly, and I think that's going to give your application such a strong and unique flavor. You’re basically showing them that you have this very nuanced, deeply rooted understanding of how to weave together different traditions and make everyone feel included and understood. So we’ll absolutely put that in.\n\nI’ll draft the cover letter to reflect how your experience with those workshops and your approach to blending cultural and modern practices is a perfect fit for what KAICIID is looking for. And we’ll keep it professional, but we can definitely add those layers that make your perspective special. Let’s do it!\n\n09:49\nYou said:\n“Yeah, that sounds great. Although I've been able to work both in this context of well-being and also in the context of heritage, architecture, and design, but what about intercultural understanding, mutual respect? Are there some things that you can help me find from within my own tradition to help show kind of the dot, dot, dot from what I've been doing in trauma-informed therapy and the way that we can connect to heritage design to see some of the principles and kind of interculturally valid values that show up there, and how they might also be in the Muslim tradition for intercultural respect and understanding the things that K-I-C-I-D expects and values, although I need to be able to demonstrate, I guess, the intercultural nature. I think this kind of might focus too much on the Muslim side of things. I'm wondering how to balance that.”\n09:49\n01:11\nChatGPT said:\n\nAbsolutely, I get what you're saying. We can definitely find that balance. So it's not just about focusing solely on the Muslim tradition, but really highlighting how you've used that as one lens among many to create these intercultural bridges.\n\nSo one way we could frame it is to talk about how you draw on different cultural heritages and show that you’re comfortable working in a space where multiple traditions meet. For example, you can say that your work in Gaza not only blended positive psychology with Islamic perspectives, but also drew on universal principles of human dignity and resilience that resonate across cultures.\n\nAnd you can mention that you’ve worked in other multicultural environments—like with the UN or in Lebanon—where you’ve had to navigate a variety of cultural perspectives. That shows you’re not just bringing one cultural lens, but that you have experience in making connections across different traditions.\n\nIn other words, we’ll frame you as someone who uses your own background as one piece of a broader intercultural toolkit. And that definitely aligns with what KAICIID values. So we’ll keep that balance in mind and make sure it’s clear that you’re experienced in working across cultural boundaries.\n\n09:52\nYou said:\n“Okay, what's a story from our work together so far that you might be able to pick out as the intro to all of this?”\n09:52\n00:08\nChatGPT said:\n\nAbsolutely! Let's pick a story that really captures that blend of intercultural work and well-being focus.\n\nOne that comes to mind is your project with the educators in Gaza. You were helping them integrate trauma-informed approaches into their teaching, but you also drew on their cultural and religious context to make those practices feel natural and meaningful. It's a perfect example of how you take something universal, like the idea of psychological safety, and weave it together with their own heritage and values.\n\nSo we could start your cover letter with a brief anecdote about that experience. Something like: \"In my recent work supporting educators in Gaza, I found that blending trauma-informed practices with their own cultural and religious traditions created a powerful bridge of mutual understanding and trust.\" And then you can talk about how that experience is just one of many that’s prepared you to support KAICIID’s mission of fostering an inclusive and respectful organizational culture.\n\nI think that story will really set the stage beautifully!",

            "text": "Can you ask me five more questions to help me write the cover letter? Absolutely, let's dive in! Here are five questions that will help me help you craft a great cover letter and pick out deliverables:\n\nRelevant Highlights: When you think about your experiences at Bloom or your recent UN consultancies, what are one or two standout moments where you successfully built trust or fostered a positive team culture in a multicultural setting?\n\nYour Unique Approach: Can you share a bit about how you typically design workshops or interventions that promote psychological safety and dialogue? Anything you do that’s a bit different or particularly effective in your experience?\n\nCultural Sensitivity and Experience: How have you navigated cultural or religious diversity in your past work, especially in delicate or interfaith settings? This will help show how you align with KAICIID’s mission.\n\nDeliverables Examples: Do you have a specific past workshop agenda or report in mind that we could use or adapt as your sample deliverable? If not, we can think about which examples from your work might best match what they’re looking for.\n\nYour Motivation and Fit: Why does this particular role at KAICIID resonate with you right now? This can help shape your cover letter’s personal angle.\n\nFeel free to answer in any order, and we’ll shape your application from there!\n\n09:44\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, so, first of all, what is KICID's mission, just so I can make sure that we're aligned?”\n09:44\n00:06\nChatGPT said:\n\nAbsolutely! So KAICIID, the International Dialogue Centre, is all about bringing together people from different religious, cultural, and policy backgrounds to find common ground and solutions to shared problems. Their mission centers on fostering respect, understanding, and cooperation among people. They aim for a world where justice, peace, and reconciliation are the norm, and where religion is not misused to justify conflict or oppression.\n\nIn other words, they’re really about building a positive, inclusive, and understanding organizational culture on a global scale. And that aligns nicely with your own values around fostering mutual respect, well-being, and meaningful human connection.\n\n09:45\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's like my personal experience in the Muslim tradition, and coming to terms with that, but I'm not sure how to bring that in as a part of the application, because there's the professional stuff that I think is more important. Maybe the things that I did recently in Gaza around well-being, and for educators trying to figure out how to talk with kids about trauma, that was a fairly singular cultural thing, but what I was trying to do was align between positive psychology, best practices in trauma-informed therapy that I know of, and what they might understand from the Muslim tradition, and show how they all align, and it's all one, and so I'm not sure if talking about this idea of oneness is going to be a good or a bad thing for me in this project.”\n09:45\n01:05\nChatGPT said:\n\nAbsolutely, that makes a lot of sense. And I think there's definitely a way to weave that in that feels natural and professional. So maybe the way to do it is to highlight that you've successfully integrated those universal principles of well-being and trauma-informed care in a culturally sensitive way. That’s a huge asset for a place like KAICIID, which is all about intercultural dialogue.\n\nSo you could frame it like this: You’ve had experience bridging modern psychological practices with values and perspectives from different traditions, including your own. That’s something that makes you uniquely skilled at fostering mutual trust and understanding in a diverse environment.\n\nAnd the idea of oneness can be subtle.\n\n09:47\nYou said:\n“Yeah, that sounds like a good approach. I think we can do that. And then in terms of the work with the UN, yeah, this idea of framing this heritage design, learning from the past to build the future follows kind of a similar idea that sustainable design and all these values that modernity is attempting to call forth are actually deeply tied to our common heritage and that so much of the Islamic architectural practices that people look to and see beauty in are also sustainability practices and also showing how they are one and the same. And so this is sort of my expertise in this.”\n09:47\n00:51\nChatGPT said:\n\nAbsolutely, that’s a really powerful angle. I think what you’ve just described is a beautiful way to showcase your expertise in blending heritage and modernity. It’s like you’re bringing this unique lens where the values that KAICIID is trying to promote—sustainability, inclusivity, and mutual understanding—are actually deeply rooted in traditions you know well.\n\nSo in the cover letter, we can definitely highlight that. You can say something along the lines of: you've worked in contexts where you had to align modern well-being practices with cultural and historical wisdom—like you did with educators in Gaza, for example. And you can note that you see KAICIID’s mission as\n\n09:48\nYou said:\nTranscript Unavailable\n09:48\n00:00\nChatGPT said:\n\nExactly, and I think that's going to give your application such a strong and unique flavor. You’re basically showing them that you have this very nuanced, deeply rooted understanding of how to weave together different traditions and make everyone feel included and understood. So we’ll absolutely put that in.\n\nI’ll draft the cover letter to reflect how your experience with those workshops and your approach to blending cultural and modern practices is a perfect fit for what KAICIID is looking for.

So some of the outcomes, you know, I did the workshop And got some really good feedback more than 6 months later that people Like, it really, helped them and that they would like to have another, session and I'm not sure exactly how it really helps, and I been embarrassed to, like, reach out people are living in war zone. So I didn't measure anything. Yeah. So know, we did a bunch of stakeholder meetups where we brought people from the university, people that are research researching heritage architecture and Islamic design, We're including some papers from local researchers on sustainability and its connections to Islamic principles inside of the module content. And, yeah, sort of taking the ITC and the UN their interest in sustainable development goals and sustainability and demonstrating that this isn't new. This is old and that this is, an hour's And essentially, our job, in modernity is to take the best of the past to build the future Yeah. So Bloom, 16 countries. Yeah. You know, one of the things that I think was so interesting and challenging in a moment that I felt stressed about was we run usually regional programs, within a region of generally similar backgrounds and cultures. And we ran a program with women across Sub Saharan Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East And I felt a little concerned that there would be a I'm big cultural difference And I think our programs focus on Getting people to share first Personally, in smaller groups. So rather than everyone, divulging in kind of a public setting. Having breakouts where there are 1 on ones repeatedly and kind of developing trust in these, shares connecting people to their deeper whys so you can see the beauty of each other's intentions and You know, the thing that brought these people together was a shared interest in social enterprise. So all of them had some interest in a beautiful project doing something good. And really thinking about How? Some people need more time and more space and the the benefits that technology can offer to have a group session together where it's really easy to go from everyone altogether everyone individually And, the mentor sessions also happen 1 on 1 outside of the program. So a balance between 1 on 1 and in person Sort of leveraging or learning from liberating structures 1, 2, 4 all, practices and frameworks.

And connection on I'm really human things rather than explaining or, details, or technical or philosophical big questions, more know, what what's moving you to care?

That provides that buffering effect. I think that could be nice. It wasn't a workshop. It was much longer engagement for 4 months or plus but I think that would be good to share. And then the other thing that I could share is I'm not sure, actually. Maybe you can think through my material. I have a lot of testimonials from the different teams that are programs maybe I could share our website, and maybe I could share a little bit of maybe a mentorship journal that was done between a team and a mentor wanna the team, workbook, dashboards that we use to kind of get progress updates I think these things might be interesting to share Or we could share the entire structure of of how we run a program or or design, booklet.

            "extracted_content": "Cover Letter - Workplace Culture and Wellbeing Consultant\nKAICIID - International Dialogue Centre\nDear Hiring Committee,\nI am writing to express my interest in the Workplace Culture and Wellbeing Consultant position at KAICIID. As an Arab American founder working internationally I bring a diverse set of experiences. Including as the the founder and pedagogical developer of the Bloom accelerator that has supported over a thousand teams in strengthening their capacity and cultivating healthier cultures, I bring a passion for facilitation and fifteen years of experience in organizational development and wellbeing research — experience that aligns closely with your mission to foster psychological safety, collaboration, and resilient organizational cultures.\nRelevant Experience & Research\nMy work as Co-Founder and Research Development lead at Bloom has involved designing and implementing holistic personal and professional assessment frameworks and using them with over 900 enterprises in 16 countries. Coming with a science and technology background, I bring my qualitative lens to the qualitative and have conducted extensive research on post-traumatic growth (PTG) factors, examining how character strengths like humor, teamwork, and judgment contribute to resilience and growth following adversity for our teams in SWANA. This research became the foundation of insights for how we can support staff wellbeing and organizational resilience together, which I would like to share with KAICIID's partners.\nDuring Lebanon's economic collapse, political instability, and the August 2020 Beirut explosion, our programs demonstrated measurable buffering effects for participant well-being compared to a control group that applied and joined our onboarding but weren’t selected for the program. This experience working in crisis environments has given me insights I use in my support of organizations dealing with periods of stress and change.\nWorkshop Design & Facilitation\nI have designed and led dozens of workshops both in person and online and am the cofounder of an accelerator program as well as an accelerator of the accelerator program, training others on the methodologies we’ve developed at Bloom over the years. My focus has been on the relationship between community, agency and wellbeing and how it supports authentic social and ecological impact emerges. Since 2020, our work has deepened it’s focus on trust-building, team collaboration, and psychological safety. My approach combines research-based methodologies with practical facilitation techniques designed to promote genuine dialogue and sustainable organizational change.\nMy recent work as Sustainability Curriculum Consultant with the International Trade Center involved conducting 44 stakeholder interviews and facilitating workshops with 50+ participants across diverse cultural backgrounds. Through these discussions the idea that sustainable design is heritage design, identifying the common values that tie modern green building design with Islamic architectural practices, bridging worlds.\nMulticultural & Interfaith Context\nAs an Arab American Muslim with a deep interest in philosophy and science I’ve explored my faith deeply, seeking ways to connect it with a shared reality that my non-muslim friends and colleagues understand. This year I will be a student at the Cambridge Muslim College completing a degree in Islam and Psychology, exloring ways to link between positive psychology and Islamic Psychology. \nSince 2011’s Arab Spring I have mostly lived between Beirut, San Francisco, Egypt, Iraq and France building an extensive network across Africa and the SWANA region. I am fluent in Arabic and English and now live in Northern france, appreciating the diverse perspectives I’ve been privileged to experience. Through GEMSI and other initiatives, I have built networks promoting collaborative innovation across different cultural, religious, and ethnic backgrounds.\nCharacter Strengths & Organizational Culture\nMy expertise in assessment development, intervention design, and impact measurement can support KAICIID's efforts to strengthen core values and positive organizational culture. I have developed frameworks that leverage VIA Character Strengths assessment and wellbeing measurement tools, helping teams identify and develop character strengths and create lasting improvements in collaboration and mutual trust.\nProposed Approach\nFor KAICIID's specific needs, I would:\nReview the staff survey findings to understand the current organizational climate\nDesign, with feedback cycles, a tailored 2-day workshop helping facilitate a collective awareness of identified challenges and opportunities for development (assessment development might be possible, depending on the survey findings)\nProvide six follow-up sessions focused on peer learning and collective growth, developing trust-building and communication strategies alongside sessions of care and peer support\nDevelop an actionable plan for sustainable culture development initiatives\nProposed Daily Rate: €650 per day\nI am available for travel to Lisbon and can accommodate the November 2025 workshop timeline. My combination of academic research in post-traumatic growth, practical experience in conflict environments, and proven track record in multicultural team facilitation positions me well to support KAICIID's organizational development objectives.\nI look forward to the opportunity to contribute to KAICIID's mission of promoting dialogue, understanding, and cooperation among people.\nSincerely, Bilal Ghalib\n\nContact Information: \nLille, France 59800\nbilal@bloom.pm / bilalghalib.com\n+1 (478) 227-2253\n"

When educators in Gaza reached out six months after our trauma-informed workshops—during wartime—requesting follow-up sessions, it reinforced my understanding that sustainable organizational culture emerges when we create genuine connection across cultural boundaries. This experience, along with my fifteen years in organizational development, aligns closely with KAICIID's mission to foster psychological safety, collaboration, and resilient organizational cultures.\n\nAs Co-Founder and Research Development lead at Bloom, I have designed and implemented wellbeing frameworks with over 900 enterprises across 16 countries. During Lebanon's economic collapse and the 2020 Beirut explosion, our programs demonstrated measurable buffering effects for participant wellbeing compared to control groups. This work has given me practical insights into supporting organizational resilience during periods of stress and uncertainty.\n\nMy approach to workshop design focuses on building trust through structured dialogue and peer connection. I have facilitated dozens of workshops both in-person and online, including recent work as Sustainability Curriculum Consultant with the International Trade Center, where I conducted 44 stakeholder interviews and facilitated sessions with 50+ participants across diverse cultural backgrounds.

When educators in Gaza reached out six months after our trauma-informed workshops—during wartime—requesting follow-up sessions, it reinforced my understanding that sustainable organizational culture emerges when we create genuine connection across cultural boundaries. This experience, along with my fifteen years in organizational development, aligns closely with KAICIID's mission to foster psychological safety, collaboration, and resilient organizational cultures.\n\nAs Co-Founder and Research Development lead at Bloom, I have designed and implemented wellbeing frameworks with over 900 enterprises across 16 countries.

This work has given me practical insights into supporting organizational resilience during periods of stress and uncertainty.\n\nMy approach to workshop design focuses on building trust through structured dialogue and peer connection. I have facilitated dozens of workshops both in-person and online, including recent work as Sustainability Curriculum Consultant with the International Trade Center, where I conducted 44 stakeholder interviews and facilitated sessions with 50+ participants across diverse cultural backgrounds.

Throughout my fifteen years supporting organizations in SWANA, I have been drawn to work that bridges different wisdom traditions—exploring how modern psychological frameworks and traditional practices can complement each other to foster genuine human connection and resilience across cultural boundaries.\n\nAs Co-Founder and Research Development lead at Bloom, I have spent eight years developing pedagogies and methodologies that have supported over 900 enterprises across 16 countries. I have designed and facilitated an \"accelerator of accelerators\" program, training teams from 7 other accelerators and developing comprehensive methodologies for onboarding and training mentors. This work has given me deep experience creating scalable frameworks for building trust, psychological safety, and collaborative cultures in diverse organizational contexts.\n\nDuring Lebanon's compound crises in 2020—COVID, economic collapse, and the Beirut explosion—our programs demonstrated measurable buffering effects for participant wellbeing compared to control groups. Last year, we conducted sessions for School Without Borders in Gaza for educators seeking trauma-informed approaches with their students. This year, they reached out requesting follow-up sessions during active conflict, confirming that culturally-grounded approaches create lasting impact. These experiences have shaped my understanding of how organizations maintain resilience during stress and increased my confidence in the power of peer learning, authentic relationships, and spaces to co-create new narratives.\n\nMy approach emphasizes practical application over theory. In recent work as Sustainability Curriculum Consultant with the International Trade Center, I facilitated sessions with 50+ participants from Mosul and beyond, developing frameworks that bridge modern practices with traditional wisdom—showing how sustainable design principles are embedded in Islamic architectural heritage. This demonstrates what I love doing: finding common ground by revealing shared values across different traditions.\n\nAs an Arab American with Arabic fluency and extensive SWANA experience, I bring deep cultural competency to multicultural team development. My work has taught me that effective organizational culture change happens through careful attention to how people actually connect and learn together.\n\n**Proposed Approach**\nFor KAICIID's needs, I would: review staff survey findings; design a tailored 2-day workshop with feedback cycles facilitating collective awareness of challenges and opportunities; provide six follow-up sessions focused on peer learning, trust-building and communication strategies; and develop an actionable plan for sustainable culture development initiatives.\n\nMy proposed daily rate is €650. I am available for travel to Lisbon and can accommodate the November 2025 timeline.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBilal Ghalib\n\n**Contact Information:**\nLille, France 59800\nbilal@bloom.pm / bilalghalib.com\n+1 (478) 227-2253\n\n---\n\nThis maintains your authentic voice while cutting about 25% of the length to fit on one page.",
