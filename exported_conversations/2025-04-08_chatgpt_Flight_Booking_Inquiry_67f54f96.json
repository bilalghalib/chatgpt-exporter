Please let me know, thank you :)\nI believe our last meeting was recorded and uploaded here I will watch and catch up with any other updates.

Here's a friendlier and clearer version of your email that gently asks about the flight without sounding pushy:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Quick Check-In About Travel Plans ✈️\n\n**Salam dear Paola and Alejandra,**\n\nI hope you're both having a wonderful start to your week! I'm getting more and more excited about our upcoming time together. I was sad to miss the last session—I was flying to the US to be with my family for Eid celebrations.\n\nLast week, I sent in my bank information for the accommodation grant. I was planning to book my flight today, but Nilam mentioned that a travel agency might be coordinating the arrangements. I haven’t seen anything in my inbox, and I’m not sure of the agency's name—should I wait for them to reach out, or should I go ahead and book the ticket myself?\n\nPlease let me know what you recommend—thank you so much!\n\nI believe our last meeting was recorded, so I’ll watch the recording and catch up. Looking forward to seeing you soon on the call with Dr. Vago, insha’Allah.\n\nWarmly,  \nBilal\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to make it more formal, casual, or add anything personal!",
