My career has focused on building learning spaces where healing and peacebuilding meet, beginning in Egypt during the Arab Spring and continuing in Lebanon and Iraq, where I saw how personal and intergenerational trauma shapes learning and community.\nSince 2016, I have co-founded and led Bloom, a Beirut-based venture development platform serving entrepreneurs and educators across the SWANA region. During the Lebanese economic collapse and after the Beirut Port Explosion, we adapted programs into spaces of shared resilience by combining psychosocial tools, reflective storytelling, and peer-led learning. My graduate research at the Université de Paris, “Post-Traumatic Growth and Social Entrepreneurship in Lebanon,” documented how trauma-informed pedagogy fosters agency and collective healing.\nRecently I conducted Trauma-Informed Teacher Training with School Without Borders in Gaza, where this approach proved useful in very difficult conditions.\nEarlier, with The Nawaya Network (a UNICEF-funded initiative), I designed programs with marginalized youth and refugees in Beirut that restored confidence and connection, confirming that inner wellbeing and outer peacebuilding are inseparable and aligned with Pro Peace’s values.\nIn facilitation I prioritize safety, inclusion, and agency through experiential exercises, reflection circles, and creative methods. I have led 100+ online and hybrid programs in English and Arabic, using digital tools for storytelling and somatic grounding, and I train facilitators to create trauma-sensitive digital environments.\nI plan to co-facilitate with Tudor Tarlev, a colleague I first worked with in 2016; I have since seen his leadership, conflict resolution coaching, and personal development training deepen year after year.\nI am available from January 2026 to help design, deliver, and evaluate the five-week online course, bringing experience from post-crisis work and a framework informed by positive psychology, polyvagal theory, and the Islamic concepts of sabr (resilience) and ihsan (service excellence).\nThe Academy’s holistic and participatory philosophy resonates with my view of peace work as both inner practice and collective action, and I would be honored to support your mission.\nWarm regards,\nBilal Ghalib]]]",

      "content": "This is already a strong and full cover letter. Since you don’t want it longer, the best move is to **swap in** or **tweak phrasing** so the most relevant things about you (that I know from your background) are visible without adding length.  \n\nHere are the **key things you’re missing or could sharpen**:\n\n1. **Scale of experience** → you’ve supported *hundreds of entrepreneurs and educators* across MENA. That number makes your facilitation experience more concrete.  \n   - Suggestion: Instead of “Bloom, a Beirut-based venture development platform serving entrepreneurs and educators across the SWANA region” → “Bloom, a Beirut-based platform through which I have supported hundreds of entrepreneurs and educators across the SWANA region.”  \n\n2. **Trauma + entrepreneurship link** → your thesis and programs explicitly studied *post-traumatic growth in crisis*. Right now it says “documented how trauma-informed pedagogy fosters agency,” but it doesn’t connect to **your published/academic work on PTG**. A quick swap could highlight that unique niche.  \n   - Suggestion: “…documented how trauma-informed pedagogy fosters agency and collective healing” → “…documented how post-traumatic growth practices foster agency and collective healing.”  \n\n3. **Multilingual facilitation** → you already note English and Arabic, but **French** could matter here, given Pro Peace is Bonn-based and European-facing. Even a small phrase can signal this.  \n   - Suggestion: “…100+ online and hybrid programs in English and Arabic” → “…100+ online and hybrid programs in English, Arabic, and French.”  \n\n4. **Your framing gift** → your strength is not just designing but making frameworks usable in messy, real conditions (polycrisis, post-explosion, displacement). That could come out more directly.  \n   - Suggestion: “bringing experience from post-crisis work and a framework informed by positive psychology, polyvagal theory, and the Islamic concepts…” → “bringing practical frameworks tested in post-crisis contexts, informed by positive psychology, polyvagal theory, and the Islamic concepts…”  \n\nIf you want, I can rewrite your version with only swaps (no added length). Do you want me to show you a tightened version with those 4 upgrades baked in?",

Training Concept and Outline\nTrainer: Bilal Ghalib\nTitle: Trauma-Informed Peacebuilding: Humor, Connection, and Storytelling  for Collective Transformation\nFormat: Five-week online thematic training (April 2026)\nLanguage: English (bilingual support in Arabic possible)\nTraining Overview\nThis five-week online training equips peacebuilders to integrate a trauma-informed lens into their professional and personal practice. The training builds on on Bilal Ghalib’s fieldwork working in conflict zones with communities in Refugee Camps in Syria and Lebanon, his training work in Iraq during the civil war, and expecially the research he conducted while working with social entrepreneurs during the Beirut Port Explosion. The course links trauma awareness with non-violent transformation through community, story, and humor. Participants explore individual, collective, and transgenerational trauma and learn how our inner landscapes affect our  social dynamics, conflict analysis, and project design. We are a part of the world we want to make peaceful, and we have the strongest leverage with ourselves. Participants also practice self-regulation, empathic communication, and community-building methods that create safety and trust in volatile contexts. Designed for ~16 participants; activities scale to cohort size in coordination with the Academy.\nThe pedagogy blends scientific grounding (Polyvagal Theory, Positive Psychology, and Post-Traumatic Growth) with experiential, reflective, and participatory approaches. Having knowledge of theory helps contextualize practice and increases integration. Rather than talk, we will work to engage in lived experiences from checkins, self-reflection, and warm, trust-based, connection across difference. Weekly self-paced work (3–4h) uses a flipped format so live sessions prioritize practice, feedback, and peer learning.\nParticipants’ Deliverables\nWeekly Reflection Journals (text/audio): personal learning, boundaries, and application moments.\nPeer Dialogue Notes: Summaries from small-group practice (1-2-4-All Liberating Structure methodology with note taker) \nPost Traumatic Growth Factors “map” and intervention library. \nApplied Mini-Project (Week 4): short, practical upgrade to an ongoing project they have using an organizational self-assessment to set 1–2 initiatives + key results for safer, trauma-sensitive delivery.\nFinal 5-minute Presentation (Week 5): one commitment and  tool/practice to carry into work\nValues In Action/Come Alive Development Snapshot: brief opening/closing check-ins using VIA Character Strengths (Values in Action), PERMAH (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment, Health) and the Come Alive frameworks.\nWeekly Content and Structure\nOnline Live Session\nContent Focus & Methods\nOnline Tools & Methods\nSelf-paced Learning (3–4 h)\nWeek 1 – Understanding Trauma & the Peacebuilder’s Role\nDefine trauma, resilience, PTG; guided reflection “Why I work for peace”; somatic grounding (Window of Tolerance/Polyvagal). \n(Opt-in) brief strengths & flourishing snapshots to; strengths-share to name signature strengths (via VIA Character Strengths), discussion on importance of checkins, humor, and gratitude. \nBackgroudn/sharing experiences from fieldwork, plenary & breakouts; shared whiteboard (Miro/Jamboard).\nShort video: trauma responses; reading about polyvagal theory and unconscious trauma. Some wounds are invisible even to us.\nVIA/PERMAH mini-check (opt-in); journal on personal resonances, boundaries and stories of resilience in your own life. \nWeek 2 – Collective & Transgenerational Trauma\nExplore historical/social wounds; case lens: post-explosion Beirut community healing; participant-led story telling to surface narratives and power dynamics; emphasize agency, sharing what feels natural, and creating a safe space to share, and sometimes to be funny even when things are extremely difficult.\nMiro timeline; small-group dialogue; 123All, collective waterfall Liberting Structures.\nReadings on collective trauma & systems; podcast on memory/healing; interview a peer and gather stories of resilience, narrative reappraisal and hope. \nWeek 3 – Creating Safety & Boundaries in Practice\nTools for self-regulation and vicarious trauma hygiene; non-judgmental feedback rituals; micro-practices (breath, nature, company, humor, titration) to return to safety; peer-coaching triads \nGrounding practice; Liberating Structures (1-2-4-All); shared notes doc.\nRest and micro-grounding; Polyvagal reminder, reflective journal on Come Alive, limits & escalation protocols \nWeek 4 – Integrating Trauma-Informed Practice into Peacebuilding\nApply lens to conflict analysis & project planning: mini organizational self-assessment → choose 1–2 objectives → Find an activity and place it in the calendar.; small groups run a case lab collective intelligence on live projects; capture in a simple dashboard.\nBreakouts for case labs; Collective Intelligence sheet Airtable/Sheet template; plenary feedback.\nReading: trauma-sensitive facilitation/design; draft mini-project + peer review; upload KR plan & safety “guardrails” (ILIAS).\nWeek 5 – Reflection & Sustaining the Work\nStory circle “My learning journey”; community of practice planning; closing ritual & evaluation; (Opt-in) repeat brief VIA/PERMAH snapshot to learn about changes.\nPlenary; gallery walk of mini-projects; evaluation form, tiny habits promise, arting it out, closing circle.\nPrepare/upload final presentation; short reading: ethics of care; personal commitment plan, tiny habit incorporation plans\n\n\nExpected Learning Outcomes\nBy the end of the training, participants will be able to:\nDevelop a tiny habit for themselves to support resilience and connection\nRecognize trauma dynamics in conflict contexts and have the tools to practice engaging with it dynamically\nApply trauma-informed principles to conflict analysis, project planning, and community facilitation, producing a practical upgrade with initiatives \nThe importance of personal resilience for community resilience. \nThat the authenticity of human connection through humor and art is still possible, and perhaps welcomed, during times of turmoil.\nPractice self-regulation and boundary awareness to prevent burnout and model safe facilitation online/offline.\nContribute to a peer community of reflective, resilient practitioners with shared protocols and tools (non-judgmental feedback, micro-practices, check-ins).\n",

I design trauma-informed (and yes—humor-friendly) learning spaces in conflict contexts. Highlights: co-founded Bloom (supported **1,011** entrepreneurs/educators across SWANA), led **100+** online/hybrid programs (English/Arabic/French), MSc on **post-traumatic growth** after the Beirut Port Explosion; recent trauma-informed teacher training in Gaza; earlier work with refugees in Beirut and fieldwork in Iraq.\n\nI propose a trainer tandem with **Tudor Tarlev** (cc). I’m available from **Jan 2026** to prep and ready to deliver in **April**. Outline is designed for ~16 participants with flipped learning, Liberating Structures, and a safe, warm room—even on BigBlueButton.\n\nAttachments: CV, 1-page cover letter, 2-page concept & outline.\n\nWarmly,  \nBilal Ghalib  \nLille, France · bilal@bloom.pm · +1-478-227-2253  \nbilalghalib.com · bloom.pm",
