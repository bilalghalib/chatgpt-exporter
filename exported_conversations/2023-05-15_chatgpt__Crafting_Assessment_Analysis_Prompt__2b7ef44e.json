Once we have that information we should be able to modify the activity so that it's tailored to their needs here's an example of the output we have to work with:\n Based on the assessment results and information provided, here are some potential insights and recommendations for Bilal:\n\n•Bilal seems particularly interested in developing expertise and mastery, especially around research and AI. Given his weaknesses in focus and prioritization, mentorship or coaching in a specific domain could be helpful. For example, collaborating with Ghina on research projects and skills could provide an opportunity for targeted learning and increased expertise. \n\n•Bilal appears motivated by work that involves others and leads to tangible outcomes. Team-based learning or projects, especially those focused on turning ideas into action, may be most engaging and impactful for him. For example, collaborating with program managers on new program designs or financial models.\n\n•Bilal's interests in research, technology, economics, and human values suggest some potential areas of growth for Bloom. Developing Bilal's capacities in these areas through further study and experimentation could lead to valuable innovation. At the same time, Bilal recognizes the need to stabilize the organization financially and improve time management, focus and prioritization. Mentorship, coaching and increased teamwork may help strengthen these skills which are crucial for Bloom's success.\n\n•Online courses, workshops or activities involving dialogue and facilitation seem to suit Bilal's preferences well. However, without proper note-taking, synthesis and follow-through, the learning may not translate into outcomes. Additional support in implementing takeaways or accountability measures may be needed.\n\n•There appear to be many opportunities for cross-team collaboration at Bloom based on the range of Bilal's interests, skills, and areas for improvement. In particular, increased collaboration with program managers, mentors, and the research team could lead to valuable co-learning, innovative program designs, and scalable solutions for Bloom. Fostering connections across teams may be an important step.\n\nIn summary, focused mentorship or coaching, team-based learning and projects, developing research and technology skills, improving time management and follow-through, and increasing cross-team collaboration seem like potentially high-impact areas of development for Bilal and Bloom overall based on the assessment results and information provided.

I don’t deserve to\nlive. I’m so tired. If only I could rest – I need rest! I’m the seagull – but\nI’m not really. I’m an actress. Yes. (She hears Arkadina and Trigorin\nlaughing.) So he’s here, too…well, it doesn’t matter. He never believed in\ntheatre, he always laughed at me for my dreams of being famous, and bit by bit\nI stopped believing, too, and lost heart…there were all the other things to\nworry about – love, jealousy…and always the worry about the baby. I became\ntrivial and commonplace. My work lost all meaning. On stage I didn’t know what\nto do with my hands or how to stand, I couldn’t control my voice…You can’t\nknow what it’s like when you’re up there feeling you’re acting so badly. The\nseagull. No, that’s not me…you remember how you once shot that seagull? A man\nhappened to come along and see her, and having nothing much to do, destroyed\nher. Idea for a short story… No, that’s not it … what was I saying? Oh yes,\nabout acting… I’m not like that anymore. I’ve become a real actress. I love\nacting, when I’m on stage I feel drunk on the sheer joy of it, and I feel\nbeautiful. While I’ve been back here I’ve spent a lot of time walking and\nthinking – and every day I’ve felt my spirit getting stronger. What I’ve\nrealized, Kostya, is that, with us, whether we’re writers or actors, what\nreally counts is not dreaming about fame and glory…but stamina: knowing how to\nkeep going despite everything, and having faith in yourself – I’ve got faith\nin myself now and that’s helped the pain, and when I think to myself, \"You’re\non the stage!’ then I’m not afraid of anything life can to do to me.\n\n[Submit\nFeedback!](https://airtable.com/shrOXtCfB8nG6pkAQ?prefill_Activity=📖+Reading:+The+Seagull+\\(Monologue\\)&hide_Activity=true)\n\n## Title\n\n📊 Business Process: Rapid Research\n\n## Image\n\n  * ![](/assets/att1smxJGZXbXMLzF-Rapid_Research_Review_More_Study_Types_EMRA)\n\n## Welcome!\n\nA simple exercise that complements exploratory, discursive, and creative\nworkshops with insights and opinions from outside.
