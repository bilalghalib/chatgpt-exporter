      "content": "In **Maliki fiqh**, *recitation (tilawa)* of the Qur'an specifically refers to **uttering the words with the tongue**, not just reading silently or following along with the eyes. So, **if you're only reading silently while listening to an audio recording, it does *not* count as recitation** in the technical sense that carries the rewards and rulings associated with it (e.g., during prayer or for obtaining reward of tilawa).\n\n### Summary (Maliki View):\n- **Reciting aloud or moving the tongue, even softly**, counts as proper recitation (*tilawa*).\n- **Silent reading without any tongue movement**, even if accompanied by audio, **does not count** as recitation.\n- This is based on the **Maliki emphasis** that *qira’ah* (recitation) involves **utterance (nطق)** and not just mental engagement.\n\n### Evidence and Reasoning:\n1. **Qur'an:**  \n   *\"فَاقْرَءُوا مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ\"* — *“Recite what is easy from the Qur’an”* (Surah Al-Muzzammil 73:20)  \n   - The term \"iqra’\" in Arabic linguistically implies **reciting aloud**, not reading silently.\n\n2. **Maliki Sources:**  \n   Scholars like **Ibn Rushd (Bidayat al-Mujtahid)** and others maintain that for acts like **reciting in prayer**, the movement of the tongue is essential. This general principle extends outside of prayer as well when seeking the reward of *tilawa*.\n\n3. **Qadi ‘Iyad and Others:**  \n   They clarify that **moving the lips and tongue is what distinguishes actual recitation** from mere contemplation or silent reading, especially when fulfilling specific acts of worship.\n\n### Practical Implication:\n- If you want it to count as **recitation**, make sure you **move your tongue/lips**, even if quietly, while following the audio.\n- Just following along with your eyes or in your head (mental reading), even with full understanding and reflection, does not fulfill the *fiqhi* condition for *tilawa* in the Maliki school.\n\nWould you like a reference from a classical Maliki source or fatwa body for documentation?",

      "content": "In **Maliki fiqh**, recitation (*tilawa*) of the Qur'an requires **audible articulation**, meaning the movement of the tongue and lips to produce sound, even if it's only audible to oneself. Silent reading without vocalization does not fulfill the criteria for recitation. Therefore, merely reading the Qur'an silently while listening to an audio recording does not count as recitation in the Maliki school.\n\n**Evidence from Maliki Sources:**\n\n- **The Risala of Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani**: This foundational Maliki text emphasizes the importance of listening attentively when the Qur'an is recited aloud. It references the Quranic verse:\n\n  *\"When the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it and be silent.\"* citeturn0search13\n\n  This underscores the significance of both recitation and attentive listening in appropriate contexts.\n\n**Clarification on Listening vs. Reciting:**\n\n- While listening to the Qur'an is a commendable act and holds its own merit, it does not replace the act of recitation. Recitation involves active vocal articulation, whereas listening is a passive act. Therefore, to achieve the rewards associated with recitation, one must engage in vocalizing the words of the Qur'an.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn the Maliki school, for an act to be considered recitation, it must involve audible articulation. Silent reading, even when accompanied by listening to an audio recitation, does not fulfill this requirement. Therefore, to attain the specific rewards and fulfill the obligations of recitation, one should vocalize the words of the Qur'an. ",
