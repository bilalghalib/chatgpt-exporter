These amounts should be deducted from the amounts owed to these service providers. Consequently, their taxes will be deducted accordingly. However, if these service providers are up to date with their taxes in their country of residence, these withholdings will not be applied.\nThis is why we are asking you to send them to us, depending on your situation.\nIn your case, we need proof of taxes paid by the individual or legal entity that received €1,800 in 2023.\n\n \n\nHope everything is clear to you, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you need anything. \n\n \n\nThank you for your understanding of this tax process, which is beyond our control.\n\n \n\nBest regards\n\nStéphanie\n\n\nImage supprimée par l'expéditeur.\n\nStéphanie NGUYEN Comptable/Accountant\nstephanie.nguyen@learningplanetinstitute.org\n0184256807\n\nLearning Planet Institute8bis rue Charles V, Paris, 75004\nhttps://learningplanetinstitute.org\n\nImage supprimée par l'expéditeur.

      "content": "Got it — this makes sense now.  \n\nWhen a **European company** pays money to a **foreign service provider** (like your U.S. company), they are sometimes legally required to withhold taxes *unless* the provider proves they are already a tax resident in their own country.  \n\n👉 The document they’re asking for is a **U.S. Tax Residency Certificate**.  \nIn the U.S., this is obtained by filing **IRS Form 8802 (Application for U.S. Residency Certification)**. When approved, the IRS issues **Form 6166**, which is the official *Certificate of U.S. Tax Residence*.  \n\n### What it is:\n- **Form 6166** is a letter from the IRS confirming that your company (Nur Creative Studio) is a tax resident of the United States for a specific year.  \n- It is used under **double tax treaties** so that the French entity does not withhold extra French taxes on top of the U.S. taxes you already owe.  \n\n### Why they need it:\n- France (and most EU countries) has tax treaties with the U.S.  \n- Without this certificate, the French company is legally obligated to withhold up to **25%** of the payment they made to you.  \n- With the certificate, they can justify to their tax auditors that you’re a U.S. tax resident, so they don’t need to withhold French tax.  \n\n### What you need to do:\n1. **Apply to the IRS with Form 8802** (you can do this online or by mail).  \n   - There is a processing fee (around $85).  \n   - You need your company’s EIN and proof you filed U.S. taxes.  \n2. The IRS will send you **Form 6166** (the actual residency certificate).  \n3. Send the Form 6166 to the French company — that’s what they’re asking for.  \n\n⚠️ Important: **Your 1040 or 1120 tax return, or a CPA letter, is not enough.** The French tax authority only accepts the official IRS certificate (Form 6166).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **draft a short reply email** you could send back to them, explaining that in the U.S. the certificate is Form 6166 (requested via Form 8802) and that you’re applying for it now?",

      "content": "Yes — being an **LLC in America** doesn’t change the French side’s requirement.  \n\nThe French accountants aren’t asking whether you filed taxes — they need **proof from the IRS** that your entity is officially treated as a **U.S. tax resident** under the U.S.–France tax treaty.  \n\nHere’s how it works for LLCs:\n\n- **Single-member LLC (disregarded entity)** → By default, the IRS treats it as part of your personal taxes (Schedule C on your 1040).  \n  - In this case, *you personally* would apply for Form 8802 using your **SSN**, and the IRS would issue **Form 6166 in your name**.  \n- **Multi-member LLC (partnership)** → The LLC files Form 1065. The IRS can still issue Form 6166 in the LLC’s name, but you need the LLC’s EIN.  \n- **LLC taxed as a corporation (you filed Form 8832 or 2553)** → The LLC is its own taxpayer, so Form 6166 will be issued to the LLC.  \n\n👉 In all cases, **yes, you need to request Form 6166** (via Form 8802), but whether it’s in your **name** or the **LLC’s name** depends on your tax classification.  \n\n---\n\n✅ So the practical next step:  \n- Check how your LLC is taxed (disregarded, partnership, or corporation).  \n- File **Form 8802** with the IRS.  \n- Get **Form 6166** back.  \n- Send it to the French company so they don’t withhold 25% of your payment.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to break down *step-by-step* what to file for each LLC type (single-member, multi-member, or corporation)? That way you’ll know exactly which path applies to you.",

      "content": "That’s a totally fair reaction — for a **$1,000 contract**, this feels like overkill 😅. But from the French school’s perspective, their **auditors** are forcing them to collect this, or else they have to withhold French taxes.  \n\nHere’s the **practical reality for you as a small U.S. LLC**:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. What the French school needs\n- They need **official proof from the IRS** that you are a U.S. tax resident (so they don’t withhold 25%).  \n- That proof = **Form 6166** (Certificate of U.S. Tax Residence), which you request by filing **Form 8802**.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. If you do get Form 6166\n- You just **send them the PDF/letter** from the IRS.  \n- You don’t need to file anything else in France.  \n- You still report the $1,000 income on your normal U.S. tax return (Schedule C, Form 1065, or 1120 depending on how your LLC is taxed).  \n- That’s it — no extra U.S. filings just because of France.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. If you don’t get Form 6166\n- The French school might be legally forced to **withhold ~25% (€250)** from what they paid you.  \n- They would pay that to the French tax office, and you’d only get the remainder.  \n- You *could* try to claim that back later using the U.S.–France tax treaty, but that process is very bureaucratic and not worth it for $250.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. The “tiny LLC” question  \nFor just **one $1,000 contract**, you need to weigh:  \n\n- **Cost/effort of Form 8802**: $85 IRS fee + paperwork, takes weeks/months.  \n- **Potential withholding**: ~€250 lost.  \n- If this is a **one-off**, honestly, it may not be worth filing 8802/6166. You might just accept the withholding.  \n- If you plan to do **more French/EU contracts**, it’s worth setting this up once so you have the certificate ready.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Bottom line:  \n- If it’s just this $1,000: it may be cheaper to **let them withhold** than to go through the IRS process.  \n- If you expect more EU clients: **apply for Form 6166 once**, then reuse it for all of them in the same year.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **draft you a short reply** you can send the French school explaining that you’re a small U.S. LLC, this is one $1,000 contract, and asking whether they really need the IRS certificate or if they can just withhold the treaty rate? That could save you the headache.",

      "content": "Perfect, thanks for sharing that notice — it tells us a lot about your LLC. Let’s break it down.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. What your IRS notice says about **Nur Creative Studio LLC**  \n- EIN: **81-4514826**  \n- Entity type: **LLC**  \n- IRS expected you to file **Form 1065 (partnership return)** — meaning they treated your LLC as a **multi-member partnership** when you applied.  \n- Member listed: **Bilal S Ghalib**  \n\n⚠️ If you are the **only member**, the IRS may have expected you to elect single-member treatment (disregarded entity, reported on your 1040 Schedule C). But since they sent you a 1065 notice, they may have you flagged as a **partnership**.  \n👉 If in reality you’re single-member and have been filing as such, that’s fine — but for Form 8802/6166, it matters which classification you’ve been filing under.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. How this affects **Form 8802 (Application for U.S. Residency Certification)**  \nForm 8802 is the application. The IRS will then issue **Form 6166**, the certificate.  \n\n**Key parts you’ll fill out (simplified for your case):**\n\n- **Line 1 – Applicant name**:  \n  → *NUR CREATIVE STUDIO LLC*  \n\n- **Line 2 – EIN**:  \n  → *81-4514826*  \n\n- **Line 3 – Address**:  \n  → If you’re in France, put your French address here. That’s where the IRS will mail the certificate.  \n\n- **Line 4 – Type of entity**:  \n  → LLC (taxed as **partnership** if you filed 1065, or as **disregarded entity** if you report on your 1040 Schedule C).  \n\n- **Line 5 – U.S. income tax return filed**:  \n  → If single-member: *1040 with Schedule C*.  \n  → If multi-member: *1065*.  \n  → If you elected corporate status: *1120*.  \n\n- **Line 7 – Calendar year(s) requested**:  \n  → Put **2023** (since that’s what the French school wants). You can also request 2024 at the same time if you expect more contracts.  \n\n- **Line 8 – Treaty country**:  \n  → France  \n\n- **Signature**:  \n  → Signed by you as the member/manager.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Fee & submission\n- Fee: **$85** (per application, not per certificate).  \n- Payment: Use IRS pay.gov (recommended).  \n- Mailing: You send the 8802 to the IRS in Philadelphia. They process and mail Form 6166 back.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. What you do with the 6166  \n- When you receive it, **send a copy to the French school**.  \n- That’s it — no extra filing with France.  \n- You keep reporting the $1,000 income normally on your U.S. tax return.  \n\n---\n\n✅ So, for you:  \n- **If you file Schedule C (single-member)** → you request Form 6166 in your **own name** (Bilal Ghalib), referencing your LLC/EIN.  \n- **If you file Form 1065 (partnership)** → you request it in the **LLC’s name**.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **mock-fill Form 8802** for you (with dummy address details for now) so you can see exactly what it would look like for Nur Creative Studio?",

      "content": "Got it — that clears things up.  \n\nSince the IRS initially classified **Nur Creative Studio LLC** as a **partnership** (because you had at least two members when you applied for the EIN), that means:  \n\n- Unless you later filed **Form 8832 (entity classification election)** or **Form 1065** with “final return,” the IRS still expects your LLC to be a **partnership**.  \n- Even if your cousin isn’t active anymore, the IRS will still consider it a partnership until you formally change it.  \n\n👉 For **Form 8802**, you should therefore apply **as a partnership** (the LLC itself is the applicant, not you personally).  \n\n---\n\n### How that looks on Form 8802 (your case)\n\n- **Line 1** (Applicant name):  \n  `NUR CREATIVE STUDIO LLC`  \n\n- **Line 2** (EIN):  \n  `81-4514826`  \n\n- **Line 3** (Address):  \n  Your current French address (so the IRS mails Form 6166 directly to you).  \n\n- **Line 4** (Type of entity):  \n  `Partnership`  \n\n- **Line 5** (U.S. tax return filed):  \n  `Form 1065` (U.S. Return of Partnership Income)  \n\n- **Line 7** (Calendar year(s)):  \n  `2023` (and you can also request `2024` while you’re at it).  \n\n- **Line 8** (Treaty country):  \n  `France`  \n\n- **Signature**:  \n  You, as the managing member of the LLC.  \n\n---\n\n### What happens next\n1. File Form 8802 (+ $85 fee).  \n2. Wait for IRS to process and mail you **Form 6166**.  \n3. Send the Form 6166 to the French school.  \n4. Done — no other U.S. or French filing needed.  \n\n---\n\n⚠️ One thing: If you’ve actually been reporting your LLC income on **your personal return (Schedule C)** instead of Form 1065, then the IRS records and your filings don’t match. In that case, applying as a **partnership** may cause confusion later.  \n\nWould you like me to help you figure out whether the IRS “sees” your LLC as an active **partnership** or as a **disregarded entity** right now? That way you’ll know which version of the 8802 is safest to file.",

      "content": "Ah, here’s the important bit.  \n\nRight now, you have a **mismatch** between what the IRS expects and what you’ve been filing:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. How the IRS views your LLC (based on your EIN notice)\n- You applied for your EIN with **two members** (you and your cousin).  \n- The IRS classified you as a **partnership** → they expect you to file **Form 1065** every year.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. How you’ve been filing\n- You’ve been reporting the LLC’s income directly on your **personal return (Schedule C on Form 1040)**.  \n- That’s what you’d do if the LLC were a **single-member disregarded entity**.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Why this is a problem\n- If the IRS still considers you a partnership, **filing only on your personal return is technically incorrect**.  \n- Partnerships must file a **1065** return and issue a **K-1** to each partner.  \n- Not filing Form 1065 can trigger penalties (though if the LLC really has only one active member now, you may be able to fix it).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. What this means for Form 8802\n- If you apply as a **partnership** but haven’t been filing 1065s, the IRS may reject your application because it won’t match their records.  \n- If you apply as a **disregarded entity (Schedule C)**, but their records still list you as a partnership, they may also reject it.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. What you can do\nYou have two paths:  \n\n**Option A – Clean it up as a partnership (conservative IRS approach):**  \n- File any missing **1065s** (even if late).  \n- Issue a final 1065 marking the year your cousin stopped being a member.  \n- From then on, the IRS will treat you as a **single-member LLC**, and you’ll report on Schedule C going forward.  \n- Future Form 8802 filings will match.  \n\n**Option B – Apply as a disregarded entity (practical “what you’ve been doing” approach):**  \n- Apply under your own name/SSN as a **sole proprietor**, referencing the LLC name + EIN.  \n- Sometimes the IRS accepts this if they see you’re reporting the income personally, but it’s a bit of a gamble since their system may still think you’re a partnership.  \n\n---\n\n👉 So yes, **the way you apply for the tax residency certificate depends on how you’re filing taxes.**  \nIf you keep filing as Schedule C without fixing the partnership status, you’re in a gray area.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to outline **the easiest “fix-up” path** to get the IRS in sync with the reality (you’re the only member now), so you won’t run into this mismatch again when French or other foreign clients ask for tax certificates?",

      "content": "That’s actually a very common situation — lots of small partnerships/LLCs lose money or barely make anything. The IRS still expects a return, even if there’s **zero income**.  \n\nHere’s how it works for a **partnership LLC filing Form 1065**:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Form 1065 basics\n- **Form 1065** is the U.S. Return of Partnership Income.  \n- It shows the partnership’s total income, deductions, and expenses.  \n- The partnership itself usually pays **no federal income tax** — instead, it “passes through” the results to the partners.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. When you make no money or lose money\n- You still file Form 1065.  \n- Report the income = $0 (or whatever tiny revenue).  \n- Report the expenses (hosting, software, travel, etc.).  \n- The **net loss** flows through to you (and your cousin, if still listed as a member).  \n\nThat loss gets reported on **Schedule K-1**, which the partnership must issue to each partner.  \n- K-1s show each partner’s share of income/loss.  \n- You (and your cousin, if still on record) attach the K-1 to your personal 1040.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Why this matters\n- Filing a **1065** even with losses keeps you compliant with the IRS.  \n- If you don’t file, the IRS can hit the LLC with penalties: **$220 per partner, per month, up to 12 months** (so if they still think it’s a 2-member LLC, that’s $440/month until it’s filed).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. If your cousin isn’t really active anymore\n- You can file one last 1065 as a **“Final Return”** marking the year your cousin left (put “Final return” at the top and check the box on Form 1065).  \n- Then going forward, you’re a **single-member LLC**, and you can just report on **Schedule C** with your personal 1040. No more 1065.  \n- That would also make your future **Form 8802 applications** much simpler.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Your next step\nIf you haven’t filed any 1065s yet, you’ve technically been out of compliance since 2017. But the IRS is often lenient with **small, no-income partnerships** if you voluntarily fix it. You’d basically:  \n- File retroactive 1065s (even with $0 income).  \n- Mark the current one as **final**.  \n- Switch to Schedule C from now on.  \n\n---\n\n👉 So to answer your question:  \n- **Yes, you must file 1065 even if the partnership loses money.**  \n- The losses can actually help you reduce your personal taxable income (they flow through to your 1040).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to sketch out a **step-by-step “catch-up” plan** (how many 1065s you’d need, what to do about your cousin, how to close out as a partnership cleanly)? That way you can decide if it’s worth cleaning up officially before applying for Form 8802/6166.",

To fill this out correctly for **Nur Creative Studio LLC**, I’ll need to confirm a few details with you before I can map your answers into the form.  \n\n---\n\n### Questions I need to ask you first:\n\n1. **Tax classification**:  \n   - You said you started with your cousin, but now you’re the only one.  \n   - Have you ever filed a **Form 1065 (partnership return)** for the LLC? Or have you just been reporting the income/loss on your personal 1040 Schedule C?  \n\n2. **Year needed**:  \n   - The French school asked for **2023**.  \n   - Do you also want to request **2024** now, since it’s valid for the whole year and you might need it again? (You can request multiple years in one 8802).  \n\n3. **Mailing address**:  \n   - Do you want the IRS to mail the certificate to your **French address** directly, or to a **U.S. address** (friend, family, registered agent) who can scan it and send it to you?  \n\n4. **Phone number to list**:  \n   - The form requires a daytime phone number. Do you want to use your U.S. number, French number, or both?  \n\n5. **Number of certificates**:  \n   - Usually, you can request **1 certificate per country per year**, and then just send photocopies to clients. Do you need more than one original for France?  \n\n---\n\nOnce I have these, I can tell you **exactly what to write on each line** of the form you uploaded.  \n\n👉 Do you want me to go line by line after you answer these, so you’ll have a mock-filled version ready to copy into the PDF?",

      "content": "Perfect — thanks for sharing those returns. They clear up the confusion:  \n\n✅ You are filing **Schedule C (Form 1040)** as a **sole proprietor/disregarded entity**.  \nEven though the LLC was originally set up as a partnership with your cousin, in practice you’re the only one reporting income/loss. For IRS purposes, the LLC is now functioning as a **single-member LLC (disregarded entity)**.  \n\nThat means for **Form 8802**, you should apply **as an individual/sole proprietor**, not as a partnership.  \n\n---\n\n### How to fill out Form 8802 for your situation\n\n#### Top section:\n- **Applicant’s name & TIN**:  \n  - Name: **Bilal Ghalib**  \n  - TIN: Your **SSN** (not the EIN, since IRS sees you as the taxpayer via Schedule C).  \n\n- **Line 1 (Applicant’s name and TIN as it should appear on the certification if different)**:  \n  - If you want the certificate to show your business name too:  \n    **Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC**  \n  - TIN: Still your SSN.  \n\n- **Line 2 (Applicant’s address during 2023)**:  \n  - Your U.S. home address for 2023 (e.g., 4122 Helen St, Detroit, MI 48207).  \n\n- **Line 3a (Mail Form 6166 to)**:  \n  - If you want it mailed to France now, list your French address here.  \n\n---\n\n#### Line 4 (Applicant is…):\n- Check:  \n  ☑ **Individual**  \n  ☑ **Sole proprietor**  \n\n---\n\n#### Line 5 (Was the applicant required to file a U.S. tax form?)  \n- Yes → check **1040**.  \n- You can also mention **Schedule C** (since that’s where your LLC’s income/loss went).  \n\n---\n\n#### Line 7 (Calendar year(s) for which certification is requested):  \n- Write: **2023**.  \n- (Optional: also **2024**, so you don’t need to reapply if another EU client asks).  \n\n---\n\n#### Line 8 (Tax period(s) on which certification will be based):  \n- Write: **2023 calendar year (Form 1040 with Schedule C)**.  \n\n---\n\n#### Line 9 (Purpose of certification):  \n- Check: ☑ **Income tax**  \n- Treaty country: **France**  \n\n---\n\n#### Line 10 (Penalties of perjury statement):  \nWrite:  \n> “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I was a resident of the United States within the meaning of the income tax laws of the United States for the calendar year(s) 2023 (and 2024, if you request both), and that I have examined this application and accompanying attachments, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, they are true, correct, and complete.”  \n\n---\n\n#### Signature section:  \n- Sign: **Bilal Ghalib**  \n- Date  \n- Daytime phone number (U.S. or French number is fine).  \n\n---\n\n#### Worksheet (page 3):  \n- Applicant Name: Bilal Ghalib  \n- Applicant TIN: your SSN  \n- Country: France (FR)  \n- Number of certifications: 1 (unless you want extra originals).  \n\n---\n\n### Fee & mailing\n- Pay **$85** at pay.gov before sending the form.  \n- Attach proof of payment (confirmation page).  \n- Mail the completed **Form 8802** to the IRS in Philadelphia (address in instructions).  \n\n---\n\n👉 Key point: Even though your EIN exists, the IRS only recognizes **your SSN + 1040 Schedule C** as the tax base. That’s what France wants proof of, and Form 6166 will be issued in your name (possibly with “d/b/a Nur Creative Studio” if you list it on line 1).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **mock up the exact text** to type into each line of Form 8802 with your info, so you can basically just copy-paste it into the PDF?",

      "content": "Great questions — let’s break this down step by step:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. What a **disregarded entity** means\n- An LLC can be taxed in different ways (partnership, corporation, disregarded).  \n- A **disregarded entity** = the IRS ignores the LLC for tax purposes.  \n- All the business’s income/loss “flows through” to you personally and gets reported on your **Form 1040 (with Schedule C)**.  \n- The LLC still exists legally for contracts, liability, and branding, but for taxes it’s just *you*.  \n\nThat’s exactly what you’re doing now (your Schedule C shows “Nur Creative Studio”).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Does your U.S. tax return show tax residency?\n- Your **Form 1040 + Schedule C** proves that you file U.S. taxes as a resident.  \n- But: foreign tax authorities (like France) **don’t accept** your 1040 or CPA letters as official “residency proof.”  \n- They only recognize the **IRS-issued Form 6166 (Certificate of U.S. Tax Residency)**.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Do you need the Tax Residency Certificate?\n- **Yes, if the French school insists on it.**  \n- They’re audited under French law: if they don’t have Form 6166 from you, they must withhold ~25% of your pay.  \n- If they get the certificate, they can show their auditors that you’re a U.S. taxpayer, so they don’t need to withhold.  \n\n👉 So: your U.S. tax return shows you are a resident, but **only Form 6166 counts as the official certificate** that France will accept.  \n\n---\n\n✅ Summary:  \n- You are a **disregarded entity (sole proprietor)**.  \n- Your **1040 proves residency in substance**, but **France requires Form 6166 from the IRS**.  \n- So yes, you still need to apply for the Tax Residency Certificate (Form 8802 → IRS → Form 6166).  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to make you a **short, polite reply** you can send to the French school saying you are applying for Form 6166 now, and asking if in the meantime they’ll accept a copy of your 2023 1040 as temporary proof?",

      "content": "Short answer: **Yes, include your EIN—but as a reference, not as the TIN.**  \nFor a sole-prop/disregarded LLC, the **applicant’s TIN on Form 8802 is your SSN**. You can still ask the IRS to **print your DBA and EIN on the certificate** so the French school sees the link to “Nur Creative Studio LLC.”\n\nHere’s exactly how to fill yours:\n\n### Form 8802 (your case: U.S. individual / sole prop)\n**Top box (right under the title)**\n- **Applicant’s name:** `Bilal Ghalib`  \n- **Applicant’s U.S. taxpayer identification number:** *(your SSN)*\n\n**Line 1 (name as it should appear on the certificate, if different)**\n- Put this so the DBA and EIN appear on Form 6166:  \n  `Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN: 81-4514826)`  \n- **TIN on this line:** still your **SSN** (not the EIN).\n\n**Line 2 (address during the year requested)**  \n- Your 2023 U.S. address: `4122 Helen St, Detroit, MI 48207, USA` (or whatever you used on the 2023 return).\n\n**Line 3a (mail Form 6166 to)**  \n- Your current French mailing address (if you want it mailed to France).  \n  *(If you prefer a U.S. address for speed, put that here instead.)*\n\n**Line 4 (Applicant is…)**  \n- Check: `Individual` and `Sole proprietor`.\n\n**Line 5 (Was the applicant required to file a U.S. tax form?)**  \n- Check `1040`. (You can hand-write “with Schedule C” next to it.)\n\n**Line 7 (Calendar year(s) requested)**  \n- `2023`  *(Optionally add `2024` if you might need it again this year.)*\n\n**Line 8 (Tax period(s) on which certification will be based)**  \n- `Calendar year 2023 (Form 1040 with Schedule C)`\n\n**Line 9 (Purpose of certification)**  \n- Check `Income tax`.  \n- You can write “Treaty with **France**” next to it.\n\n**Line 10 (Penalties of perjury statement & extra notes)**  \nPaste this (and this is where you also request the DBA/EIN be shown):\n> “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I was a resident of the United States within the meaning of U.S. income tax laws for calendar year 2023, and that this application and any attachments are true, correct, and complete. Please issue Form 6166 showing the name **‘Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN 81-4514826)’**.”\n\n*(If you also request 2024, add “…for calendar years 2023 and 2024…”.)*\n\n**Signature block**  \n- Sign, date, and list a daytime phone (U.S. or FR).\n\n### Worksheet (page 3)\n- **Applicant Name/TIN:** your name and **SSN**.  \n- Under **France (FR)** enter the number of originals you want (usually `1`; ask for `2` if you like having a spare).  \n- Total = that same number.\n\n### Payment & send\n- Pay the **$85** user fee on **pay.gov** (save the confirmation).  \n- Mail Form 8802 + payment proof to the IRS address in the instructions.  \n- The IRS will mail **Form 6166** on letterhead to the address you listed on **Line 3a**.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick why\n- As a **disregarded entity**, the taxpayer is **you** (SSN). That’s why SSN goes in the TIN field.  \n- Adding the **DBA and EIN** in **Line 1** and **Line 10** gets the business name + EIN printed on the certificate so the French school can match it to their vendor record.\n\nIf you want, I can also draft a one-paragraph note to include with the certificate (and/or email to the school) explaining that the certificate is in your name because the LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship.",

      "content": "Yes — that’s the one I meant 👍  \n\nHere’s the difference in plain English:\n\n- **4a “Individual – Sole Proprietor”** = you’re applying as *yourself*, filing a 1040 with Schedule C.  \n- **4i “Disregarded entity – LLC”** = tells the IRS “my business is a legal LLC, but for tax purposes you treat it as part of me.”  \n\nSince **both are true for you**, you can check **both boxes**:  \n\n- **☑ Individual → Sole proprietor**  \n- **☑ Disregarded entity → LLC**  \n\nThat way:  \n- The certificate (Form 6166) will be issued in **your name** (because you file under your SSN).  \n- But the IRS will also see that the business is an **LLC disregarded entity** and can include **Nur Creative Studio LLC + EIN** on the certificate if you request it in Line 1 and Line 10.  \n\n👉 If you only check “Individual,” you’ll still get the certificate, but it may come back just in your personal name (“Bilal Ghalib”).  \n👉 If you check **both Individual + Disregarded entity (LLC)** and ask for the LLC name in Line 1, you’re more likely to get **“Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN …)”** printed on the certificate — which will match what the French school expects.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to show you exactly how **Line 1 + Line 10** should be worded so the IRS actually prints both your **name + LLC + EIN** on Form 6166?",

Here’s what’s ✅ complete, and what’s still ⚠️ missing or could be improved before you send it:  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ Already done correctly\n- Applicant’s name (Bilal Ghalib).  \n- Address (U.S. Detroit address + mailing).  \n- Line 1 includes “d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN …)” → smart, this ties your LLC to the certificate.  \n- Box checked for **1040 with Schedule C**.  \n- Year requested: **2023**.  \n- Tax period clarified: “Calendar year 2023 (Form 1040 with Schedule C).”  \n- Purpose: Income tax + “Treaty with France.”  \n- Penalties of perjury statement is correct and includes a request for LLC name/EIN to appear.  \n- Signature and date included.  \n- Phone number included.  \n- Worksheet: France selected, 1 certificate requested.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ What’s missing / needs checking\n1. **TIN on page 1 (top right)**:  \n   - You need to put your **SSN** there (since you file Schedule C as an individual). Right now the copy I see just shows your name.  \n\n2. **Check boxes for applicant type (line 4)**:  \n   - You need to actually check:  \n     - ☑ **Individual → Sole proprietor**  \n     - ☑ **Disregarded entity → LLC**  \n   - These boxes don’t look checked in your draft.  \n\n3. **Payment confirmation**:  \n   - Before mailing, you need to pay the $85 fee on **pay.gov**. Print the confirmation and attach it.  \n\n4. **Mailing address (line 3a)**:  \n   - In your draft, it shows your Detroit address again.  \n   - If you want the certificate shipped to your **French address**, put that in line 3a. If you want it sent to the U.S. for scanning/forwarding, leave as-is.  \n\n5. **Worksheet totals (page 3)**:  \n   - You filled France = 1, but the **total line (line 12)** should also be filled in = `1`. Right now it looks blank.  \n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Once you fix those:\n- SSN in TIN field.  \n- Check applicant type boxes.  \n- Decide French vs. U.S. mailing address.  \n- Line 12 total = 1.  \n- Attach proof of $85 payment.  \n\nThen it’s ready to mail to the IRS.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to give you a **final filled mock-up** (line by line with exact text + checkmarks) so you can literally copy it into the PDF without second-guessing?",

      "content": "Great — let’s clear up both parts of your question.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **“Penalties of perjury statement” (Line 10)**\nThis is basically a legal oath.  \nThe IRS requires you to *write out* a declaration that you are a U.S. tax resident for the year(s) you’re asking about.  \n\nThe wording must match their approved templates (Table 2 in the instructions).  \nFor your case (individual filing 1040 with Schedule C), it should look like this:\n\n> **“Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I was a resident of the United States within the meaning of U.S. income tax laws for calendar year 2023, and that this application and any attachments are true, correct, and complete.”**\n\n✅ You already wrote something like this in your draft — so yes, you *do* need it, and you’re good.  \nYou can also include the extra note:  \n> “Please issue Form 6166 showing the name ‘Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN: 81-4514826).’”  \n\nThat’s optional but smart, so the French school sees the LLC name.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Where to pay the $85 user fee**\nThe IRS collects Form 8802 fees via **Pay.gov**, but it’s a specific form, not the general site.  \nThe page you need is:  \n👉 [**IRS Form 8802 User Fee Payment (Pay.gov)**](https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/60413333)  \n\nOn that page:  \n- Select **“Form 8802 Application for U.S. Residency Certification”**  \n- Enter your info, amount **$85**  \n- Pay by bank account or card  \n- Print/save the confirmation page → attach it to your 8802 application  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Final checklist before mailing\n- [ ] SSN filled in top right (TIN field).  \n- [ ] Applicant boxes checked: **Individual → Sole proprietor** + **Disregarded entity → LLC**.  \n- [ ] Address (line 3a) set to France or U.S. (where you want the IRS to mail 6166).  \n- [ ] Line 10 includes penalties of perjury statement (done).  \n- [ ] Worksheet (page 3) shows France = 1 and total = 1.  \n- [ ] Payment confirmation attached.  \n- [ ] Signed and dated.  \n\nThen mail to the Philadelphia address listed in the instructions.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to draft a **clean final version of Line 10** that you can literally copy-paste into the PDF so it meets IRS wording *and* requests your LLC name/EIN?",

      "content": "You're doing great navigating this! Let’s break down each part clearly:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **\"Penalties of perjury\" — Do you need it, and what does it mean?**\n\n- **Yes, you definitely need this.** It’s a mandatory statement that you sign, declaring under oath that:\n\n  > “I declare under penalties of perjury that I was a U.S. tax resident for the calendar year 2023, and that this application (and attachments) are true, correct, and complete.”\n\n- This appears on **Line 10** of Form 8802. Without it, the IRS won’t accept your application.\n\n- If you’d like, I can craft that exact statement for you to copy into the form for a clean, IRS-approved wording.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Paying the $85 user fee — where to go**\n\nYou were sent to the generic Pay.gov homepage — that’s why it didn’t work. Here’s the direct path:\n\n1. Go to **[Pay.gov](https://www.pay.gov)**.\n2. Use the search bar and type **\"IRS Certs\"**.\n3. Select the **\"IRS Certs – Certs User Fee for Form 8802\"** entry (Agency = IRS, Form = IRSCERTS) citeturn0search4turn0search0.\n4. Click **Continue**, follow the prompts to pay **$85** using your bank or card.  \n   - Make sure you upload your completed Form 8802 as part of the upload step (mandatory) citeturn0search4turn0search3.\n\n- After payment, you'll receive a **confirmation number** (often called the Agency Tracking ID). **Write that number** on the top of Form 8802 under “Electronic payment confirmation no.” citeturn0search11turn0search3.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Your residency situation is a bit messy, but you’re covered**\n\n- You mentioned you were \"living abroad until now, but business operates from the U.S.\" — this is not a deal-breaker.\n- For tax residency:\n  - If you filed **Form 1040** as a U.S. citizen or resident, the IRS still considers you a **U.S. tax resident** for the year.  \n  - So you're eligible.\n- When you fill in the perjury statement (Line 10), you're confirming that even while abroad, you were a **U.S. tax resident** in 2023 — and that’s valid if you're filing 1040.\n\n---\n\n###  Summary Checklist\n\n| Task | Status |\n|------|--------|\n|  Penalties of perjury statement (Line 10) |  Needs exact IRS wording (I can draft it). |\n|  Pay $85 via Pay.gov |  Use “IRS Certs” entry. Upload Form 8802. |\n|  Add confirmation number to Form 8802 |  Yes — after payment. |\n|  Residency status |  OK — you're considered U.S. resident for tax purposes if you filed 1040. |\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to draft the exact **Line 10 text** (per IRS wording) to paste into your form, including the \"d/b/a\" and EIN request?

      "content": "Thanks for sharing this page — it clears up something important.  \n\n---\n\n### What I see in your 2023 filing:\n- You filed **Form 1040** (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return), not 1040NR.  \n- On your H&R Block invoice, it lists “Form 1040NR/Foreign Income exclusions/credits/assets (each).” That doesn’t mean you filed as a nonresident — it means they prepared **Form 2555 (Foreign Earned Income Exclusion)** or related schedules *with your 1040*.  \n- Your Schedule C for Nur Creative Studio is included (expenses between $2–5k).  \n\n👉 This confirms: **You are a U.S. tax resident in the IRS’s eyes.** Even if you lived abroad, you filed the standard resident return (1040). That’s exactly what Form 8802/Form 6166 is based on.  \n\n---\n\n### What this means for your Form 8802\n1. **TIN**: Use your **SSN** (not EIN).  \n2. **Applicant type (line 4)**:  \n   - ☑ Individual → Sole proprietor  \n   - ☑ Disregarded entity → LLC  \n3. **Tax form filed (line 5)**: 1040 (with Schedule C).  \n4. **Years requested (line 7)**: 2023 (optionally add 2024).  \n5. **Penalties of perjury statement (line 10)**: required — you must write it out.  \n   - For your case:  \n     > “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I was a resident of the United States within the meaning of U.S. income tax laws for calendar year 2023, and that this application and any attachments are true, correct, and complete. Please issue Form 6166 showing the name ‘Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN 81-4514826).’”  \n\n---\n\n### Paying the $85 user fee\nThe correct link on Pay.gov is:  \n👉 [**IRS Certs – Certs User Fee for Form 8802**](https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/12164322)  \n\nSteps:  \n1. Go there, click **Continue**.  \n2. Fill out your info (name, SSN, etc.), pay $85.  \n3. You’ll get a **confirmation number** → write it in the box at the top of Form 8802 (“Electronic payment confirmation no.”).  \n4.

You filed a **Form 1040**, not 1040NR\n- The copy you uploaded is **Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, 2023)**.  \n- That means you filed as a **U.S. tax resident**.  \n- Even if you claimed a **foreign income exclusion (Form 2555)**, you’re still considered a U.S. resident for treaty purposes.  \n\n👉 That’s good news, because it makes you fully eligible for **Form 6166 (Certificate of U.S. Tax Residency)**.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. What to put on **Form 8802**\n- **Line 5** → check **1040** (since that’s the return you filed).  \n- You can note “1040 with Schedule C and Form 2555 (foreign earned income exclusion)” if you want to be precise, but “1040” is enough.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Line 10 (perjury statement)  \nHere’s the **final IRS-approved wording** tailored to you. Copy-paste this into Line 10:  \n\n> **“Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I was a resident of the United States within the meaning of U.S. income tax laws for calendar year 2023, and that this application and any attachments are true, correct, and complete. Please issue Form 6166 showing the name ‘Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN: 81-4514826).’”**  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Pay.gov step\n- Yes, you **upload your completed Form 8802 PDF** on that Pay.gov “IRS Certs” page.  \n- Then you pay $85.  \n- You’ll get a **confirmation page** with an **Agency Tracking ID**.  \n- Write that number in the **top-right box** of Form 8802 where it says “Electronic payment confirmation no.”  \n\n---\n\n✅ Bottom line:  \n- You’re fine, even though you lived abroad — because you filed a 1040.  \n- France will only accept the **IRS certificate (Form 6166)**, not your 1040.  \n- Once you upload 8802 + pay on Pay.gov, you’re done.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to also draft a **short cover note** you can send with your 8802 upload (and later to the French school) that explains:  \n- You file as a U.S. tax resident,  \n- Your LLC is disregarded (so the certificate will be in your name),  \n- And that the IRS certificate should satisfy the French tax audit?",

      "content": "Exactly — and this is the subtle but important distinction:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Residency vs. Paying Taxes**\n- The **1040** is the tax return U.S. **citizens and residents** must file each year, no matter where they live.  \n- Filing a 1040 means the IRS treats you as a **U.S. tax resident** — even if:  \n  - You lived abroad all year, and  \n  - You excluded most or all of your income with the **Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (Form 2555)**, so you didn’t owe U.S. income tax.  \n\n👉 Residency ≠ owing taxes.  \nYou can be a U.S. tax resident (filing 1040) while paying $0 U.S. taxes because exclusions/credits wiped out your liability.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. What your 1040 shows\nFrom the pages you uploaded:  \n- **You filed a 1040 (not 1040NR).** That confirms you’re a U.S. resident taxpayer.  \n- Line 24 shows only a small self-employment tax amount ($217).  \n- Your **federal income tax owed was $0** — but you still filed, so you’re still recognized as U.S. tax resident.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Why this matters for Form 8802 / 6166\n- The IRS doesn’t care whether you actually paid income tax — they care whether you filed as a U.S. resident.  \n- Since you filed 1040 (not 1040NR), the IRS will issue **Form 6166** confirming you are a U.S. tax resident.  \n- That’s what the French school needs to avoid withholding tax.  \n\n---\n\n✅ So yes, **even though you lived abroad all year and didn’t pay U.S. income tax**, you are still a **U.S. tax resident** under IRS rules. That’s why you’re eligible for Form 6166.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to draft a **one-paragraph explanation** you can forward to the French school now — saying that you filed 1040 as a U.S. resident, that you’ve applied for Form 6166 from the IRS, and that this certificate will be their official proof?",

      "content": "This is a really good and important question. Let’s separate **U.S. tax residency** from **French tax residency** and then see how the treaties fit in:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **What it means to be a U.S. tax resident**\n- For the IRS, if you are a **U.S. citizen** (which you are), you are always a **U.S. tax resident** — even if you live abroad the whole year.  \n- That means you are required to file a **Form 1040** every year, reporting *worldwide income*.  \n- You can then reduce or eliminate U.S. tax by using tools like:  \n  - **Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (Form 2555)**  \n  - **Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116)**  \n\n👉 So being a U.S. citizen = automatic U.S. tax resident. It’s about filing obligations, not where you live.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **French tax residency**\nFrance looks at different rules. You may be considered French tax resident if you:  \n- Live in France more than **183 days per year**, OR  \n- Your **household/family** is based in France, OR  \n- Your **main professional activity** is in France, OR  \n- Your **center of economic interests** is in France.  \n\nIf one of these applies, France can also claim you as a French tax resident.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **What happens if both countries claim you**\nThat’s where the **U.S.–France tax treaty** comes in.  \n- The treaty has **“tie-breaker rules”** to decide which country has the first right to tax your income.  \n- Generally, if you live and work in France, France will have **primary taxing rights** on that income.  \n- The U.S. still makes you file a 1040, but you can exclude that income (Form 2555) or claim French taxes paid as a credit (Form 1116), so you don’t get taxed twice.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **For your situation (2023)**\n- You filed a **1040** → you are a U.S. tax resident.  \n- You also lived in France all year → France could also see you as a French tax resident.  \n- The treaty avoids **double taxation**:  \n  - If France taxes your local income, you don’t have to pay full U.S. tax on it.  \n  - If the U.S. taxes it, you can deduct French taxes paid.  \n\n👉 The French school is asking for **Form 6166** only to prove to the French tax authorities that you are a U.S. tax resident. That way, *they* don’t have to withhold French tax on the money they paid you.  \n\n---\n\n✅ Summary:  \n- Being a **U.S. tax resident** = you must file a 1040 and report worldwide income, no matter where you live.  \n- Living in France makes you potentially a **French tax resident** too, but the **treaty prevents double taxation**.  \n- The certificate (Form 6166) doesn’t exempt you from French taxes personally — it just prevents the **French payer (the school)** from withholding tax from your invoice.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to make a **simple diagram** showing:  \n- U.S. tax residency,  \n- French tax residency,  \n- How the treaty tie-breakers work,  \n- And where **Form 6166** fits in?",

      "content": "Let’s unpack this carefully, using what you’ve shared (your 2023 **Form 1040** and Schedule C, with a small amount of self-employment tax shown).  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Did you pay your **U.S. taxes**?  \n- ✅ Yes — you filed a **Form 1040** as required of U.S. citizens (so you met your filing obligation).  \n- Your income was mostly excluded (likely through the **foreign earned income exclusion – Form 2555**), so you didn’t owe **U.S. income tax**.  \n- But your return shows **$217 in self-employment tax** → that is a U.S. tax you did pay.  \n\n👉 So yes, you **paid what the IRS required** for 2023.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Did you meet your **treaty obligations with France**?  \nThe treaty works like this:  \n- If you live and work in France, France has **primary taxing rights** on your French-sourced income.  \n- The U.S. still makes you file a 1040 (because you’re a citizen).  \n- The treaty + IRS rules (foreign earned income exclusion or foreign tax credits) are designed so you don’t get taxed twice.  \n\nFrom what you shared:  \n- You filed **1040 with Schedule C + Form 2555** → that’s the correct U.S. side.  \n- On the French side, if you lived and worked there in 2023, you may also be expected to file a **French income tax return**.  \n- The treaty doesn’t mean you don’t pay France → it means if you do, you get relief in the U.S. return (credit or exclusion).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Where **Form 6166** fits in  \n- It’s not about your personal taxes in France.  \n- It’s about the **French payer (the school)**: if they don’t have your 6166, the French tax authority could make them **withhold 25%** of what they paid you.  \n- With the certificate, they can show you are already taxed in the U.S., so they don’t have to withhold.  \n\n---\n\n✅ So, to answer directly:  \n- You **did pay your U.S. taxes** (small SE tax + $0 income tax because of exclusions).  \n- You **met your U.S. treaty obligations** by filing a 1040 and applying the foreign earned income exclusion.  \n- You may still have a **French filing obligation** for 2023 since you lived there — that’s separate, but the treaty ensures you don’t pay twice on the same income.  \n\n---\n\nWould it help if I mapped out **your exact obligations in 2023** in a simple table (U.S. side vs French side vs treaty outcome)?",

      "content": "Yes 👍 — that’s exactly what you need.  \n\nIt hits both key requirements:  \n\n1. **IRS-required language**  \n> “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I was a resident of the United States within the meaning of U.S. income tax laws … and that this application and any attachments are true, correct, and complete.”  \n✅ That’s the legally required certification.  \n\n2. **Optional request for DBA/EIN**  \n> “Please issue Form 6166 showing the name ‘Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN: 81-4514826).’”  \n✅ This makes it clear you want the LLC name and EIN on the certificate, which will help the French school match it to their records.  \n\n---\n\nIf you want to make it **perfectly clean** in IRS style, you could phrase it like this (tiny tweak):  \n\n> “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I was a resident of the United States within the meaning of U.S. income tax laws for calendar year 2023, and that this application and any attachments are true, correct, and complete. Please issue Form 6166 showing the name ‘Bilal Ghalib d/b/a Nur Creative Studio LLC (EIN: 81-4514826).’”  \n\n---\n\n✅ Either version will work.  \nThe tweak just mirrors the IRS sample language (“for calendar year ___”) more exactly.  \n\nDo you want me to also show you how to word it if you decide to request **both 2023 and 2024** in the same application (so you don’t need to do this again later this year)?",

      "content": "Exactly ✅ — you don’t need to mention **how** you were a resident or that you filed a 1040.  \n\nHere’s why:  \n\n- The IRS already knows you filed a **1040**. They’ll cross-check Form 8802 against their records.  \n- The **legal requirement** for Line 10 is just to declare:  \n  1. That you were a **resident of the United States within the meaning of U.S. income tax laws** for the year requested, and  \n  2. That your application is true and complete.  \n\nNothing more.  \n\n---\n\n💡 In fact, keeping it simple is safest. If you add extra explanations (“I filed a 1040…” / “I lived abroad…”), it could create confusion or raise questions.  \n\nSo the clean version is:  \n\n> **“Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I was a resident of the United States within the meaning of U.S. income tax laws for calendar year 2023, and that this application and any attachments are true, correct, and complete.
