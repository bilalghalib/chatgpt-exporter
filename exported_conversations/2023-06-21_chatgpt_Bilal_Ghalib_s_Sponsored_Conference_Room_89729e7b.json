We're in discussions with some partners/donors for additional projects, but we're not sure when those will come through, or at what scale. If there is possibility for financial support to attend the gathering in July, that would be much appreciated. 🙏 \n\nThanks so much for your efforts to make this an inclusive gathering. Please let us know your thoughts on that, how best to approach that, etc. \n\nThanks again and best wishes, \n\nDMN\n\n(David) Munir Nabti CEO/GM, Startup Trainer, Innovation/Policy Advisor\n\nHelp us grow our impact: www.bloom.pm/donate\n\nWe're hiring: www.bloom.pm/jointheteam\n\nGet updates & opportunities in our twice-monthly newsletter.\n\n     \n\nBloom runs high quality data-driven online and hybrid entrepreneurship, social enterprise, and skill development programs. (Bloom is an affiliate of AltCity Impact, a registered non-profit based in Lebanon.)  \n\nOn Tue, Feb 21, 2023 at 10:16 PM Alejandra Garza <alejandra@wellbeing-project.org> wrote:\n\nHello, we hope that this email finds you well.\n\nWe are delighted that you have confirmed your attendance to our in-person gathering this July in Switzerland!

I apologize for my tardiness in responding, the last 10 days have been hectic with travel but I am back now.\n\nWe reviewed this with our internal team and are glad to share that The Wellbeing Project can cover your accommodation (1 person, food and lodging, 3 nights & 4 days) for the WISE Gathering in Caux Palace this July. Do you think that, with this support, you would be able to pay for your roundtrip flight?\n\nPlease let us know if this scenario could work for you, we are a small nonprofit but are honored to be able to help you in this way. We truly value having you as a member of the WISE Network.\n\nAdditionally, as we said in earlier emails if you have any ideas regarding fundraising please reach out to us and we can discuss further.\n\nWe look forward to your response, \n\nAnd most of all, we look forward to meeting in July!

How is that stuff going? \n\nI've added brief notes in the \"WISE (Wellbeing Project) - Bloom Internal Notes Start Here\" (though I don't have for all meetings, but a few are there, and let's work to aggregate that stuff there or somewhere ... can you add in brief notes in there? Or do we have a separate doc where we have notes? \n\nObviously preference is to get more of us out to this gathering ... so hopefully we can figure out how to make that happen. \n\nThanks much! \n\n[Quoted text hidden]\n\nDavid Munir Nabti <dmn@bloom.pm>Wed, Apr 5, 2023 at 8:33 AM\n\nTo: Alejandra Garza <alejandra@wellbeing-project.org>\n\nCc: Silvana de Cisneros <silvana@wellbeing-project.org>, Dara Mouracade <dara@bloom.pm>, Habib Tawk <habib@bloom.pm>, Bilal Ghalib <bilal@bloom.pm>\n\nHi Alejandra and Silvana, \n\nFirst off, apologies for delays in responding to this. We discussed internally, and then got caught up in some other deadlines. \n\nSecond of all, thanks for the offer and invitation, and we're happy to accept. If you folks seem to find additional funds available (or if our financial situation improves), we'd love to have an additional 1-2 people attend, and we're exploring shifting things around internally to help us participate more in the WISE efforts, and build towards more collaborations with the community of partners. \n\nWe'd also be happy to support in other ways, in terms of helping facilitate sessions, leading workshops, etc. For example, we're doing some really interesting experiments in how to integrate AI into our programs and platform, and leverage AI to help support NI (natural/human intelligence), and help people and programs understand the complex needs and priorities of individuals and teams and suggest possible next-best activities for growth. Perhaps it could be of interest to do some sort of workshop on AI with the participants, and help them think of how they could leverage AI in their institutions and efforts to promote wellbeing. (We're working on other interesting efforts related to wellbeing assessments, data, facilitation techniques, etc as well.) We're all experimenting with those things on the team, and Bilal is leading some exciting efforts as well, so perhaps we could do a joint workshop on that, or explore some other way to share that info with people in the WISE community. \n\nIn terms of fundraising, we'll think about that as well, and also the idea came up a few times of jointly applying to RFPs/developing projects with WISE partners to guide towards implementing activities and conducting action-oriented research, but we haven't taken action yet on that. If you folks have any ideas for that, or know of possible RFPs that we could develop some consortium around, please let us know and we can see how to follow up on that. \n\nThanks again for your efforts!

Thank you so much for reaching out. We are honored to read that this support from our part can help you attend the gathering! We are glad to be able to help in this way and to see you in Switzerland!\n\nWe hope to have additional news for helping more members by the end of this month / early may. We are trying to do the best we can under our limitations / capabilities, and are trying to help at least 1 person from each institution to attend. Regarding the workshop, thank you for volunteering! We are in the process of developing the agenda for Switzerland and will let you know once we have news for participation of this kind. Also, a workshop on fundraising or exploring how we can all fundraise would be a great idea too! A lot of members have mentioned interest in this but none knows where / how to start.. maybe we could have a space for brainstorming on this in Switzerland and even a WG could arise from this, who knows!\n\nThanks again for reaching out and for all of the Bloom team's enthusiasm around WISE!\n\nWishing you all a beautiful week ahead,\n\nWarmly, \n\n[Quoted text hidden]\n\nDavid Munir Nabti <dmn@bloom.pm>Wed, Jun 7, 2023 at 2:24 PM\n\nTo: Alejandra Garza <alejandra@wellbeing-project.org>, Silvana de Cisneros <silvana@wellbeing-project.org>\n\nCc: Bilal Ghalib <bilal@bloom.pm>, Dara Mouracade <dara@bloom.pm>\n\nHi Alejandra and Silvana, \n\nSounds great all around, and I'm adding in Dara and Bilal here to keep them in the loop. \n\nAs for the gathering in Geneva, I'll check if either of us will have a +1 along. (Bilal, the Caux Palace Guidelines are here).\n\nAs for the fundraising efforts, sure sounds good. I'm familiar with and have organized unconferences before :-) , and I'll see what I / we can do to prepare for that before the gathering. \n\nAs for a community coffee before the gathering ... I think that's cool as well, and happy to support / facilitate again if you want, and build on what we did last time, and probably adapt it to help people get the most out of the Geneva gathering, since it's quite close ... maybe introduce the unconference approach, help people think of topics, etc? Let us know what you decide on that and we can go from there. \n\nAs for the regional summits, is there any more information you can share on that? How those are working, financial arrangements, etc? I'd love to explore whether it's possible to organize a MENA one as well, and maybe have it a mix of online+in-person? Or complementary gatherings? We know some good people and groups that could potentially collaborate on that. \n\nAs for June 13, I'm facilitating a session that overlaps with the first 30 minutes or so ... so I'll join a bit late, but look forward to it. :-) \n\nCheers! :-) \n\n(David) Munir Nabti CEO/GM, Startup Trainer, Innovation/Policy Advisor\n\nHelp us grow our impact: www.bloom.pm/donate\n\nWe're hiring: www.bloom.pm/jointheteam\n\nGet updates & opportunities in our twice-monthly newsletter.\n\n     \n\nBloom runs high quality data-driven online and hybrid entrepreneurship, social enterprise, and skill development programs. (Bloom is an affiliate of AltCity Impact, a registered non-profit based in Lebanon.)  \n\nOn Wed, Jun 7, 2023 at 12:53 AM Alejandra Garza <alejandra@wellbeing-project.org> wrote:\n\nSo happy to hear from you David, I hope that you are well! We are thrilled to read that Bilal will be attending as well!\n\nRegarding your sponsorship, that is correct, we will cover both your accommodations (food and lodging for July 6-9th, starting with lunch July 6th and ending with breakfast July 9th). You must cover your costs regarding travel. Any extra costs like double occupancy for the rooms or extra meals must be covered by you as well, if interested. I can put you in touch with Caux Palace so that you guys can pay for that through them.\n\nAbout the fundraising efforts, we agree and would enjoy having a space for that in our Gathering. We will share more on our June 13th call with the network, the idea is to build some parts of our agenda for Switzerland together and have multiple activities where people can join / pitch in according to each person's interests. This will happen until we're together in Caux Palace, it is a framework called \"unconferencing\" that Ken Elston will share next week in our call, and members can volunteer to lead certain sessions. We will also have time in Switzerland to work on what the WGs have been discussing, I imagine you could volunteer for this fundraising topic, which has been talked about in both the Community and Documentation WGs. I would say we could wait to have the June 13th call and then see if a call is necessary. What do you think?\n\nWe also want to see if another informal coffee break can take place by June  20-27 before Switzerland, we'll see how the Online Gathering goes and decide if this would be a good idea :)  About the event in Dubai, we would be glad to get to know more! Let us know if there is anything we can do to keep that conversation going and explore possible collaborations.  Lastly, what Bilal mentioned to you about our distributed \"Wellbeing Conferences\" - do you mean our regional wellbeing summits? If it's the case, then yes! Some Wellbeing Project members and partners are hosting several regional summits, replicating what we experienced in Bilbao! There are 5 happening this year, please see below:\n\nI hope this information helps! We would be glad to jump in a call with you as well if you'd like.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you guys in the Online gathering call June 13th as well as in Switzerland!\n\nWarm hug!",
