We haven’t, we wanted someone to get us started. \nNice to have someone walk us through first. \n\n\nWhat the hell are we doing with these people?\n\nPreparing some questions/info gathering. \nRemaining questions? \nHow long have they been working together?\n\nHow do we that that?\nWHAT IF IT WAS EASY AND FUN.\n(No prep, listen/show them how to figure it out.)\nGeneric Design From Muj\nHow are you\nWhy are you here?\nTake all these things and design the session on the fly to cover. \nAfter we do it. We add two more hours personally where Muj+Bilal \nCheckin:\nBilal:\nCheckin, doing one thing at a time. \nMuj:\nBack home, feeling like it’s actually home. Wondering about the experiment and how it’s going. \nThis bowl is awesome, I used to eat my breakfast in this every day. It’s not about the bowl. Memories stay in the place. Bilal: Is that true? Becoming the memory?\n\nWorkshop Information:\nWorkshop 5 : Software Prototyping tools and methods\nAt least one person per team is required to attend the program (ideally two )\nParticipants are required to bring a laptop to all the sessions, this is to facilitate the use of exercises and learning tools\nLocation :  A6 building ground floor, Al Warsha\nTime : 5:00PM - 7:00PM (UAE Time)\n\n 1.⁠ ⁠Ages: All early twenties, most are current university students at NYUAD, some are recent graduates. \n 2.⁠ ⁠Scholastic background: Column M in the \"Final Cohort\" sheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xDTqSg9SH05up8agIQidL1ZGTcFUJvOoyeLciBRJQl8/edit#gid=166574669 \n 3.⁠ ⁠Familiarity with digital tools: Ya, basic ones like Google Docs is fine ... they're all bright tech-savvy university students with basic tools. \n 4.⁠ ⁠Mac/Windows/Linux: Probably even split Mac/Windows ... I doubt any using Linux. Some teams do have developer members/cofounders though, but not all. \n 5.⁠ ⁠Laptop vs. Phone: All have both \n 6.⁠ ⁠Automation tools: For most it will be new. We can add that to a google form though if you want. All are aiming to be digital platforms ... though a fair number connect to offline services (tutoring, supporting local shops and small businesses, connecting people to local workshops / activities, etc) \n 7.⁠ ⁠Projects: They all have clear projects, idea-stage doing early validation ... see basic info in Columns P & Q in that same g-link I shared above. \n 8.⁠ ⁠Signing up or Mandatory: It's an optional pre-accelerator program at NYUAD... not for credit, not part of a class. \n9.⁠ ⁠Sending pre-content / pre-readings / pre-videos: \nYes it's possible. \nThere's also a group slack for the group, maybe we can invite you to join that as well (I should probably engage more there ... and it would be great to boost engagement with them ... though it has been a bit of a hectic time. :-/ ) \n10.⁠ ⁠Emails/Social:\nYa sure ... they're trying to do more comms on slack, but we could ask for their socials/etc as well. \n\nI also started creating this sheet to have compiled shared notes and a sort of \"leaderboard\" ... but it isn't done yet. Will work on that in the coming days. \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s63fERR_deCl8ZUQ_6CoyIGinPWDZj7nKGydkUp3dgc/edit#gid=0\n\nThoughts? \n\nCheers! 🙂\n\n",

      "content": "Subject: Inquiry About Discount Codes and Professional Account for Upcoming Workshop\n\nDear Mariam,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you regarding an upcoming workshop I am conducting for a group of budding entrepreneurs at a university in the UAE. As part of the training, I plan to introduce them to Softr and its capabilities.\n\nConsidering the potential for new users from this workshop, I was wondering if Softr might offer any discount codes for these participants. Such an incentive could significantly encourage their engagement with your platform.\n\nAdditionally, I'm interested in accessing a professional account at bg@bilalghalib.com. This would enable me to showcase more advanced features of Softr to the attendees, further enhancing the learning experience.\n\nI look forward to your response and any possibilities for collaboration.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
