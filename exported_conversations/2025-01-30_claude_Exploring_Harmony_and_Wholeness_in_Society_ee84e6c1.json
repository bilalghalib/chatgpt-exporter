      "content": "In the this conversation I shared what’s the book outline I remember talking about 3 sections, can you share it? What are a few other outlines and ways to share my story\n\n[[[it's it's it's like most of the people humans uh on earth not all humans because uh there are still people that are um in the same um uh way that you believed and the whole the world that they're in relationship, that won everything. But uh our uh w Western society, uh based on science and uh capitalism and everything, those people are kind of believing in science neither than the believer take it try to take some steps back and understand the whole like uh uh where where we are our our planet in the universe and what is the universe, based time and uh how what do we know, what we don't know and uh how earth is uh uh uh working instead of uh saying it's doing that it is and uh we are running too much fuel, we are eating too much and it's we can do uh uh in another way. Yeah.  Like fatalism. Yeah. It's fatalism scientism and fatalism that are killing the the sacred uh and yeah, the sacred uh look at the wholeness and but this is why I wanted to get a very um historic view, you know, because you just look I was happening now.  I'm trying, yeah. This is a part of what I want to share. It's like the history. like is it we' just pop up here and and we aren't necessarily like, you know, some people think of progress like this, right?  It just goes, I guess, and we are seeing the most clearly right now. We have the best ideas, the best science, then will you ever have, and tomorrow will be even more clear and more true and more real. There's a Christian of what is progress.  What is progress or like what is true knowledge? And the thing is I don't want to talk negatively about capitalism or negatively about scientism, what I want to say is uh, where did those ideas emerge from? Why is it so much a dominant?  Yeah, and to show like, oh, well, it makes sense that we did that. But also, does it make sense that it we could be overdoing it? Because it does make sense to try to protect yourself, right?  Like let's say, you know, for instance, you've got to a car accident you weren't wearinging your seatbelt. You got hurt. And then after that you start wearing your seatbelt.  That's okay. That's a good lesson, right? And so part of the lesson that, you know, we could have used science to use if we had it back then, to learn about the black plague, is people would already concentrating into cities.  People were already over like I was doing this research today. There were depleting their farms. They were overproducing on their farms, they were getting less returns, so people were under nourished like cities were crowded and dirty and like the conditions were good for a plague, you know?  But uh that doesn't happen in in cultures that don't have something that makes people think the best the right thing, you know? And the to live, to live in this way to like uh have a, uh, also a part of it was the peasant and landowner relationship at this hierarchy of dominance, and that's why I had to go back before the black plague because the black plague made me realize a little bit more about like why people left religion and why people were looking for hedonism and more like focus on life and individualism, but before that there was this bringing in of hierarchy and power structures, because when Christianity was not formalized, it was very diverse, a lot of different opinions. There was nobody to tell you might think that other person is really wrong, but you and 100 people will think that them and 100 people there was no pope, there was no like massive Catholic church. before the Myan creed was decreed, and they brought many different Christians and I think.  NIAN creed. Yeah. NIC EE So this thing.  Creed of constantinople happened in like ten first canceled Nicea 325, not like a 440 451. So it happened about like five 300 to 500 years after Jesus., basically it's after the Roman Empire uh end. Yeah, but it basically transitioned into the Christian Empire, because Constantine became Christian, uh the like it was a it was a Romanonsenseinople, there's double Chchus guy where.  Oh, wow, they have it. And so what I what I started looking into right now was like what were the things that were formalized here? That uh first Council of Contents in O Roman yes, a Roman emperor was the first one to put it together.  And so they inherited a lot of the Romans ideas about power, right? Like what's his name? Um Marcus Aurelius is considered a god, okay?  This is I bought the book uh thought for myself. Yeah, he he's an interesting guy and he's a very thoughtful guy, but in in Roman like early Roman history, the kings were considered gods, right? And so this idea of hierarchy and of an authority that is more important and can control and subjugate the under length begins in the Roman Empire and then gets brought into Christianity because now that there is a an authority in Christianity, now, like all of these people said, like, this is what Christianity is.  We can't have anybody saying that Jesus was just a prophet, we can't have people like differing about these different details. We are now going to sit down and just write like this is Christianity and everyone else is wrong. And it created this uh church people god and the churches in between kind of thing.  Yeah, the clergy and um like the this hierarchy. And and yeah, so so this is what I was sort of to to do this kind of historical analysis. And there's a gap here, like I did it I think I figured out a little bit more about like the black plague and how that led to like individualism and that, you know, at some point leads to capitalism and, you know, it keeps going from there.  But before the black plague, there were the things that gave rise to the conditions that let the black plague emerge, which is congested cities, um, uh impoverished people, uh close, like condition for Yeah. So this this part I want to understand a little bit better, and I think it has something to do with the the Nican creed and this hierarchy that gets imported into Christianity that creates this like peasant landowner divide, which you can so at a seat today in terms of like hierarchical power structures. How do you uh study all this?  I mean, I knew about a lot of these pieces before. but then I started to think like of course I knew about the church. history documentaries, studies. on all the different of these things like I found a book today for the black plague. I'm going to see if I can get it. But basically like I've I've known about, you know, I read a book called Galileo's error and it's about Galileo when he first came up with his idea about the language of the world as written in mathematics, language of the University of mathematics.  He also says, but that doesn't capture quality. That is a separate thing. My whole like mathematical science approach is to focus on what I can actually define mathematically.  But there is quality, but people ignore the quality things that you say and focus on his idea that the world is describable by this systems. And so I know all of these things I have read many books in the history, but I started thinking today about the question of just making it very simple. It's like where did Oneness go?  You know, where did the sense that everything is a cohesive, holistic thing that we're a part of, go and why do we have this alienation and the sense of me versus the world? me. So that's the that's the only question and then I want to look at history through that lens, because I think, like instead of trying to go like talk about climate collapse or talk about alienation or loneliness or war or all of these things.  I think those things are effects of a mindset of alienation, a mindset of other, a mindset of not one of of many and I must protect. And so I'm trying to like go backwards, figure that out. And then what I want to do with the book is give people an experience of wait a second, not, there is quality, you know?  Like, first of all it' be like, that's where my ideas come from. You know? For me, I had this big realization one day because I grew up in a very conservative Muslim family, but uh there's actually a lot of different ways to think about with some, you know?  And in history, there's a lot. And at some point in my life I was meeting Muslims that were like very different than me, you know? They had different behaviors, they were smoking pot and still Muslim and they were comfortable with themselves.  It was like they were g marijuana. They were ganaan Rostafarianyncretic Muslims, okay? Meaning they mixed between inside?  Yeah,. And so I met these people and they were like, yeah, well, most of them Rust God. and Allah Muslim Arabic, right? And so they were like, Jah.  I'm like, whoa, how are you who you are? How? And then I was I had this moment when I was young.  I was like, how am I who I am? And then I started deconstructing where I got my religious ideas from, and its history, which was related actually weirdly enough to the British because the British mess everything up, and Saudi Arabia, and they picked this one gahhe, maybe randomly, maybe strategically, but they p so, you know, in many traditions, everything has a bell curve, everything can be put on a bell curve, right? There's extremes, and then most people are in the middle, right?  is a science bell normal curve.ussian curve. They picked the guy that was just more extreme than everyone else, you know, the guy that's like very strict and very tight and very like difficult with his interpretation, who's like music is had on and everything is had on and you know, like a very uh once make things hard, right? But even in our book theoran it says God wants ease and not hardship, but for whatever reason he skips that that thing when he reads the book, and he gave because he is so funny the history and the accidents.  Look what happens. This guy becomes the king of Saudi Arabia because he's promoted by the British, the British, you know, kind of I handed it over to him and he becomes not the king, but he he influences the king and he kind of creates the the religion of the whole country, right? The most moral looks to Saudi Arabia because it has Mecca, as like the most Mussim place in the world, right?  But what happens is not only are they they already have like Saudi Mecah and like most people think of it as the most most place in the world, they find oil in the 70s. And now they can supercharge their ideology and spread it around the world, right? So when you open up oran in the messages that I was growing up in Michigan, on the front, it says a king, a gift from the king of Saudi Arabia that they were paying for scholars to get trained in their way of thinking, and then they would fly them around the world and implant them in mosques and that's where my ideas came from.  That's where like I was taught it's called stelapism or wabism, okay? Because the guy was named Yeah. Was his name Abdalbin and Wahb?  a very uh, like you said, uh angry thoughts, uh, very strict and controlling. And it's um those people are like, uh help theirselves withorum and no, I don't I't the thing that I was trying to get to here is the interesting thing is there were two accidents that made it so that this interpretation of Isem was mine. I grew up thinking it was just true.  It was the way I understood the religion and like one I know thinks this way and taught me that this is the right way to think. um I didn't know that there was such a thing as diversity and that maybe they have different ways of thinking. I thought everyone else was wrong and we were right, okay? Until I did the exercise and I realized like, okay, the British picked Abdalele in Wahab randomly.  I don't know why they picked them, but they picked him and then, too, is that country that uh uh is now very rich and can spread its ideas around the world. And that's why I have this ideas. And so that's kind of what I want this book to do.  I want people not to just think like, oh, down with capitalism or, oh, down with the, you know, like, let's all take, uh mushrooms and be one with the universe or something and like like dress like Native Americans and live back to the land. No, like there there were different ways of seeing the world that got filtered out and blocked systematically because of historical events and how they influenced culture and philosophy, and all of these things kind of work together, you know? And I think some of those very critical ones are the hundredyear war, the thirty Year War, where most of Europe is just fighting religious wars.  If you know a little bit about history, there was a period where there was a lot of religious wars in Europe between No, religious wars between the Protestants and the Catholics and yeah. And then those those two I don't know how those influen the the thinking, though. Tuesday should be history.  And then before that, there's the black plague and how that influences thing. and before that I think it's the IN creed and how that influences things. So the Niccing creed brings this dominance hierarchy structure, the black plague brings in the individualism. And then after that we have the hundredyear award that removes uh like makes it more secular.  So it's like hierarchical individualistic, secular, scientific, and each those things has a progression. and they add up to each other, right? hierarchy and power, like individual than individual power. Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You getting it. And so, uh, but I think once people see this and then they realize like, oh, holy crap, that's why we're like this. That's why we like people talk about like Western culture What do you expect, uh, which kind of effects?  I want first this realization, this aha of like, oh, that makes sense. That's why I feel that's why we are so disconnected from nature and why people in different cultures have a different relationship. there is like a bias. Maybe there is a bias because not every people are interested in those subjects.  And then even if uh these ideas would be spread and known by everybody, do you think that most of the people would be able to understand. This is why the so that's the prep work. That prepares the mind for the next step, which is the most important step, which is to re access a natural faculty, I think everyone has and everyone knows the faculty that is activated when they sense true love, not lust, the faculty when they see nature that makes them stop in their tracks and just look in awe, right?  This this faculty that knows truth, goodness, and beauty, as, and that those three things are three things, but there are also one thing in a moment of awe, there's no words. Words are the things that take one and make it into many, and so that experience, the faculty of what I call quality, not quantity, not numbers, the quality, is non segmentable, but when you start to put words on it, you use words like beauty, truth and love. But in reality, that's one thing, okay?  And so what I want to do is get people to understand that that used to be an experience that we have, this integrated sense of a whole, this thing where, you know, the thing that in other cultures turns into people communicating with trees and animals, and even if they're going to sacrifice an animal doing it respectfully, only as much as they need, knowing their bounds because they know they're a part of a complete system that is in harmony, that there is an idea of harmony that things are inbaled, the yin and the yang I take when I can and I give when I can and like this kind of less domineering, more integrated, more relational structure emerges from all I want people to do is acknowledge that love is love and it's not so molecule. That's it. And to do that, I think we can take two steps.  One is that this perception is true and that this perception is reliable. Okay? So what what we need to do is help people distinguish between emotions and mood and a quality perception.  Does that make sense? Because some people might think like, I am falling in love. I'm feeling love.  It's like, no, just chill for a second. Wait. Is that love or is this like, excitement?  Is it lust? Is it, uh like, how do how do you know when you're feeling something that is connected to this thing that I'm talking about that is connected to the beyond to this thing that is meaningful and true in a deep way, uh and and distinguishing it from all of these fleeting emotions that go up and down and change and definitely have hormonal and biological and physiological uh can uh relationships. uh and there are people that are studying um awe, right? They're actually looking at a in like the sense of amazement, right?  In neuroscience and cognitive science, and so actually, I think my book is going to require me to do a lot of interesting research finding those researchers that are looking into these things and in in the end, I want to do a historical thing, a scientific thing, and then an experiential thing. can you go these humanity contemplation? Which one the sense of quality? I call it a faculty.  It's just like we have a faculty of hearing and seeing and smelling and tasting. We have another faculty of perception. love, goodness and truth, is the thing that, you know, you see a sunset and you just stop and like, that's amazing. Or like a waterfall or a a beautiful antelope with huge antlers in the wild, and you have this like sense of alive awe connection, reverence, you know?  Or or love is maybe more more most people, uh find it, if they have a sense of true love, like, for instance, you're holding your baby for the first time, right? And then, you know, you might ask people, okay, what happened there? What happened when I'm realizing is like, all of these things happened with an Icyon creed and the dominant structure and then the black plague and being like, I should live my life before I die or whatever.  Like all these things kind of add up to a way of being that blocks that way of seeing, that perception, that faculty that we have. It exists, though. It doesn't go anywhere.  It's like it's like we we have been walking around with one eye closed and they were like, hey, one second, just like try opening this this eye a little bit and like, what. Whoa, I can see in 3D. And that's kind of the the the metaphor that I want to say is we're seeing the world as if we have only one eye and it's flat and we don't have depth perception. It's kind of hard to tell, you know, how far things are.  But then, like once we open that second eye, we'll have depth reception and we'll know how to navigate our difficult and challenging times. It's not that we give up rational thinking or even self-protection. Like put on your seatbelt, you know, use science.  It's okay, you know, these are good things, but it needs to be put into balance with another good thing. And I would say, you know, because this is this is how I think is the right order is truth, goodness, beauty first, and science rationality to serve it. Like, should you should your head serve your heart or should your heart serve your head?  I think your head should serve your heart, you know? So this is my like thinking about it you know the same and uh I was wondering this faculty that that was more developed in the past before I see and maybe the faculty still exists in many cultures. it's meaningful. and do you think this faculty is hurt or maybe step in now This is one of the reasons why I wanted to do the research on near death experiences. A near death experiences, most of the time people come back and they make major life decisions.  Chang non-meaningful things are cut out of their life. They orient towards relationships, um, and it shows that it might take a wake-up call for people to pay more attention and realize what really matters in life, you know. And I think near that experiences do that. um But, you know, the whole planet is having a n nearative experience right now with climate collapse and all of these things.  And so many young people are considering suicide. There are, I think we talked about it last time, underage suicides, like preteenagers killing themselves, worried about the future. That is insane, okay?  Kids, like literally kids. And so the way I see it is like we are having a kind of planetary near death experience. There's a lot of stress and fear about the future.  People aren't having children and might lead to a population collapse. Like there's a lot of these issues. um and it's spilling out into the political sphere, that anxiety about things mean me first, um the France first, America first, refugees leave, you know, it's becoming more protective because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow and has all these negative consequences. And so I think, you know, talking about this and looking at like the research in near experiences and the the qu-quote solution is, I don't really want this book to be understood by everybody.  I just want to create practices that help people like connect to that perceptual faculty and acknowledges acknowledge its existence as a source of reliable and true information that is it's not like a, you know, some people talk about intuition to talk about some of these things. Like I have an intuition. I'm feeling, you know?  But it's just an idea, it's just a feeling, you know? But no, what if we distinguish between feelings and recognition? That's what I'm trying to suggest.  That we just like you recognize something with your eyes, like, this is a pencil. That's a pencil. You you can recognize something with that faculty, that perception.  Instead of saying, this is an intuition and then blowing it off as like, an emotion. an emotional as if it's not real, it'll just come and it will just go, being like, I have an intuition. Maybe I need to like dig into it and open that eye wider to get the message to get that message, right? And so it does involve some things like meditation or prayer or contemplation or just sitting with your emotions until you can see your emotions and then see beyond your emotions.  Like at some point, if you sit with your emotions, you can be like, oh, that's a feeling, it comes, and it goes, but this thing is here and it just stays. only a fancy. Yeah, we have the non-fancy version. We'll get a fancy one someday, don't worry, dear.  No, the toilet is That's right. Only one time the Japanese toilet in our parents' house. You've never really tried it.  Only one time because I was like you can change the pressure. You can make less strong. yeah, I's it's like taking a shower. It's it's less smeary. and spreading.  Yeah, yeah Arabs think of you know like people look at Arabs like dirty Arabs, Arabs look at the Western people and like, you're actually dirty, literally dirty. Definitely dirty. We were talking about this and I don't know, it's I had a family uh during my consultation on it was uh moment dad and uh the two children and uh so one were four years old and a girl was uh I think she was nine and uh they all have the gasro.  Oh no. And uh so uh I I exam then all and um I started with the little one and uh then uh the the mother and then the uh the the two of the the two others and uh at the end I was doing the prescription on the computer and the the little, the little boy, uh four years old, he was sitting on uh the legs of his. And he said mommy, I I shoot on myself oh no it's it's it went through the pens on the mother's legs.  I saw it was shit happens you took them like to the like what did you do you give them to it was only on the legs of the moment the children they went on the toilet and I gave them a tissues, yeah some tissues. four years old if he has a guest who you should wear diapers or something. Yeah. I don't know.  Yeah. So we now have both have our thesis to write. Yeah, but all these subjects are very deep and interesting and I think it's a good uh work yard you you are doing.  And it's very hard because you have to connect a lot of different things. You can have a consensus, but it's very hard to get it get to this point because people will always say that's not true we are all other influences or is just the, you know, it's just random evolution is run down and yeah, this is why one of the things I want to do is make it a a science by trying to build a community of people working on listening to that part of them that I think is a real thing. And then I don't know.  And then basically if it exists, it's gonna be in a tradition. It's gonna be in like a religious tradition or a spiritual tradition. I'm trying to say that this is like this is just something that human beings have access to.  This is why, like I don't think of myself as a Muslim because I grew up in this tradition. Like I had a very big period of exploration and questioning and wondering and it gives me also yeah, it gives me also a structure. But also, I think it's true.  Like I actually believe in the that if people were to think and explore and feel and let go over their biases and their emotions and try to understand, like, who am I? What is the world? Are we created?  Do we just as it just biological? Where do my ideas come from all of these things? That it might not look uh super Arab, uh, but like the fun the foundational principle of the most tradition is there's only one god.  And that he is not divisible, that uh he is the first and the last, and there's uh, you know, all of these like the the foundational principle is there's only one God and that the second most important thing is he doesn't leave us alone. He actually writes writes us stories and messages. I think there's only one thing, yeah.  Oh yeah, or like, uh the the Greeks, you know, with the the god of the things and, it's sort of like just questioning Yeah, they' that's actually kind of what Joe is doing these days. She's exploring the 99 names. And so there's there is only one god, but the the names are just like the Pantheon, like, there's the god of what is this?  the promoter or the advancer? the most merciful, the source of goodness, uh the avenger, uh the so so these like often come in pairs in the in the Muslim tradition, like today is uh we're reflecting on the name of God for the all seeing. One of the qualities uh Rahman.  Yeah. So this is the only Rahman only name of God that's Rahman.. So, the the way that the name works is very much like the Pathan or like Taoism, where there's often these binaries, right?  There's the first and the last, the one that honors people, the one that actually brings people to dishonor. the giver of life, the bring her to death, right? So this is still the one God, but it has these aspects. But the only one name that is ever used on its own is the most merciful. or thou god.  Which is not a description. There's either so it's either a law, which means the god or a Rahman, which means a the most merciful, and when God describes why he sent the messengers it's only to be a mercy for all of the universes. And so you get this idea that it is oneness and the primary quality of this oneness is goodness, love, beauty, truth, how everyone to talk about this all enveloping all nurturing mercy that is a the only other the only way that oneness wants to be understood in the Muslim tradition, at least.  But what I what I want to do with the book is to make it experiential, to ask people to do these practices, to reflect on what they think it means, to look at the history to understand, to to look at like one of the things that's really interesting is most indigenous cultures do have this property of oneness about it. And and being a part of a whole rather than everything is just random and there's a lot of different pieces and segmenting and cutting the world apart. It's the relational element with with everything.  And so I think that means something. I think there's something important to realize there and that Western culture is weird in the world. It's not normal.  It does spread because of the dominance and some of the different principles that cause it to be over overreaching, but to to say like, what would Western culture look like if we brought back the part of us that saw that we were part of everything else? You know? It's not that Western culture should book like native culture and have feathers in our hair or whatever.  No, like there's some really beautiful things about baguettes and berets, you know, it's great. B. B. is really wonderful things about these things, but like it's a special expression in English now? B?  No, I just made it. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay., yes. But but like what does a French culture look like when more French people you know, French people, I feel like are very cut off from religion because of the uh French revolution and because of like its own historical uh history.  But imagine if we didn't even talk about religion and we just talked about, okay, when we got rid of religion and we overemphasized like reason and rationality, we cut ourselves off from intuition, understanding, unity, wholeness, meaning, you know, things that actually make life worth living, and it's not just about eating great cheese and having affairs, you know, and sleeping around. Like there's something more and what would it look like when French culture finally opens up that eye of perception? It will be amazing.  I don't know what it could look like. I was wondering about because there is a French his name is in the one of his show is uh is speaking about French people. And the the history of uh this uh people and uh he is uh telling that uh, yeah, uh we are Gurwa.  And uh What's Gurwa is the old name for French people, because before French, France was uh gold. Oh yeah, the Ga.. and the Gauls and the Visigoths and the Goths, yeah. uh some Spanish Arabic, Italian, uh, uh immigration and the revolution and uh basically is it is kind of speaking uh fast and uh uh t this about uh, uh we don't want a president, we want uh, a piata, you know? Pinett We want something to to to break down and hit a five years we are very how people like uh as you said, uh French are totally kind of the partially related related to this idea of like when it's our responsibility now to make things better, but it's not better, we need to fight the thing that it is and try to make it better, right?  So as it's it's very much like heaven is tomorrow, you know, if we just do the right things and we make the right plan and we create this social safety nets and you know, J John, like the yellow jacket then they won't be angry because they will have their things and and so it's it's very much we need to use our reason and our logic to make life the best. and when it's not the best, we got it wrong so we have to do it again. But the problem is, you can't use that tool to understand everything and make it work. It doesn't happen, and so you keep getting frustrated, you know, because, you know, it's we mentioned, I think the idea of the strip form, you know, uh the the farm where you reduce the number of variables so that you have fertilizer water and seed and you can expect this is the expectation.  Expectation always leads to misery and suffering because you never get what you want. But when you reduce the number of variables in a system, it's more manageable to control with the with our limited human capacities, right? We are not able to reason about all of the dynamic complexities of a food forest.  What you can only do is be a part of it. You know, do your little part, you know, uh create the conditions and and have trust and faith, you know. I think Jesus said, if you trusted God as God should be trusted, you would go out like the birds, hungry in the morning and full in the evening, but every day you will leave you this is not Jesus, this is not be dead.  You you would leave the nest. in trust and reliance and hope and fear that you'll find your warm for the day, and when you find it, you can truly be joyful, you know, and that's a difference of being a part of a system and the gratitude and joy and a wiveness that is there versus I ordered the bigmac on Uri and its taking wait long. It should have been here 15 minutes ago, and I have guests coming and I paid money for this. Okay.  This expectation and this like desire, this kind of way of yeah, and and I think that's also related to why the French keep, you know, pinataing their governments. It's like you're supposed to make everything perfect. It was a good plan..  Why don't we have utopia? What happened? Because there's this arrogance to thinking that you can figure it out.  But we can figure it. I was thinking about the movie June. There is a a part when you know black guy at the he fights with a pole in one uh Paul's dream, Janice is talking to him and he he said, uh uh to understand the process of life you just have to follow it.  And you see the the sand that is a vibrating and doing waves and yeah, I like this uh but that attitude is very not accepted, especially for for governments for businesses, for the world that we're in, it's to understand life, you need to make a map and a diagram and have S do you know the SDGs are? This sustainable development goals, I think I all develop them. yougnore the SDGs. Our government is like, okay, so we have poverty and we are gonna make a pyot and this one has to be smaller and then we're can allocate more resources here and then that's going to move this one, like expand the other part of the government because the minister uh we had the first minister and the he he had he was kicked the out because uh the budget, uh with the idea of all the other uh the group the Yeah, so they they are trying to do this now. they're trying to figure figure it out.  But I wonder sometimes like what my ideas would look like if they're more balanced. Because how does the perception of quality fit into budgeting for a country? How would it look differently if it was accepted that you know, that we can't understand everything, that we have to be integrated into systems that life actually makes sense as we go through it.  Maybe instead of starting and making a budget in the beginning of the year, we do budgeting where every day we are attuned to the reality of our society as much as possible, and allocate appropriately day by day rather than you know, make a big plan or maybe that maybe that's where it needs. Maybe it needs both. Maybe it needs the pie chart and the plan in the beginning, but then every day allocating the allocating, being attuned, talking, connecting to people connecting to what is supposed to do connecting with the feeling of what you're supposed to do you know sometimes people make a good intention in the beginning, like, for instance, me and Duol lingo.  I had a good intention. I wanted to learn French, I wanted to talk with your family, I wanted to be wanted to be. But now I do duolingo just to make the streak, right?  So if I was in touch with the reality, I would either tell myself, okay, you either commit to it or just stop, because right now you're not learning French and you're just doing things to make this number go up. You know, just like people in a budget. We allocated budget to the arts because we wanted to have a flourishing creative community.  Is that doing it the best? Or is there a different way to allocate money to make sure that we have a flourishing creative community? Because there's so many people in jobs around the world, especially in governments and in the UN, where they know that this isn't the best use of funds, but this is what they're doing and they have this creeping feeling of like, this doesn't feel right.  This is wrong, but they just do it because because they don't have this, they only have this. They only have the once a year decision. integ, you know, and countries are basically uh some uh found our lending money to countries, and I think it's so complex now. I don't know how we could maybe erase all.  I mean start again and through like this watching what we are being more grounded realistic, connected to the you know, the the the thing that people kind of hope for is like, okay. We're collecting more information than we know what to do with. AI will solve it.  That's what they're thinking. They're thinking they'll just give everything to AI and it will be able to find the patterns that matter, but what I'm trying to suggest is we can't delegate this because I think that our perception of of goodness is and that feeling of like, is this right? This doesn't feel right, you know?  You can't get that. This it doesn't feel right and we need to be able to trust that. So for instance, this is one of the stories I'm put in my book.  And I think I forget his name, but this Russian general was looking at his uh monitoring system for nuclear warheads, and he saw five nuclear missiles coming from America. and he freaked out. The red light started spinning, the alarms went off, literally he was in the control room. All he had and what his job it was was to monitor this, and if America sends missiles, Russia sends missiles.  Okay. I don't know if you know about the Cold War. Yeah, so that was the Cold War.  That was the the common response to everyone was waiting for the missiles to fall, okay? And he saw the missiles. Why don't we have a story of five nucle explosions in Russia and he didn't push the button.  He didn't call his superiors. He had a feeling that said this can't be. Right.  And he trusted it. We are alive, probably. You know, like if Russia and America had a nuclear war, the world would look very, very different today.  And five nukes from America, let's imagine that they were real hitting Russia. And of course they would target major cities. Like we would live in a very different world and Russia would have anyway, it would have just exploded. and escalated.  So we're alive today and we have the world that is relatively safe without the major nuclear war because someone trusted this insight.. Yeah, it turned out that there was an error. Yeah, it was uh it was light reflecting off of a lake in New Mexico or something like that.  And so you? Yeah, and so I think that that story is like really important. uh and people need to like know about this story and to realize like this idea of creating AI plus our data to make decisions for us and without humans to be able to feel and to be close enough to reality. And this is the other thing that I'm realizing.  This is where it gets a little bit, I'm going to need to do more research on the science element, which is that guy felt something, even though the instruments which were mediated like digitally mediated instruments told him something. It was an artifact of light reflecting off of some clouds and water and yeah, like the radar systems like the I think it was a satellite system. uh But but yeah, it was an artifact that um it confused the machines. So my dad, when his brother died, felt it before he got the phone call, okay?  Many people have stories like this. Okay? And I think it's because this faculty of perception of um of oneness is one.  It's not to it's not spatially dependent. It's so that person looking at the radar had a disconnect between this faculty and this faculty. He sees the radar and it says that missiles are coming, but this thing says that they are not right?  How did that how did that thing know? That's So so this is where it gets like kind of into the place where it's like a little bit crazy, you know, where you start saying like, okay, well, you can you can perceive the right thing to do uh because it digests everything that matters about this decision and gives you a sense of it. So, and it's trustable and reliable, but it digest everything in all time and all space for this moment, you know, like relevant for this moment, but it doesn't actually matter about how far you are from the thing.  That's the kind of this is like I'm not sure if I need to go there for this argument, but that's what this story tells us. That this person had a faculty that was connected to the reality of what was happening beyond his line of sight and the instruments that were telling him what was happening were at conflict with it, but he trusted his intuitive sense or his quality sense or whatever. I think I need a better word for it.  Like I I I use the word quality, but I don't think people um I'm trying not to say things like heart and I'm trying not to say things like soul or spirit or anything that can sound religious. uh and quality in quantity or I think really good pairs of antonms, you know, it's like the quantity of things. You can measure like how far this thing is. You can measure how many, you know, silicon atoms make up this thing if you had a really it's not enough I think it may be why you try to search another word.  Do you have any ideas isn't heart? Or intuition? I'm Yeah.  And uh I was thinking about two things? The gravitation we detected a recently? Yeah, the gravitons or yeah.  The black holes that collapsed and it made waste and we could uh detected because the crazy thing is things were squished together. like isn' that crazy? Yeah. like space time squished and we got squished too, but we we didn't feel it. a very little bitters. But no, and I was thinking also about in the movie when the woman I say uh love isn't uh meatmeasurable, but it can cross space and time, you know it's interesting movies gravitational waves the kind of keep the information and it's not uh influ influenced by its base and time, you know, it' it's crossing space time.  But isn't everything crossing space time? Like right now, if you do this, you're affecting the farthest star at the end of the the universe.? Because, you know, gravity has an R squared relationship R is the distance, right?  But it never goes to zero. And so by moving my head over here, there is slightly more mass over here and the entire center of mass of the universe has shifted because I did this, right? And so it as a real effect, but that's the idea.  You can sense it if you if you are very, very very very extremely super ultrasensitive. you could sense it on the moon, you could sense it. You know, they you can actually see these experiments with gravity here where, you know, you put a bowling ball next to something and they can actually sense the amount this thing moves towards it, right? So you have a bowling ball on a string and a on a string and they actually can see it's very, very tiny amount.  But because the bowling ball has mass and it war up space time, then this thing moves, right? And so it doesn't take the graitation waves. It just takes mov, you know?  Everything is literally connected. Everything is talking to everything at all times, even just gravitational. Like I'm pulling you towards me and you're pulling me towards you right now.  Like Newton? Yeah. I'm not sure, because uh Einstein kind of uh uh you know, change everything musicfficient. money.  Newton said the third law, when two masss are there, they are it's so Einstein's idea is space time, but you are warping space time. So I concentrate space time. Yeah, a little bit.  I concentrate space time over here, which is why you feel the effect of being run. It's not necessarily like yeah, I I'm bending you a little bit towards me instead of using the Newtonian affects uh like uh never goes to zero. Yeah, yeah, to zero.  So yeah, that's the idea. So because it does affect everything at all times. Yeah, what I want to say is that, uh scientist of physicist say says that our universe is, uh um oh, there is a name an ejective to say that the physics low are the same at each point of the universe.  Self- consistence or something like that. Yeah, it's it's a very special word in French. and uh so because it it's never going to zero, but uh at our level we can't really see the the effect. But I was thinking, does does this gravitational effect could be related to the quality??  I don't know. Maybe I don't I don't I don't want to to uh explicit or to define it to try to to figure out uh what it could be related to, because uh it could it would be reduce it just like everything else. I think it no, no.ropic.  Yeah, yeah. Is. You know, sometimes this this thing we mentioned earlier, like when you are struck by something so awe inspiring, you usually don't have words, right? You're just yeah, you your reduce it to.  I yeah, I don't know. It's just How could it be meaningful and wordless? It's it's very interesting that the most meaningful things are often associated with moments of speechlessness.  And then later, a poet tries or an artist tries their best to evoke it, right in their poetry or their art, they try to put words on the unword did. truths, love, and goodness. goodness. It's it's also it's not just my uh language. This is like one of the things that um philosophers and theologians think of as kind of foundational elements of it.  There's an additional one that I use, which is beauty, but I think beauty is sort of like electricity in a solar panel, like when they' when you uh like like love and beauty come together, uh, when you love something you find a beautiful and when you find something beautiful, you love it, and so it's like the forces, right? It's it's war big space time and pulling things towards each other. That's what love does. love like takes things that are distant and tries to bring them together.  And I think that's actually a very interesting way of thinking about love as a as a force. It is actually a unifying force. Like people see each other from across the room and if they love each other, they just want to get closer and closer and closer and so they start kissing, you know.  And then they want to get inside of each other, just like become one, you know And actually, you know the weird thing is, I know it sounds very crude, but I think there's like if you look with the eye of metaphor and that nothing, well, it my interpretation, God does, is an accident, this stuff is very meaningful, like even even the sexual act as that representation of like, what does love want to do? It wants to bring things together and to take things and bring them to make one and then actually as what life comes from and like you can think about these metaphors and you can realize like, wow, man, God is hilarious, first of all. And and he's like telling a really good story here.  I'm searching a world because I have the impression that not that far. I was thinking about contemplation and Hm. Yeah, it's hot funny. good work.  You know, there's this relationship between, um love and attraction, it reminds me of one of the you know, things that the in the Muslim tradition says, like, why did God create all of this? And it goes like this. I was a this is God speaking.  He says, I was a hidden treasure that wanted to be known, and so I created so that I could be known and uh like this idea of love and knowledge is kind of evoked in this. It's like to to love and to to to to know and to be connected and um it kind of reminds me of some of the uh Indian philosophies about the Brahmin and this idea of oneness getting bored. and then hiding in multiplicity to recognize oneness and then to awaken to go back to oneness. This kind of idea uh kind of rhymes with this idea of being a hidden treasure and not being admired or known or loved, and creating in order to be able to to love and be loved. and that the and it's kind of interesting that love is the thing that takes the many and makes one.  And and it's interesting that it's actually, you know, what we just thought of historically. It's fear that takes the one makes many, right? It's the fear, the need for control, the it's so interesting.  I think love and fear are like love love is the unifying principle and fear is the the disunifying or the dispersing principle. Maybe it could be h harmony, liality harmony? Harmony, that is a result.  I think of following your perception of well, because I I asked IGPT I could be resume in one word roof, love, beauty, and goodness. You know what we can do as well, we can ask the similar question. We can ask um, can you come up with ten different ways to say quality versus quantity?  We want to find a new word for the faculty in that perceives quality. Okay. Let's see.  Let's see what it says. Depth versus breadth, substance versus substance versus scale, essent essence, versus extent, nuance versus count, value versus volume. OK, this sounds pretty good.  Meaning versus measure. Right?? Yeah, you either measure things, you know the own space and your distance or your like sense of meaning.  I like meaning quality versus quantity or meaning, and they both start with them. versus measure. That's not bad. Beauty versus bulk no.  Integrity sensna, discernment, value versus volume. That's kind of interesting. Value versus volume.  Nuance versus count. depth versus breadth. Substance awareness. Eence essence perception. essence perception.  I like the essence perception and discernment discernment and meaning can we go down this track? pisses conscience wisdom. Yeah, I mean, I think listening to it implies like that you're getting closer to wisdom.  I think like when we are listening to our lower like feelings of like fear, like jealousy or uh, you know, these like like can be addressed by tapping into the thing. It's like, okay, it's I'm feeling really angry or uh jealous, but when you listen to that faculty, how should I respond? and this is why I think the fundamental name of mercy really matters, and the fundamental like purpose of being to know and connect with a hidden treasure of like truth, beauty, and goodness is your your quality sense will never tell you like hurt someone else or hurt yourself, right?  It will never tell you yeah, I'm not so sure if the missiles are coming or not, but just fire anyway just in case you know I don't think that's going to be what happens. Usually, like the sense of meaning is also connected to self sacrifice on the opposite side of things, right? Like when we see Jesus or Gandhi or Martin Luther King Junior or pick any famous like story of someone that the band of brothers or okay, maybe not you, uh 300 uh yeah, yeah, all those people.  They lost. They all died, but they died with like honor and it left us feeling inspired, right and left us connecting to some of these qualities of years ago something it's not beautiful and the the aesthetic sense, but there's something beautiful about how they stared together and faced instrmumentable odds, and even if they died, they died with honor and there's something beautiful and good about that, right? And so it's it's something I think there's something very interesting about self-sacrifice. uh that kind of is important in this uh in this thing because it shows like the self doesn't matter.  There's like a a things a wholeness that matters more and being in harmony and in integrity and upholding what wants to come through your your your meaning sense or whatever we're calling it, you know, is more inspiring than you staying alive. But when you're in the fear, you just want to stay alive, you want to control, you want to substigate. It's like I will, I will, I will.  And like all these billionaire, you know what they're doing? They're building homes and compounds in islands around New Zealand. because they expect ocean levels a rise, New Zealand will be okay, um, they expect that this refugee mass migration thing will happen. They don't want to be on any land mass that's contiguous with other countries that are going to be experiencing climate collapse.  And they're thinking of self and self-p protection, and it's ugly, right? Like you don't you don't hear the story of like how billionaires are looking to preserve themselves. They hired a futurist named Douglas Rushkoff.  They asked him okay, we figured out the food, we figured out the land, we figured out all this stuff and we have money and we bought our place and we can survive. um and we have the people working on the farms and and all of this. How can we be sure that they won't revolt? and take over the property and like we're just one or two billionaires.  It's like a small billionaire family. How can we be sure that the personnel don't work together to kill us and just live on the island, right? And uh the the answer uh was, you know, you want, because you're a billionaire to delegate all the work.  You don't want to go and dig in the fields and figure out food and you'll kill the chickens. You want to hire people to do that. You want to pay people with food probably, right?  Because we're imagining an ap apocalyptic situation. And so what they were suggested to do was they have to do one thing and keep one thing under their control, which is food storage. They need to have the only set of keys you know, maybe biometric, maybe it's connected to their eye retina or fingerprint or something that people can't like chop off and use that needs to be connected to a very well-p protected sealed safe of food storage.  And if you do that, then you can control the rest of the situation. So I only tell that whole story. First of all, just to show you how that's ugly.  You hear that story and you're not inspired. You think this person is horrible, you don't feel like that's what we should be doing that's a good life, that's a good way of living, and we know that, but what knows that? Because it's the world Yeah, the thing that knows that, I think is that meaning sense. is that sense that says like that's not meaningful.  You might survive, but like you'll like, if you really sat with this and you didn't look at the fear that was making you do all that planning, you wouldn't be proud of yourself likely, right? I think, yeah, but just told it's kind of how our world is actually functioning. It's a real story.  It's not a hypothetical., you already told me this story of the billionaire in New Zealand. Yeah, I think it's a million people are those rich people want to try to stay in comfort and, you know and not helping people. But I was thinking about the whole stone.  It's actually how our world isn't right now, you know, the trillioners the most rich people in the world, those people are owning the industry of meat, of chemicals, and the the system, the political system and the economic system is built. so that we are like slaves working and keeping in control and the richer people, I know it sounds like communism and but uh the idea is there and it's still a bulful uh I think somebody once told me that one of the most important things that you can do for your freedom is to grow a little bit of food. It doesn't have to be everything, but just a couple of carrots, just a couple of like potatoes or onions or eggs or chicken. Once you start to realize like self sufficiency, even in a small way, like you get that feeling like, oh wow, like, because right now, I the way that I think about what you were just saying is it's sort of like these um the system as holding security and food and shelter hostage, and we have to, even though we know the system is broken, many people know this they feel like they have to go through these steps of getting a job doing these things in a certain way to be able to access the fundamental basic needs of metal hierarchy, great food, shelter, security, stuff like that.  And it's true. It's it's actually true. Like right now that's that's how the food is behind the paywall, you know?  It's interesting that they are thinking about these universal basic income and But I think about this food thing sometimes I'm like, hmm, if we owned some land somewhere and a farm that made enough food, and I looked into it. It doesn't actually take that much land and that much uh space to produce enough food for a year. Detroit I'm looking at property and So I also have like my family and my cousin's already there and yeah, it's actually really great. in terms of water excess.  It's one of the few places in the world that will benefit from climate collapse longer growing seasons, fresh water, a lot of people are weirdly enough, a lot of people this is why we should probably buy land there before too long, is people want to come to Detroit because of climate collapse. But uh yeah, other than Detroit, Russia But why would I want to go to Russia? Montes.  I thought about um Kurtisistan, also like wanna connect with roots and history and and meaning in a broader sense, right? Like what would. It's pretty fertile.  Okay, if you like mountains, there's mountains too. I am, yeah, actually, there's probably some good claiming. Kurt anymore.  Kurtan? It's I think it exists. Curtisistan never really existed in the nation stateway because the colonizers didn't realize that that was a people and they were like, well, the map should look like this, and this should be for France and that can be for England.  England, what do you think? Okay, no, no, this can be for France. They literally did that.  Do you know that? They got together. It's called the Sykes Peaks agreement.  You know about this? And they got a big map and they they drank a lot of coffee, smoked a lot of cigars and they literally drew a map. like this, and they called it putting wines in the sand, and there's some like really funny stories, like I forget, like I want to go find the thing. It's like apparently someone had their cup on the map and like somebody went a little bit like this and had to like avoid the cup and and and so you see the map of like one Yeah, you see you map with some of these countries and and it looks like and there's like this little zigzag in it and they're like, oh yeah, that was because I just didn't want to move the cup when I was, you know It's crazy.  It's it's just like when you realize like because and the rest of the world, like you look at Europe, all the borders are like this, you know? And that's people of either mountain range or that's people fighting this way and these people fighting this way. and like at some point they're like like, let's just call it a country and, you know, so let's stop fighting, you know? And you have like these very organic borders of nature and people, right?  Africa. Middle East Africa say America, like there's one states square. Yeah, but those are states in in one country, supposedly, but uh, just like the Middle East and Africa and all these places are just so so funny.  I wonder how like it's really good to be really curious, but it takes a long time for things to come together. you know? It takes a long time for things to come together. uh so well things like this this this kind of book that I'm writing, it started off because I wanted to write something about economics and I wanted to talk about like a different economic system. And then I realized that like economic systems come from like worldviews and then I wanted to like think about world views.  But because I've been such a nerd and so curious about so many things, I can actually like piece something together and was really interesting is that finally at the end, the the thing that I'm talking about is um is one thing is just one thing. It's like, and and by talking about this one thing, I can address all of the other things. I can talk about economics.  I can talk about like, why did we build this economic system? It's like, oh, because fear and need for control after, you know, the the black plague and like the council of Nicea and like hierarchy and that led to this these philosophers and history. And then in the end, it's like, I hope it's very practical.  Like I want in the end, even if the book doesn't sell, nobody cares. I want to start a coaching process that the only thing it is, it's related to have to and want to and to help people take there to do list and break it up into one of these two columns and then over time make more of their to do list on this side. That's it.  I think if we did this, what we're doing is we're getting people to connect with meaning more in their life that brings all of these other principles that we were talking about of like connecting to oneness or understanding um like their part in a broader whole because the a lot of the have toos are the I have to work to be able to eat. I have to do these things and usually they are not how you want to be, but how you think you have to be, and they usually come with tensions. They're like I have to go to work so we able to eat, but it's not happy I have to go to work usually.  It's ling this tension. And so when we do this coaching and we look at the tensions and then we ask, is it true? That's a pretty good start.  I think just doing this with more people, we can we don't have to explain all of history and where the ideas come from and we'll connect people more with their perception of meaning. It will give them more awareness of their feelings and why they have them, their anger, where they come from, you know, just by looking at your tualist and comparing half twoss and wanttos, and then asking about tensions. So this is a coaching practice that I'm developing and it's kind of comes with the book.  Wow, that's kind of cool. I think it's all because I've been working on this for a while, and initially I was working on like the economics book and then I tried to work on this philosophy book and then I worked on the the practice, but I think I have a very clear way of explaining how they all fit together. It's like there's like the understanding of the past, um how like history and philosophy evolved over time to disconnect people from oneness and then like so the core theme is this oneness principle uh and how do we get back to that?  That's I think the simplest way of explaining everything without having to get into so much detail, because there's it could be a lot of detail. I realized that I'm pretty much uh uh like, yeah, I I'm aware and I try to change to be more connected to the quality and uh the things that I want to and but I realize that I am functioning my life that I built my life and I'm functioning really much more like uh on the quantity how it works and what I have to do to get in and if you do you want to try going through the coach? Because I still have to um develop this.  I still have I only have tried running a a few times with a few people. It might be interesting to. Yeah, it could be interesting to try and it could also help you to develop it.  I'm not sure I yeah, I think I would be a good subject for for trial. But uh the thing is that maybe uh since I I passed the the 30 I uh I studied uh changing like trying to get more want to Yeah, you know, trying to to do some meditation, to to be more healthy and to yet do things that are meaningful and hmm it's still hard to do it right. Because is there right Yeah, but that's the whole uh that's is whole problem.  It's just uh I'm too much uh control. Yes. That perfection.  Yes. Yeah. That's interesting.  Well we can um we can try this like to to do this and we might not figure it out immediately, but it could be interesting to see, you know, every emotion tells you something. It's a it's an indicator of a way of being that is being blocked or prevented from uh happening. And so when you have these um feelings of like need for okay, I need to do it right, even myself development has to be right.  And you know it's all the medicine.. I think it's a big uh influence in my life. I I already I was already a bit like this before and it it went uh exacerbate exacerbate, yeah.  Yeah, with the medical students. Yeah yeah it makes sense. So it's it's like you learn these unconscious things about needing to be right Yeah, yeah, basically yeah, it's this.  I learn to, like, you know the science uh demar the method? The method It's all about uh what we we say before. the quantity, the trying to control things. Yeah. yeah.  And and you know, one of the ideas was not to have necessarily big transformations, but the idea would be to try to listen for this quiet voice, you know, this intuition, this feeling, and to answer its call, however, best you think you can, and then to reflect on was that better or worse, you know? So, for instance, like let's say, it might be a it was an interesting one. Like, when you let go of control with the barber, you didn't come in, with a picture, right?  That's a small experiment and easy one, yeah. So can we come up with more of these things and gradually build up to the bigger ones like relationships for sure. And you know what I told you about it's one big point in my life because I still feel a little a little bit guilty, uh with uh whether I I have done to her. with the history of the pregnancy and the abortion and uh and the whole all the um the very uh conflictual relationship before and after this event and uh yeah, and kind of uh always uh um questioning myself uh, either I uh school or uh did I school at all?  Did I uh h do uh bad things uh uh should I have uh uh cultivate more on this relationship uh was she uh the woman of my life uh does the the the entuition I I had before and now, uh what does that mean? Am I uh uh am I right? uh I don't know.  It's a lot of a lot of thoughts. So, uh, you know, coming from from my perspective, there is this uh this idea, especially for people that are on the path. You know, there might not be perfect, but they're on the path that when they die, they will look back, they will give you know they say life flashes before your eyes when you die?  That people on the path will look back and they look at their life and see everything that happened and not want a single thing to be changed. But that's for, I think, especially for people that are on the path that started on the path and then sustained on the path. um throughout their life. Whenever they started, it doesn't have to be starting uh, you know, from the beginning, like from birth.  But it could be that you, you know, there's this idea of uh penance and repentance and going to the confessionary or whatever it is in the Catholic Church. But this idea of like, if you have this intuition that you've done something that you aren't proud of, uh, one is it's in the past, but just make a commitment that you won't do that again, that you've learned your lesson. That's why we do bad things.  You know, there's a saying in the lesson tradition. If you lived and never made any mistakes, God would replace you with another society that made mistakes and asked for forgiveness so that he can forgive, because he is the all forgiving, right? And so this idea of like mistakes are not a mistake.  They're actually necessary part of a process of cultivating the heart of becoming like imagine if you've never made any mistakes and you died and you you know, a lot of life is about Catharsis. It's about like okay, that happened, but this time I'm gonna do a differently and then regular and then being you can be proud of yourself for doing it differently. You know, like, I had a similar thing in my life when I had a previous partner that, uh asked me if I love her, and I was like, I define love. like bring me a diction.  I literally ask for a dictionary, okay? I was like, I don't want to say anything is not true. Like, what does love mean?  you know, and because I couldn't acknowledge it because it would require me to fight my family and like, there was a lot of, you know, difficulties around this. And so I for a long time, I felt like, oh my God, I lost the person that I loved. I many thoughts similar to yours, right?  But uh, because there is one important point, uh, you you said here is when one partner is more in love than the other, and Inez was totally in love and she was very committed and I felt like uh I was uh hurting him her and I was uh uh evil and uh and uh yeah, I felt it really bad, you know, really guilty and bad, like sad. And uh that's why I had these uh whole circus of uh getting back with her, uh stopping and then getting back but you weren't sure what to do and then when you were in it didn't feel right. 20 times and uh yeah, that's why I asked myself, do I really love her, but I was not enough material to trust myself to trust my feelings? or was that not a good relationship and and I should uh just uh trust my uh what I felt and and stop it and not come back.  I remember this idea that we said that the faculty of meaning intuition and it's hard for me to trust my intuition because I have a lot of intritions and sometimes I was like, yeah, it's it's hers and sometimes I was like, knowing it can work because we are two different and so, you know, it's even now it's still hard to really be sure. So so and I think now things are really too much uh uh painful and then it's it's it's it's over. It's too it's it's screws. everything else too distant Yeah, but everything is damaged. and it's's damaged forever.  Yeah. I mean let's go back. What was that that message I was gonna say?  It was like is it true, first of all, uh the thing that okay, two things. One is there is probably a process of view that you can get clarity on, which is I know that people don't like this idea of sin, but you mentioned it yourself like, and was I evil, right? Like, what are the things that you want Sin, right?  There's uh doing bad, right? Uh, but you don't we don't usually talk about these things or even say like I was a bad person or I did something bad, but we sometimes do things against ourselves, against our own better judgment, against what we think is beautiful or right, like sometimes we are the billionaires building things and and so maybe like one of the things that you can just get clear on is what are the what like what are the waves that I was that I don't want to ever be again? One, you know, I don't want to do XY or Z or I don't want to respond like however it was, right?  With um with avoidance and distancing saying, I don't want to, you know, and and then just like ask for forgiveness and forgive yourself, and then never do them again, you know? And instead of being clear, like was I evil or was I like was I? It just be clear for you.  It doesn't have to share with anybody. I just like decide, like these are the ways that I want to be and these are the ways I don't want to be. So instead of the lessons being a little blurry, make the lessons very clear, you know, make it very clear, and then I feel like you need some kind of very it feels like a decision should be completely closed and what you can do is say, you know, that relationship is done.  I'm going to take these lessons. I know who I want to be now. I know how I want to be in relationships. um you know, it could have been a beautiful relationship.  I don't think there's only one size fits all for relationships. I think the opportunities for loving there is this idea of oneness we talked about. And it's one of the things that I told myself is like, everyone has a heart and a and a soul that's worth loving.  It's coming from the one and it's in a lot of different people's bodies, right? If I allow myself, if somebody is like, I'm willing, why would I say no? Why don't I also try to be willing, right?  What can I do to help open that door, right? And and I had like the intuition and so we cultivated and we work on like developing a love relationship. It's not this idea of like she was in love or I wasn't in love.  It's just an opportunity for someone to open the door to their spirit was available to you, and you missed it, but everyone has a spirit. Every one you might find that opportunity you likely will find that opportunity again. right? Because I feel like when you just said, I missed it.  I feel like it. And I feel like uh there is the only one, the, you know, the the the love of my life, the only one, and and he's gone and it's over. No, no.  I don't I don't think that at all. I think I think basically like I mentioned, the way that I feel is that you can love it's. If somebody is opening their heart, like, I'm willing, and you're like, okay, well, am I willing?  And like I said, mentioned last week, it was like arranged marriages, you don't need arrange marriages. It's good to have practical things too. It's good to have um compatibility things too.  It's good to have sexual attraction, it's good to have all these other things. But then if someone's like yeah, like, I'm willing.. You willing.  Maybe it could be good, you know, like, I had these it's a feeling that I missed it. And there is one up there is nobody else, but uh but it's just a feeling and I feel like you and I uh I know that it's not true, but uh this is why I think live with this film. I think it's connected to the the regret and the remorse.  Right? So there's like this this um what is that? self-fl flagellation?  because I was bad explore this idea, you know it's it's kind of weird, but I have this masochistic, this note on my uh on my iPhone, which is called the C. Is it like understanding yourself? Yeah, yeah.  Like problems to analyze and uh some kind of introspection to try to find out and figuring out what's not working, what went bad, and uh I have this this idea of uh self uhician. I think this is why I was talking about accepting the lessons, digesting them and committing to never doing them again, asking forgiveness from you from God from whomever, from you as even maybe, it might be very cathartic to ask for forgiveness, if you can not ask to get back together, but just tell her, like, whatever it is, okay? Just ask for forgiveness. like's like I come and I ask for a forgiveness as if I wanted to to to feel better, you know?  Then do it for yourself, but what I'm what I'm seeing is if you don't forgive yourself here, you might maintain this potential I lost a love of my life and I'm never going to have this like again, uh kind of feeling, but I had some intritions that uh indicate indicated in indicated mirror that uh could be could be? Okay. The the idea of the one person is is interesting to to look into uh there there may be something about like some compatible people, but what does it mean for someone to be the one?  Where does that idea come from? versus there's many people and you know how many people find the one that are high school sweethearts, you know, they met in in college or whatever you want to call it. They fell in love.  They got married, and then they get a divorce, okay? Like, there life is hard and long and lots of things change. And there's many examples of this whole like I think that movies and culture shapes are understanding a lot of relationships.  And doing this whole movie historical analysis of like where do my ideas of love come from for yourself? uh, could be interesting. parents, movies. Yeah.  And and these stories but then also looking at it with the lens of like facts, right? Like you know, like even just this idea of what does falling in love mean? This is why I give you that book, because, you know, like there is there's and relationships and compatibility and all of these things that we're we're trying to navigate and is like living together, you know, like there's just people that they might love each other, but they have very incompatible lifestyles or whatever and and this is why I think like having this maybe the both eyes thing, like the pie chart and the uh feeling, it's like, okay, this does this make sense?  Is that person willing to gradually open their heart to me? And am I willing to do that with them and making love a process? And of course, like there could be a moment of intuition.  There could be a moment of like expansion and excitement and enthusiasm. But that just opens the door to the process. This is the thing.  I think people think that you fall in love and then that's it. Instead of viewing relationships as a craft, you know? And I think you have more of a discoverer than a craft perspective and it could be balanced a little bit more with the craft. to to fabricate to make to evolve to build together craft. craft is more like actually craft is the perfect balance between quantity and quality. because exactly. the potter making the pot, right?  It has a weight, it has specifics, they want to use the right amount of water with the right amount of clay, they measured, they mixed, right? But then when they get down to actually shaping it, it's still very precise ashemisymmmetric, but they are doing both the measurements and the feeling and the quality and the perception all at the same time. It's like You know?  And that's why I think craft is a great analogy and actually this is the analogy that I use for um how I want to do my uh my my programs and and um my trainings is to view it more of like a craft uh and putting things together with both your quality and your quantity at the same time. And of course, I'm just probably reinventing Taoism or something, but uh you know, they call it cho Have you heard of choiceless action? Wui?  Choiceless action? Yeah, it's called woo. It's, you know, you might hear it from what's his name?  uh, Bruce Lee, it's like acting without acting. Like, you're not thinking about punching, like a punch happens and it happens through you, and it's like a it's when you're in that space where maybe you could think of what way is what people do when they're in the zone, right? Where let's say that you're watching an Olympic athlete do a very complicated thing.  I don't think they're thinking about all the different steps because they've become the steps. and it's like an action that happens through them of them, and it's like craft of themselves in their bodies and whatever it is, right? Yeah. So it's called wui.  It's a Chinese like Taoist principle of it's called a choiceless action. as a one way of interpreting it. It was it would be like factories and industry and the opposite side, you have arts and in between craft. Yeah.  I think so. I think that's like a good description uh and I think though, like art and craft used to be more together. And then because of you know it's like when things get more extreme, uh there has to become a middle. you know, like Yeah, it's like here's and then like art yeah, and art just becomes weirder and weirder and less and less like yeah and then here's like industry and industry is just like getting super brutalist.  Everything is minimalist and art becomes like illegible and and kind of nonsense and what's the what that boyfriend that was making sound art when one of your cousins was dating this very tattooed guy and it doesn't matter. Well, you understand like this, so art art gets weird, okay? He he was dating one of your cousins, I think.  He's a nice guy. We saw him at some family reunions when we went to Bootzeg and saw your aunt. your grand.. Do you remember it?  Yeah So he's like moving our like way out I forget. He was a nice guy, okay? But like our life.  Yeah, it was out there. But like like you know when you go down to Mar Bell or lead and you walk by um some of these older houses and you just see like the tile work or the bricks and how they were made and like artisanship and art and practical life and uh artistic life weren't so disconnected. They were actually more harmonious.  And it was it's really beautiful to like think and then we go into modern buildings and modern life and it's an it's so funny. It's like um it's like oatmeal that you didn't mix, okay? You have the bland wall that's flats and modern and whatever, and then they hang a painting of some like really abstract art, you know, and it's it's like you have the industry of the building and the the weird art that moved all the way out this way, and then they try to mix it, but like in the middle is craft, you know, and it's you don't need to hang a you know, of course there's a lot of art in a church already, but like it's integrated into the building.  It's the windows. It's not a painting on a flat wall with like minimalist aluminum siding, you know? It's kind of interesting that there's this it's like what the balance, but they balance it by putting to extreme side by side instead of instead of like oil.s very interesting.  But this is what I think an artistic sensibility might be one of the ways that we can describe this, is the thing that we're trying to to activate here in the quality. If we talk about quality, if we talk about meaning, we talk about all this stuff. Like people might not relate.  But if we talk about like developing an artistic sensibility, you know, like to just see things more with like sense and meaning and metaphor and creativity and beauty and arts and stuff. That's hard to do for people that are not trained or not or in the opposite uh condition. And that they get trained to be more and more rational rational. oh yeah, you can't even tell a story.  What can we do this could be an interesting that's true. That's that's the problem. And it's hard when you realize it even when you realize it you try to say?  Yeah, try to it it's hard because you don't have a um I used to to read the books and how it works and uh the the The structure in the instruction, you. And so I don't have instructions to try to, yeah, andalyze my previous relationship, you know how to not uh know if it was wrong or good or yeah. Did you have this sense of quality?  Yeah. I think you might have already done it you keep a journal, like just a journal. That isn't about your patience.  Yeah. I not my patience, but uh uh my patients yes, but not me. So I think there is like good ways and not so good ways to do journaling.  I think, you know, I used to journal a lot um and one of the ways actually, maybe the next book I should give you is this one. It's called the artist's Way. and the key practice in the artist way is ad journaling, but it's in a very specific way. It's you start writing and you're not allowed to stop writing until you fill three pages, okay?  You're not allowed to stop or slow down, you're supposed to just start writing, and even if you don't know what to say, you could fill a whole page with I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what and it's totally fine. But it's called freewriting, okay? And once you do that.  And you trying to figure out what I shouldn't. But but usually, like you say like, okay, so today is Thursday, I'm just waking up. I feel a little tired.  I'm not sure what to write, but I'm gonna try. I'm doing this artist way thing. It's kind of interesting.  I'm not really sure if I'm can be creative. is like it really what what is creativity? Well, I guess I'm writing right now. Isn't that creative?  you know, like, you start with nonsense and then by the end, you'll see like it starts coming together. But you're not supposed to read it. You're supposed to take it, put it in an envelope and seal it for at least six months, okay?  The whole point is not to judge yourself, uh, to not think that it's important or that it's not important. The whole point is to turn on the engine of creativity. Just by writing three pages and not looking.  The rest of the book is is expanding on that, uh basic thing, um including how do you get artistic inspiration? And she recommends going on an artist date. So like, what's the place that is inspiring for you could be going to the mountains or the beach or a museum or a concert, whatever it is, like, what is something that actually charges you, creatively and inspiring you and do the morning pages, which is the journaling thing.  That's it. You don't need to read the book now, like, you're good. There's a lot of practices, there's a lot of things to do, but uh like week one, yeah, there's a whole process.  You know, maybe I should do that. I think it will. I can take it.  You need it? I'm thinking about doing it. Okay. you know missing?  Yeah, I've done done the process before. but I've been wondering what my craft is, you know, like we talk about being an artisan. and I think that is important for any human to have their job, to have their life, to have their family, but to have a craft. But what is it? Is it baking bread?  Is it writing books? Is it? I guess I do a lot of my craft, but like Yeah, I guess part of me is is between this half two and one two.  Like there's there's stuff that that wants to happen through me, right? uh foraging, you know, um that just happens. I'm like, wow, I'm foraging.  I love it. It's just, you know, like I walk with a baby foraging, looking for mushrooms. Oh yeah.  Okay, so foraging is on I want to. it's not even like I want to. It's like emerges, right? And then I have to like sometimes I wish I could draw better, you know, like I want to draw more.  I and but I I don't find the flow and the I'm not sure. So there's like there's something over here about drawing, you know, when I think about like my creativity. Like I want to like draw.  I want to make um stencils. And uh yeah, I guess I'm kind of doubting my craft because I don't know why I don't you know, I feel like a craft is a very personal thing and it has identity tied into it. And I identify more as somebody who, I guess writes poetry or or does drawing than as someone who's a baker.  But maybe I could change my mind about myself. I don't know. That's kind of craft on poetry and drawing..  Yeah. What what would you think is your craft that could be what could it be? in craft.  Yeah, like what is your artisal thing that brings quality and quantity? I think music, music, making or listening? Making, but it's uh like if I if I would uh do something.  Yeah, music. you play piano? You're pretty good. you know. Yeah.  I'm I think I will never do this because okay. Yeah, it's okay. But uh yeah, I that something I could uh like to to craft.  I think, you know, touching it at least once a week, bringing it into your life and and feelings and feeling what you feel. You know I, uh um practice uh uh um piano lessons when I uh finished my residence because I have time down and I was thinking about uh uh following piano lessons. You know, do you have a piano that you can play at home?  Like a keyboard or's house, but Yeah. Because I feel like one of the interesting things to explore for you is how you can explore doing it with feeling more than doing it right. And my intuition is to explore the idea of improvisation.  You know what I mean? It's just like a feeling or like a guess from me to say like you looking for a teacher when you already have some technical skills, like you know how to move around, you know how to play pieces. um but this idea that we're we're looking for is the feeling side, right? You can even you can turn piano into a quantity all of it, right?  You can. You can make it about getting it right, getting it perfect, getting it, you know, and you can force yourself and you could have the hierarchy, and you could have the power, you can you know, or you can try to figure out like what helps you feel in that moment. A along with the technical, along with the rights and along you know, like you have to stay in the scale, you know, and jazz is about like doing that, but then breaking it sometimes and coming back and then learning how to how to flow, right?  It might be an interesting thing for you to explore, like what is improvisation or just feeling mean for you in music. Yeah. Yeah, but uh improvisition I think I would do just uhap you know Yeah, that's fine.  No one's listening at least, you know. We'll get you a in the piano example, uh to for me to to try to to feel the more an emotion and try to do something like uh improvisation and uh and I wanted to be still ammonious, but uh can be because I'm not uh uh neither uh thing uh emotions that I can translate into uh movements and doing a not. So we can play so this is doing advice And now he's doing this?  He's actually playing the key. And on the opposite way doing a harm many technical There's a a band okay, so two things. One is, I think it might be interesting for you to try to bring your meditation and your piano in at the same time. like we talk about like and make themgistic.  Um, you can you're only allowed two keys, okay? middle finger thumb, okay? And then you get into your meditation and just play the two keys..  Yeah. I can also already imagine it right now, you know, like so I feel like maybe there's something there, maybe three keys. I don't know, like you but limit yourself, don't think about technicality, don't think about harmony, don't think about anything.  And there's this band that's calledawn of Mid. um, which has a uh album called disnomia. Let me see if we can find it on YouTube. Yeah, here, this is the full album.  I'll just share it with you.]]]",

            "text": "In the this conversation I shared what’s the book outline I remember talking about 3 sections, can you share it? What are a few other outlines and ways to share my story\n\n[[[it's it's it's like most of the people humans uh on earth not all humans because uh there are still people that are um in the same um uh way that you believed and the whole the world that they're in relationship, that won everything. But uh our uh w Western society, uh based on science and uh capitalism and everything, those people are kind of believing in science neither than the believer take it try to take some steps back and understand the whole like uh uh where where we are our our planet in the universe and what is the universe, based time and uh how what do we know, what we don't know and uh how earth is uh uh uh working instead of uh saying it's doing that it is and uh we are running too much fuel, we are eating too much and it's we can do uh uh in another way. Yeah.  Like fatalism. Yeah. It's fatalism scientism and fatalism that are killing the the sacred uh and yeah, the sacred uh look at the wholeness and but this is why I wanted to get a very um historic view, you know, because you just look I was happening now.  I'm trying, yeah. This is a part of what I want to share. It's like the history. like is it we' just pop up here and and we aren't necessarily like, you know, some people think of progress like this, right?  It just goes, I guess, and we are seeing the most clearly right now. We have the best ideas, the best science, then will you ever have, and tomorrow will be even more clear and more true and more real. There's a Christian of what is progress.  What is progress or like what is true knowledge? And the thing is I don't want to talk negatively about capitalism or negatively about scientism, what I want to say is uh, where did those ideas emerge from? Why is it so much a dominant?  Yeah, and to show like, oh, well, it makes sense that we did that. But also, does it make sense that it we could be overdoing it? Because it does make sense to try to protect yourself, right?  Like let's say, you know, for instance, you've got to a car accident you weren't wearinging your seatbelt. You got hurt. And then after that you start wearing your seatbelt.  That's okay. That's a good lesson, right? And so part of the lesson that, you know, we could have used science to use if we had it back then, to learn about the black plague, is people would already concentrating into cities.  People were already over like I was doing this research today. There were depleting their farms. They were overproducing on their farms, they were getting less returns, so people were under nourished like cities were crowded and dirty and like the conditions were good for a plague, you know?  But uh that doesn't happen in in cultures that don't have something that makes people think the best the right thing, you know? And the to live, to live in this way to like uh have a, uh, also a part of it was the peasant and landowner relationship at this hierarchy of dominance, and that's why I had to go back before the black plague because the black plague made me realize a little bit more about like why people left religion and why people were looking for hedonism and more like focus on life and individualism, but before that there was this bringing in of hierarchy and power structures, because when Christianity was not formalized, it was very diverse, a lot of different opinions. There was nobody to tell you might think that other person is really wrong, but you and 100 people will think that them and 100 people there was no pope, there was no like massive Catholic church. before the Myan creed was decreed, and they brought many different Christians and I think.  NIAN creed. Yeah. NIC EE So this thing.  Creed of constantinople happened in like ten first canceled Nicea 325, not like a 440 451. So it happened about like five 300 to 500 years after Jesus., basically it's after the Roman Empire uh end. Yeah, but it basically transitioned into the Christian Empire, because Constantine became Christian, uh the like it was a it was a Romanonsenseinople, there's double Chchus guy where.  Oh, wow, they have it. And so what I what I started looking into right now was like what were the things that were formalized here? That uh first Council of Contents in O Roman yes, a Roman emperor was the first one to put it together.  And so they inherited a lot of the Romans ideas about power, right? Like what's his name? Um Marcus Aurelius is considered a god, okay?  This is I bought the book uh thought for myself. Yeah, he he's an interesting guy and he's a very thoughtful guy, but in in Roman like early Roman history, the kings were considered gods, right? And so this idea of hierarchy and of an authority that is more important and can control and subjugate the under length begins in the Roman Empire and then gets brought into Christianity because now that there is a an authority in Christianity, now, like all of these people said, like, this is what Christianity is.  We can't have anybody saying that Jesus was just a prophet, we can't have people like differing about these different details. We are now going to sit down and just write like this is Christianity and everyone else is wrong. And it created this uh church people god and the churches in between kind of thing.  Yeah, the clergy and um like the this hierarchy. And and yeah, so so this is what I was sort of to to do this kind of historical analysis. And there's a gap here, like I did it I think I figured out a little bit more about like the black plague and how that led to like individualism and that, you know, at some point leads to capitalism and, you know, it keeps going from there.  But before the black plague, there were the things that gave rise to the conditions that let the black plague emerge, which is congested cities, um, uh impoverished people, uh close, like condition for Yeah. So this this part I want to understand a little bit better, and I think it has something to do with the the Nican creed and this hierarchy that gets imported into Christianity that creates this like peasant landowner divide, which you can so at a seat today in terms of like hierarchical power structures. How do you uh study all this?  I mean, I knew about a lot of these pieces before. but then I started to think like of course I knew about the church. history documentaries, studies. on all the different of these things like I found a book today for the black plague. I'm going to see if I can get it. But basically like I've I've known about, you know, I read a book called Galileo's error and it's about Galileo when he first came up with his idea about the language of the world as written in mathematics, language of the University of mathematics.  He also says, but that doesn't capture quality. That is a separate thing. My whole like mathematical science approach is to focus on what I can actually define mathematically.  But there is quality, but people ignore the quality things that you say and focus on his idea that the world is describable by this systems. And so I know all of these things I have read many books in the history, but I started thinking today about the question of just making it very simple. It's like where did Oneness go?  You know, where did the sense that everything is a cohesive, holistic thing that we're a part of, go and why do we have this alienation and the sense of me versus the world? me. So that's the that's the only question and then I want to look at history through that lens, because I think, like instead of trying to go like talk about climate collapse or talk about alienation or loneliness or war or all of these things.  I think those things are effects of a mindset of alienation, a mindset of other, a mindset of not one of of many and I must protect. And so I'm trying to like go backwards, figure that out. And then what I want to do with the book is give people an experience of wait a second, not, there is quality, you know?  Like, first of all it' be like, that's where my ideas come from. You know? For me, I had this big realization one day because I grew up in a very conservative Muslim family, but uh there's actually a lot of different ways to think about with some, you know?  And in history, there's a lot. And at some point in my life I was meeting Muslims that were like very different than me, you know? They had different behaviors, they were smoking pot and still Muslim and they were comfortable with themselves.  It was like they were g marijuana. They were ganaan Rostafarianyncretic Muslims, okay? Meaning they mixed between inside?  Yeah,. And so I met these people and they were like, yeah, well, most of them Rust God. and Allah Muslim Arabic, right? And so they were like, Jah.  I'm like, whoa, how are you who you are? How? And then I was I had this moment when I was young.  I was like, how am I who I am? And then I started deconstructing where I got my religious ideas from, and its history, which was related actually weirdly enough to the British because the British mess everything up, and Saudi Arabia, and they picked this one gahhe, maybe randomly, maybe strategically, but they p so, you know, in many traditions, everything has a bell curve, everything can be put on a bell curve, right? There's extremes, and then most people are in the middle, right?  is a science bell normal curve.ussian curve. They picked the guy that was just more extreme than everyone else, you know, the guy that's like very strict and very tight and very like difficult with his interpretation, who's like music is had on and everything is had on and you know, like a very uh once make things hard, right? But even in our book theoran it says God wants ease and not hardship, but for whatever reason he skips that that thing when he reads the book, and he gave because he is so funny the history and the accidents.  Look what happens. This guy becomes the king of Saudi Arabia because he's promoted by the British, the British, you know, kind of I handed it over to him and he becomes not the king, but he he influences the king and he kind of creates the the religion of the whole country, right? The most moral looks to Saudi Arabia because it has Mecca, as like the most Mussim place in the world, right?  But what happens is not only are they they already have like Saudi Mecah and like most people think of it as the most most place in the world, they find oil in the 70s. And now they can supercharge their ideology and spread it around the world, right? So when you open up oran in the messages that I was growing up in Michigan, on the front, it says a king, a gift from the king of Saudi Arabia that they were paying for scholars to get trained in their way of thinking, and then they would fly them around the world and implant them in mosques and that's where my ideas came from.  That's where like I was taught it's called stelapism or wabism, okay? Because the guy was named Yeah. Was his name Abdalbin and Wahb?  a very uh, like you said, uh angry thoughts, uh, very strict and controlling. And it's um those people are like, uh help theirselves withorum and no, I don't I't the thing that I was trying to get to here is the interesting thing is there were two accidents that made it so that this interpretation of Isem was mine. I grew up thinking it was just true.  It was the way I understood the religion and like one I know thinks this way and taught me that this is the right way to think. um I didn't know that there was such a thing as diversity and that maybe they have different ways of thinking. I thought everyone else was wrong and we were right, okay? Until I did the exercise and I realized like, okay, the British picked Abdalele in Wahab randomly.  I don't know why they picked them, but they picked him and then, too, is that country that uh uh is now very rich and can spread its ideas around the world. And that's why I have this ideas. And so that's kind of what I want this book to do.  I want people not to just think like, oh, down with capitalism or, oh, down with the, you know, like, let's all take, uh mushrooms and be one with the universe or something and like like dress like Native Americans and live back to the land. No, like there there were different ways of seeing the world that got filtered out and blocked systematically because of historical events and how they influenced culture and philosophy, and all of these things kind of work together, you know? And I think some of those very critical ones are the hundredyear war, the thirty Year War, where most of Europe is just fighting religious wars.  If you know a little bit about history, there was a period where there was a lot of religious wars in Europe between No, religious wars between the Protestants and the Catholics and yeah. And then those those two I don't know how those influen the the thinking, though. Tuesday should be history.  And then before that, there's the black plague and how that influences thing. and before that I think it's the IN creed and how that influences things. So the Niccing creed brings this dominance hierarchy structure, the black plague brings in the individualism. And then after that we have the hundredyear award that removes uh like makes it more secular.  So it's like hierarchical individualistic, secular, scientific, and each those things has a progression. and they add up to each other, right? hierarchy and power, like individual than individual power. Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You getting it. And so, uh, but I think once people see this and then they realize like, oh, holy crap, that's why we're like this. That's why we like people talk about like Western culture What do you expect, uh, which kind of effects?  I want first this realization, this aha of like, oh, that makes sense. That's why I feel that's why we are so disconnected from nature and why people in different cultures have a different relationship. there is like a bias. Maybe there is a bias because not every people are interested in those subjects.  And then even if uh these ideas would be spread and known by everybody, do you think that most of the people would be able to understand. This is why the so that's the prep work. That prepares the mind for the next step, which is the most important step, which is to re access a natural faculty, I think everyone has and everyone knows the faculty that is activated when they sense true love, not lust, the faculty when they see nature that makes them stop in their tracks and just look in awe, right?  This this faculty that knows truth, goodness, and beauty, as, and that those three things are three things, but there are also one thing in a moment of awe, there's no words. Words are the things that take one and make it into many, and so that experience, the faculty of what I call quality, not quantity, not numbers, the quality, is non segmentable, but when you start to put words on it, you use words like beauty, truth and love. But in reality, that's one thing, okay?  And so what I want to do is get people to understand that that used to be an experience that we have, this integrated sense of a whole, this thing where, you know, the thing that in other cultures turns into people communicating with trees and animals, and even if they're going to sacrifice an animal doing it respectfully, only as much as they need, knowing their bounds because they know they're a part of a complete system that is in harmony, that there is an idea of harmony that things are inbaled, the yin and the yang I take when I can and I give when I can and like this kind of less domineering, more integrated, more relational structure emerges from all I want people to do is acknowledge that love is love and it's not so molecule. That's it. And to do that, I think we can take two steps.  One is that this perception is true and that this perception is reliable. Okay? So what what we need to do is help people distinguish between emotions and mood and a quality perception.  Does that make sense? Because some people might think like, I am falling in love. I'm feeling love.  It's like, no, just chill for a second. Wait. Is that love or is this like, excitement?  Is it lust? Is it, uh like, how do how do you know when you're feeling something that is connected to this thing that I'm talking about that is connected to the beyond to this thing that is meaningful and true in a deep way, uh and and distinguishing it from all of these fleeting emotions that go up and down and change and definitely have hormonal and biological and physiological uh can uh relationships. uh and there are people that are studying um awe, right? They're actually looking at a in like the sense of amazement, right?  In neuroscience and cognitive science, and so actually, I think my book is going to require me to do a lot of interesting research finding those researchers that are looking into these things and in in the end, I want to do a historical thing, a scientific thing, and then an experiential thing. can you go these humanity contemplation? Which one the sense of quality? I call it a faculty.  It's just like we have a faculty of hearing and seeing and smelling and tasting. We have another faculty of perception. love, goodness and truth, is the thing that, you know, you see a sunset and you just stop and like, that's amazing. Or like a waterfall or a a beautiful antelope with huge antlers in the wild, and you have this like sense of alive awe connection, reverence, you know?  Or or love is maybe more more most people, uh find it, if they have a sense of true love, like, for instance, you're holding your baby for the first time, right? And then, you know, you might ask people, okay, what happened there? What happened when I'm realizing is like, all of these things happened with an Icyon creed and the dominant structure and then the black plague and being like, I should live my life before I die or whatever.  Like all these things kind of add up to a way of being that blocks that way of seeing, that perception, that faculty that we have. It exists, though. It doesn't go anywhere.  It's like it's like we we have been walking around with one eye closed and they were like, hey, one second, just like try opening this this eye a little bit and like, what. Whoa, I can see in 3D. And that's kind of the the the metaphor that I want to say is we're seeing the world as if we have only one eye and it's flat and we don't have depth perception. It's kind of hard to tell, you know, how far things are.  But then, like once we open that second eye, we'll have depth reception and we'll know how to navigate our difficult and challenging times. It's not that we give up rational thinking or even self-protection. Like put on your seatbelt, you know, use science.  It's okay, you know, these are good things, but it needs to be put into balance with another good thing. And I would say, you know, because this is this is how I think is the right order is truth, goodness, beauty first, and science rationality to serve it. Like, should you should your head serve your heart or should your heart serve your head?  I think your head should serve your heart, you know? So this is my like thinking about it you know the same and uh I was wondering this faculty that that was more developed in the past before I see and maybe the faculty still exists in many cultures. it's meaningful. and do you think this faculty is hurt or maybe step in now This is one of the reasons why I wanted to do the research on near death experiences. A near death experiences, most of the time people come back and they make major life decisions.  Chang non-meaningful things are cut out of their life. They orient towards relationships, um, and it shows that it might take a wake-up call for people to pay more attention and realize what really matters in life, you know. And I think near that experiences do that. um But, you know, the whole planet is having a n nearative experience right now with climate collapse and all of these things.  And so many young people are considering suicide. There are, I think we talked about it last time, underage suicides, like preteenagers killing themselves, worried about the future. That is insane, okay?  Kids, like literally kids. And so the way I see it is like we are having a kind of planetary near death experience. There's a lot of stress and fear about the future.  People aren't having children and might lead to a population collapse. Like there's a lot of these issues. um and it's spilling out into the political sphere, that anxiety about things mean me first, um the France first, America first, refugees leave, you know, it's becoming more protective because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow and has all these negative consequences. And so I think, you know, talking about this and looking at like the research in near experiences and the the qu-quote solution is, I don't really want this book to be understood by everybody.  I just want to create practices that help people like connect to that perceptual faculty and acknowledges acknowledge its existence as a source of reliable and true information that is it's not like a, you know, some people talk about intuition to talk about some of these things. Like I have an intuition. I'm feeling, you know?  But it's just an idea, it's just a feeling, you know? But no, what if we distinguish between feelings and recognition? That's what I'm trying to suggest.  That we just like you recognize something with your eyes, like, this is a pencil. That's a pencil. You you can recognize something with that faculty, that perception.  Instead of saying, this is an intuition and then blowing it off as like, an emotion. an emotional as if it's not real, it'll just come and it will just go, being like, I have an intuition. Maybe I need to like dig into it and open that eye wider to get the message to get that message, right? And so it does involve some things like meditation or prayer or contemplation or just sitting with your emotions until you can see your emotions and then see beyond your emotions.  Like at some point, if you sit with your emotions, you can be like, oh, that's a feeling, it comes, and it goes, but this thing is here and it just stays. only a fancy. Yeah, we have the non-fancy version. We'll get a fancy one someday, don't worry, dear.  No, the toilet is That's right. Only one time the Japanese toilet in our parents' house. You've never really tried it.  Only one time because I was like you can change the pressure. You can make less strong. yeah, I's it's like taking a shower. It's it's less smeary. and spreading.  Yeah, yeah Arabs think of you know like people look at Arabs like dirty Arabs, Arabs look at the Western people and like, you're actually dirty, literally dirty. Definitely dirty. We were talking about this and I don't know, it's I had a family uh during my consultation on it was uh moment dad and uh the two children and uh so one were four years old and a girl was uh I think she was nine and uh they all have the gasro.  Oh no. And uh so uh I I exam then all and um I started with the little one and uh then uh the the mother and then the uh the the two of the the two others and uh at the end I was doing the prescription on the computer and the the little, the little boy, uh four years old, he was sitting on uh the legs of his. And he said mommy, I I shoot on myself oh no it's it's it went through the pens on the mother's legs.  I saw it was shit happens you took them like to the like what did you do you give them to it was only on the legs of the moment the children they went on the toilet and I gave them a tissues, yeah some tissues. four years old if he has a guest who you should wear diapers or something. Yeah. I don't know.  Yeah. So we now have both have our thesis to write. Yeah, but all these subjects are very deep and interesting and I think it's a good uh work yard you you are doing.  And it's very hard because you have to connect a lot of different things. You can have a consensus, but it's very hard to get it get to this point because people will always say that's not true we are all other influences or is just the, you know, it's just random evolution is run down and yeah, this is why one of the things I want to do is make it a a science by trying to build a community of people working on listening to that part of them that I think is a real thing. And then I don't know.  And then basically if it exists, it's gonna be in a tradition. It's gonna be in like a religious tradition or a spiritual tradition. I'm trying to say that this is like this is just something that human beings have access to.  This is why, like I don't think of myself as a Muslim because I grew up in this tradition. Like I had a very big period of exploration and questioning and wondering and it gives me also yeah, it gives me also a structure. But also, I think it's true.  Like I actually believe in the that if people were to think and explore and feel and let go over their biases and their emotions and try to understand, like, who am I? What is the world? Are we created?  Do we just as it just biological? Where do my ideas come from all of these things? That it might not look uh super Arab, uh, but like the fun the foundational principle of the most tradition is there's only one god.  And that he is not divisible, that uh he is the first and the last, and there's uh, you know, all of these like the the foundational principle is there's only one God and that the second most important thing is he doesn't leave us alone. He actually writes writes us stories and messages. I think there's only one thing, yeah.  Oh yeah, or like, uh the the Greeks, you know, with the the god of the things and, it's sort of like just questioning Yeah, they' that's actually kind of what Joe is doing these days. She's exploring the 99 names. And so there's there is only one god, but the the names are just like the Pantheon, like, there's the god of what is this?  the promoter or the advancer? the most merciful, the source of goodness, uh the avenger, uh the so so these like often come in pairs in the in the Muslim tradition, like today is uh we're reflecting on the name of God for the all seeing. One of the qualities uh Rahman.  Yeah. So this is the only Rahman only name of God that's Rahman.. So, the the way that the name works is very much like the Pathan or like Taoism, where there's often these binaries, right?  There's the first and the last, the one that honors people, the one that actually brings people to dishonor. the giver of life, the bring her to death, right? So this is still the one God, but it has these aspects. But the only one name that is ever used on its own is the most merciful. or thou god.  Which is not a description. There's either so it's either a law, which means the god or a Rahman, which means a the most merciful, and when God describes why he sent the messengers it's only to be a mercy for all of the universes. And so you get this idea that it is oneness and the primary quality of this oneness is goodness, love, beauty, truth, how everyone to talk about this all enveloping all nurturing mercy that is a the only other the only way that oneness wants to be understood in the Muslim tradition, at least.  But what I what I want to do with the book is to make it experiential, to ask people to do these practices, to reflect on what they think it means, to look at the history to understand, to to look at like one of the things that's really interesting is most indigenous cultures do have this property of oneness about it. And and being a part of a whole rather than everything is just random and there's a lot of different pieces and segmenting and cutting the world apart. It's the relational element with with everything.  And so I think that means something. I think there's something important to realize there and that Western culture is weird in the world. It's not normal.  It does spread because of the dominance and some of the different principles that cause it to be over overreaching, but to to say like, what would Western culture look like if we brought back the part of us that saw that we were part of everything else? You know? It's not that Western culture should book like native culture and have feathers in our hair or whatever.  No, like there's some really beautiful things about baguettes and berets, you know, it's great. B. B. is really wonderful things about these things, but like it's a special expression in English now? B?  No, I just made it. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay., yes. But but like what does a French culture look like when more French people you know, French people, I feel like are very cut off from religion because of the uh French revolution and because of like its own historical uh history.  But imagine if we didn't even talk about religion and we just talked about, okay, when we got rid of religion and we overemphasized like reason and rationality, we cut ourselves off from intuition, understanding, unity, wholeness, meaning, you know, things that actually make life worth living, and it's not just about eating great cheese and having affairs, you know, and sleeping around. Like there's something more and what would it look like when French culture finally opens up that eye of perception? It will be amazing.  I don't know what it could look like. I was wondering about because there is a French his name is in the one of his show is uh is speaking about French people. And the the history of uh this uh people and uh he is uh telling that uh, yeah, uh we are Gurwa.  And uh What's Gurwa is the old name for French people, because before French, France was uh gold. Oh yeah, the Ga.. and the Gauls and the Visigoths and the Goths, yeah. uh some Spanish Arabic, Italian, uh, uh immigration and the revolution and uh basically is it is kind of speaking uh fast and uh uh t this about uh, uh we don't want a president, we want uh, a piata, you know? Pinett We want something to to to break down and hit a five years we are very how people like uh as you said, uh French are totally kind of the partially related related to this idea of like when it's our responsibility now to make things better, but it's not better, we need to fight the thing that it is and try to make it better, right?  So as it's it's very much like heaven is tomorrow, you know, if we just do the right things and we make the right plan and we create this social safety nets and you know, J John, like the yellow jacket then they won't be angry because they will have their things and and so it's it's very much we need to use our reason and our logic to make life the best. and when it's not the best, we got it wrong so we have to do it again. But the problem is, you can't use that tool to understand everything and make it work. It doesn't happen, and so you keep getting frustrated, you know, because, you know, it's we mentioned, I think the idea of the strip form, you know, uh the the farm where you reduce the number of variables so that you have fertilizer water and seed and you can expect this is the expectation.  Expectation always leads to misery and suffering because you never get what you want. But when you reduce the number of variables in a system, it's more manageable to control with the with our limited human capacities, right? We are not able to reason about all of the dynamic complexities of a food forest.  What you can only do is be a part of it. You know, do your little part, you know, uh create the conditions and and have trust and faith, you know. I think Jesus said, if you trusted God as God should be trusted, you would go out like the birds, hungry in the morning and full in the evening, but every day you will leave you this is not Jesus, this is not be dead.  You you would leave the nest. in trust and reliance and hope and fear that you'll find your warm for the day, and when you find it, you can truly be joyful, you know, and that's a difference of being a part of a system and the gratitude and joy and a wiveness that is there versus I ordered the bigmac on Uri and its taking wait long. It should have been here 15 minutes ago, and I have guests coming and I paid money for this. Okay.  This expectation and this like desire, this kind of way of yeah, and and I think that's also related to why the French keep, you know, pinataing their governments. It's like you're supposed to make everything perfect. It was a good plan..  Why don't we have utopia? What happened? Because there's this arrogance to thinking that you can figure it out.  But we can figure it. I was thinking about the movie June. There is a a part when you know black guy at the he fights with a pole in one uh Paul's dream, Janice is talking to him and he he said, uh uh to understand the process of life you just have to follow it.  And you see the the sand that is a vibrating and doing waves and yeah, I like this uh but that attitude is very not accepted, especially for for governments for businesses, for the world that we're in, it's to understand life, you need to make a map and a diagram and have S do you know the SDGs are? This sustainable development goals, I think I all develop them. yougnore the SDGs. Our government is like, okay, so we have poverty and we are gonna make a pyot and this one has to be smaller and then we're can allocate more resources here and then that's going to move this one, like expand the other part of the government because the minister uh we had the first minister and the he he had he was kicked the out because uh the budget, uh with the idea of all the other uh the group the Yeah, so they they are trying to do this now. they're trying to figure figure it out.  But I wonder sometimes like what my ideas would look like if they're more balanced. Because how does the perception of quality fit into budgeting for a country? How would it look differently if it was accepted that you know, that we can't understand everything, that we have to be integrated into systems that life actually makes sense as we go through it.  Maybe instead of starting and making a budget in the beginning of the year, we do budgeting where every day we are attuned to the reality of our society as much as possible, and allocate appropriately day by day rather than you know, make a big plan or maybe that maybe that's where it needs. Maybe it needs both. Maybe it needs the pie chart and the plan in the beginning, but then every day allocating the allocating, being attuned, talking, connecting to people connecting to what is supposed to do connecting with the feeling of what you're supposed to do you know sometimes people make a good intention in the beginning, like, for instance, me and Duol lingo.  I had a good intention. I wanted to learn French, I wanted to talk with your family, I wanted to be wanted to be. But now I do duolingo just to make the streak, right?  So if I was in touch with the reality, I would either tell myself, okay, you either commit to it or just stop, because right now you're not learning French and you're just doing things to make this number go up. You know, just like people in a budget. We allocated budget to the arts because we wanted to have a flourishing creative community.  Is that doing it the best? Or is there a different way to allocate money to make sure that we have a flourishing creative community? Because there's so many people in jobs around the world, especially in governments and in the UN, where they know that this isn't the best use of funds, but this is what they're doing and they have this creeping feeling of like, this doesn't feel right.  This is wrong, but they just do it because because they don't have this, they only have this. They only have the once a year decision. integ, you know, and countries are basically uh some uh found our lending money to countries, and I think it's so complex now. I don't know how we could maybe erase all.  I mean start again and through like this watching what we are being more grounded realistic, connected to the you know, the the the thing that people kind of hope for is like, okay. We're collecting more information than we know what to do with. AI will solve it.  That's what they're thinking. They're thinking they'll just give everything to AI and it will be able to find the patterns that matter, but what I'm trying to suggest is we can't delegate this because I think that our perception of of goodness is and that feeling of like, is this right? This doesn't feel right, you know?  You can't get that. This it doesn't feel right and we need to be able to trust that. So for instance, this is one of the stories I'm put in my book.  And I think I forget his name, but this Russian general was looking at his uh monitoring system for nuclear warheads, and he saw five nuclear missiles coming from America. and he freaked out. The red light started spinning, the alarms went off, literally he was in the control room. All he had and what his job it was was to monitor this, and if America sends missiles, Russia sends missiles.  Okay. I don't know if you know about the Cold War. Yeah, so that was the Cold War.  That was the the common response to everyone was waiting for the missiles to fall, okay? And he saw the missiles. Why don't we have a story of five nucle explosions in Russia and he didn't push the button.  He didn't call his superiors. He had a feeling that said this can't be. Right.  And he trusted it. We are alive, probably. You know, like if Russia and America had a nuclear war, the world would look very, very different today.  And five nukes from America, let's imagine that they were real hitting Russia. And of course they would target major cities. Like we would live in a very different world and Russia would have anyway, it would have just exploded. and escalated.  So we're alive today and we have the world that is relatively safe without the major nuclear war because someone trusted this insight.. Yeah, it turned out that there was an error. Yeah, it was uh it was light reflecting off of a lake in New Mexico or something like that.  And so you? Yeah, and so I think that that story is like really important. uh and people need to like know about this story and to realize like this idea of creating AI plus our data to make decisions for us and without humans to be able to feel and to be close enough to reality. And this is the other thing that I'm realizing.  This is where it gets a little bit, I'm going to need to do more research on the science element, which is that guy felt something, even though the instruments which were mediated like digitally mediated instruments told him something. It was an artifact of light reflecting off of some clouds and water and yeah, like the radar systems like the I think it was a satellite system. uh But but yeah, it was an artifact that um it confused the machines. So my dad, when his brother died, felt it before he got the phone call, okay?  Many people have stories like this. Okay? And I think it's because this faculty of perception of um of oneness is one.  It's not to it's not spatially dependent. It's so that person looking at the radar had a disconnect between this faculty and this faculty. He sees the radar and it says that missiles are coming, but this thing says that they are not right?  How did that how did that thing know? That's So so this is where it gets like kind of into the place where it's like a little bit crazy, you know, where you start saying like, okay, well, you can you can perceive the right thing to do uh because it digests everything that matters about this decision and gives you a sense of it. So, and it's trustable and reliable, but it digest everything in all time and all space for this moment, you know, like relevant for this moment, but it doesn't actually matter about how far you are from the thing.  That's the kind of this is like I'm not sure if I need to go there for this argument, but that's what this story tells us. That this person had a faculty that was connected to the reality of what was happening beyond his line of sight and the instruments that were telling him what was happening were at conflict with it, but he trusted his intuitive sense or his quality sense or whatever. I think I need a better word for it.  Like I I I use the word quality, but I don't think people um I'm trying not to say things like heart and I'm trying not to say things like soul or spirit or anything that can sound religious. uh and quality in quantity or I think really good pairs of antonms, you know, it's like the quantity of things. You can measure like how far this thing is. You can measure how many, you know, silicon atoms make up this thing if you had a really it's not enough I think it may be why you try to search another word.  Do you have any ideas isn't heart? Or intuition? I'm Yeah.  And uh I was thinking about two things? The gravitation we detected a recently? Yeah, the gravitons or yeah.  The black holes that collapsed and it made waste and we could uh detected because the crazy thing is things were squished together. like isn' that crazy? Yeah. like space time squished and we got squished too, but we we didn't feel it. a very little bitters. But no, and I was thinking also about in the movie when the woman I say uh love isn't uh meatmeasurable, but it can cross space and time, you know it's interesting movies gravitational waves the kind of keep the information and it's not uh influ influenced by its base and time, you know, it' it's crossing space time.  But isn't everything crossing space time? Like right now, if you do this, you're affecting the farthest star at the end of the the universe.? Because, you know, gravity has an R squared relationship R is the distance, right?  But it never goes to zero. And so by moving my head over here, there is slightly more mass over here and the entire center of mass of the universe has shifted because I did this, right? And so it as a real effect, but that's the idea.  You can sense it if you if you are very, very very very extremely super ultrasensitive. you could sense it on the moon, you could sense it. You know, they you can actually see these experiments with gravity here where, you know, you put a bowling ball next to something and they can actually sense the amount this thing moves towards it, right? So you have a bowling ball on a string and a on a string and they actually can see it's very, very tiny amount.  But because the bowling ball has mass and it war up space time, then this thing moves, right? And so it doesn't take the graitation waves. It just takes mov, you know?  Everything is literally connected. Everything is talking to everything at all times, even just gravitational. Like I'm pulling you towards me and you're pulling me towards you right now.  Like Newton? Yeah. I'm not sure, because uh Einstein kind of uh uh you know, change everything musicfficient. money.  Newton said the third law, when two masss are there, they are it's so Einstein's idea is space time, but you are warping space time. So I concentrate space time. Yeah, a little bit.  I concentrate space time over here, which is why you feel the effect of being run. It's not necessarily like yeah, I I'm bending you a little bit towards me instead of using the Newtonian affects uh like uh never goes to zero. Yeah, yeah, to zero.  So yeah, that's the idea. So because it does affect everything at all times. Yeah, what I want to say is that, uh scientist of physicist say says that our universe is, uh um oh, there is a name an ejective to say that the physics low are the same at each point of the universe.  Self- consistence or something like that. Yeah, it's it's a very special word in French. and uh so because it it's never going to zero, but uh at our level we can't really see the the effect. But I was thinking, does does this gravitational effect could be related to the quality??  I don't know. Maybe I don't I don't I don't want to to uh explicit or to define it to try to to figure out uh what it could be related to, because uh it could it would be reduce it just like everything else. I think it no, no.ropic.  Yeah, yeah. Is. You know, sometimes this this thing we mentioned earlier, like when you are struck by something so awe inspiring, you usually don't have words, right? You're just yeah, you your reduce it to.  I yeah, I don't know. It's just How could it be meaningful and wordless? It's it's very interesting that the most meaningful things are often associated with moments of speechlessness.  And then later, a poet tries or an artist tries their best to evoke it, right in their poetry or their art, they try to put words on the unword did. truths, love, and goodness. goodness. It's it's also it's not just my uh language. This is like one of the things that um philosophers and theologians think of as kind of foundational elements of it.  There's an additional one that I use, which is beauty, but I think beauty is sort of like electricity in a solar panel, like when they' when you uh like like love and beauty come together, uh, when you love something you find a beautiful and when you find something beautiful, you love it, and so it's like the forces, right? It's it's war big space time and pulling things towards each other. That's what love does. love like takes things that are distant and tries to bring them together.  And I think that's actually a very interesting way of thinking about love as a as a force. It is actually a unifying force. Like people see each other from across the room and if they love each other, they just want to get closer and closer and closer and so they start kissing, you know.  And then they want to get inside of each other, just like become one, you know And actually, you know the weird thing is, I know it sounds very crude, but I think there's like if you look with the eye of metaphor and that nothing, well, it my interpretation, God does, is an accident, this stuff is very meaningful, like even even the sexual act as that representation of like, what does love want to do? It wants to bring things together and to take things and bring them to make one and then actually as what life comes from and like you can think about these metaphors and you can realize like, wow, man, God is hilarious, first of all. And and he's like telling a really good story here.  I'm searching a world because I have the impression that not that far. I was thinking about contemplation and Hm. Yeah, it's hot funny. good work.  You know, there's this relationship between, um love and attraction, it reminds me of one of the you know, things that the in the Muslim tradition says, like, why did God create all of this? And it goes like this. I was a this is God speaking.  He says, I was a hidden treasure that wanted to be known, and so I created so that I could be known and uh like this idea of love and knowledge is kind of evoked in this. It's like to to love and to to to to know and to be connected and um it kind of reminds me of some of the uh Indian philosophies about the Brahmin and this idea of oneness getting bored. and then hiding in multiplicity to recognize oneness and then to awaken to go back to oneness. This kind of idea uh kind of rhymes with this idea of being a hidden treasure and not being admired or known or loved, and creating in order to be able to to love and be loved. and that the and it's kind of interesting that love is the thing that takes the many and makes one.  And and it's interesting that it's actually, you know, what we just thought of historically. It's fear that takes the one makes many, right? It's the fear, the need for control, the it's so interesting.  I think love and fear are like love love is the unifying principle and fear is the the disunifying or the dispersing principle. Maybe it could be h harmony, liality harmony? Harmony, that is a result.  I think of following your perception of well, because I I asked IGPT I could be resume in one word roof, love, beauty, and goodness. You know what we can do as well, we can ask the similar question. We can ask um, can you come up with ten different ways to say quality versus quantity?  We want to find a new word for the faculty in that perceives quality. Okay. Let's see.  Let's see what it says. Depth versus breadth, substance versus substance versus scale, essent essence, versus extent, nuance versus count, value versus volume. OK, this sounds pretty good.  Meaning versus measure. Right?? Yeah, you either measure things, you know the own space and your distance or your like sense of meaning.  I like meaning quality versus quantity or meaning, and they both start with them. versus measure. That's not bad. Beauty versus bulk no.  Integrity sensna, discernment, value versus volume. That's kind of interesting. Value versus volume.  Nuance versus count. depth versus breadth. Substance awareness. Eence essence perception. essence perception.  I like the essence perception and discernment discernment and meaning can we go down this track? pisses conscience wisdom. Yeah, I mean, I think listening to it implies like that you're getting closer to wisdom.  I think like when we are listening to our lower like feelings of like fear, like jealousy or uh, you know, these like like can be addressed by tapping into the thing. It's like, okay, it's I'm feeling really angry or uh jealous, but when you listen to that faculty, how should I respond? and this is why I think the fundamental name of mercy really matters, and the fundamental like purpose of being to know and connect with a hidden treasure of like truth, beauty, and goodness is your your quality sense will never tell you like hurt someone else or hurt yourself, right?  It will never tell you yeah, I'm not so sure if the missiles are coming or not, but just fire anyway just in case you know I don't think that's going to be what happens. Usually, like the sense of meaning is also connected to self sacrifice on the opposite side of things, right? Like when we see Jesus or Gandhi or Martin Luther King Junior or pick any famous like story of someone that the band of brothers or okay, maybe not you, uh 300 uh yeah, yeah, all those people.  They lost. They all died, but they died with like honor and it left us feeling inspired, right and left us connecting to some of these qualities of years ago something it's not beautiful and the the aesthetic sense, but there's something beautiful about how they stared together and faced instrmumentable odds, and even if they died, they died with honor and there's something beautiful and good about that, right? And so it's it's something I think there's something very interesting about self-sacrifice. uh that kind of is important in this uh in this thing because it shows like the self doesn't matter.  There's like a a things a wholeness that matters more and being in harmony and in integrity and upholding what wants to come through your your your meaning sense or whatever we're calling it, you know, is more inspiring than you staying alive. But when you're in the fear, you just want to stay alive, you want to control, you want to substigate. It's like I will, I will, I will.  And like all these billionaire, you know what they're doing? They're building homes and compounds in islands around New Zealand. because they expect ocean levels a rise, New Zealand will be okay, um, they expect that this refugee mass migration thing will happen. They don't want to be on any land mass that's contiguous with other countries that are going to be experiencing climate collapse.  And they're thinking of self and self-p protection, and it's ugly, right? Like you don't you don't hear the story of like how billionaires are looking to preserve themselves. They hired a futurist named Douglas Rushkoff.  They asked him okay, we figured out the food, we figured out the land, we figured out all this stuff and we have money and we bought our place and we can survive. um and we have the people working on the farms and and all of this. How can we be sure that they won't revolt? and take over the property and like we're just one or two billionaires.  It's like a small billionaire family. How can we be sure that the personnel don't work together to kill us and just live on the island, right? And uh the the answer uh was, you know, you want, because you're a billionaire to delegate all the work.  You don't want to go and dig in the fields and figure out food and you'll kill the chickens. You want to hire people to do that. You want to pay people with food probably, right?  Because we're imagining an ap apocalyptic situation. And so what they were suggested to do was they have to do one thing and keep one thing under their control, which is food storage. They need to have the only set of keys you know, maybe biometric, maybe it's connected to their eye retina or fingerprint or something that people can't like chop off and use that needs to be connected to a very well-p protected sealed safe of food storage.  And if you do that, then you can control the rest of the situation. So I only tell that whole story. First of all, just to show you how that's ugly.  You hear that story and you're not inspired. You think this person is horrible, you don't feel like that's what we should be doing that's a good life, that's a good way of living, and we know that, but what knows that? Because it's the world Yeah, the thing that knows that, I think is that meaning sense. is that sense that says like that's not meaningful.  You might survive, but like you'll like, if you really sat with this and you didn't look at the fear that was making you do all that planning, you wouldn't be proud of yourself likely, right? I think, yeah, but just told it's kind of how our world is actually functioning. It's a real story.  It's not a hypothetical., you already told me this story of the billionaire in New Zealand. Yeah, I think it's a million people are those rich people want to try to stay in comfort and, you know and not helping people. But I was thinking about the whole stone.  It's actually how our world isn't right now, you know, the trillioners the most rich people in the world, those people are owning the industry of meat, of chemicals, and the the system, the political system and the economic system is built. so that we are like slaves working and keeping in control and the richer people, I know it sounds like communism and but uh the idea is there and it's still a bulful uh I think somebody once told me that one of the most important things that you can do for your freedom is to grow a little bit of food. It doesn't have to be everything, but just a couple of carrots, just a couple of like potatoes or onions or eggs or chicken. Once you start to realize like self sufficiency, even in a small way, like you get that feeling like, oh wow, like, because right now, I the way that I think about what you were just saying is it's sort of like these um the system as holding security and food and shelter hostage, and we have to, even though we know the system is broken, many people know this they feel like they have to go through these steps of getting a job doing these things in a certain way to be able to access the fundamental basic needs of metal hierarchy, great food, shelter, security, stuff like that.  And it's true. It's it's actually true. Like right now that's that's how the food is behind the paywall, you know?  It's interesting that they are thinking about these universal basic income and But I think about this food thing sometimes I'm like, hmm, if we owned some land somewhere and a farm that made enough food, and I looked into it. It doesn't actually take that much land and that much uh space to produce enough food for a year. Detroit I'm looking at property and So I also have like my family and my cousin's already there and yeah, it's actually really great. in terms of water excess.  It's one of the few places in the world that will benefit from climate collapse longer growing seasons, fresh water, a lot of people are weirdly enough, a lot of people this is why we should probably buy land there before too long, is people want to come to Detroit because of climate collapse. But uh yeah, other than Detroit, Russia But why would I want to go to Russia? Montes.  I thought about um Kurtisistan, also like wanna connect with roots and history and and meaning in a broader sense, right? Like what would. It's pretty fertile.  Okay, if you like mountains, there's mountains too. I am, yeah, actually, there's probably some good claiming. Kurt anymore.  Kurtan? It's I think it exists. Curtisistan never really existed in the nation stateway because the colonizers didn't realize that that was a people and they were like, well, the map should look like this, and this should be for France and that can be for England.  England, what do you think? Okay, no, no, this can be for France. They literally did that.  Do you know that? They got together. It's called the Sykes Peaks agreement.  You know about this? And they got a big map and they they drank a lot of coffee, smoked a lot of cigars and they literally drew a map. like this, and they called it putting wines in the sand, and there's some like really funny stories, like I forget, like I want to go find the thing. It's like apparently someone had their cup on the map and like somebody went a little bit like this and had to like avoid the cup and and and so you see the map of like one Yeah, you see you map with some of these countries and and it looks like and there's like this little zigzag in it and they're like, oh yeah, that was because I just didn't want to move the cup when I was, you know It's crazy.  It's it's just like when you realize like because and the rest of the world, like you look at Europe, all the borders are like this, you know? And that's people of either mountain range or that's people fighting this way and these people fighting this way. and like at some point they're like like, let's just call it a country and, you know, so let's stop fighting, you know? And you have like these very organic borders of nature and people, right?  Africa. Middle East Africa say America, like there's one states square. Yeah, but those are states in in one country, supposedly, but uh, just like the Middle East and Africa and all these places are just so so funny.  I wonder how like it's really good to be really curious, but it takes a long time for things to come together. you know? It takes a long time for things to come together. uh so well things like this this this kind of book that I'm writing, it started off because I wanted to write something about economics and I wanted to talk about like a different economic system. And then I realized that like economic systems come from like worldviews and then I wanted to like think about world views.  But because I've been such a nerd and so curious about so many things, I can actually like piece something together and was really interesting is that finally at the end, the the thing that I'm talking about is um is one thing is just one thing. It's like, and and by talking about this one thing, I can address all of the other things. I can talk about economics.  I can talk about like, why did we build this economic system? It's like, oh, because fear and need for control after, you know, the the black plague and like the council of Nicea and like hierarchy and that led to this these philosophers and history. And then in the end, it's like, I hope it's very practical.  Like I want in the end, even if the book doesn't sell, nobody cares. I want to start a coaching process that the only thing it is, it's related to have to and want to and to help people take there to do list and break it up into one of these two columns and then over time make more of their to do list on this side. That's it.  I think if we did this, what we're doing is we're getting people to connect with meaning more in their life that brings all of these other principles that we were talking about of like connecting to oneness or understanding um like their part in a broader whole because the a lot of the have toos are the I have to work to be able to eat. I have to do these things and usually they are not how you want to be, but how you think you have to be, and they usually come with tensions. They're like I have to go to work so we able to eat, but it's not happy I have to go to work usually.  It's ling this tension. And so when we do this coaching and we look at the tensions and then we ask, is it true? That's a pretty good start.  I think just doing this with more people, we can we don't have to explain all of history and where the ideas come from and we'll connect people more with their perception of meaning. It will give them more awareness of their feelings and why they have them, their anger, where they come from, you know, just by looking at your tualist and comparing half twoss and wanttos, and then asking about tensions. So this is a coaching practice that I'm developing and it's kind of comes with the book.  Wow, that's kind of cool. I think it's all because I've been working on this for a while, and initially I was working on like the economics book and then I tried to work on this philosophy book and then I worked on the the practice, but I think I have a very clear way of explaining how they all fit together. It's like there's like the understanding of the past, um how like history and philosophy evolved over time to disconnect people from oneness and then like so the core theme is this oneness principle uh and how do we get back to that?  That's I think the simplest way of explaining everything without having to get into so much detail, because there's it could be a lot of detail. I realized that I'm pretty much uh uh like, yeah, I I'm aware and I try to change to be more connected to the quality and uh the things that I want to and but I realize that I am functioning my life that I built my life and I'm functioning really much more like uh on the quantity how it works and what I have to do to get in and if you do you want to try going through the coach? Because I still have to um develop this.  I still have I only have tried running a a few times with a few people. It might be interesting to. Yeah, it could be interesting to try and it could also help you to develop it.  I'm not sure I yeah, I think I would be a good subject for for trial. But uh the thing is that maybe uh since I I passed the the 30 I uh I studied uh changing like trying to get more want to Yeah, you know, trying to to do some meditation, to to be more healthy and to yet do things that are meaningful and hmm it's still hard to do it right. Because is there right Yeah, but that's the whole uh that's is whole problem.  It's just uh I'm too much uh control. Yes. That perfection.  Yes. Yeah. That's interesting.  Well we can um we can try this like to to do this and we might not figure it out immediately, but it could be interesting to see, you know, every emotion tells you something. It's a it's an indicator of a way of being that is being blocked or prevented from uh happening. And so when you have these um feelings of like need for okay, I need to do it right, even myself development has to be right.  And you know it's all the medicine.. I think it's a big uh influence in my life. I I already I was already a bit like this before and it it went uh exacerbate exacerbate, yeah.  Yeah, with the medical students. Yeah yeah it makes sense. So it's it's like you learn these unconscious things about needing to be right Yeah, yeah, basically yeah, it's this.  I learn to, like, you know the science uh demar the method? The method It's all about uh what we we say before. the quantity, the trying to control things. Yeah. yeah.  And and you know, one of the ideas was not to have necessarily big transformations, but the idea would be to try to listen for this quiet voice, you know, this intuition, this feeling, and to answer its call, however, best you think you can, and then to reflect on was that better or worse, you know? So, for instance, like let's say, it might be a it was an interesting one. Like, when you let go of control with the barber, you didn't come in, with a picture, right?  That's a small experiment and easy one, yeah. So can we come up with more of these things and gradually build up to the bigger ones like relationships for sure. And you know what I told you about it's one big point in my life because I still feel a little a little bit guilty, uh with uh whether I I have done to her. with the history of the pregnancy and the abortion and uh and the whole all the um the very uh conflictual relationship before and after this event and uh yeah, and kind of uh always uh um questioning myself uh, either I uh school or uh did I school at all?  Did I uh h do uh bad things uh uh should I have uh uh cultivate more on this relationship uh was she uh the woman of my life uh does the the the entuition I I had before and now, uh what does that mean? Am I uh uh am I right? uh I don't know.  It's a lot of a lot of thoughts. So, uh, you know, coming from from my perspective, there is this uh this idea, especially for people that are on the path. You know, there might not be perfect, but they're on the path that when they die, they will look back, they will give you know they say life flashes before your eyes when you die?  That people on the path will look back and they look at their life and see everything that happened and not want a single thing to be changed. But that's for, I think, especially for people that are on the path that started on the path and then sustained on the path. um throughout their life. Whenever they started, it doesn't have to be starting uh, you know, from the beginning, like from birth.  But it could be that you, you know, there's this idea of uh penance and repentance and going to the confessionary or whatever it is in the Catholic Church. But this idea of like, if you have this intuition that you've done something that you aren't proud of, uh, one is it's in the past, but just make a commitment that you won't do that again, that you've learned your lesson. That's why we do bad things.  You know, there's a saying in the lesson tradition. If you lived and never made any mistakes, God would replace you with another society that made mistakes and asked for forgiveness so that he can forgive, because he is the all forgiving, right? And so this idea of like mistakes are not a mistake.  They're actually necessary part of a process of cultivating the heart of becoming like imagine if you've never made any mistakes and you died and you you know, a lot of life is about Catharsis. It's about like okay, that happened, but this time I'm gonna do a differently and then regular and then being you can be proud of yourself for doing it differently. You know, like, I had a similar thing in my life when I had a previous partner that, uh asked me if I love her, and I was like, I define love. like bring me a diction.  I literally ask for a dictionary, okay? I was like, I don't want to say anything is not true. Like, what does love mean?  you know, and because I couldn't acknowledge it because it would require me to fight my family and like, there was a lot of, you know, difficulties around this. And so I for a long time, I felt like, oh my God, I lost the person that I loved. I many thoughts similar to yours, right?  But uh, because there is one important point, uh, you you said here is when one partner is more in love than the other, and Inez was totally in love and she was very committed and I felt like uh I was uh hurting him her and I was uh uh evil and uh and uh yeah, I felt it really bad, you know, really guilty and bad, like sad. And uh that's why I had these uh whole circus of uh getting back with her, uh stopping and then getting back but you weren't sure what to do and then when you were in it didn't feel right. 20 times and uh yeah, that's why I asked myself, do I really love her, but I was not enough material to trust myself to trust my feelings? or was that not a good relationship and and I should uh just uh trust my uh what I felt and and stop it and not come back.  I remember this idea that we said that the faculty of meaning intuition and it's hard for me to trust my intuition because I have a lot of intritions and sometimes I was like, yeah, it's it's hers and sometimes I was like, knowing it can work because we are two different and so, you know, it's even now it's still hard to really be sure. So so and I think now things are really too much uh uh painful and then it's it's it's it's over. It's too it's it's screws. everything else too distant Yeah, but everything is damaged. and it's's damaged forever.  Yeah. I mean let's go back. What was that that message I was gonna say?  It was like is it true, first of all, uh the thing that okay, two things. One is there is probably a process of view that you can get clarity on, which is I know that people don't like this idea of sin, but you mentioned it yourself like, and was I evil, right? Like, what are the things that you want Sin, right?  There's uh doing bad, right? Uh, but you don't we don't usually talk about these things or even say like I was a bad person or I did something bad, but we sometimes do things against ourselves, against our own better judgment, against what we think is beautiful or right, like sometimes we are the billionaires building things and and so maybe like one of the things that you can just get clear on is what are the what like what are the waves that I was that I don't want to ever be again? One, you know, I don't want to do XY or Z or I don't want to respond like however it was, right?  With um with avoidance and distancing saying, I don't want to, you know, and and then just like ask for forgiveness and forgive yourself, and then never do them again, you know? And instead of being clear, like was I evil or was I like was I? It just be clear for you.  It doesn't have to share with anybody. I just like decide, like these are the ways that I want to be and these are the ways I don't want to be. So instead of the lessons being a little blurry, make the lessons very clear, you know, make it very clear, and then I feel like you need some kind of very it feels like a decision should be completely closed and what you can do is say, you know, that relationship is done.  I'm going to take these lessons. I know who I want to be now. I know how I want to be in relationships. um you know, it could have been a beautiful relationship.  I don't think there's only one size fits all for relationships. I think the opportunities for loving there is this idea of oneness we talked about. And it's one of the things that I told myself is like, everyone has a heart and a and a soul that's worth loving.  It's coming from the one and it's in a lot of different people's bodies, right? If I allow myself, if somebody is like, I'm willing, why would I say no? Why don't I also try to be willing, right?  What can I do to help open that door, right? And and I had like the intuition and so we cultivated and we work on like developing a love relationship. It's not this idea of like she was in love or I wasn't in love.  It's just an opportunity for someone to open the door to their spirit was available to you, and you missed it, but everyone has a spirit. Every one you might find that opportunity you likely will find that opportunity again. right? Because I feel like when you just said, I missed it.  I feel like it. And I feel like uh there is the only one, the, you know, the the the love of my life, the only one, and and he's gone and it's over. No, no.  I don't I don't think that at all. I think I think basically like I mentioned, the way that I feel is that you can love it's. If somebody is opening their heart, like, I'm willing, and you're like, okay, well, am I willing?  And like I said, mentioned last week, it was like arranged marriages, you don't need arrange marriages. It's good to have practical things too. It's good to have um compatibility things too.  It's good to have sexual attraction, it's good to have all these other things. But then if someone's like yeah, like, I'm willing.. You willing.  Maybe it could be good, you know, like, I had these it's a feeling that I missed it. And there is one up there is nobody else, but uh but it's just a feeling and I feel like you and I uh I know that it's not true, but uh this is why I think live with this film. I think it's connected to the the regret and the remorse.  Right? So there's like this this um what is that? self-fl flagellation?  because I was bad explore this idea, you know it's it's kind of weird, but I have this masochistic, this note on my uh on my iPhone, which is called the C. Is it like understanding yourself? Yeah, yeah.  Like problems to analyze and uh some kind of introspection to try to find out and figuring out what's not working, what went bad, and uh I have this this idea of uh self uhician. I think this is why I was talking about accepting the lessons, digesting them and committing to never doing them again, asking forgiveness from you from God from whomever, from you as even maybe, it might be very cathartic to ask for forgiveness, if you can not ask to get back together, but just tell her, like, whatever it is, okay? Just ask for forgiveness. like's like I come and I ask for a forgiveness as if I wanted to to to feel better, you know?  Then do it for yourself, but what I'm what I'm seeing is if you don't forgive yourself here, you might maintain this potential I lost a love of my life and I'm never going to have this like again, uh kind of feeling, but I had some intritions that uh indicate indicated in indicated mirror that uh could be could be? Okay. The the idea of the one person is is interesting to to look into uh there there may be something about like some compatible people, but what does it mean for someone to be the one?  Where does that idea come from? versus there's many people and you know how many people find the one that are high school sweethearts, you know, they met in in college or whatever you want to call it. They fell in love.  They got married, and then they get a divorce, okay? Like, there life is hard and long and lots of things change. And there's many examples of this whole like I think that movies and culture shapes are understanding a lot of relationships.  And doing this whole movie historical analysis of like where do my ideas of love come from for yourself? uh, could be interesting. parents, movies. Yeah.  And and these stories but then also looking at it with the lens of like facts, right? Like you know, like even just this idea of what does falling in love mean? This is why I give you that book, because, you know, like there is there's and relationships and compatibility and all of these things that we're we're trying to navigate and is like living together, you know, like there's just people that they might love each other, but they have very incompatible lifestyles or whatever and and this is why I think like having this maybe the both eyes thing, like the pie chart and the uh feeling, it's like, okay, this does this make sense?  Is that person willing to gradually open their heart to me? And am I willing to do that with them and making love a process? And of course, like there could be a moment of intuition.  There could be a moment of like expansion and excitement and enthusiasm. But that just opens the door to the process. This is the thing.  I think people think that you fall in love and then that's it. Instead of viewing relationships as a craft, you know? And I think you have more of a discoverer than a craft perspective and it could be balanced a little bit more with the craft. to to fabricate to make to evolve to build together craft. craft is more like actually craft is the perfect balance between quantity and quality. because exactly. the potter making the pot, right?  It has a weight, it has specifics, they want to use the right amount of water with the right amount of clay, they measured, they mixed, right? But then when they get down to actually shaping it, it's still very precise ashemisymmmetric, but they are doing both the measurements and the feeling and the quality and the perception all at the same time. It's like You know?  And that's why I think craft is a great analogy and actually this is the analogy that I use for um how I want to do my uh my my programs and and um my trainings is to view it more of like a craft uh and putting things together with both your quality and your quantity at the same time. And of course, I'm just probably reinventing Taoism or something, but uh you know, they call it cho Have you heard of choiceless action? Wui?  Choiceless action? Yeah, it's called woo. It's, you know, you might hear it from what's his name?  uh, Bruce Lee, it's like acting without acting. Like, you're not thinking about punching, like a punch happens and it happens through you, and it's like a it's when you're in that space where maybe you could think of what way is what people do when they're in the zone, right? Where let's say that you're watching an Olympic athlete do a very complicated thing.  I don't think they're thinking about all the different steps because they've become the steps. and it's like an action that happens through them of them, and it's like craft of themselves in their bodies and whatever it is, right? Yeah. So it's called wui.  It's a Chinese like Taoist principle of it's called a choiceless action. as a one way of interpreting it. It was it would be like factories and industry and the opposite side, you have arts and in between craft. Yeah.  I think so. I think that's like a good description uh and I think though, like art and craft used to be more together. And then because of you know it's like when things get more extreme, uh there has to become a middle. you know, like Yeah, it's like here's and then like art yeah, and art just becomes weirder and weirder and less and less like yeah and then here's like industry and industry is just like getting super brutalist.  Everything is minimalist and art becomes like illegible and and kind of nonsense and what's the what that boyfriend that was making sound art when one of your cousins was dating this very tattooed guy and it doesn't matter. Well, you understand like this, so art art gets weird, okay? He he was dating one of your cousins, I think.  He's a nice guy. We saw him at some family reunions when we went to Bootzeg and saw your aunt. your grand.. Do you remember it?  Yeah So he's like moving our like way out I forget. He was a nice guy, okay? But like our life.  Yeah, it was out there. But like like you know when you go down to Mar Bell or lead and you walk by um some of these older houses and you just see like the tile work or the bricks and how they were made and like artisanship and art and practical life and uh artistic life weren't so disconnected. They were actually more harmonious.  And it was it's really beautiful to like think and then we go into modern buildings and modern life and it's an it's so funny. It's like um it's like oatmeal that you didn't mix, okay? You have the bland wall that's flats and modern and whatever, and then they hang a painting of some like really abstract art, you know, and it's it's like you have the industry of the building and the the weird art that moved all the way out this way, and then they try to mix it, but like in the middle is craft, you know, and it's you don't need to hang a you know, of course there's a lot of art in a church already, but like it's integrated into the building.  It's the windows. It's not a painting on a flat wall with like minimalist aluminum siding, you know? It's kind of interesting that there's this it's like what the balance, but they balance it by putting to extreme side by side instead of instead of like oil.s very interesting.  But this is what I think an artistic sensibility might be one of the ways that we can describe this, is the thing that we're trying to to activate here in the quality. If we talk about quality, if we talk about meaning, we talk about all this stuff. Like people might not relate.  But if we talk about like developing an artistic sensibility, you know, like to just see things more with like sense and meaning and metaphor and creativity and beauty and arts and stuff. That's hard to do for people that are not trained or not or in the opposite uh condition. And that they get trained to be more and more rational rational. oh yeah, you can't even tell a story.  What can we do this could be an interesting that's true. That's that's the problem. And it's hard when you realize it even when you realize it you try to say?  Yeah, try to it it's hard because you don't have a um I used to to read the books and how it works and uh the the The structure in the instruction, you. And so I don't have instructions to try to, yeah, andalyze my previous relationship, you know how to not uh know if it was wrong or good or yeah. Did you have this sense of quality?  Yeah. I think you might have already done it you keep a journal, like just a journal. That isn't about your patience.  Yeah. I not my patience, but uh uh my patients yes, but not me. So I think there is like good ways and not so good ways to do journaling.  I think, you know, I used to journal a lot um and one of the ways actually, maybe the next book I should give you is this one. It's called the artist's Way. and the key practice in the artist way is ad journaling, but it's in a very specific way. It's you start writing and you're not allowed to stop writing until you fill three pages, okay?  You're not allowed to stop or slow down, you're supposed to just start writing, and even if you don't know what to say, you could fill a whole page with I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what and it's totally fine. But it's called freewriting, okay? And once you do that.  And you trying to figure out what I shouldn't. But but usually, like you say like, okay, so today is Thursday, I'm just waking up. I feel a little tired.  I'm not sure what to write, but I'm gonna try. I'm doing this artist way thing. It's kind of interesting.  I'm not really sure if I'm can be creative. is like it really what what is creativity? Well, I guess I'm writing right now. Isn't that creative?  you know, like, you start with nonsense and then by the end, you'll see like it starts coming together. But you're not supposed to read it. You're supposed to take it, put it in an envelope and seal it for at least six months, okay?  The whole point is not to judge yourself, uh, to not think that it's important or that it's not important. The whole point is to turn on the engine of creativity. Just by writing three pages and not looking.  The rest of the book is is expanding on that, uh basic thing, um including how do you get artistic inspiration? And she recommends going on an artist date. So like, what's the place that is inspiring for you could be going to the mountains or the beach or a museum or a concert, whatever it is, like, what is something that actually charges you, creatively and inspiring you and do the morning pages, which is the journaling thing.  That's it. You don't need to read the book now, like, you're good. There's a lot of practices, there's a lot of things to do, but uh like week one, yeah, there's a whole process.  You know, maybe I should do that. I think it will. I can take it.  You need it? I'm thinking about doing it. Okay. you know missing?  Yeah, I've done done the process before. but I've been wondering what my craft is, you know, like we talk about being an artisan. and I think that is important for any human to have their job, to have their life, to have their family, but to have a craft. But what is it? Is it baking bread?  Is it writing books? Is it? I guess I do a lot of my craft, but like Yeah, I guess part of me is is between this half two and one two.  Like there's there's stuff that that wants to happen through me, right? uh foraging, you know, um that just happens. I'm like, wow, I'm foraging.  I love it. It's just, you know, like I walk with a baby foraging, looking for mushrooms. Oh yeah.  Okay, so foraging is on I want to. it's not even like I want to. It's like emerges, right? And then I have to like sometimes I wish I could draw better, you know, like I want to draw more.  I and but I I don't find the flow and the I'm not sure. So there's like there's something over here about drawing, you know, when I think about like my creativity. Like I want to like draw.  I want to make um stencils. And uh yeah, I guess I'm kind of doubting my craft because I don't know why I don't you know, I feel like a craft is a very personal thing and it has identity tied into it. And I identify more as somebody who, I guess writes poetry or or does drawing than as someone who's a baker.  But maybe I could change my mind about myself. I don't know. That's kind of craft on poetry and drawing..  Yeah. What what would you think is your craft that could be what could it be? in craft.  Yeah, like what is your artisal thing that brings quality and quantity? I think music, music, making or listening? Making, but it's uh like if I if I would uh do something.  Yeah, music. you play piano? You're pretty good. you know. Yeah.  I'm I think I will never do this because okay. Yeah, it's okay. But uh yeah, I that something I could uh like to to craft.  I think, you know, touching it at least once a week, bringing it into your life and and feelings and feeling what you feel. You know I, uh um practice uh uh um piano lessons when I uh finished my residence because I have time down and I was thinking about uh uh following piano lessons. You know, do you have a piano that you can play at home?  Like a keyboard or's house, but Yeah. Because I feel like one of the interesting things to explore for you is how you can explore doing it with feeling more than doing it right. And my intuition is to explore the idea of improvisation.  You know what I mean? It's just like a feeling or like a guess from me to say like you looking for a teacher when you already have some technical skills, like you know how to move around, you know how to play pieces. um but this idea that we're we're looking for is the feeling side, right? You can even you can turn piano into a quantity all of it, right?  You can. You can make it about getting it right, getting it perfect, getting it, you know, and you can force yourself and you could have the hierarchy, and you could have the power, you can you know, or you can try to figure out like what helps you feel in that moment. A along with the technical, along with the rights and along you know, like you have to stay in the scale, you know, and jazz is about like doing that, but then breaking it sometimes and coming back and then learning how to how to flow, right?  It might be an interesting thing for you to explore, like what is improvisation or just feeling mean for you in music. Yeah. Yeah, but uh improvisition I think I would do just uhap you know Yeah, that's fine.  No one's listening at least, you know. We'll get you a in the piano example, uh to for me to to try to to feel the more an emotion and try to do something like uh improvisation and uh and I wanted to be still ammonious, but uh can be because I'm not uh uh neither uh thing uh emotions that I can translate into uh movements and doing a not. So we can play so this is doing advice And now he's doing this?  He's actually playing the key. And on the opposite way doing a harm many technical There's a a band okay, so two things. One is, I think it might be interesting for you to try to bring your meditation and your piano in at the same time. like we talk about like and make themgistic.  Um, you can you're only allowed two keys, okay? middle finger thumb, okay? And then you get into your meditation and just play the two keys..  Yeah. I can also already imagine it right now, you know, like so I feel like maybe there's something there, maybe three keys. I don't know, like you but limit yourself, don't think about technicality, don't think about harmony, don't think about anything.  And there's this band that's calledawn of Mid. um, which has a uh album called disnomia. Let me see if we can find it on YouTube. Yeah, here, this is the full album.  I'll just share it with you.]]]",

Each layer builds on previous ones while adding new dimension of understanding.\n\nThis approach could help create the transition you're seeking by:\n- Making quality faculty recognizable and accessible\n- Providing historical/scientific context for skeptical minds\n- Offering practical tools for integration\n- Showing path forward through real examples\n- Maintaining balance between understanding and application\n\nWould you like me to expand on any aspect of this structure or explore how specific content might fit within it?",
