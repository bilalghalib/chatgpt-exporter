This is the SAME framework I've been using to analyze his conversations - but here he's applying it to himself through structured reflection. Stories include Tajul's agar wood processing (ihsan/excellence), craft fair trading, business relationships. This is one of the most significant CAPs in the corpus - deep meaning-making work.",
