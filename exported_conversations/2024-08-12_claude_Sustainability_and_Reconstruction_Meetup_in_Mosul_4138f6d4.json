Current state and practices:\no Climate smart materials: There is a lack of awareness among engineers and ministries\nabout the use of climate-smart materials. For example, for a participating company,\nit took three years to promote the use of plastic steel for plumbing.\no Imported Materials: Commonly imported materials include floors, windows, pipes,\nsteel, fibers, cements, ceramics, porcelain, and tiles. However, importing materials\nfaces challenges due to poor quality control and high testing costs handled by\nprivate labs.\n2. Challenges:\no Corruption: Corruption significantly affects the industry, particularly in registering\nfactories and obtaining necessary permits.\no Exchange rate: Fluctuations in the exchange rate create pricing instability. Prices do\nnot revert to original levels once increased.\n\no Banking system: Iraq's banking system is inefficient, with transfers taking 10-20\ndays, increasing costs and delaying projects. High fees and financial hurdles in\ninternational transactions complicate import processes.\no Consumer convincing: Convincing consumers of the benefits of modern materials\nand green energy is difficult, especially due to initial poor experiences with new\ntechnologies, e.g. solar energy.\no Transportation: Problems with transporting materials from outside Iraq add to the\nlogistical challenges.\no Quality Control: Absence of robust quality checkpoints at the borders or at the\nports which allows substandard and low-quality materials to access the country,\nwhich contributes to the widespread of low-quality materials in the market.\n3. Recommendations:\no Consumer awareness: Increase awareness through workshops and events,\nhighlighting the long-term benefits of green energy and modern materials.\no Government role: Government should implement laws to create industrial zones,\nsupport factories, and standardize green technologies for residential construction.\no Financial support: Provide financial incentives and easier access to finance for\nconsumers to adopt green energy solutions.\no Standards and qualifications: Develop and enforce standards for individual houses\nand ensure workers are properly qualified.\nName of the event: FGDs with Input suppliers and service providers – Supply-side\nDate and venue: 09/06, Venue: Arjaan Hotel - Erbil\nHighlights:\n• There is a clear growth in the adoption of solar energy, indicating a positive trend towards\nrenewable energy sources in Iraq.\n• The use of advanced isolation techniques and a focus on water reduction in construction\nreflects an increasing awareness of and response to environmental sustainability.\n• The lack of skilled technicians highlights a need for targeted educational programs and\ncertification processes to bridge the gap between engineering knowledge and practical\napplication.\n• Consumer behaviour focused on cost-saving over quality needs to be addressed through\ncomprehensive awareness campaigns that emphasize the long-term benefits and savings of\nquality installations.\n• Enhancing collaboration between the government, NGOs, and private sector can lead to more\neffective implementation of climate-smart solutions.\n• Developing robust training programs for applicators and technicians can ensure higher quality\ninstallations and greater consumer trust in these technologies.\n\n• Establishing clear quality standards for construction materials and providing financial\nincentives can stimulate the market for sustainable construction practices.\n• Streamlining the registration and import processes for businesses can reduce costs\nSummary:\n1. Current state\no Solar energy: Solar technologies are increasingly available and in demand in Iraq,\nwith a 50% rise in consumer interest in the last three years. Over 50 companies now\nwork with solar panels, up from a few in 2018.\no Isolation techniques: Focus on thermal and hydro isolation starting from basements\nto roofs, using different materials for each step.\no Water reduction: Innovations in materials aim to reduce water usage in\nconstruction by 50%.\no Companies indicated that efforts to raise awareness among individuals about\nclimate-smart construction solutions have shifted focus to applicators (installers)\nwho can educate consumers.\no The efficacy of isolation techniques is demonstrated through re-testing with thermo\ncameras.\no Training and certification programs are needed to improve the skills of technicians\nand applicators, who play a crucial role in the adoption of these technologies.\n2. Challenges:\no Quality and cost: A significant portion of consumers prioritize low costs over\nquality, which impacts the overall effectiveness and durability of the constructions.\no Technical workforce: There are enough engineers but a shortage of skilled\ntechnicians for installation, highlighting a gap in the workforce.\no Regulatory and logistical issues: Businesses face challenges in registration and\nimport processes, particularly in navigating the bureaucratic requirements and high\ntransport costs between different regions of Iraq.\no Government Support: Need for government and NGO intervention in cost-sharing,\nproviding loans, and setting quality control standards for imported materials.\n3. Recommendations:\no Consumer education: Consumers need to be informed about the long-term cost\nbenefits and dangers of not using proper insulation.\no Government policies: Implement minimum quality requirements for imported\nmaterials and support training programs for technicians.\no Incentives: Financial incentives, such as loans and subsidies, can encourage the\nadoption of climate-smart solutions.\no Promotion and outreach: Use social media, workshops, and direct engagement with\nengineers and applicators to spread awareness of the benefits of these\ntechnologies.\nRegional practices: Highlight the successful adoption of green energy in Saudi Arabia and\nGulf countries where higher initial costs lead to long-term savings. Governments in these\nregions offer incentives and partial loans for adopting green technologies.\n\nName of the event: FGDs with MSMEs – Supply-side\nDate and venue: 10/06, Venue: Mosul Space\nTakeaways and Highlights:\n• Main Projects: The primary projects discussed by the attendees involve residential houses and\napartment building. There is a trend towards shifting from horizontal to vertical expansion in\nIraq, due to the rapid population growth averages.\n• Migration Effects: During the displacement period (2014-2018), most residents of Mosul\nmoved to Erbil, where they became accustomed to residential complexes. These complexes\noffer several benefits, such as security, sustainability, and adequate space for families.\n• Modern Design Trends: There is a current trend towards implementing environmentally\nfriendly designs in homes due to the reduced size of residences compared to the past. Gardens\nare now often designed within the house instead of outside, with a good adoption rate.\n• Regulatory Non-Compliance: There is direct interaction between citizens and service providers\nwithout adhering to laws and regulations. Generally, contractors submit different layouts from\nthose actually constructed to municipalities, to ease obtaining construction permissions.\nApproximately 90% of the layouts with the municipality do not match the actual construction.\n• Discrepancies in the layouts (design): The discrepancies are mainly associated with the area.\nUsually, the municipality only checks on street cleanliness and verifies ownership documents\n– a situation that’s applicable to Iraq, but not Kurdistan, where inspections are more thorough.\nThe municipality does not strictly follow the original standards and regulations, due to\noutdated and stringent nature of them, which, if fully enforced, would make the acquiring of\nconstruction permissions very difficult.\n• Green Space Mismanagement: There is also improper investment in green spaces, with\nresidential complexes being built instead. Additionally, the selected locations are far from the\ncity centre and lack nearby services.\n• Outdated Government Tenders: The government tenders do not enforce the use of the newly\neco-friendly materials, which are sustainable. Corruption also influences the evaluation and\nstudy of these tenders, which is an issue.\n• Consultancy Requirements: Unlike in the Kurdistan Region, there’s no enforcement to assign\nconsulting offices to variety of construction projects in Mosul.\n• Skilled Labor: Mosul has a high availability of skilled labour at competitive prices, among the\nlowest in Iraq.\n• Energy Consumption: One-third of Iraq's electricity production is used for water heating in\nwinter due to outdated, energy-intensive water heaters. There are no regulations to control or\nspecify the standards of these devices during import and installation.\n\nSummary:\n1. Current state\no Solar energy: There’s a leap towards adopting the climate-smart practices,\nespecially the solar energy due to the high prices of electricity recently, despite\nbeing under ambition.\no Awareness: Citizens often spend significant amounts on luxurious house facades\ninstead of investing in energy-efficient modifications like solar panels.\n2. Challenges\no Cost and Material Prices: The rising cost of building materials is a major obstacle.\no Customer Awareness: Customers often reject modern solutions that may be costlier\ninitially but offer long-term benefits, preferring traditional materials and methods\ndue to cost concerns and lack of awareness. For example, ordinary blocks are cheaper\nthan insulated blocks – which is what many customers look at first.\no Direct Contracting: Many customers bypass engineering offices, opting for\ncontractors without engineering qualifications. Approximately 50% of middle-class\nhomes in Mosul are built without engineering office input, mainly due to a lack of\nawareness. Which of course, leads to several problems in the future in terms of the\nquality and safety of structure as well as the overuse of construction materials which\nimpose an extra cost.\no Obstacles to Modern Building Practices: The main obstacles to adopting modern\nbuilding practices, such as solar energy and thermal insulation, are twofold. The first\nobstacle is the high initial cost of equipping and implementing these technologies.\nThe second is cultural, as many people perceive solar energy as a luxury rather than\na necessity. Therefore, increasing awareness can lead to a positive and fundamental\nchange in this area.\no Trust Issues: Another barrier is the lack of trust between citizens and companies\nproviding these modern technologies, largely due to their limited use in residential\nsettings.\n3. Recommendations and Suggestions\no Mandatory Consultancy: A consulting body should be appointed for every project,\nwhether state or privately funded, to ensure the safety and quality of construction\nacross Iraq.\no Construction Permits: Address the issue of building permits, especially for areas less\nthan 200 square meters, though the impact of such a solution remains uncertain.\no Updating Construction Laws: Local building laws should be updated to be more\nflexible and aligned with market realities.\no Public Awareness on the use of Engineering offices/engineers: There should be\nefforts to educate citizens on the positive role of engineers and engineering firms in\nconstruction. The misconception that hiring professionals increases costs should be\ncountered, emphasizing that professional input ensures sustainability and cost\nefficiency.\n\no Promoting Sustainable Practices: Engineering offices should actively educate clients\non the benefits of sustainable building practices, such as solar energy, rather than\nfocusing solely on costs.\no Incentives for Solar Energy: To encourage the adoption of solar energy, installations\nshould be offered on installment plans with government support, tailored to\nconsumption levels. This could serve as a temporary alternative to the widespread\nprivate generators in Iraq, which considered one of the most contributors to\nincreased GHG emissions in Iraq.\no Promoting Success Stories: Sharing successful case studies and stories of\nadopting modern and sustainable construction practices and their positive\nenvironmental and financial impacts can significantly contribute to increasing the\nadoption of these technologies, especially in the Mosul province.\nITC-BEIT\nAGENDA\nName of the event: FGDs with MSMEs – Supply-side\nOverview: This focus group discussion aims to define the sector scope, refine and validate the\nsector value chain, identify competitiveness constraints, and discuss potential solutions to key\nchallenges faced by MSMEs involved in construction services for housing.\nDate: 06/06, Venue: Babylon Hotel in Baghdad\nDate: 10/06, Venue: Mosul -Space\nTime Session\n09:00 - 09:10\nWelcome and introductory remarks\nSetting the context: Explain BEIT background and overall objective of this exercise.\nThank them for their participation and encourage them to be as active as possible.\n09:10-09:30\nIce-Breaker\nAsk participants to introduce themselves and share about the type of work they do.

These include support for the improvement of capacities of firms, the efficiency of value\nchains, and environment to access and operate in the construction and housing sectors in Iraq. Due to their\ndynamism, MSMEs in particular stand to make a major contribution to the improvement of the housing sector and\nwill be assisted in this through project’s activities on strategy design and implementation, local organisation, and\ntraining and capacity building. ITC’s experience in working with the private sector and other stakeholders, and\nfacilitating public-private collaboration on strategy design and implementation, firm-level capacity building, value\nchain coordination, and trade and investment policy and regulatory reform, and trade and investment to drive\nsustainable and inclusive growth will be leveraged in implementing these elements of the project. Specific attention\nwill be given to ensuring that safety standards and disaster resilience are promoted.\n4.5.3 OUTCOME THREE: OUTPUTS AND ACTIVITIES\nOutput 3.1: Strengthened partnership between Iraqi public and private stakeholders to design and implement a\ngreen sustainable construction sector development strategy.\nA sustainable sector development strategy is needed to provide a solid basis for a strengthened construction sector\nby setting common policy priorities and coordinating key actors. In order to maximise the impact of the strategy, the\nproject includes activities under Output 3.1 on value chain analysis, participatory strategy design, the establishment\nor strengthening of an effective public-private sector coordination structure responsible for implementation,\ntechnical and advisory on implementation management including monitoring and resource mobilization.\nThe strategy will be comprehensive in scope, addressing the development of products and services directed at\nincreasing productivity, promoting investment, nurturing innovation, enhancing value addition, and improving the\ninstitutional and regulatory environment.\nThe strategy will address issues that constrain competitiveness and private sector development, while ensures that\ndevelopmental objectives are targeted. To this end, the strategy design process will follow an inclusive and\nparticipative approach to ensure that all stakeholders are consulted and have ownership over the resulting strategy\nand implementation plan. Women empowerment considerations will be incorporated into the analysis of challenges\nand opportunities throughout the sector development strategy, highlighting the needs and priorities of women-led\nMSMEs and key recommendations. To this end, women-led MSMEs and relevant public and private sector\norganisations representing women in the private sector will be consulted and interviewed during the strategy design\nprocess. Through this approach, the strategy will reflect their needs and priorities by elaborating specific and tailored\nrecommendations in the action plan.\nFindings and recommendations from other existing endorsed plans will be integrated and further developed. A\ncapacity-building approach will be adopted along the process, with the aim of strengthening the capacity of national\npartners to formulate, manage and implement their own strategy.\n53\nThe project will work with stakeholders to design the detailed strategy, including a five-year plan of action, that\nallocates responsibilities, and specifies timelines and targets. As a result, the Government of Iraq will own a strategy\nfor the construction sector that is specific and measurable to ensure well-managed implementation, accountability,\nand that the desired results are achieved. These activities will be delivered directly through the project, with the\npotential involvement of external experts in an advisory capacity.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.1.1: Define strategy design process, roles, including the focal point organization and person, and work\nplan.\nDefine strategy design process, roles, including the focal point organization and persons, and develop a work plan.\nThis includes the identification and appointment of a Navigator to champion the design and delivery of the strategy\nfor the construction sector. The Navigator is usually respected individual, likely a senior official from the public sector\nfrom the relevant Ministry or from the Prime Minister’s office, who is appointed to the management of the strategy\nfor the duration of the design process.\nIn collaboration with project partners, this activity would entail as well the identification (or formation) of a sector-\nlevel coordination platform to guide the strategy design process and subsequent implementation. This coordination\nmechanism will guide the process of strategy design and ultimately take responsibility for guiding its\nimplementation. This continuity encourages the development of realistic and useful planning for the sector’s future.\nWhere possible, synergies will be sought with other areas of project governance in the establishment of this\nmechanism.\nActivity 3.1.2: Conduct comprehensive background research on the structure and functioning of the value chain,\nincluding in-depth quantitative and quality analysis of MSMEs’ participation in the sector, and of market access\nand trends for the sector.\nConduct comprehensive background research on the structure and functioning of the construction value chain,\nincluding an in-depth quantitative and quality analysis of MSMEs’ participation in the sector, and of market access\nand trends for the sector.\nThis activity will build on the analysis conducted for the project development, as well as relevant assessments to be\ncarried out during the inception phase by all partners. This includes a comprehensive analysis of the policy\nframework, to ensure alignment with the strategy and avoid potential duplications. A further identification will be\ncarried out of public sector, private sector, and other actors, including development partners that are directly\nengaged in the housing and construction value chain and in establishing the environment in which these actors\noperate.\nFurther assessments will include analysis of production, processing and market related data for the sector, as well\nas its impact on socio-economic development. An in-depth analysis of MSME’s participation of the sector may\ninclude a survey of firms to understand their key characteristics, challenges to compete, connect among each other\nand with supporting institutions and to upgrade their practices.\nA first value chain map and initial analysis that identifies major constraints and highlights the most promising\nopportunities, particularly to increase MSME participation and entry points for youth participation, innovation and\nsustainability of the sector will be produced. The project’s cross-cutting themes related to inclusive and sustainable\ngrowth will be central to this research.\nExpert advice may be sought here and at later stages in the strategy design process on sector research and the\ndevelopment of specific activities and targets for the strategy’s plan of action.\nThe output will be a preliminary sector diagnostic which will be presented, discussed and refined during the first\nconsultation with stakeholders.\nActivity 3.1.3: Consultation with sector stakeholders (public and private sector) to present, refine and validate the\nsector diagnostics and propose initial solutions.\n54\nStakeholders representing various aspects of the construction value chain will meet to discuss and agree on a\ncommon vision and way forward for strengthening economic opportunities, sustainability, and housing affordability.\nIf possible, this will be done through a single discussion in order to foster consensus-building, though smaller group\ndiscussions may be used with ongoing communication with participants to validate evolving conclusions. The\nbackground research on value chain structure, challenges, and opportunities will be used to structure the\ndiscussions, though participants will be invited to challenge these preliminary findings. The consultation aims to\nachieve broad-based agreement on the vision for the strategy and main areas of work to be encompassed.\nStakeholders will be actively involved throughout the consultations which are comprised of ITC-facilitated capacity-\nbuilding and decision-making sessions.\nThe consultation will be highly practical and results-oriented in nature. It is deliberately structured this way so that\nupon the conclusion of the consultations, material is produced that feeds directly into the Construction Strategy.\nOutputs of the first consultation are as follows:\n• Definition of the sector scope,\n• Refining and validating the sector value chain,\n• Identifying competitiveness constraints,\n• Identify and discuss potential solutions to key challenges.\nActivity 3.1.4: Development of a detailed plan of action for the strategy, including entry points for greater MSME\nparticipation, closing the skills gaps, developing business models and measures to foster the adoption of\nsustainable practices.\nThe background research and outcomes of the first stakeholder consultation will be consolidated and used in further\nelaborating the strategic orientations and specific recommendations that can contribute to enhance MSME\nparticipation and performance in the sector, as well as activities that address supply-side, business environment and\nmarket entry issues, as well as development side challenges. These actions will be explored as responses to particular\nchallenges identified by sector stakeholders. Recommendations would also include entry points for greater MSME\nparticipation, closing the skills gaps, developing business models and measures to foster the adoption of sustainable\npractices.\nActivity 3.1.5: Second consultation for the validation of the strategy to refine the strategic orientations and\nactivities of the plan of action, as well as to validate the coordination body to oversee and guide the\nimplementation.\nThe second consultation for the validation of the strategy to develop and further refine the strategic orientations\nand activities of the plan of action, as well as to validate the coordination body to oversee and guide implementation.\nBringing together again the stakeholders involved in the first consultation, the second consultation will focus on the\ndetails of the draft actions included, the inclusion of new actions, and the removal of unnecessary actions. The goal\nof the second consultation is therefore to reach broad-based agreement on the structure and content of the\nstrategy’s plan of action. This support improves the design and its relevance to the sector, in addition to beginning\nto build necessary momentum for its implementation.\nThe plan of action has a 5-year timeline. Since recommendations and strategic orientations are necessary but not\nsufficient, the plan of action systematically highlights next steps required to implement the strategy and outlines a\ntimeline for implementing those steps. In addition, the Plan of Action identifies organizations responsible for\nimplementing the highlighted actions. Project ideas derived from the action plan deliver key entry points for\ngovernment action, private sector support and development partners. To ensure successful implementation,\noutreach and donor mobilization are built into the design process.\nActivity 3.1.6: Presentation of the way forward to the sector-level coordination body for validation.\n55\nThe way forward will describe the core elements of the strategy at the level of the vision and strategic objectives,\nwith context on the challenges being addressed and concerns of contributing stakeholders. The validation of the way\nforward by the sector-level coordination platform, confirms the general scope and priorities of the strategy, as well\nas the support of the key stakeholders involved in the coordination body. This ensures that the vision is achievable\nand properly aligned with relevant development initiatives.\nActivity 3.1.7: Finalization and validation of Iraq’s construction sector strategy, followed by an official launch\nceremony.\nWhere needed, adjustments will be made to the strategy following the recommendations of the coordination body\nand other relevant stakeholders in order to enhance its relevance to sector goals and to best support the effective\nimplementation of the strategy. The strategy will be available in English and Arabic.\nTo ensure the strategy mobilizes national and international support required for its implementation, the lead\nministry, with ITC’s technical support, will seek high-level endorsement. In this manner, the Plan of Action will obtain\nthe commitment of the government to allocate the necessary resources and responsibilities for its implementation.\nThe endorsement of the strategy will be followed by an official launch ceremony to ensure visibility and gain\nmomentum towards implementation.\nActivity 3.1.8: Support to define and operationalize a public-private sector coordination structure to manage the\nimplementation of the strategy.\nA key success criterion for success of strategy will be the country’s ability to coordinate activities, monitor progress\nand mobilize resources for its implementation. To this end, the project’s support will contribute to defining and\noperationalizing an adequate governance structure, e.g. sector coordination committee, to build collaboration.\nIncluding the main organisations responsible for the plan’s actions, the sector strategy coordination body will be\nestablished as the body responsible for overseeing the implementation process. This will include coordinating\ninitiatives and may require their leadership in adapting the strategy as needed and in consultation with stakeholders.\nActivity 3.1.9: Capacity strengthening, including coaching to national sector coordination body and its Secretariat.\nSuccessful implementation management of a strategy ensures that all relevant institutions and partners are enabled\nto implement activities within a coherent framework. Accordingly, strategy implementation management support\nfocuses assisting such a framework and providing specialized tools and advice to ensure successful implementation\nand monitoring of activities outlined in the Plan of Action (PoA) of the Strategy. The project’s intervention will aim\nto capacitate the Secretariat of the established sector coordination structure, so as to guarantee that initiatives\nimplemented are aligned to the priorities of the stakeholders as defined in the strategy. Technical assistance and\ncapacity building will be provided as required. Tools and organisational best practices in achieving strategy\nimplementation will be shared with the coordination body to support tracking, resource mobilisation, sector\ncoordination, and management of responsibilities in the implementation process.\nOutput 3.2: Improved opportunities and capacities of supply chain actors for private sector-led affordable, quality\nconstruction and climate-adaptive buildings retrofit.\nBuilding on the findings of the strategy design process, Output 3.2 will support enhanced coordination among small\nbusinesses in the construction sector in order to enhance their performance. The organisation of value chain actors\nin MSME alliances in two governorates through the project will assist smaller firms in accessing new markets, reduce\ncosts and improve firm-level capacities through enhanced information sharing and economies of scale. This\ncooperation will provide a model demonstrating the means and benefits of organisation. Output 3.2 activities on\norganising local MSME alliances in high-potential areas, local-level planning, design and technical solutions in\nconstruction, and organisational capacity building will provide a basis for cooperation among firms. ITC has\nexperience on training MSMEs on resource efficiency and circular production resulting in reduction in GHG emissions\nover a multi-annual process, increased productivity, cost reduction and enhanced compliance with environmental\nstandards and regulations. Through the coaching programme on Resource Efficiency and Circular Production (RECP),\nITC will build the capacity of construction MSMEs to optimize the use and management of resources (water, energy,\nchemicals and waste) and identify solutions to make production processes greener. The ITC RECP coaching\n56\nprogramme has been implemented in over 15 countries and 10 value chains and can be adapted to serve any\nproductive sector. Active collaboration and dialogue between value chain actors – including international companies\nand local suppliers – is facilitated through this approach to ensure joint implementation of resource-efficient and\ncleaner production practices.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.2.1: Climate-Smart Housing Retrofit Consumer Research, Product-Market combination, and selection of\ntarget areas.\nBuilding on activities under output 3.1, ITC and partners plan to conduct market research on climate-smart housing\nretrofit solutions and affordable housing construction in Iraq, with a focus on energy efficiency and climate\nadaptation, particularly in high-temperature environments. The research will identify options for new retrofit\nproducts to be offered by MSMEs in the fields of energy-efficient appliances / air conditioning, water efficiency, heat\ninsulation, and renewable energy solutions within an affordable budget range (e.g. $5,000 - $10,000 package\nincluding installation cost). In the same time consumers assessment will identify the most relevant areas for project\nintervention while setting clear selection criteria balancing vulnerability and market requirements. Possible\npartnership to serve housing fund recipients will be also explored (e.g. housing fund beneficiaries). These insights\nwill inform subsequent activities under outputs 3.2 and 3.3, empowering local SMEs to offer tailored, cost-effective,\nand sustainable solutions to address climate challenges while fostering economic growth in the construction and\nenergy sectors.\nActivity 3.2.2: Organize market awareness events on innovative climate-smart services and establish MSME\nalliances to enhance collaboration, knowledge sharing, and collective bargaining power, strengthening the sector.\nThis multifaceted activity will create two local associations of construction MSMEs (“Alliances”) that will be both\nconnected with construction material / innovative climate-smart solution suppliers, relevant service providers (e.g\narchitectural design services, housing finance) and potential consumers. By creating these alliances, we aim to\nprovide smaller firms with a platform to collectively address challenges, share insights, and negotiate more\neffectively in areas such as procurement and market access. Under this activity, steps will also be taken to stimulate\nconsumer demand for innovative retrofit products, encourage local Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)\nin the construction sector to invest in this evolving business model, and establish strategic connections with both\ninternational and national construction material suppliers. These suppliers will play a pivotal role in ensuring the\navailability of innovative materials at competitive prices as well as training MSMEs on the proper techniques to use\nthe material, respecting required standards.\nActivity 3.2.3: Develop two inclusive, locally-tailored sustainable construction sector development plans,\nemphasizing energy efficiency and eco-friendly practices.\nITC will actively engage local construction MSMEs and community representatives in target areas to develop\nsustainable development plans. These plans will prioritize energy-efficient and eco-friendly practices through clear\ngoal-setting, actionable steps, and capacity-building initiatives. They will also promote respect of construction\nstandards, safety and disaster resilience. We will identify specific needs for training and material support through\ncomprehensive needs assessments. Ongoing monitoring and documentation will ensure adaptability and provide\nvaluable insights for the construction sector's long-term sustainability in these areas. These plans will be aligned with\nthe national strategy devised under 3.1 and will support its implementation locally.\nActivity 3.2.4: Definition of the technical designs for the climate-adaptive retrofit products and associated quality\nstandards and certification processes in partnership with government and private sector.\nThe implementation of this activity involves a collaborative effort bringing together local and international\narchitects, builders, material suppliers, academia, government, and other stakeholders. This collective initiative will\nbuild on the market opportunities and possible options identified under 3.2.1 to develop climate-smart and cost-\neffective technical designs and packages tailored for Iraqi Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to retrofit\nexisting buildings. These designs may encompass various sustainability elements, including enhanced insulation,\nenergy efficiency, sealing, shade structures, natural ventilation, reflective painting, cool roofing, and solar energy\n57\nsolutions. The goal is to create standardized and pre-agreed fixed-cost packages making sustainable retrofitting\naccessible and affordable for MSMEs while addressing climate challenges. To ensure technical quality, the initiative\nincludes the establishment of rigorous standards, certifications, checklists, and validation processes.\nActivity 3.2.5: Creation of an incentive program and social marketing for the adoption of the climate adaptation\nretrofit packages by consumers.\nMore than 200 households are set to benefit from climate-adaptive housing retrofit packages delivered by MSME\nmembers of the Alliances, showcasing their tangible value and the economic returns achieved through energy\nefficiency savings. To encourage early adoption and utilize these initial households as model homes to convince\nneighbours, we will introduce an incentive program covering 50% of the retrofit costs for the first 50 families in each\narea during the first year. This incentive will gradually decrease to 25% in the second year and will be phased out\nentirely after year three. Additionally, specific marketing efforts will be deployed to raise awareness, generate\ninterest, and demonstrate the economic returns of this sustainable investment to the broader community.\nActivity 3.2.6: Support to commercial delivery of the housing retrofit packages by local Alliance MSMEs building\non capacity strengthening effort under output 3.3 and quality insurance and certification mechanisms set under\nactivity 3.2.4.\nThis activity focuses on providing comprehensive support to the commercial delivery of housing retrofit packages by\nlocal Alliance Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Building upon the capacity strengthening efforts\noutlined in Output 3.3 and guided by the quality assurance and certification mechanisms established in Activity 3.2.4,\nthis activity ensures that trained MSMEs and young entrepreneurs possess the necessary skills to proficiently\nimplement the retrofit packages developed under Activity 3.2.4. Collaborative partnerships with material suppliers\nare integral, facilitating the exchange of expertise and technical standards required for effective package installation.\nAdditionally, a robust certification mechanism, a product of Activity 3.2.4, guarantees that only certified installers\nare engaged and that external verification maintains the quality of installation at the highest standards. This\ncoordinated approach reinforces the successful and reliable commercial delivery of housing retrofit solutions while\nbolstering the capacity of local enterprises and entrepreneurs.\nOutput 3.3: Strengthened capacities of local businesses, particularly young entrepreneurs, for the integration of\ngreen and innovative practices in their operation.\nOutput 3.3 of the project focuses on strengthening the capacity of local businesses, with a particular emphasis on\nyoung entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This output recognizes\nthe importance of enhancing the skills and knowledge of entrepreneurs to drive sustainability and innovation within\nthe local business landscape. Here are some key points and strategies outlined in this output:\nThe project acknowledges that small businesses, especially micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs),\nare vital components of the local economy. Therefore, efforts will be directed towards these businesses to help them\nbuild capacity in sustainable and innovative practices with a specific focus on youth.\nTo achieve the desired outcomes, the project will work on reinforcing the portfolio of business development service\nproviders. These providers will offer training, coaching, and mentoring services to young entrepreneurs and small\nbusinesses particularly in areas such as climate smart solutions, and innovative construction technology, among\nothers. An important aspect of this output is the exposure to good practices from peers. This learning from both\ninstitutional and company-level peers can be invaluable in helping entrepreneurs understand and implement\nsustainable and innovative practices effectively. The project will ensure a close look at reaching out to relevant\npartners. The project recognizes the role of youth in economic empowerment and job creation. It aims to not only\nsupport new entrepreneurs but also provide existing MSMEs with the necessary skills to grow. This involves\ncollaboration with sector stakeholders and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) providers.\nTo stay relevant and meet the evolving demands of the market, the project will focus on better aligning current TVET\nprograms with the specific needs of businesses. This ensures that the training provided is practical and directly\napplicable to the industry and the value chain analysis will feed this process.\n58\nCollaboration and partnerships will be key to the success of this output. These partnerships may involve recognized\nmultinational corporations, training institutions, and other industry stakeholders. Such collaborations can facilitate\nknowledge transfer, keep pace with market changes, and help build skills that align with the identified value chains.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.3.1: Design and implement short modular competency-based trainings for professionals on new\naffordable house construction, repairs, resource efficiency, financial literacy.\nThis activity is focused on designing and implementing short modular competency-based training programs for\nprofessionals in the areas of new affordable house construction, repairs, resource efficiency, and financial literacy.\nThis activity aims to provide targeted and practical training to professionals, equipping them with the knowledge\nand skills needed for sustainable and innovative practices in these areas. The first step in this activity involves\nidentifying key stakeholders who will be involved in the design and implementation of the training programs. These\nstakeholders may include experts in energy efficiency, construction, repair, and financial literacy, as well as\nrepresentatives from relevant institutions and organizations. Focus group discussions will be conducted to gather\ninsights and inputs from professionals to shape the content of such training. Based on the insights gained from focus\ngroup discussions and in collaboration with key stakeholders, the project will co-design the training modules. That\ncould cover various topics, such as: new affordable house construction techniques that emphasize sustainability and\nresource efficiency; repair and maintenance practices that reduce environmental impact; strategies for improving\nresource efficiency in construction and repair projects; Financial literacy modules. Training modules on financial\nliteracy may be customized based on existing materials or resources, or they can be developed in collaboration with\nrelevant partners who specialize in financial education. The roll out of these materials will have an objective of 200\nusers.\nActivity 3.3.2: Develop partnerships with construction material supplier, universities, and innovators to\nmainstream climate smart solutions in Iraq.\nThis activity focuses on the development of strategic partnerships with various stakeholders to promote and\nmainstream climate-smart solutions in Iraq's construction sector. This activity recognizes the importance of\ncollaboration with key players in the value chain to drive sustainability and innovation. The first step in this activity\nis to engage with relevant stakeholders in the construction and housing sector that were already identified as part\nof the value chain analysis. These stakeholders may include construction material suppliers, universities, innovators,\nand other organizations that play a role in the value chain. Once key stakeholders are identified, the project will\nwork on establishing partnerships with them. These partnerships can take various forms, including: sharing of\neducational resources related to climate-smart solutions and sustainable construction practices; access to cutting-\nedge technologies, materials, and solutions that promote sustainability in construction. Collaboration with\nuniversities or incubators can involve supporting research and innovation projects related to climate-smart\nconstruction solutions. In addition to partnerships with stakeholders directly involved in the construction sector, this\nactivity may extend collaboration to Financial Service Providers (FSPs) at the national or international levels. Building\nand maintaining strong partnerships is an ongoing process. The project will focus on nurturing these relationships,\nfostering collaboration, and ensuring that the partnerships remain productive and mutually beneficial over time.\nActivity 3.3.3: Co-establish pilot training sites and model houses using innovative affordable green techniques in\ncollaboration with UN-Habitat\nITC will collaborate with UN-Habitat (under Output 2.6) to establish pilot training sites and model houses. This\nactivity will showcase innovative and affordable green techniques. These sites serve as practical learning\nenvironments and examples for students, professionals, and the community at large. The project will collaborate\nclosely with a range of stakeholders, including locally established vocational training centers, private sector partners,\nuniversities, incubators, practitioners, and relevant government ministries. The objective of this multi stakeholder\nengagement is to create physical spaces where innovative and affordable green techniques are put into practice.\nThese pilot training sites and model houses will serve as living examples of sustainable construction and design. The\nproject team, in consultation with experts and stakeholders, will select specific green techniques and practices that\nalign with the project's goals. These techniques may include energy-efficient building methods, sustainable\n59\nmaterials, renewable energy integration, waste reduction, and water conservation, among others. Physical locations\nfor the pilot training sites and model houses will be identified and secured. The pilot training sites will serve as hands-\non learning environments for students and professionals. Training programs and educational activities will be\nconducted on-site to demonstrate and teach the application of green techniques. This can include workshops,\nseminars, and practical demonstrations. The model houses and pilot sites will act as showcases for innovative and\naffordable green solutions. They will demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of these techniques, encouraging\nbroader adoption within the construction industry and community.\nActivity 3.3.4: Strengthen the capacities of key support organizations working with MSMEs particularly youth-led\ncompanies with new services particularly in entrepreneurship and financial literacy.\nActivity 3.3.4 focuses on strengthening the capacities of key support organizations that work with Micro, Small, and\nMedium Enterprises (MSMEs), particularly those led by young entrepreneurs. This activity aims to provide these\nsupport organizations with the necessary tools and resources to offer new and improved services, with a specific\nfocus on entrepreneurship and financial literacy. Here's a breakdown of the key components of this activity: Support\nwill be provided to selected organizations to enhance their operational and service delivery capacities in the above-\nmentioned areas. These services may include mentoring and coaching for young entrepreneurs, workshops on\nbusiness planning and management, access to financial education, and assistance in securing financing. Efforts will\nbe made to foster collaboration and synergies among different support institutions. This ensures complementarity\nand shared efforts in supporting the competitiveness of the value chain and promoting entrepreneurship and\nclimate-smart solutions. Collaboration may involve joint initiatives, knowledge sharing, and resource pooling.\nActivity 3.3.5: In collaboration with local alliances create a system of certified trainees, a repository, regular\nnetworking events, and associated marketing.\nThis activity aims at establishing a system to certify trainees, create a repository of resources, organize regular\nnetworking events, and implement associated marketing efforts in collaboration with local alliances. This activity is\ncrucial for sustaining and expanding the impact of the project's efforts to strengthen the capacity of local businesses,\nespecially young entrepreneurs, in integrating green and innovative practices into their operations. This component\ninvolves setting up a certification process for individuals who have completed the training and capacity-building\nprograms offered as part of the project. A repository or database will be created to store training materials, guides,\nmanuals, case studies, and other resources related to green and innovative practices. This repository will serve as a\nvaluable knowledge base for trainees, professionals, and entrepreneurs seeking information and guidance. Effective\nmarketing efforts will be put in place to promote the project's activities, training programs, and networking events.\nMarketing strategies may include digital and traditional marketing channels, outreach to local media, and leveraging\npartnerships with local alliances to reach a wider audience.\nOutput 3.4: Improved regulatory and legal framework for access to and provision of construction and housing\nservices in Iraq.\nAn enabling framework for service providers (businesses and investors) to engage in construction and housing\nservices in Iraq has the potential to contribute to improvements in housing affordability and sustainability, including\nthrough the more active involvement of MSMEs in these sectors.\nAccess to construction and housing services and effective functioning of such service providers is instrumental to\naddressing Iraq’s housing crisis. Increasing opportunities for service providers in this sector to operate in Iraq and\nthe functioning of various service providers in this space would allow for a more competitive sector – thus creating\nthe impetus for better quality and competitively priced services within the housing and construction sector in Iraq.\nA preliminary assessment revealed restrictions in the ability of service providers in this sector to operate across the\nmodes of supply of services (i.e. the four modes through which services are traded: Cross-border trade – Mode 1;\nConsumption abroad - Mode 2; Commercial presence – Mode 3; and Temporary movement of natural persons –\nMode 4). Restrictions were identification in the context of the setting up a commercial presence in the country,\naccessing services abroad, and bringing in foreign labour/skills needed for these services. Among others, regulatory\nchallenges identified include the disjunct between the legal framework and practical implementation creating space\n60\nfor uneven implementation of laws and informal mechanisms; restrictions in foreign participation in the sector,\nability for foreign ownership of land, and the lack of harmonization and coordination of procurement practices.\nActivities to strengthen the regulatory and legal framework on market access for construction and housing services\nin the country under Output 3.4 will assist with policy mapping, analysis and planning, dialogue and implementation\nthrough targeted capacity building and the organisation of suitable platforms for discussion and coordination. Across\nthese activities, the sharing of international expertise and best practices will be led by local stakeholders to address\ntheir concerns, progress towards the goals they set as priorities, and match the capacities of implementing\ninstitutions.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.4.1: Undertake detailed mapping of regulatory and legislative measures governing the (a) entry and\noperation of service providers in the housing and construction sectors in Iraq (including in terms of access to set\nup/engage in operations, engagement of foreign professionals, operation and participation in public-private\npartnerships in the sector), and (b) bidding/qualifying for procurement offers in housing and construction related\nprojects (including in terms of the process adopted to prepare, issue, and evaluate tenders, and award contracts).\nThe mapping of Iraq’s regulatory and legislative measures is a necessary first step to undertake a regulatory\nassessment of Iraq’s construction and housing sector (Activity 3.4.2). The mapping will include both horizontal and\nsectoral laws and regulations governing these sectors. Horizontal laws are those which apply to all service providers\n(such as investment law, companies act, labour laws, immigration laws, land law, procurement etc.), which are likely\nto include restrictions on transfer of funds, limitations on movement of people, caps on foreign equity participation,\netc.; while the sectoral laws covered those which govern the particular industry (such as construction law), as well\nas at the sector-specific level which govern particular activities (such as the practice of architecture and engineering).\nThe objective of the mapping is to collect and tabulate all the regulations and legislations that impact Iraq’s in\npreparation to undertake the regulatory assessment. Building upon the preliminary mapping undertaken,\nconsultations will be undertaken with relevant stakeholders to confirm/validate the laws/regulations/measures\nidentified and ensure that all relevant measures governing this sector including any provincial level\nregulations/measures are covered in the mapping.\nActivity 3.4.2: Conduct regulatory impact assessments for the regulatory/legal measures governing the entry and\noperation of service providers in the housing and construction sectors in Iraq (identified from the mapping\nengagement above).\nThe objective of this activity is to critically assess the effects of proposed and existing regulations (drawn from the\nmapping exercise in Activity 3.4.1) in order to ensure that regulations are efficient and effective to achieve the overall\nobjective. This is because certain laws such as the regulation placing limits on foreign participation in the market,\nfunction as a trade restrictive measure and therefore impact on services and investments in Iraq. Policy makers\nshould assess, when designing policies/laws/regulations, the likely impacts and consequences of such measures, and\nregulatory impact assessments are a useful framework that can be adopted to assess regulations and ensure that it\nmeets the overarching objectives.\nAccordingly, through this activity, ITC will support relevant stakeholders in Iraq to develop a framework for\nundertaking regulatory impact assessments in the abovementioned sectors, drawing from the ‘OECD’s Best Practice\nPrinciples for Regulatory Policy’. (Capacity building based on this framework will be undertaken in Activity 3.4.3\nbelow).\nBased on this framework, ITC will work with relevant institutions to select key laws/regulations/policies, as mapped\nin Activity 3.4.1 above, and assess the impact of these measures so as understand whether it achieves the intended\nobjectives and how it impacts the operation of construction and housing services and investments into this sector.\nBased on these assessments, and demand from the Government of Iraq, technical assistance can then be provided\nto support Iraq’s policy makers to undertake necessary policy and regulatory reforms.\n61\nActivity 3.4.3 Provide capacity building for officers in relevant institutions on undertaking regulatory impact\nassessments – to be applied for future regulatory developments – including through development of a technical\nguide and practical training sessions.\nGuidelines will be formulated based on the strategy discussed above on undertaking regulatory impact assessments\nfor the construction/housing sector related laws/regulations/policies. These guidelines will serve to function as a\ntoolkit that can be used for officers for existing and future laws/regulations/policies – with the objective of\ncontribution to efforts to promote evidence-based policy making.\nCapacity building sessions will be organized for relevant institutions based on these guidelines; and practical sessions\nheld with relevant officers by working with ITC on the selected measures for the assessment under Activity 3.4.2.\nActivity 3.4.4: Undertake diagnostic assessment of the alignment of the procurement framework governing\nconstruction and housing sectors with international guidelines/best practices governing transparency, integrity,\nand accountability of procurement processes.\nPreliminary analysis undertaken revealed a lack of harmonization and coordination on procurement practices across\ngovernment organizations – with regard to procurement, methods, information contained in tender documents,\nadvertising periods, etc. With regards to procurement within the construction and housing sectors, it is important\nfor strong coordination and alignment between the activities of the Ministry of Planning and Development\nCooperation (which is the main agency responsible for public contracts in Iraq) and the Ministry of Construction,\nHousing and Public Municipalities (which oversees procurement of construction services). An assessment\nundertaken by OECD in 2008 reviewed the general public procurement framework and provided pertinent\ninterventions to enhance transparency, integrity, and accountability. Since then, further developments have taken\nplace in the regulatory framework governing public procurement.\nHaving in place a well-functioning public procurement framework that promotes transparency and accountability is\nan important factor to attract investments into the sector and ensure that quality services are made available for\nconstruction and housing services in the country. In this context, drawing from international guidelines/best\npractices in relation to public procurement, drawing from the WTO’s Government Procurement Agreement (GPA),\nthe EU's Integrity Pact Toolbox, among others, as well as sector specific guidelines such as the Construction Sector\nTransparency Initiative, to build understanding and capacitate stakeholders to work towards a more conducive and\nenabling public procurement framework.\nLinked with the capacity building initiatives under Activity 3.4.5, ITC will work with relevant institutions to undertake\nan assessment of Iraq’s public procurement framework being adopted for construction services. The assessment will\nreview the regulatory framework and process adopted in place to prepare, issue and evaluate tenders, and award\nof contracts for the construction and housing related projects – with the objective of assessing the extent to which\nthe existing framework is aligned with OECD recommendations and related international guidelines pertaining to\ntransparency and accountability as noted above.\nActivity 3.4.5: Provide capacity building for officers on international guidelines/best practices in procurement\nprocesses with a view to foster alignment of Iraq’s procurement processes in the housing and construction sectors.\nLinked with the technical intervention in Activity 3.4.4 above, targeted capacity building initiatives will also be\nundertaken for Iraq’s officers in the abovementioned ministries as well as other agencies identified from the\nassessment, on best practices in public procurement with specific focus on procurement contexts for construction\nand infrastructure related services. This will include training events (virtual and in-person) to raise awareness on\nbest practices/guidelines available in relation to public procurement and integrating these lessons into the public\nprocurement frameworks in Iraq for construction and housing services.\nActivity 3.4.6: Provide technical/advisory support to undertake regulatory reforms – based on the impact\nassessments and diagnostic assessment.\n62\nBased on the results of the regulatory and diagnostic assessments undertaken through Activities 3.4.2 and 3.4.4\nrespectively, technical assistance can be provided for relevant government agencies, based on demand, to prioritise\nand implement recommendations to facilitate regulatory and institutional reforms.\nRelevant interventions can be in the form of providing technical inputs to draft/amend laws/regulations, and\nstrategize reforms to strengthen coordination among government agencies, improve transparency, etc.\nActivity 3.4.7: Organize public-private dialogues (built into the activities covered above) to present and discuss\nregulatory and policy reforms to strengthen access to the construction and housing services sectors in Iraq,\nincluding in the context of integrating broad developmental priorities such as sustainability and digitalization into\nthe industry.\nPPDs will be built into the technical activities to present and discuss findings, seek inputs/clarifications, and obtain\nvalidation on policy recommendations/insights formulated.\nThese dialogues function as an important platform for all relevant stakeholders from public and private sectors to\nbe informed about the studies/analyses underway, seek buy-in from stakeholders to engage in these efforts, and\nfacilitate dialogue between public and private sectors on policy reforms, so as to ensure that all stakeholders are\neffectively engaged in the policy formulation and implementation process.\nThe PPDs effectively provide an opportunity to inform the reform process through inclusive consultation as well as\nto validate the results of the studies; and ensure that stakeholders are actively engaged in decision making to\nstrengthen the regulatory and policy framework governing the construction and housing services sector in Iraq.\nActivity 3.4.8: Provide capacity building engagements for public and private sector (including economic operators,\nprofessional associations, business associations, etc.), and the academia/civil society on market access issues\nrelating to services trade – with focus on the construction and housing services sector (covering issues such as the\nmodalities of services trade, and potential from services liberalization, technicalities of MRAs, etc.).\nTo ensure that all relevant stakeholders relevant for strengthening the construction and housing services sector in\nIraq are able to provide meaningful inputs and effectively engage in the reform process, it is important that these\nstakeholders understand their role in the services framework and the relevance of their engagement in contributing\nto a conducive business environment for these services. As explained above, there are a number of different\nareas/topics which have an impact on the operation of the construction and housing services sector, and accordingly,\nit is important to ensure that all these various stakeholders understand their position in this reform process.\nThrough this activity, capacity building engagements will be undertaken for the various stakeholders (identified\nbased on the mapping undertaken in Activity 3.4.1) to understand the operation of trade in services (including the\nmodalities, potential from services liberalization, technicalities of MRAs, etc.) and explore these concepts within the\nframework of the construction and housing services sector. Targeted sessions can be held with stakeholders from\nspecific institutions, based on request, to dive into these concepts and build linkages with authorities in the\nconstruction and housing sectors.\nGuides, infographics and related resources will be developed under this activity, to feed into the capacity building\ninitiatives. This activity will also see the development of guides, infographics and other resources. The most suitable\nmodality of capacity building will be decided based on the needs of the stakeholders.\nOutput 3.5: Enhanced awareness and capacities of public and private stakeholders of the regulatory and\nprocedural framework for investing in the housing and construction sectors and potential for reform.\nInvestment is a key driver of the construction and housing sector growth in Iraq. Increased investment –\ndomestic and foreign – will lead to increased jobs and income for the workers in these sectors, improved\naccess to finance, increased efficiency, as well as greater adoption of new technologies and sustainable\nbusiness models.\n63\nBeyond economic fundamentals such as market access conditions, and returns on investment, investment related\nadministrative procedures also play a key role in investment decisions. These may include measures/procedures\nrelated to company establishment and business registration, connecting to infrastructure, capital transfers and\npayments, payment of taxes, benefitting from incentives and public programmes, among others.\nIraq has adopted legal and regulatory reforms to encourage foreign investment and improve the business climate,\nincluding through the promulgation of the Investment Law and establishment of the National Investment\nCommission (NIC). The NIC, in turn, has established a one stop shop to function as a single point of contact for\ninvestors and facilitate the investment process through streamlined services. However, significant challenges remain\nmaking it challenging for investors seeking to engage in the construction and housing sectors in Iraq. Some challenges\nidentified from the preliminary analysis include the complexity and lack of clarity of regulations, predictability of the\npolicy environment, lack of coordination among government agencies, lack of transparency, and the complex and\ntime-consuming administrative procedures to be complied with. These challenges are not unique to Iraq, and efforts\nhave been pursued through domestic reforms or international agreements such as the WTO Investment Facilitation\nfor Development (IFD) Agreement to improve transparency and streamline administrative procedures to make\ninvestment processes easier, faster, and safer.\nAccordingly, interventions are designed under Output 3.5 to strengthen Iraq’s investment facilitation measures,\ndrawing from international guidelines, with the objective to increase flow of domestic and foreign investment into\nthe housing and construction sectors.\nOutput 3.5 engages public and private stakeholders to improve the policy environment for facilitating investments\ninto the housing and construction sectors, and in turn, expanding access to housing and potential of small firms in\nthe sector to meaningfully contribute to job creation and facilitate sustainable industrial growth. Through targeted\nactivities on building awareness, assessing needs, analysing potential reforms to administrative processes and\nregulations, and providing comprehensive capacity building, stakeholders will be equipped with the necessary tools\nto attract and engage potential investors.\nActivities Narrative:\nActivity 3.5.1: Determine the core group of stakeholders for investment facilitation, including participants from\nboth public and private sector.\nInvestment facilitation measures (as reflected in the WTO IFD Agreement) cover a broad scope of laws and\nregulations on various elements – and accordingly, it is crucial for the country to identify all governmental agencies\ndirectly involved in the whole life cycle of investment at both national and sub-national levels. These agencies will\nneed to be part of the assessment process (undertaken in Activity 3.5.2 and 3.5.4) – and form the core stakeholder\ngroup for implementing investment facilitation measures. In addition to the core stakeholder group, it is also\nnecessary to engage other stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental, involved in the whole life cycle\nof an investment – which can include foreign and domestic investors, research institutes, civil society organizations\nthat have a practical and ground level knowledge and experience that enables them to provide inputs from various\nperspectives. Key agencies already identified include the National Investment Commission, Provincial Investment\nCommission, the Ministry of Trade’s Companies Registration Department, Kurdistan Board of Investment, Chamber\nof Commerce, and the Council of Ministers.\nAccordingly, a mapping will be undertaken of the various government agencies linked to/relevant for overseeing the\nimplementation of measures/procedures set out in the WTO IFD Agreement; and identification of other relevant\nstakeholders (from private sector and civil society) who can be engaged in the process. The core group of\nstakeholders will occupy an important role in the needs assessment and business process analysis – as the\ninformation collected and analysis formulated will need to be reviewed and confirmed by all relevant agencies\ninvolved in the implementation process. The overall process will have to be led by a national coordinating agency –\nwhich will be identified in consultation with relevant agencies.\nThe mapping will be undertaken through a combination of desk research, and stakeholder consultations and focus\ngroup discussion(s) to present the mapping and seek validation/inputs from the relevant stakeholders. In addition,\n64\nthere will be a sub-core group within the overall core stakeholder group comprising stakeholders directly engaged\nin the construction and housing services industry. The sub-core group will not necessarily be mutually exclusive from\nthe overall core stakeholder group – as there may be overlaps in the stakeholders engaged (For instance the National\nInvestment Commission, and the Companies Registrar will be engaged in both groups).\nThese activities will be undertaken by investment facilitation expert(s) and a national investment expert (with\ncapacity to engage in Arabic language and build networks with relevant stakeholders).\nActivity 3.5.2: Provide capacity building and awareness-raising for the core group stakeholders to enhance their\nknowledge about the objectives and approaches for investment facilitation and the needs assessment.\nTo facilitate the assessment of investment facilitation measures under Activity 3.5.3 - capacity building initiatives\nwill be built in for the relevant stakeholders as identified in Activity 3.5.1 - to ensure that all stakeholders are well-\nversed and capacitated to engage effectively in this process.\nThe Needs Assessment Guide for Investment Facilitation – formulated by the WTO to enable self-assessments – and\nother related materials will be circulated to all stakeholders in advance of the assessment – with the objective of\nproviding a good foundation and to ensure comprehensive discussion among stakeholders.\nFollowing this, targeted capacity building sessions will be organized in collaboration with the national coordinating\nagency and the core stakeholder group to build understanding on the context of investment facilitation and related\nmeasures, and process for strengthening investment facilitation using the Needs Assessment Guide as a template.\nTechnical sessions will then be facilitated on each of the sections of the Needs Assessment Guide for Investment\nFacilitation – to work through each provision, provide examples on how each provision can be implemented, and\ndiscuss its application in Iraq.\nThrough these sessions, the objective will be to ensure that all stakeholders relevant for the investment facilitation\nprocess are well-versed on the relevant matters and able to provide solid and useful inputs to feed into the needs\nassessment process effected under Activity 3.5.3.\nActivity 3.5.3: Undertake a needs assessment of the investment facilitation framework in Iraq – based on the\nguidelines developed based on the WTO Investment Facilitation for Development (IFD) Agreement.\nAt the initial training undertaken in Activity 3.5.2, participants will be invited to fill in a pre-assessment survey to\ncollect preliminary inputs on relevant procedures/measures, as set out in the Needs Assessment Guide formulated\nby the WTO. The Needs Assessment Guide is structured into four main sections – (a) transparency of investment\nmeasures; (b) streamlining and speeding up administrative procedures; (c) focal points, domestic regulatory\ncoherence and cross-border cooperation; and (d) sustainable investment. Participants will not be required to provide\ncomprehensive answers and may provide partial answers focusing on their areas of expertise. The survey will serve\nas a foundation for group discussion in the in-country self-assessment.\nThereafter, technical support will be provided to work through and complete information on each of the sections of\nthe Guide and identify challenges/constraints and areas for reform. Consultations will be built into the targeted\ncapacity building sessions discussed in Activity 3.5.2 above, to present preliminary inputs received from the pre-\nassessment survey and obtain inputs/information from the stakeholders on the relevant\nlaws/regulations/procedures pertaining to each of the articles covered in the section.\nThis will be complemented with an in-depth study based on the information collected from the stakeholder group,\nfurther desk research and consultations, to review the laws/regulations/administrative requirements and the\npractical implementation, assess challenges/constraints identified, and compile information into the needs\nassessment guide. The compiled assessment will be shared with the national coordinating agency for review,\nconsultations held to present the findings, and seek confirmation on the information gathered and analysed\npertaining to the relevant laws/regulations/measures.\nDialogues will be organized under Activity 3.5.7 to present the findings of the assessment to the core stakeholder\ngroup – to seek inputs and validation on the analysis of the challenges/constraints identified – and discuss potential\n65\npolicy reforms in this regard (refer to Activity 3.5.7 for further details). The needs assessment will be further refined\nbased on feedback received at these dialogues.\nA final report will be prepared with an overall analysis of the investment facilitation framework in Iraq,\nchallenges/constraints faced, and policy recommendations to streamline and strengthen investment facilitation\nmeasures in the country.\nActivity 3.5.4: Undertake a business process analysis study on the administrative/procedural steps and relevant\nagencies involved in the process for investing in and setting up operations in the housing and constructions sectors\nin Iraq.\nThe business process analysis study will, draw from the investment facilitation analysis, and then dive into the\nspecific administrative procedures in the housing and construction sectors, with the aim of identifying redundancies\nand undue complexities, assess mechanisms, quality, and effectiveness of procedures, and propose suggestions for\npractical reform.\nThis will entail a mapping of the value chain in the housing and construction sector, identifying relevant steps in the\ninvestment process, procedures for setting up a company in Iraq (both as a foreign and domestic investor) in the\nconstruction and housing industry, required authorizations and agencies in charge, time required for obtaining\nauthorization, fees and charges, time and costs associated with obtaining local services required to undertake\nconstruction and related services.\nThe results of this mapping will also be used to feed into the formulation of a sub-core group within the core\nstakeholder group set out in Activity 3.5.1; and further targeted sessions will be conducted for stakeholders in the\nsub-core group pertaining directly to the construction and housing services sectors to explain the context of\ninvestment facilitation in the framework of the particular industry. Relevant stakeholders identified from the\npreliminary analysis undertaken by ITC in this regard include the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation,\nMinistry of Labour, General Directorate of Real Estate, and the Iraqi Syndicate of Engineers.\nAn analysis of the application of the procedures identified from the mapping exercise will be undertaken – through\ndesk research, consultations/focus group discussion, etc. – to assess/identify options to streamline procedures,\nenhance collaboration among agencies, reduce required authorizations, and digitize documentation requirements,\nand improve transparency and reduce corruption.\nA final report will be prepared to present the overall findings, detail the procedures and challenges/constraints\nidentified, and provide policy recommendations to streamline, build collaboration and smoothen the process in the\nconstruction and housing sector.\nThe investment facilitation experts referred to above, will be supported by a local expert in the construction and\nhousing services sector for this activity.\nActivity 3.5.5: Develop an investment guide (which can be integrated into an online platform) on the\nsteps/procedures to invest and set up operations in the construction and housing sectors in Iraq.\nAn investment guide will be developed providing step-by-step guidance for investors seeking to engage in Iraq. The\nguide will detail in a logical manner – the procedures for to set up and operate a business in in Iraq – including\nmeasures for registering labour, engaging foreign employees, registering tax profile, claiming incentives, etc.\nUpon development of the investment guide – an event will be organized to present and launch the investment guide\n(potentially in collaboration with events organized under Activity 3.5.8) – with the objective of showcasing and\npromoting the efforts of the Iraqi Government to strengthen the investment framework for the construction and\nhousing sector.\nActivity 3.5.6: Deliver capacity building for public and private sector stakeholders on investment facilitation and\nstrengthening investment frameworks, including in the context of aligning investment frameworks with emerging\ntrends such as sustainability and digitalization, drawing on best practices/lessons learned from other jurisdictions\n– including targeted engagements for key stakeholders such as the National Investment Commission, Provincial\n66\nInvestment Commissions, and the Kurdistan Board of Investment, among others (based on a sustained\ntraining/capacity building plan to be developed at the start of the project).\nComplementing the targeted capacity building events for the core stakeholder group on investment facilitation,\nrelevant training/information-sharing materials will be developed such as infographics and video clips on related\ncontent – which can be circulated widely to reach a broader audience.\nIn addition, further targeted events will be organized for the core stakeholder group and other relevant stakeholders\nfrom the public and private sectors, to explore:\n- Developments in investment negotiations, covering multilateral and regional/bilateral agreements – and\nrelevance for Iraq, and importance of aligning investment policy to facilitate industrial development in the\ncountry.\n- Best practices/lessons learned in leveraging investment policy to facilitate transition to digital and\nsustainable led industrial growth.\nThese events will seek to generate awareness of the public and private sector in Iraq on the importance of\nrefining/strengthening investment frameworks in line with emerging trends – to build competitiveness and attract\nsustainable private sector investments into the country.\nFor the topics referred to above, the content produced will be contextualised for the construction and housing\nindustry in Iraq, as relevant.\nTo feed into these training programmes, technical briefs will be developed on the topics mentioned above, to be\nshared with participants and can also be made available on online platforms to be accessible in public.\nActivity 3.5.7: Organize public-private dialogues to present and discuss regulatory and procedural reforms based\non the analyses.\nIn order to strengthen collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors in Iraq, and\nimportantly, to also ensure that private sector is engaged as an important stakeholder in the policy formulation and\nimplementation process in Iraq – public-private dialogues will be built in across the activities under Output 3.5.\nAs noted in Activity 3.5.1, 3.5.3 and Activity 3.5.4 above, public-private dialogues will be organized to present:\n- the mapping of relevant stakeholders undertaken for the studies under this Output, and\n- the findings of the self-assessment for investment facilitation framework in Iraq and the analysis of the\ninvestment process in the construction and housing sector in Iraq.\nThese dialogues will be a forum from which to familiarize stakeholders with the interventions being undertaken to\nstrengthen the investment facilitation framework for the construction and housing sector in Iraq, obtain\nfeedback/inputs on the analysis, facilitate discussion between public and private sectors on challenges/constraints\nfaced and feasibility of proposed policy recommendations, and seek agreement from stakeholders on the way\nforward.\nReports will be drawn upon based on each public-private dialogue organized to detail the discussion points covered\nin the dialogue, agreements reached between stakeholders, and set out the next steps. These reports will function\nas a record for the relevant government agencies and institutions to take action on policy reforms, and for private\nsector to be able to track and follow-up on relevant matters, including providing the necessary support to facilitate\nimplementation of the policy reforms.\nThese reports, upon sign off from the main government agency, can be circulated among all participants in the\npublic-private dialogue.\n67\nActivity 3.5.8: Develop tools for facilitating sustainable investment, including domestic supplier databases of\ndomestic services/material providers in the construction and housing value chains, so that investors can have\neasier access to information on available domestic services and suppliers.\nA domestic supplier database provides information about the availability and capacity of the local suppliers so that\ninvestors/foreign companies can have easier access to information and connect with the local suppliers. The supplier\ndatabase can be hosted on the website of the investment promotion agency (IPA), as part of IPA’s effort to promote\nlocal suppliers and connect them to markets. The supplier database can also serve as a tool to increase transparency\nin the market and help businesses assess competition and market conditions.\nThe tool will be made available in English and Arabic – for accessibility by local and foreign stakeholders. The\ndevelopment of the database will be effected in collaboration with the IPA with the objective of capacitating relevant\nofficials to take ownership of the database and keep it updated.\nActivity 3.5.9: Analysing and identifying countries with strong home country support measures in infrastructure/\nconstruction/housing sectors and developing targeted initiatives to attract investors from these countries.\nSome countries have strong home country support measures in infrastructure/ construction/housing sectors,\nincluding support to identify market opportunities (business intelligence and information on regulations), support\nto connect to public and private stakeholders including potential creditors, support on meeting regulatory and\nsustainability standards through trainings etc. These home country measures can help increase competitiveness as\nwell as ensure quality delivery. Home and host country IPAs can work together to exchange information on these\nsupport measures and develop targeted initiatives to benefit from home country measures, both for the investor\nand the local communities.\nITC’s experts will organize experience sharing sessions with IPAs in selected countries (to be identified based on\nresearch and consultations) to explore mechanisms/initiatives being implemented and exchange information in this\nregard. In line with these sessions, ITC will also develop a best practice guide on relevant support measures adopted\nby other selected jurisdictions and assess the feasibility for application in Iraq.\n4.6 RESULTS CHAIN OUTCOME FOUR\n4.6.1 OUTCOME FOUR: INTERVENTION LOGIC\nIf the awareness and technical capacities of social partners with regard to the right to organize, collective bargaining\nand the participation in social dialogue with public actors are improved (Op 4.1), then the influence on labour\nmarkets of employers’ and workers’ organisations involved in social dialogue with the government will be\nstrengthened (Oc. 4), as long as the representatives of social partners are committed to participate in the training\nand technical support provided; the members are also willing to implement the technical skills acquired to\nstrengthen their respective organizations further; and, social partners will exert concerted effort towards using\ndifferent advocacy platforms towards ensuring their rights to organize and collective bargaining.\n4.6.2 OUTCOME FOUR: DESCRIPTION\nStrengthened influence on labour markets of employers’ and workers’ organisations involved in social dialogue\nwith the government.\nThe ILO has proven experience in promoting social dialogue through consultative processes between social partners\nand government to shape labour markets and address labour-related issues all over the world. The ILO's work on\nstrengthening social partners' representativeness and institutional capacity is guided by its tripartite structure,\nwhere representatives from governments, employers' organizations, and workers' organizations collaborate on\nvarious programs and initiatives.\nThe ILO also works with governments, employers' organizations, and workers' organizations to strengthen their\ninstitutional capacities. This includes supporting the development of effective organizational structures, internal\ngovernance mechanisms, and strategic planning processes.\n68\nThe ILO also supports the right of workers and employers to form and join organizations of their choice taking its\ncatalyst role in promoting Freedom of Association (FoA), and advocates for the recognition and protection of\ncollective bargaining rights. By promoting freedom of association, the ILO fosters the creation of strong and\nrepresentative workers' and employers' organizations.\nOverall, the ILO's work focuses on empowering social partners to engage in social dialogue and consultative\nprocesses. By strengthening their representativeness and institutional capacity, the ILO aims to foster inclusive and\nparticipatory decision-making that leads to better labour market outcomes and improved working conditions for\nworkers.\nUnder this outcome, the ILO aspires to: supporting the national coordination mechanism to implement a roadmap\nto strengthen the application of the right to organize and collective bargaining; and supporting institutional capacity\nof the social partners to influence the labour market in the construction sector.\nFurthermore, beyond Outcome four, ILO, UN-Habitat and ITC have emmeshed engagement with CSO’s throughout\nthe project design (outcomes one, two, and three). CSO’s will be central to engaging in policy dialogues and valued\npartners on the ground - supporting with advocacy, outreach, awareness raising and implementation activities.\nCSO’s will be engaged in expert consultations, participatation in roundtable and participatory planning discussions,\nserve on technical working groups, and support community-level activities."

Alqimaqche*\n*Faculty Members in Mosul University - College Of Engineering - Department Of Architecture\nKEYWORDS: Sustainable architecture, Islamic principles of sustainability, Islamic regulations, Built\nenvironment\nABSTRACT:\nSustainable development may be defined, from an Islamic point of view, as a multi-dimensional process that seeks to strike a\nbalance between economic and social development on one side, and the environment on the other. It seeks for humans to\nuse resources in the best possible way.\nThere are numerous citations from the Qur’an and the hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Mohammad) that mentioned the wise\nutilization of natural resources. They all lead to the conviction that all elements, species, habitats and ecosystems are part of\nthe perfect universe created by GOD. Hence ,respecting the law of nature and all its components is an obligation of every\nMuslim, who by definition has “submitted” himself, body and soul, to the Creator.\nDepending on the main Islamic concept in the Qur’an “And remember when He made you successors after the 'Aad and\nsettled you in the land, [and] you take for yourselves palaces from its plains and carve from the mountains, homes. Then\nremember the favors of Allah and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.” ( Al-'A`rāf, 7:74), this paper tried\nto discuss the main principles of Islamic roles that deal with nature as a main resource to architecture and built up area and\nhuman as a wise and rational consumer for these resources.\nThe paper aims to increase awareness to the importance of the theme of sustainability in architecture by expounding the core\nof the conceptual basis for the same. It also presents some general principles and ideas around which a comprehensive theory\non sustainability in Islamic architecture, in line with the requirements of the Islamic worldview while fully conforming to the\ndictates of different circumstances, environments and cultures, can be developed today. To deal with such an issue , the paper\nwill try to project the built environment and architecture of the old resident area of Mosul city within the Islamic principles of\nliving to investigate how Islam deals with such an environment and its resources sustainably.\n1. ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS IN ISLAM\nThe ethical base of Islam which is derived from the imperatives laid down in the Qur’an and expressed in the\npractice of the Prophet, comes under numerous headings. They can however be distilled into just three categories\nbearing in mind public good to be the ultimate objective. They are to do what is right, forbid what is wrong and\nact with moderation at all times: “Let there be a community among you who call to the good, and enjoin the right\nand forbid the wrong. They are the ones who have success” (Al ’Imrân, 3:104).\nAs Abed Al-Rahim (2010: 2-13) refers, the Qur’an uses an environmental theme in exhorting humankind to be\nmoderate, “it is He who produces gardens, both cultivated and wild, and palm trees and crops of diverse kinds\nand olives and pomegranates both similar and dissimilar. Eat of their fruits when they bear fruit and pay their\ndues on the day of their harvest, and do not be profligate. He does not love the profligate” (Al An‘âm, 6:141).\nThe Qur’an refers to creation or the natural world as the signs (ayat) of Allah, the Creator. Ayat means signs,\nsymbols or proofs of the divine. As the Qur’an is proof of Allah so likewise is His creation. Islamic unique\nperception of man and his position on earth necessitated the formation of a compelling and comprehensive view\nof the natural environment as well (Nasr, 1993: 130-131). This is so because man totally depends on nature for\nhis survival. Also, nature is a ground for man’s realization of his spiritual purpose on earth. Simply put, man is an\n\nintegral part of the total natural setting. Man is nature himself, sustaining nature means sustaining his self,\ndamaging nature means damaging his self and his prospects of a civilization achievement.\nOwing to all this, Islam attaches so much importance to the subject of environment clearly expounding man’s\nrights over it and his responsibilities towards it. Islam teaches that environment is part of the universal web of\ncreation. Its role is two-fold: to worship its Creator (in ways suitable to it), and to be subjected to serve the\nexigencies of man, so that God’s vicegerent can smoothly carry out his honorable task of managing earth. (Omer,\n2009: 115-116)\n1.1 Basic Roles of Sustainability in the Quran\nThe Qur’an highlighted some principles and guidelines on sustainability, which include (Matali, 2012: 35-38):\n1. Adl (Justice) - governing human relationships and other living creatures;\n2. Mizan (Balance) - governing not only human social and economic relationships but also the environment,\nespecially in ensuring the equilibrium of nature, the use of resources and life cycle of all species;\n3. Wasat (Middleness) - choosing the middle path in economic planning, social conduct, scientific pursuits,\nideological views, material, water and energy consumption;\n4. Rahmah (Mercy) - governing all aspects of human relationships and treatment of all living animals, plants and\ninsects including micro-organisms;\n5. Amanah (Trustworthiness and custodianship) - Humankind is considered to be a trustee appointed by the\nCreator, for all earth’s assets;\n6. Taharah (Spiritual purity and Physical cleanliness) - generating contented individuals through spiritual purity,\nconscious of the presence of his/her Creator, that would result in a balanced society, living in harmony with the\nenvironment; cleanliness that would generate a healthy society devoid of air and water pollution, as well as\ngenerating a clean economy devoid of usury and deceitful marketing techniques and business transactions;\n7. Haq (Truthfulness and Rights) - Truthfulness in all dealings that recognizes the respective rights of others\n(humans, animals and plants);\n8. Ilm Nafi’ (usefulness of knowledge and science) - Knowledge, whether theological, scientific or technological,\nmust be beneficial to others (individuals and society) including future generations.\n1.2 Sustainable Architecture\nEnvironmental sustainability is a concept coined at the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Environment (2002)\nwhere the concept of Sustainable Development was redefined to mean that all development must stand on three\npillars (Figure 1): economic development, social development and environmental protection. If any of the three\npillars is overlooked in our development strategies and work plans, such developments cannot be called\nsustainable development. Environmental sustainability ensures that the harmonization of the three concepts is\napplied by planners and developers in practice.\nSustainable architecture is a general term that describes environmentally conscious design techniques in the field\nof architecture. It is framed by the larger discussion of sustainability and the pressing economic and political\nissues of our world. According to LEED rating systems, sustainable architecture seeks to minimize the negative\nenvironmental impact of buildings by enhancing efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and\nFigure 1. An indication between\nthe three pillars of sustainability\n(Scott, 2009, p. 36)\n\ndevelopment space (USGBC, 2005: 4). The idea of sustainability, or ecological design, is to ensure that our\nactions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations. The term can be used to\ndescribe an energy and ecologically conscious approach to the design of the built environment.\nOn the other hand, architecture, in general, should always be in service to people. It is never to be the other way\nround, that is to say that architecture should evolve into a hobby or an adventure in the process imposing itself on\nsociety while forsaking, or taking lightly, people’s identities, cultures and the demands of their daily struggles.\nArchitecture, first and foremost, should remain associated with functionality. It should not deviate from its\nauthentic character and stray into the world of excessive invention and abstraction. (Bianca, 2000: 40)\nCentral to Islamic architecture is function with all of its dimensions: corporeal, cerebral and spiritual. Form\ndivorced from function is inconsequential (Omer, 2009: 112). This, however, by no means implies that form\nplays no role in Islamic architecture. It does play a prominent role, but its relevance is a supportive one\nsupplementing and enhancing function. Form is important, but in terms of value and substance it always comes\nsecond to function and its wide scope. There must be the closest relationship between the ideals that support the\nform of buildings and the ideals that support their function, with which the users of buildings must be at ease. A\nconflict between the two is bound to lead to a conflict of some far-reaching psychological proportions in\nbuildings users. This way, the roles of form become equivalent to the roles of function.\n1.3 The Islamic Built Laws\nThe built laws or principles as mentioned in Fiqh books illustrate the responsibilities of both individuals and\nauthority in Islamic law (Hammad 1997: 54-60). Hakim (1986: 6) defines Fiqh of building processes as: \"the\nmechanism of interpreting and applying the value system of the shari'a (Islamic divine law) within the processes\nof building and urban development... its primary sources, the Qur'an and the Sunna (or traditions of the Prophet)\nare crucial for the transfer of the value system to design and urban form.\" Islamic built laws were used to define\nthe rights, responsibilities of people and how to respond to one's needs as outlined above without conflicting\nother people's interests (Al-Ibrahim 2003: 63-80). In this sense, Akbar (1988: 20) pointed out that\nAhmed (2003: 12) suggested that the Islamic built laws (driven from Islamic principles) can be listed as the\nfollowing:\n1.3.1 No-Harm principle:\nNo-Harm principle means that residents' initiated action, which is considered harmful to others, should be\nprevented when affected people ask so (Hakim 1983: 32).\n1.3.2. Openings and projections:\nAkbar (1989: 28-35) stated that any individual could project part of his upper floor, such as Mashrabiyahs or\ncantilevers, on to a through street as long as no damage is caused to the public. Projecting cantilevers over main\nroads are permissible because the roads are the remains of `dead' lands that could have been `revived' in the past.\nHe/ she can also open windows and doors on to these roads providing they do not cause harm to their neighbors.\n1.3.3. Right of appropriation of open spaces:\nAs long as this causes no harm, residents should be free to appropriate open spaces in their residential settlements\nfor a wide range of social and economic activities determined and permitted by the residents themselves without\noutside intervention (Akbar 1989: 29, and Hakim 1986: 9).\n1.3.4. Right of easement (servitude) (Irtifak):\nRight of easement (servitude) is an exclusive benefit of a property over another adjacent to it, where the two are\nowned by different owners. This benefit belongs to the first property, even if its owner changes, unless this\nbenefit has been relinquished through a conventional transaction (Akbar 1988: 28).\n1.3.5. Right of pre-emption (Shufah):\nThe right of pre-emption (Shufah) is the right of a neighbor or a partner to substitute himself/ herself for the\nbuyer of an adjacent property or structure when offered for sale by another neighbor or partner (Akbar 1988: 29).\nThe above principals have defined the user’s rights in terms of how to build, alter or extend his/ her property.\nThey also provide a flexible framework to the property user/owner that enables him/ her to change his property\nwithout harming his neighbors and violating their rights.\n\n1.4. Sustainable Issues in Islamic Architecture\n1.4.1. The Use of Resources\nCentral to the understanding of Islamic architecture, as both a concept and sensory reality, is the understanding of\nthe Islamic concepts of man and the environment. This is so because it is man who perceives, creates and uses\narchitecture. It is man who produces or destroys architecture. It is man who enjoys or suffers from architecture.\nFurthermore, architecture and natural environment are inseparable, at both the conceptual and practical planes.\nThe environment holds enormous potential and diversified resources meant only for man, God’s vicegerent on\nearth. They are to be seen as the facilities which facilitate each and every aspect of man’s fleeting stay on earth.\nThe environment is further to be seen by man as an “ally” or a “partner”, so to speak, in the execution of his\nearthly mission. After all, in order to create an architecture, man borrows diverse natural ingredients, such as\nspace, water, clay, timber, stone and other minerals, placing the newly created or built elements back into the\nexisting natural contexts. In other words, the built environment is in so many ways the natural environment that\nhas been borrowed, utilized, manipulated and processed. Man himself constitutes a part of the universal natural\nsetting. It goes without saying that some of the most prominent features of Islamic architecture must always be as\nfollows: it is heavily loaded with the Islamic spirituality; it is economic and safe; it is users friendly; it is\nenvironment friendly; and, it is sustainable.\n1.4.2. Complementary with Context\nIt is the nature of Islam that provides humanity with basic rules of morality and guidelines of proper conduct in\nthose spheres of life which are not related to prescribed ritual worship, such as the spheres of building, planning\nand general development, for example. Upon such general principles and guidelines, people can establish\nsystems, regulations, views and attitudes in order to comprehend. and regulate their worldly life in accordance\nwith their time, region and needs. Since every age and geographic location have their own problems and\nchallenges, the solutions and perceptions deduced from the fundamental principles and permanent values of life\nhave got to be, to some extent, different. Their substance, however, due to the uniformity and consistency of the\ndivinely given foundation and sources from which they stem, will always be the same. Islam is based on essential\nhuman nature, which is constant and not subject to change according to time and space.\nIn addition, Islam ensured the right of natural resources exploitation (sun, air and water) for all, without abusing\nthe individual rights on others.\n1.4.3. Diversity with Unity\nMuslim architects tend to, firstly, identify the general Islamic guidelines and principles pertaining to the\nenterprise of sustainable building, on top of which are those related to the notions of man and the environment in\nIslam. Next, they must be aware of the implications of the challenges of regions diversity in which they live\nentail. If something was the norm during a period and in a particular ecological setting, such by no means can be\nthe same in every subsequent period and in different ecological settings. Technological advancements rapidly\nchange; demands of different eras fluctuate, even under the same ecological conditions; climate exigencies must\nbe painstakingly heeded; and, lastly, human psychology also changes with the change of time and space posing a\nnumber of exigencies of its own. No architectural plan and design which served as a solution for an age and place\ncan be simply copied to another age and place without properly modulating it to its environmental and socio-\ncultural requirements. To do that is to betray the dynamic spirit of both the common sense and the perpetual\nmessage of Islam. Blind and ignorant imitations, even in sheer religious matters, are categorically rebuked by\nIslam. By taking hold of the general Islamic guidelines and principles with reference to creating a sustainable\narchitecture, on the one hand, and by studying the needs of different times and situations so that the former can\nbe accurately understood and applied, on the other, Muslim architects in reality perform a degree of ijtihad,. In\ndoing so, in no way can a serious, enlightened, accountable and willing person be a loser as far as the execution\nof matters ordained by God is concerned. He can never be wrong. Verily, this divine assurance should serve to\nthe Muslim architects and designers as a starting point to look carefully and critically at the state of architecture\nand how buildings in the Muslim world are planned and designed, as well as to start contemplating the prospects\nof finding much better sustainability solutions which will be inspired by and infused with the values of Islam, and\nwill be responsive to the exigencies of different times and regions.\n\n2. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY\nThe objectives of the research are to study how far Islamic values and sustainable architecture have been applied\nto residence area in old Mosul city (MOC) in Iraq country. The research main question is lay under the\ninvestigation of ; how much Islamic architecture and sustainable architecture principles are synchronized\nThe research objectives are carried out through a pilot study in a selected area on the inner city, data is obtained\nwith survey as a purposive sample, building sketches and photographs.\n2.1. The Case Study: Mosul Old City\nIn the Mosul Old City in Iraq, urban tradition is greatly presented as demonstrated by the traditional alleys,\nhouses doorways, the old Islamic public buildings. For testing the theoretical framework (Islamic roles and\nprinciples mentioned above), a part of the historic fabric of (MOC) has been selected, (Fig.2). The case study has\nbeen elected due to the variety of its building styles and their ages; purposes and types. It includes several houses,\na number of public buildings like public baths, schools, and some significant religious building (mosques).\n2.2 Sustainable Architecture within (MOC)\nThe form of Mosul urban fabric returns wholly to Arabic, and Islamic in fluencies. It does not generally differ\nfrom any other Arabic–Islamic city. It is, however, considered the production of this great cultural tradition.\nThe table below (Table 1) indicates manifestation of architectural sustainability which have been obtained during\nsurvey, such appearances dealt with the concept of sustainability spontaneously, due to the (conscious)\ninvolvement of designer and architect within Islamic principles and roles.\nThe survey also indicates that the use of these concepts were at macro and micro levels of the architecture and the\nurban design of the built environment, and muslin architect dealt with such environment with various degrees of\nawareness, to establish safety and humanity, with wise and various use of natural resource.\nFigure 2.

CONCLUSIONS:\nThe Islamic world has enriched human history with its scientific and artistic achievements, and contributed both\nwithin and outside of Islamic borders to the advent of the modern era. The field of Islamic Architecture is a key\nexample of this rich legacy. This can be witnessed in the timeless and unprecedented buildings throughout\nIslamic civilization, among them.\nThe unity of Islamic architecture is related of course not only to the unity of cosmos and beyond that realm to the\nunity of the divine principle itself, but also to the unity of life of the individual and the community which the\ndivine law makes possible. By refusing to distinguish between the sacred and profane, by integrating religion into\nall facets of life and life itself into the rhythm of rites and patterns of values determined by religion, Islam creates\na wholeness, which is reflected in its architecture.\nIt was clear from the survey held in Mosul city which represents one of the cities established by Muslim\narchitects and designers that there is a great awareness to issues of sustainability with their three pillars. That\nawareness is reflected in both macro and micro levels so that we can find this wise usage of resources in the\nspace and fabric, in the material and construction, in the single building and its inner and constructed elements,\nand in the whole urban grains.\nThese sustainable pillars were also reflected sharply in the optimum collaboration between man and his\nenvironment, which is one of the most obligations in Islamic faith.\nIt is also clear that by depending on Islamic principles (No- Harm, Mezan, Ilm Nafi’….etc.) architects created\nbuilt environment with a high responsibility to the natural and local resources, without refuting the richness\n(saying diversity and variety) of such environment, and by using these local resources they also could save to the\nenvironment its health and strength.\nGiven the way Islam looks at development, we can also seek Islamic solutions to global issues which threaten\nenvironment, so that we can keep our universe clean and healthy with enough resources to the future generations.\nReferences:\nAbed Al-Rahim M., (2010), The Environment In Islam: Environmental Sustainability and Islam, The 15th General\nConference, The Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought, Amman, pp: 2-13.\nAhmed, K.

Introduction:\nThis day and age you hear everyone talking about going green.\nWhether you want to state it or not at some point everyone\nwill have to follow with the green movement. This is because\nat the rate we are going the earth is simply not sustainable so\nwe will begin to run out of confident natural resources that are\nneeded in order for us to survive. First we can wonder about\nthis new traded technology, what exactly is green building?\nLet's take a nearer look at what it is and what the objectives of\na green building are. We are sure to find that it is something\nthat we should take part in (www.businessfeed.sunpower.com).\n2. What is the Meaning of Green Building?\nFirst we will take a look at what a green building means. We\nmay think of a green or sustainable building as just a building\nthat doesn’t actually have as bad of an influence on the\nenvironment as another usual building. Also we may think\nabout it that it’s the type of building which contain a wide\nspace of green. The ideal meaning of green building would be\nThe Possibilities of the Actual Orientation of the\nGreen Building in Iraq \nP-ISSN: 1680-9300\nE-ISSN: 2790-2129\nVol. (32), No. (2)\npp. 22-29\nNarmeen A. Abdalqadir\nDepartment of Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Mustansiriayah University, Baghdad, Iraq\n______________________________________________________________________________________\nAbstract:\nThis research covers the zone between Iraq and Iran. The first investigated region is the 'Mesopotamian Marshes' or Iraqi-Iran\nMarshes, it's a wetland zone located in southern Iraq and partly in southwestern Iran. The other region is a desert district which\nincludes a prominent part of the southern and western parts of Iraq and part of Iran. The last is the center city of Basra. The\nbuilding materials were the most important building element that affected the conformation of vernacular habitats In this study,\nwe needed to focus on the effects of ecological and energy-efficiency processes in creating vernacular habitats and the selection of\noptimal building systems and materials in this part of the world which can be an essential point for sustainable environmental\nbuilding processes in the future. Reeds, clay, straw, bricks, and wood were the most popular building materials used by builders\nfrom this region. The impact of building material on the environment embodies the essential method implicitly significant in this\nresearch to effectively determine traditional building materials in the environment in addition to comparative analysis which\npresents an essential factor of our analysis in addition to the impact of environments on building systems. The main target of this\nstudy is to benefit designers and building engineers in their pursuit to find optimal and competent solutions suitable for specific\nlocal microclimates using traditional methods in the design process that are sustainable and ecological.\nKeywords: Green Building, Marshes House, Basra, Iraq\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n_________________________________________\nJournal of Prospective Researches\nVol.(24), No.(2)\nThe paper was received in 4 February 2024; Accepted in 15 March 2024; and\nPublished in 9 April 2024\nCorresponding author’s e-mail: narmeen_71@yahoo.com\n\nجمةلتقبلية\n \nحبوث مس\nJournal of Prospective Researches32\n60716.01/jpr.v24i2.pp23-29\na building project that would permit you to preserve most of\nthe natural environment around the project position while still\nbeing competent to create a building that is going to serve a\npurpose. The construction and operation will support a healthy\nenvironment for all involved and it will not disrupt the land,\nwater, resources and energy around the building. This is can\nbe the actual meaning of a green building. The U.S. EPA says\n'green building is the practice of generating structures and\nusing processes that are environmentally accountable and\nresource efficient throughout a building’s life-cycle from siting\nto design; construction; operation; maintenance; renovation\nand deconstruction. This practice grows and supplements the\nconventional building design concerns of economy; utility;\ndurability; and comfort'. Green building is also recognized as a\nsustainable or extraordinary performance building\n(www.businessfeed.sunpower.com).\n3. Why Go Green?\nLet us take a look at why it is so important to go green. May\nwe will find when going green that we are competent to\ndecrease our carbon footprint and actually lend a helping hand\nto the environment. We can go green in a range of different\nways nevertheless builders and construction workers must do\ntheir part as well. Green buildings are planned in such a way\nto decrease overall influence on environment and human\nhealth by:\n Reducing trash, pollution and degradation of\nenvironment.\n Efficiently using energy, water and other resources.\n Protecting occupant health and improving\nproductivity.\n4. Objectives of Green Buildings:\nThe goal of green building concept is to improve buildings\nwhich use the natural resources to the minimal at the time of\nconstruction and operation. Green buildings accentuate on the\nresource usage efficiency and press upon the three R's -\nReduce, Reuse and Recycle (www.ukessays.com). We can\nachieve the most important goals in these points:\n Maximizes the use of efficient construction materials\nand practices, increases the use of natural sources and\nsinks in the building's surroundings, reduces the\nenergy usage to run itself, uses highly capable\napparatus for the indoor area;, uses extremely skillful\nmethods for water and waste administration. The\nindoor equipment includes lighting and air-\nconditioning in addition to all other needed\nequipment.\n Saving Energy; this can be occurs in two ways: First is\ndecrease in the expanse of energy that is consumed in\nlighting and air conditioning in addition to other\nbuilding operations. Second is the usage of energy\nsources which do not create any greenhouse gases and\nare renewable in nature. Green Buildings accentuate\nmore on natural lighting and ideas of temperature\ncontrol and efficient design to more decrease the\ncarbon footprint and reduce cost of operation.\n Saving water; Green Buildings use numerous ways to\ndecrease water usage by treatment and reusing of\nwaste water as well as filter water from sourced from\nprecipitation so to be able to achieve zero water table\nnegative effect from the green building.\n Reducing Waste; it is the most important issues that\nare to be dealt with. Green Building idea emphasizes\non improving the design of the product, re-using and\nrecycling materials. It results in great waste reduction\nand helps to decrease the environmental effect of the\nbuilding.\n Improving Health and Productivity; Hygiene and\nsuitable conditions inside the building also help in\nenhancing human productivity.

Does Going Green Really Cost More?\nThere are those who think that they just can’t go green\nbecause it will cost them further money but that is surely a\ncommon misconception. Although it may cost you a bit more\n\nجمةلتقبلية\n \nحبوث مس\nJournal of Prospective Researches32\n60716.01/jpr.v24i2.pp23-29\nto get started when you are going green as green materials and\nproducts can be more costly but you really have to consider the\ntype of savings that you will be able to gain. It can be able to\nsave on energy costs because going green also means\npreserving energy. It should really look at the green building as\nfurther of an investment than anything other. An investment\nthat will be capable to save money as well as an investment\nthat will be capable to assistance the environment\n(businessfeed.sunpower.com).\n6. Green Buildings are the Phenomenon of the\nTimes, Where is Iraq from it?\nWhat is the relationship between the outer conditions of\ntemperature, sunshine and rain and the inside thermal comfort\nis the most important question that needs to be answered\n(Givoni, 1976). According to a UN document, the purpose of\nthe habituation process is not to build houses but to ovulate a\ncompetent house. Also the house should be responsible for the\nsecurity of technical advice and be involved in acquiring small\nloans and cheap materials (Stulz and Mukerj, 1981). Climatic\nconditions constrain the builder to find an efficient solution to\nassist the human being and the comfort of his animation.\nBuilding materials have an essential effect on the home’s\nfunctions and inhabitants. Environmental building materials\nenhance assessment to human life and decrease the negative\neffect on the environment drastically. The main lesson it can\nbe can learned from this study is not only to further the\nconservation and repossession of the form of habitats already\nin existence but also to rethink what can form new habitats for\nthe future. This research covers the zone between Iraq and\nIran. The first investigated region is the center city of Basra.\nThe other region is the 'Mesopotamian Marshes' or Iraqi-Iran\nMarshes; a wetland zone situated in southern Iraq and partially\nin southwestern Iran. The last is a desert district, which\nincludes a prominent part of the southern and western parts of\nIraq and part of Iran (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1. The different building systems categories from the zone between\nIraq and Iran.\nThe material effect on the environment should not be detected\nin isolation from other environmental elements. The\nenvironmental effect of certain materials or structures can be\ncompared to other elements (Almusaed and Almssad, 2015).\nBuilders from this zone have chosen three varied categories in\nthe building material’s selecting process. These materials and\ntheir types are as shown the table 1 with their various\nproperties and advantages.\nTable 1: The different building materials used in the zone between Iraq and Iran\nBuilding materials types properties advantages\nOrganic materials\nReeds \nContains a high ratio of silicon\nsubstance\n1) Has good resistance to water actions.\n2) Durable and flexible in technical action and\nstructures; however, it is a highly flammable\nmaterial\n3) Unattractive for insects and other animals\n4) An excellent thermal and acoustic insulator\nmaterial.\nStraw\nConsists of barley that is 36%\ncellulose, 26% pentoses, 17%\nlinen, wax, protein and ash-a\n1) High thermal efficiency\n2) Excellent insulation properties\n3) Straw bales are good at transporting moisture and\n\nجمةلتقبلية\n \nحبوث مس\nJournal of Prospective Researches32\n60716.01/jpr.v24i2.pp23-29\ncomposition very similar to\nwood\nthus regulate interior humidity, provided they bear\nthe diffusion through open screen and coatings\nWood\nThe principal components are\ncellulose (40–50%) and\nhemicellulose (15–25%), with\nlignin (15–30%) as well as\nother material such as sugar,\nstarch and protein\n1) Has a high caloric value\n2) A natural combination of cellulose fibers (that are\nstrong in tension) embedded in a matrix that\nresists compression\n3) The conversion of wood into a sustainable,\nrenewable resource to be used as a main building\nmaterial could be beneficial in various areas of the\nworld.\nMineral materials\nClay\nExcellent adhesion and\nbonding forces count as the\nmain properties of clay\n1) Principal building material\n2) Excellent thermal resistance\nBrick\n1) Principal building material\n2) Has excellent thermal resistance\n3) Very efficient in energy consumption and can be\naccepted as a bio-ecological material\nMixture material\nThe density of the mixture\nbuilding material of clay and\nstraw is 1200–1700 kg/m3. A\nmix of clay and straw is a\nheterogeneous material, with\ngood thermal properties\nClay is odorless, non-toxic and pleasant to work with\nin combination with straw, creating a soft to pulpy\nprepared mix of clay and vegetable fibers (straw) that\ncan be used for filling the panels in timber-framed\nbuildings or pressed in moulds for making clay bricks\nand boards\nIn this study we investigated three different cases from Basra\nhabitats as shown in (Fig. 2), where old builders constructed\nsomething appropriate for the environmental, climatic and\nhuman requirements. These cases are:\nFig. 2. Building zones from Basra.\n6.1 Old Basra Habitat from Zone I\nA high temperature 'T' due to the heat island phenomenon is a\nmain danger factor that affects housing configurations and\ncompositions in this zone. The commendation is to produce a\nhabitat unit that adjusts to great climate with a sequence of\ninterferences such as significant thermal insulation, deep\nshadows on frontages and natural stream aerations throughout\nthe building functions and structures (Fig. 3). In Old Basra a\nhouse is considered attractive if it is spacious and if the\ncondition is airy and exposed on all edges to the wind\nespecially to the northern wind. A healthy house has its\ncourtyards and basins of water In addition to wooden\nfragments on the front of the frontage 'Shanashil' (Fathy,\n1986). Most of the old Basra featured habitats are decorated\nwhich usually to show invisible spirits and to satisfy local\ncivilizations. The habitat area is divided into two efficient\nzones first a social area that includes the living room, kitchen,\nstorage room, and bathroom and other include a private area\nthat includes bedrooms. Brick is the main material used in this\nconstruction. The houses are situated in row buildings in front\nof a narrow street; placed directly by the old city river. These\nhouses were built in the beginning of the last century. The\nresults expression that the release of CO2 is relative low.\n\nجمةلتقبلية\n \nحبوث مس\nJournal of Prospective Researches32\n60716.01/jpr.v24i2.pp23-29\nFig. 3. Traditional house from zone I (Old Basra Habitat).\n6.2 Marshes House Unit from Zone II\nHigh moisture 'H' due to marsh water is a chief risk factor that\nupsets housing configurations and compositions from this\nzone. Numerous commendations are to create a habitat unit\nwith a building material resistant to water and moisture. The\nposition is a historic site from the Sumerian time. The housing\ncompositions were founded for the early time in the 'Ur' city\nwhere the initial settlement was founded (Cooper and Dawson,\n1999). UNESCO recognizes this region in the north of Basra\nas a monument of nature representing it as one of the largest\nsites of unique ecosystem types in the world. There is a low\ndensity of societies living in relationship with impressive flora\nand fauna full of rare species. In the north of Basra the house\nwas built in water with a weak current and the habitat unit is\nmade of reeds and a mixed of clay and straw (Waltjen et al.,\n2009). Two ways are to make the island suitable for the\nconstruction development; one is choosing good ground and\nthe other is making it meet a particular case. In this region,\nhouse is made of lightweight constructions and the main\nbuilding material applied is reed. (Fig. 4) shows the different\nprocedures for building an artificial island.\nFig. 4. Different position of artificial island made for habitat unit\nThe habitat site is created from many posts that include closely\nrelated strains of reeds between them. The height of the pillar\n(Shabe) can reach 10 m. The diameter of the pillar (Shabe) is\napproximately 70 cm at the base and 20 cm at the top (Fig. 5).\nFig. 5. Compositions Reed’s house such principal building materials from\nnorthern and Eastern part of Basra.\n6.3 Al-Zubeir House Unit from Zone III\nSandy wind 'W' which is due to the Sahara Desert\nenvironment in the Arabian Peninsula is a chief danger factor\nthat affects house configurations and compositions from this\nzone. Here a blind wall is suggested. The earth is the most\nnoticeable material used in natural buildings. Earth can be\nfound everywhere and it used to be said that the majority of\nthe world’s population still lived in earth buildings (Keefe,\n2012). In fact, concrete and bricks are made of material from\nthe earth but what will be conversed here are structures that\nare made of earth in its most natural state with a minimum\namount of treatment and processing. Strong prevalent sandy\n\nجمةلتقبلية\n \nحبوث مس\nJournal of Prospective Researches32\n60716.01/jpr.v24i2.pp23-29\nwinds aggravate the builder’s response: resulting in lower;\nblind facades; flatter buildings offering less resistance and thus\nless disposed to building harm and human worry. Practices\nfrom the old building process display that flexible building\nmaterials can be active when the climate is moist and are rigid\nwhen the climate is dry. Generally wet clay is used directly\nwhen mixed with Straw and maybe given more body by adding\ngravel or stone. This is noticeable in areas of the world where\nearth buildings may have a comparatively short life as part of a\nnomadic existence. When abandoned they will not leave\nanything unpleasant behind (Wenzel, 1996). especially on a\nsite where a house is due to be created, The extraction of clay\nis a zero- carbon solution for construction, the clay, straw walls\nand floors can be used as a direct substitute for mass concrete\n(Marchell and Leary, 1974). Al-Zubeir House Units building,\nin its architecture without architects, summaries that\ninexperienced builders fitted their work to the local\nenvironment and topography. Habitats from an Al-Zubeir\ndistrict are really vernacular, developing only slightly\ntransformed material from its immediate surroundings. Rural\ndesert architecture is notable for its sculptural shapes achieved\nin clay. In this zone, the major building material applied is clay\nand straw. Shade and protection from dust storms may have\nthe highest priority in some areas, ventilation and the trapping\nof air currents and breeze are the primary considerations (Fig.\n6). Then it's noticed that the house material components are\nenvironmentally friendly and better employed in energy-\nefficiency features (Kukreja, 1978).\nFig. 6. A compositions clay and straw are main building materials from\nnorthern and Eastern part of Basra.\n7. Conclusion:\nDefining of green building is vary with time and change as\npeople’s outlooks and education variations, it is neither easy\nnor absolute. Furthermore adjusting to a new-architectural\nawareness with a vernacular conception is difficult for many\narchitects who have been educated in a culture that despises\nthe aesthetics of what they see as twee vernacular cottages. By\nthe way the artistic and serviceable housing opportunities\nremain innumerable and fun opportunities. Strategies to\ndecrease environmental effects can and should vary depending\non the site. The selection of building materials is generally\ncritical because there is little alteration in the material’s\nenvironmental effects and because they play an animated role\nboth architecturally and in terms of the effect on the external\nenvironment near a residential use. For example, the term\n'environmentally compatible' submits that suitable effects for\nhumans and ecosystems can still be done with maximum\namounts of emissions and limited pollution. This study\ndiscusses the requirements of building materials suitable for\nbio-climatic building in the zone between Iraq and Iran where\nthe meaning of the contemporary building category is an\napplication of the bio-climatic concept which is very difficult.\nIn all places sustainable home thinking about the\nenvironmental effects in the overall processes is implied in\nhouses. The zone between Iraq and Iran specifically Basra had\nthree different microclimates: regular hot climate in the city\ncenter, a marshland district and desert region. This study tries\nto investigate an existing habitat in s zone that has different\nmicroclimates. The Ecology of building materials is an\nencounter concerning the possibilities for existing materials\nand the evaluation of new materials. Yet a complete ecological\nstructure does not be present but a building can always be\nmade more ecological and less environmentally impactful. The\nmain conclusion of the study shows that: The local\nmicroclimate directly influences the conformation of habitat so\nthe choice of building materials takes a high priority in the\nbuilding process. Clay, straw, breeds, and brick are the most\ncommonly applied building materials. These materials were\nused efficiently in vernacular houses and when insulating\nhabitats, the interrelated environmental impact of the selection\nof insulation materials is not relevant compared to the savings\n\nجمةلتقبلية\n \nحبوث مس\nJournal of Prospective Researches32\n60716.01/jpr.v24i2.pp23-29\nin energy. To provision the meaning of the building in the\nresidual value of the primary material, the maintenance and\nrepairs must be carried out on all components corresponding\nto their specific renewal cycles. For future research the life\ncycle of building materials by concentrating on the experiences\nof vernacular houses from this zone should be improved the\ncreate a creative interference where advanced material can be\nused in new buildings with an increasing life cycle of current\nmaterials. Brick, clay and wooden structures should be\ndeveloped to occupy a more extensive place in our residential\nbuildings than they do today. The goal of the study is to assist\narchitects and designers in choosing apposite solutions in\nterms of building materials. Then the studying of different\nbuilding materials from numerous sources and their\ncharacteristic is necessary to adapt to traditional materials in\nmodern and innovative applications as well as create a good\nsolution in terms of building materials for the studied zone\nspecifically.\nReferences\nAlmusaed, A., and Almssad, A.

In this way, the practical\nproblem \ncan be solved (Ginvoni Man, 1976). Throughout history, the human being has striven to erect shelters that fulfil\nbasic \nneeds relating to his survival, shelter that provides an environment favourable to his physical requirements. During his\nyears \nof effort to achieve that environment, many local variations in dwellings have evolved (Wenzel, 1996). According to a\nUN \ndocument, the purpose of the habituation process is not to build houses but to ovulate a competent house. In other words,\nthe \nhouse should provide the security of technical advice and be involved in acquiring small loans and cheap materials (Stulz,\n1981). \nClimatic conditions compel the builder to find an efficient solution to serve the human being and the comfort of his\nexistence. \nBuilding materials have an important impact on the home’s functions and inhabitants. Environmental building\nmaterials \nadd value to human life and reduce the negative impact on the environment drastically. In West Asia, climates,\nenvironmental \nelements with heavy buildings and shaded courtyards are common. These climates typically have a huge\ndiurnal \ntemperature range, and houses tend to employ an arrangement of these measures, with the particular mix being\nmodulated \nto suit local micro-climatic characteristics. Selecting and specifying environmental building materials are often\ncomplicated \nprocesses (Jester, 1995).\nBuilders \nfrom this region created their habitats taking into consideration the above-mentioned question, in an efficient\nmanner \nand to fit human needs by adapting to local environmental parameters. Each building material displays the different\nphysical \ncharacteristics; the structure requires rigid strength to support the dead weight of the roof and walls. If the situation\ndictates \nthe range of fitting materials, together they command the form. West Asia’s vast landmasses are diverse in geology\nand \nclimate (Almusaed, 1997). This investigation has to find suitable solutions for building materials and then study\ndifferent \nbuilding materials from various sources and based on its characteristics of eco-energy house efficiency. The main\nlesson \nwe can learn from this study is not only to further the conservation and repossession of the form of habitats already in\nexistence, \nbut also to rethink what can form new habitats for the future (Fig. 1).\n2. \nClimate-specific effects\nClimate \nis the main factor that directly affects the construction process and building materials in West Asia. This region is\nsituated \nin the subtropics’ climate zone. It is affected by the subtropics’ high-pressure belt, which reaches the farthest north\nin \nthe summer. The sky in West Asia is bright and glaring, even when thinly clouded. As one goes inland from the equator,\nseasonal \ndifferences in climate become more marked with a wetter wet season, and a drier winter period (Kukreja, 1978).\nThere \nare many factors that affect building materials of traditional buildings from West Asia. Solar radiation deteriorates\norganic \nmaterials by initiating chemical reactions within the material and causing oxidation. Fig. 2 shows the monthly\naverage \ntemperature and sunshine hours in the West Asia Region. In this region, edifices have to be planned with great\nattention \nand thought, and with due respect for climate. Shade and protection from dust storms may have the highest\npriority \nin some areas, whereas in other areas, ventilation and the trapping of air streams and breeze are the primary goals.\nThe \neffect of climate over the building materials is large; high temperatures, for example, can affect all types of materials in\ngeneral. \nThe speed of a chemical reaction doubles for every 10 8C increase in temperature (Nielsen, 2010).\nIn \naddition, increasing levels of humidity can increase the deterioration physically and by creating an environment for\nharmful \nfungus and microbial growth as well as insect attacks. Changes in humidity also cause deterioration through\nchanges \nin volume and stress within the material.\n3. \nInvestigation methods\nAN \nenvironmental profile is achieved on the basis of the SBI (DK) calculation programme, BEAT 2000, which is a\nstandardised \ntechnique for classifying and measuring the environmental effects related to building materials in their life\nFig. 1. The different building systems categories from West Asia Region.\nA. \nAlmusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–54 43\n\ncycles (11). It consists of seven parameters that cover all essential physical environmental impacts and effects. It is possible\nto \nexamine an environmental profile indicator using the same indicator on another one. The first indicator is resource\nconsumption, \nwhere the environmental impacts of resource benefits can be composed of a loss of resources and space\nconsumption \nand risks of gas extraction or a cultivation process. The study will use three circumstances. The first is the\nability \nof the material to engage in a recycling process, where it can provide for the immediate environment by reducing the\nuse \nof new resources. Knowledge materials are a part of the renewable resource process, such as, in the building of plant\nmaterials, \nmainly wood, or non-renewable resources, such as mineral substances like brick, concrete and metals. The second\nindicator \nis the environmental impact of energy consumption. In this situation, the study will use three circumstances:\nrenewable \nfeedstock energy, the heat of combustion of renewable resources, where is wood is the principal base\nproduct; \nnon-renewable feedstock energy, such as plastic; and renewable energy, such as energy from wind and\nhydropower \nproduction and biofuels. Last is non-renewable energy, such as coal, oil, gas. These energy sources are\ncharacterised \nby a limited quantity at disposal, and their use gives rise to, among other things, the greenhouse effect.\nThe \nthird indicator is a greenhouse effect, which shows the environmental impact of greenhouse-gas emissions. The\nanthropogenic \ngreenhouse effect is due to cord gases (including carbon dioxide, methane and other) for the retention\ntraps \nheat radiation that would otherwise radiate from the earth into space. In this way, they contribute to atmospheric\nwarming. \nAcidification influence is a fourth indicator that shows the environmental impact of the emissions of\nacidifying \ncompounds (mainly sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides), which attack plant foliage and acidify the soil.\nNitrogen \nimpact is a fifth indicator, which shows the environmental impact of the discharge of substances containing\nnitrogen \nor phosphorus. They can cause the growth of algae or plants to increase out of balance in relation to, and to the\ndetriment \nof, the global ecosystem. The toxification effect is a sixth indicator of the environmental profile, showing the\nenvironmental \nimpact of the emissions of substances that have acute and chronic toxic effects on humans. Disposability\nis \nthe last indicator of environmental profiles and shows what happens to a building, structure or material once its life is\nover. \nIn this situation, the study will use three circumstances: recycling/high-value recycling, the direct reuse of the\nmaterial \nin its original form or reuse of the material innovatively through the production of new materials (Marsh,\n2000). \nA low-worth recycling/incineration, the recycling of material for the production of brand new materials of lower\nquality, \nor burning the material with energy; and hazardous waste, where the material contains substances that must be\ndisposed \nof according to law (Table 1).\nComparisons \nare an instrument of inquiry. Materials related to environmental impacts can be assessed in relation to other\nfactors \nsuch as energy consumption and the greenhouse effect, which is divided into the following:\n\u000f Materials\n\u000f Acclimatisation\nA \nmaterial impact on the environment should not be observed in isolation from other environmental factors. The\nenvironmental \nimpact of certain materials or structures can be compared to other factors (Dinesen, 1997). The\nenvironmental \nprofile can compare the environmental impact per m\n2 \n-floor areas of the house’s acclimatisation needs and its\nbuilding \nmaterials. The calculation of housing accumulation requires using the approach developed by SBI for the calculation\nprogramme \nBV95. The calculated cooling & heating requirements are then converted to gross energy consumption and CO\n2\nemissions.\nFig. 2. The average weather in West Asia Region.\nA. \nAlmusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–5444\n\n4. Specific building materials nominated\nA \nbuilding is built to be occupied by humans. As such, it makes sense that architects, be they Classical, Renaissance,\nModern, \nor contemporary, would use the human body as inspiration or a principle of design (Korydon, 2012). The building\nenvelope \nis a man’s barrier against external atmospheric conditions and their fluctuations. Builders from this zone have\nchosen \nthree varied categories, in the building material’s selecting process. These are mineral materials, organic materials\nand \nmixture material.\n4.1. \nOrganic building materials\nThis \nis the first building material utilised by human beings in the building process. It comes from renewable resources and\ncan \nbe extracted by humans easily; therefore, it is an ecological material with many good proprieties and can be successfully\nused \nin the construction process. It is a large part of human life (Brown, 1990). It is a popular building material because of it is\nspecific \nenvironmental friendliness and great energy values. The main benefits of these materials are their cheapness,\nprevalence, \nand excellent proprieties of thermal and acoustical insulation.\n4.1.1. \nReeds\nReed \nis an organic building material; it has good resistance to water actions. It contains a high ratio of silicon substance,\nwhich \nleads to it being durable and flexible in technical action and structures; however, it is a highly flammable material. The\nhigh \nconcentration of silica in the reeds makes this material unattractive for insects and other animals. Reed meets all the\nrequirements \nto be an efficient insulator. The form of the stem allows it to serve all manners of functions (Elias, 1980). It is an\nexcellent \nthermal and acoustic insulator material. The relative durability and flexibility in construction are the most\nimportant \nproprieties of reeds. The unique properties of reeds have been noted for a long time, in all regions of the world\n(Lauren, \n2000). The influence of reeds on pathogenic bacteria is particularly intense. Reeds from the marshland region consist\nof \nseveral types of plants whose stems differ in thickness, flexibility and chemical composition. The most popular reeds used\nin \nthe construction process are ‘‘Ihdri’’, the regional name of this type of reed. The building of walls with reeds is much less\nlabour \nintensive than that with other materials such as brick, adobe, or stone, and requires considerably less skill. Reed\nbuilding \nis forgiving, encourages individual creativity, and leads to final structures that are climatically adapted and energy\nefficient. \nReed does have some disadvantages. Its natural durability is lower than wood, and it must be treated with\npreservatives \nto last in exposed locations.\n4.1.2. \nStraw\nStraw \nis a material with high thermal efficiency. It has an R-value substantially better than those of other traditional\nbuildings, \ndepending on the type of straw; it consists of barley that is 36% cellulose, 26% pentoses, 17% linen, wax, protein and\nash \n– a composition very similar to wood. The straw has excellent insulation properties. Straw’s biological functions include\nits \naxis for water. Therefore, straw bales are good at transporting moisture and thus regulate interior humidity, provided they\nbear \nthe diffusion through open screen and coatings. Straw’s weaknesses are risk of fire, insects or decay refraction caused by\nlong-term, \nhigh moisture content (Gillv, 1970). Straw can provide greatly improved comfort, and dramatic energy savings\ncompared \nto more expensive traditional building structures because they allow for smaller heating or cooling systems in\nconventional \nhomes because of the increased insulation. Bale building is of particular value in severe environments where\nenergy \nis costly.\n4.1.3. \nWood\nWood \nis an organic material, a natural combination of cellulose fibres (that are strong in tension) embedded in a matrix\nthat \nresists compression (Janssen, 1988). The principal components in wood are cellulose (40–50%) and hemicellulose\n(15–25%), \nwith lignin (15–30%) as well as other material such as sugar, starch and protein. The technical properties of wood\nare \nhighly dependent on the type and moisture content. It also contains varying other elements depending on the type,\nTable 1\nEnvironmental \nprofiles indicators using in eco-energy buildings materials efficiency analysis.\nEnvironmental \nprofiles indicators Analysis factors\nResource \nconsumption Ability to recycling\nprocess \n(ARP.)\nRenewable \nresources (RR) Nonrenewable resources (NRR)\nEnergy \nconsumption Renewable feedstock\nenergy \n(RFE)\nNon-renewable \nfeedstock\nenergy \n(NRFE)\nRenewable \nenergy (RE) Nonrenewable\nenergy \n(NRE)\nGreenhouse \neffect GE\nAcidification \ninfluence AI\nNitrogen \nimpact NI\nIntoxication \neffect IE\nDisposability \nAbility to recycling (AR) Low worthy recycling (LWR) Hazardous waste (HW)\nA. \nAlmusaed, A.

There are two forms of wood, softwood and hardwood, which\nare \nsubdivided into a number of different types (Edward and Joseph, 2011).\nWood \nhas a high caloric value (between 12.5 MJ/kg and 20.1 MJ/kg). Thermal re-utilisation of untreated and uncoated wood\nis \nun-problematic. Re-utilisation is possible if the wood is dismantled without damage. Untreated old wood conventionally can\nbe \nused as raw material for a number of different applications (Woolley, 2006). The conversion of wood into a sustainable,\nrenewable \nresource to be used as a main building material could be beneficial in various areas of the world.\n4.2. \nMineral building material\nMineral \nmaterials are made from non-renewable resources dug on land or at sea. They are homogeneous, naturally\noccurring \nsolid inorganic materials with a clear crystal structure and a definite chemical composition (Damon, 1983).\nBuilders \nfrom this zone have found good building materials from the local neighbourhood. Two essential building materials\nwere \nselected in the building process: clay and brick, which are near the required scale of humans.\n4.2.1. \nClay\nToday, \nclay offers the only practical prospect for building the five hundred million houses that will be required in the\ncoming \nyears (Anil, 1981). A mass of clay has extraordinary formability and robustness. Excellent adhesion and bonding\nforces \ncount as the main properties of clay.\n4.2.2. \nBrick\nBrick \nis used as a principal building material from zone ‘‘I’’. The typical house from Sumerian age was a one-story\nconstruction \nmade from baked or sun-dried mud-brick. The family house included the following structure functions: a living\nroom, \nkitchen, open courtyard, servant’s residences, etc. A brick-building element has excellent thermal resistance (Barry,\n1988).\nThe \nmaterial is very efficient in energy consumption and can be accepted as a bio-ecological material, especially in West\nAsia. \nClay bricks are a more thermally inert material, and chemical reactions are relatively low. Thus, the effects of green\nhouses \nare limited (Manand har, 1983). The recycling of clay bricks can be a difficult process due to the unavoidable mortar,\nrender \nand plaster residue that tends to adhere to the bricks, particularly when such products have high cement content.\nHowever, \nolder brick is easier to recycle because much of it was constructed using lime mortar (Manfred et al., 2006).\n4.3. \nMixture of building materials\n4.3.1. \nClay + straw\nThis \nis one of the ancient building practices known. Clay is odourless, non-toxic and pleasant to work with in combination\nwith \nstraw, creating a soft to pulpy prepared mix of clay and vegetable fibres (straw) that can be used for filling the panels in\ntimber-framed \nbuildings or pressed in moulds for making clay bricks and boards. Ready-made mixes are now available on\nthe \nmarket. The density of the mixture building material of clay and straw is 1200–1700 kg/m\n3 \n. A mix of clay and straw is a\nheterogeneous \nmaterial, with good thermal properties (Easton, 1996). Fig. 3 shows the environmental profile comparative\nanalytical \ninterpretation of environmental profiles of 1 m\n2 \nof different building materials.\nThe \nstraw–clay mix creates a unique, breathable combination of high insulation with thermal mass.\nFig. 3. Comparative analytical interpretation of environmental profiles of 1 m\n2 \nof different building materials.\nA. \nAlmusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–5446\n\n5. Building systems of heritage practices (case study from Basra habitats)\nThe \ncity is located in a region of the historic area of Sumer, the hometown of the fictional character Sinbad the Sailor, and a\nsuggested \nplace of the Garden of Eden. It held a significant position in the early regional history and was founded in 636 AD. It\nincludes \nthree different habitat arrangements. The first appeared in the north part of the city in the zone of marshes, Zone III.\nAnother \ntype appeared in the south part of the city in the desert area, Zone II. The last appeared the middle part of the city\nbeside \nthe big-city river Shat Al-Arab, Zone I, as shown in Fig. 4.\nFrom \nthe practical experiences of the building process, specific habitat units from historical experiences were more\nrelated \nto the objective context (Solar Handbook, 1986). One of the most effective interventions of an old building from this\nregion \nwas respecting balances between many environmental factors to create a particular building style, which makes the\nbalances \nbetween human life and the milieu condition optimal. The notion of ecological building is not an absolute\n(Almusaed, \n1996; Marsh, 2000). It is, therefore, more correct to use the words more or less environmentally friendly, healthy\nor \nwilling ecology (Doran and Cather, 2013). However, that is not sufficient in practical experience. Accordingly, old builders\nof \nthe city and region took into account many other factors. One important factor was the implication of bio-climatic\nconcepts \nin the building process\n- Why a bio-climatic building concept?\nThe \nclimate has a primary influence on architectural form, not only in the challenges it poses to the builder but also in\nthe \nmaterials it supports. In bio-climatic building conception, the edifice is converted to a subsystem of a vast\nenvironmental \nsystem that should be examined carefully. The holistic integration of subsystems in the system is critical.\nThere \nare clear interpretations in native architecture (Houben and Guillaud, 1984). The temperature of the ground or walls\ncan \nbe substantially different from that of the neighbouring atmosphere. In bio-climatic buildings from Basra, the earth is\nvaluable \nas a shelter, particularly in conjunction with landscaping.\n- Specific houses From Basra\nBasra’s \ntraditional habitat has evolved within these constraints; it can be defined as architecture without architects: not\nthat \nit is created without overall supervision, just that it is not in the hands of a sophisticated urban professional. Instead, it\nis \nvernacular in that it is the product of well-tried local craftsmen raised in the use of local materials to confront local social\nand \nenvironmental conditions. Glazed windows are not part of the Basra tradition. In the warmer regions, glass inhibits the\nflow \nof air in summer. Openings are sealed against the winter cold by opaque shutters or cloth screens. Rural housing often\nlacks \nwindow openings, making for a dark interior (Namdin, 1996). Building materials are convenient, readily available and\ncan \nbe made and used by the city builders to build their habitats. In all housing’ models, the allocation of habitat functions\nin \nthe house resembles the shape of a tree, where the main building element is a courtyard, which is point ‘‘zero’’ in the\nhouse \nstructure. The most common characteristic of the houses of the hot and humid regions is their openness. They are\nconstructed \nto catch every breeze that occurs, for natural air currents are the best relief in humid climates [8-2]. All habitat\nfunctions \nare allocated around the courtyard with a hierarchy approach. The most important is for functions of living, such\nas \na living room. Next come service areas, such as kitchens. In this study, we investigated three different cases where old\nbuilders \nconstructed something appropriate for the environmental, climatic and human requirements.\n5.1. \n‘‘Old Basra Habitat’’ from zone I\nA \nhigh temperature, ‘‘T’’, due to the heat island phenomenon is a major risk factor that affects housing configurations and\ncompositions \nin this zone. The recommendation is to create a habitat unit that adapts to extreme climate with a series of\nFig. 4. Building zones from Basra.\nA. \nAlmusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–54 47\n\ninterferences such as significant thermal insulation, profound shadows on facades, and natural stream ventilations\nthroughout \nthe building functions and structures (Fig. 5).\n5.1.1. \nThe house mechanism\nIn \nOld Basra, a house is considered beautiful if it is capacious and if the situation is airy and exposed on all sides to the\nwind, \nespecially to the northern breeze. A healthy house has its courtyards, basins of water, and wooden pieces on the\nfront \nof the fac¸ade ‘‘Shanashil.’’ A handsome house is seen without terraces, with ‘‘Shanashil’’ on which the family may\nsleep \nduring the night (Fathy, 1986). Most of the old Basra distinct habitats are decorated, usually to show invisible spirits\nand \ndemons and to satisfy local traditions. Building materials have to be strictly respected (see Fig. 10). The habitat area is\ndivided \ninto two functional zones: a social area that includes the living room, kitchen, storage room, and bathroom and a\nprivate \narea that includes bedrooms. Communication between all operational areas occurs throughout the courtyard\n(Table \n2).\n5.1.2. \nTechnical house description\nThe \nhabitat area of this edifice is ca. 125 m\n2 \n: the social area is 30%, the private area is 45%, and the courtyard is 25%. The\nbuilding \nmaterials used in the creation of the house are as follows:\n\u000f The roof is made of 10 cm of clay and straw, which improves the roof’s resistances to waterproofing and high temperature;\n3 \ncm of pressed straw; 10 cm of reeds; 5 cm of pressed straw and 10 cm of wood as a structural element.\n\u000f The floor is made of a 40 cm layer of clay and eventually sand as a healthy ground, and a 12 cm layer of brick.\n\u000f The exterior wall is combined with an inner wall with 24 cm of brick.\n\u000f The upper fac¸ade is made of wooden elements (Shanashil unit), with a thermal roll.\n\u000f The interior wall is made of 12 cm of brick.\n\u000f The estimated life cycle is 100 years.\nFig. 5.

Brick is the main material used in this construction. The impact on the\nenvironment \nby acclimatisation or building materials is limited. The houses are located in row buildings in front of a narrow\nstreet, \nplaced directly by the old city river. The houses were built in the beginning of the last century.\nThe \nresults show that the release of CO\n2 \nis relative low; however, it is higher than other categories of houses. Fig. 6 shows\nthe \ninfluence of the greenhouse effect distributed on habitat development and the environmental profile for 1 m \n2\n.\nThe \nenvironmental impact of the materials is a representation of the results shown in the environmental profile of the\nsame \nhouse’s materials.\n5.2. \n‘‘Marshes House, Unit’’ from zone II\nA \nhigh humidity ‘‘H’’, due to marsh water, is a major risk factor that affects housing configurations and compositions from\nthis \nzone. A recommendation is to create a habitat unit with a building material resistant to water and humidity.\n5.2.1. \nThe house mechanism\nThe \nlocation is a historic site, from the Sumerian time. The housing configuration was founded for the preliminary time in\nthe \n‘‘Ur’’ city, where the initial settlement was founded (Ilay and Barry, 1998). UNESCO recognises the lacustrine region in the\nnorth \nof Basra as a monument of nature, representing one of the largest sites of unique ecosystem types in the world. There is\na \nlow density of people living in symbiosis with impressive flora and fauna full of rare species. In the north of Basra, on an\n‘‘Artificial \nIsland’’, the house was built in water with a weak current, and the habitat unit is made of reeds and a mixed of clay\nand \nstraw (Tobias et al., 2009). There are two ways to make the island suitable for the construction process: one is choosing\ngood \nground and the other is making it suitable for a particular case. Fig. 7 shows the different procedures for building an\nartificial \nisland.\n5.2.2. \nTechnical house description\nThe \nhabitat unit area is 147 m\n2 \n(7 \u0003 21) m:\n\u000f The habitat entrance is oriented towards the northwest, where the dominant wind originates.\nFig. 7. Different position of artificial island made for habitat unit (Abbas, 2012).\nFig. 6. The greenhouse effect spread on habitat construction and environmental profile for 1 m \n2\n.\nA. \nAlmusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–54 49\n\n\u000f The frontal fac¸ades on the axis (northwest-southeast) are perforated to allow for permanent natural cross-ventilation\n(see \nFig. 8).\n\u000f The minimum distance to the water must be approximately 10 m.\n\u000f The roof is always made of a vault form.\n\u000f The number of columns on the long side is as follows: seven pillars with the local name of Shabe, with 3 m between\n2 \npillars.\n\u000f The facade has four pillars: the roof pillars framing the entrance and the others located on the corners.\n\u000f The estimated life cycle is 25 years.\nThe \nhabitat site is created from many posts that include closely related strains of reeds between them. The height of the\npillar \n(Shabe) can reach 10 m. The diameter of the pillar (Shabe) is approximately 70 cm at the base and 20 cm at the top (Fig. 9).\n5.2.3. \nThe house’s environmental impacts\nThe \nhouse is made of lightweight constructions. The principal building material applied is reed. Table 3 shows different\nmaterial \nused in the composition and the percentage of building materials in layers.\nA \ndemonstration shows that houses made of reeds are friendlier environmentally, with a positive impact on the\nenvironment \nand less energy consumption. A short life cycle material presents negative aspects to a building system. Fig. 10\nshows \nthe greenhouse effect for a habitat construction and the environmental profile for 1 m \n2 \n.\n5.3. \nThe ‘‘Al-Zubeir House, Unit’’ from zone III\nThe \nsandy wind ‘‘W’’, which is due to the Sahara Desert environment in the Arabian Peninsula, is a major risk factor that\naffects \nhouse configurations and compositions from this zone. Here, a blind wall is recommended.\n5.3.1. \nThe house mechanism\nIn \nmany ways, the earth is the most prominent material used in natural buildings. Earth can be found everywhere, and, as\na \nresult, it used to be said that the majority of the world’s population still lived in earth buildings (Keefe, 2005). Of course,\nconcrete \nand bricks are made of material from the earth, but what will be discussed here are structures that are made of earth\nin \nits most natural state, with a minimum amount of treatment or processing (Wenzel, 1996). Strong prevailing sandy winds\nprovoke \na builder’s response, resulting in lower, blind fac¸ades, flatter buildings offering less resistance and thus less prone to\nbuilding \ndamage and human discomfort. Experiences from the old building process show that malleable building materials\ncan \nbe employed when the climate is humid and are rigid when the climate is dry. Usually wet clay is used directly, mixed\nwith \nStraw, and perhaps given more body by adding gravel or stone. This is prominent in areas of the world where earth\nFig. 8.

When abandoned, they will not leave anything\nunpleasant \nbehind (Wenzel, 1996). The extraction of clay, especially on a site where a house is due to be created, is a zero-\ncarbon \nsolution for construction, and clay and straw walls and floors can be used as a direct substitute for mass concrete\n(Marchell \nand Leary, 1974).\nThe \n‘‘Al-Zubeir House, Unit’’ building, in its architecture without architects, notes that inexperienced builders fitted their\nwork \nto the local environment and topography. Basra’s vast variety of environments and local microclimate assures a\ncorrespondingly \nwide range of a reply. The beauty of the ‘‘Al-Zubeir House Units’’ design derives less from self-conscious\ndecorative \nattempts than from unadulterated, practical outlines produced by adapting regional material to be as economical\nas \npossible, resisting aggressive environmental elements and employing beneficial ones. Habitats from an Al-Zubeir district\nare \ntruly vernacular, utilising only slightly altered material from its immediate surroundings. Rural, desert architecture is\nremarkable \nfor its sculptural shapes achieved in clay.\n5.3.2. \nTechnical house description\nIn \nthis zone, edifices have to be planned with great attention and thought and with due respect for climate. Shade and\nprotection \nfrom dust storms may have the highest priority in some areas, whereas in other regions, ventilation and the\ntrapping \nof air currents and breeze are the primary considerations (Kukreja, 1978) (see Fig. 11). The courtyard space is an\nessential \nelement in the habitat from zone III, where all habitat functions are allocated together and are oriented towards the\ncourtyard. \nIntimacy is necessary in cultural life. All primary functions are oriented towards the house courtyard directly. The\nunit \ninvolves just one level (Fig. 12).\nFig. 11. A compositions clay and straw are main building materials from northern and Eastern part of Basra.\nFig. 12. The greenhouse effect distributed on habitat construction, and environmental profile for 1 m \n2\n.\nA. \nAlmusaed, A. Almssad / Case Studies in Construction Materials 2 (2015) 42–5452\n\nThe habitat area of this edifice is of ca. 450 m\n2 \n, where the social area is 10%, the private area is 35%, and the courtyard is\n55%. \nThe building materials used in the conception of the house are as follows:\n\u000f The roof is made of the mixture of 10 cm of clay and straw, 3 cm of pressed straw, 10 cm of reeds, 5 cm of pressed straw and\n10 \ncm of wood as a structural element\n\u000f The floor is made of a 30 cm layer of clay and eventually sand, as a solid base, and a 10 cm layer of clay and straw.\n\u000f The exterior wall is combined with an inner face layer of 3 cm special clay and straw, or 25 cm of clay and straw and the\nsame \ninner face of 3 cm clay and straw.\n\u000f The interior wall is made of 15 cm clay and straw.\n\u000f The estimated life cycle is 50 years.\nHabitat \nshapes vary from a rectangular plan and extension to the north to a square one. The conglomeration of buildings\ncreates \na progression of private space, which is enclosed by a clay wall; therefore, a courtyard is created by this process\n(Jensen, \n1997). The system was developed for individual utility, free of fixed rules. Each building is oriented in relation to its\nneighbours.\n5.3.3. \nHouse environmental impacts\nThe \nprincipal building material applied is clay and straw. Table 4 shows the different material used in house compositions\nand \nthe percentage of materials in layers.\nThe \nhouse material components are environmentally friendly and better employed in energy-efficiency features.\n6. \nConclusion\nDefining \nthe qualities of an environment is neither easy nor absolute. They vary with time and change as people’s\nexpectations \nand education changes. Moreover, adapting to a new-architectural idea with a vernacular conception is difficult\nfor \nmany architects who have been educated in a culture that despises the aesthetics of what they see as ‘twee’ vernacular\ncottages. \nIncidentally, the aesthetic and functional housing opportunities remain innumerable and fun opportunities.\nRespect \nis given a high priority. Strategies to reduce environmental impacts can and should vary depending on the site. The\nselection \nof building materials is, overall, crucial because there is little difference in the material’s environmental impacts\nand \nbecause they play a vital role both architecturally and in terms of the impact on the external environment near a\nresidential \nuse. For instance, the term ‘‘environmentally compatible’’ suggests that acceptable effects for humans and\necosystems \ncan still be achieved with maximum amounts of emissions and limited contamination. This study discusses the\nrequirements \nof building materials suitable for bio-climatic building in West Asia, where the meaning of the contemporary\nbuilding \ncategory is an application of the bio-climatic concept, which is very complex. Everywhere, sustainable home\nthinking \nabout the environmental impacts in the overall processes is implicit in houses.\nBasra \nhad three different microclimates (a marshland district, desert region and regular hot climate in the city centre).\nThis \nstudy tries to investigate an existing habitat in the Iraq–Iran area that has different microclimates. Vernacular building\nmaterials \nsuch as clay, brick, straw and wood, are the most popular building materials used in this region. The Ecology of\nBuilding \nMaterials is a challenge regarding the possibilities for existing materials and the evaluation of new materials.\nNevertheless, \na complete ecological structure does not exist. However, a building can always be made more ecological and\nless \nenvironmentally impactful. The principal conclusion of the study shows that:\ni. The local microclimate directly influences the conformation of habitat. Therefore, the choice of building materials takes a\nhigh \npriority in the building process. Clay and straw, breeds, and brick are most frequently applied building materials.\nii. Natural materials were used efficiently in vernacular houses. It is clear that when insulating habitats; the interrelated\nenvironmental \nimpact of the selection of insulation materials is not relevant compared to the savings in energy.\nTable 4\nThe \n‘‘Al-Zubeir House, Unit’’ compositions, areas and percentage.\nExternal \nwalls\n(52%) \nof\ntotal \nareas\nGlass \npanels\n(1%) \nof total\nareas\nRoof \n(14%)\nof \ntotal areas\nGround \nslab\n(16%) \nof total areas\nInner \nwalls\n(12%) \nof total areas\nFoundation\n(5%) of total\nareas\nMaterials \nAreas Mat.

Heavy materials (Bricks) used in the exterior or interior reduce energy requirements. In contrast, clay- and reed-based\nmaterials \nhave a lower material-related environmental impact.\nv. To support the meaning of the building in the residual value of the primary fabric, maintenance and repairs must be\ncarried \nout on all components corresponding to their specific renewal cycles.\nvi. For future research, the life cycle of building materials by focusing on the experiences of vernacular houses from this zone\nshould \nbe increased the create a creative intervention where innovative material can be used in new buildings with an\nincreasing \nlife cycle of current materials.\nvii. Brick, clay and wooden constructions should be improved to occupy a more considerable place in our residential\nbuildings \nthan they do today.\nThe \nobjective of the study is to assist architects and designers in selecting suitable solutions in terms of building\nmaterials. \nIn addition to studying different building materials from various sources and their characteristic, it is necessary to\nadapt \nto traditional materials in modern, innovative applications and create a good solution in terms of building materials for\nWest \nAsia specifically.\nReferences\nAbbas A.

What specific traditional building techniques or materials from the Mosul region could be effectively combined with modern sustainable technologies?\n\n2. How can the concept of the traditional courtyard house be adapted to incorporate passive cooling and heating strategies in modern designs?\n\n3. Are there any local materials (like reeds, clay, or specific types of stone) that could be sustainably sourced and used in modern construction to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings?\n\n4. How can traditional water management techniques (like qanats or rainwater harvesting) be integrated with modern water conservation technologies?\n\n5. What cultural or social aspects of traditional Iraqi architecture should be preserved or reinterpreted in sustainable modern designs to maintain a sense of place and identity?\n\nRegarding the presentation length, given the complexity of the topic and the wealth of information you have, I would recommend expanding to 15-20 slides.

            "extracted_content": "Okay, so I'm going to try to think through this element of the assessment. Sorry, the curriculum.\n\nAnd so there are a couple of ways that we can cut it up. And one of those ways, remember the flow chart that we made where there's an assessment, and then they take the skills, and then they go into the technical training.\n\nThat's one path that we can follow. Another way that we can organize and structure the assessment and training is past, present, future.\n\nAnd so the past would be like learning from islamic architecture, learning from local materials and natural products, and then the future could be, you know, integrating. The present would be integrating, like, solar panels and better insulation techniques.\n\nAnd the future would be about them doing a design project and thinking about kind of how they would go about these things. Another so element is the green comp, which has these kind of skills like critical thinking, future planning, systems thinking, and different, you know, skills like that.\n\nThe green comp is, I think, the easiest thing to do as an assessment and a training program, but it doesn't address the things that they want. And this is why the thing I sent on WhatsApp that has this stuff around financial literacy, and let's read that.\n\nYeah. Element.\n\nSo there's the modules for resource efficiency, sustainable repair and maintenance, affordable house construction, intro to sustainable construction. And I kind of feel like maybe instead of doing it like this, like I'm talking because it helps me think.\n\nAnd so I'm. If you can, you know, I think what I'm seeing right now is maybe the broad themes can be something like past, present, future, and it could still have these modules in it.\n\nAnd maybe there's like, this is like, I think two things that I want to present. One is going to be about general mindset competencies and overall skills around planning and design.\n\nAnd then secondly, there needs to be an element of, like, case studies, local materials, local projects, things that are present that can be enhanced rather than looking outside. I think what I would like to do is, as much as possible, find what's already there and get people to learn about it and maybe get inspired by other things that are happening in Iraq and other things that are happening in the Middle east and trying to keep it close.\n\nSo I think that's my main thoughts so far on the curriculum. There's additional elements to think about as well.\n\nSo we have one element of the green comp, and then we have the elements of these practical things around, resource efficiency, financial literacy, sustainable repair and maintenance, affordable house construction. And I kind of feel like maybe the way that we think about the past and the present can fall into these different things.\n\nRight. So for instance, like affordable house construction in the past, we can talk about how building with local materials, looking at the cost of home building, and then do the same for modern materials and what are the novel techniques that we can use and how it impacts the affordability of houses and then sustainable repair and maintenance.\n\nAnd we can talk about how that actually addresses the. When you use local materials, it's a lot easier to maintain and to repair.\n\nAnd the resource efficiency, same thing. We can kind of use that guide of past and present to kind of be a bit of a compass and.\n\nYeah, what else? So there's like the broad skills that are intellectual, and then there are the skills related to finances, related to energy, related to.\n\nSo, yeah, affordability and like the financial stuff often, yeah, it would be interesting to see like, what are the elements of sustainability that are connected to a house. It's like energy use, it's water use, it's material use, and how it impacts all of these things.\n\nI guess it almost always comes down to, like, energy and cost. Right.\n\nAnd yeah, I'd be curious to see if there's anything else that we need to consider when it comes to this. And then of course, there's like legislation that kind of motivates road disincentivizes these things and.\n\nYeah, so maybe this is where I'll have to, like, maybe show them multiple approaches. Right.\n\nOne approach is the mental stuff, critical thinking, problem solving, caring about sustainability, all the stuff in the green comp that's already there. And then the stuff around like resources, water, energy and environmental factors like air quality and how.\n\nHow it feels to be in it, and then the dirtiness of the construction process as well. It needs to be like the full life cycle of the house should be assessed when you consider its sustainable practices.\n\nAnd giving people kind of this bird's eye view of sustainable education is one thing of like the mental stuff, the green comp stuff, and then the other thing, which is the practical stuff. And then once you have all of that kind of awareness of the past and the ways that people built homes and managed energy, water and resources and the present and how we do the management of these things, and then it would be like the practical stuff.\n\nHow do you take what you've learned and to think about where do you go from here? Do you get an internship to learn a practical skill around solar?\n\nAre you more interested in developing around insulation? Are you working more on different ways of designing homes for cooling systems?\n\nAnd then maybe we go to an architecture firm for cooling systems. And maybe it could be nice to have like, a really cool example of different ways of doing each of these three things and kind of maybe making a model somehow of the sustainability factors and then somehow maybe connecting it to one of these, like Leed or green building certifications.\n\nLike you get this broad overview and then if you want, you can continue to go deeper into your education and connect to the green thing. Right now, I think I don't need to, like, have the answers.\n\nI need to show these different directions. One being the kind of green comp and like, the mental skills of, you know, design thinking and systems thinking and complexity systems, and then the other being kind of connecting to what is even sustainable reconstruction about what are the fundamental things we need to think about, energy, water resource use, clean construction, full life cycle, all of that stuff.\n\nAnd then we can have a moment where we also talk about practical technical skills that people can learn during internships. And that's like the internship flow.\n\nAnd then the other element can be design and come up with an idea entrepreneurship flow. And yeah, I think this would be good to kind of send into an AI to get insights from it."
