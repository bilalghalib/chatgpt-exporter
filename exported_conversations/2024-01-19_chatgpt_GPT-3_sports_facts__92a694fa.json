      "content": "This is a journal for Jan 19 2023, can you keep most of the content and structure (Freeflowing is ok), just turn it into a clustered and grouped journal entry, start with the clusters of themes. Keep the language as is as much as possible, just add some grammar and structure:\n\nif things are underlined underline them and bold all the important elements:\nHey, okay, so we are going for a walk with a baby and it's really nice. I'm glad to have him. Today is my day with the baby and he's asleep on my chest and I am going to go for a small walk. Maybe I'll go to a Citadel and just a reminder to myself, I probably should get that shoe thing. That thing that you wear to make it easy to wear your shoes when you're holding a baby and you can't really bend down, that would be great. And then I was thinking that I would like to message Krista a bit and tell her about compassionate leadership/muscular compassion requiring cultural chiropractic, not creative people. I know there are leverage points to push and how much pain to allow oneself to cause and others for our culture's mutual benefit. And I thought that I wanted to reach out to Gaia, Mushon, wanted to reach out to Joe Edelman, asked Pascal when I should come to Paris. I thought that I should encourage today's the day to buy the glasses. Here, buy the glasses. I'm going to send it to Amen and just see if Shalomah, when Amen is able to come. And actually, I don't know, I guess there's an import fee if it comes in the, what's it called, in the airplane. Sorry, in the mail. But maybe someone's coming to France and Amen can ship it with them. I would actually really like it. So maybe I'm just getting ahead of myself here. But I really believe that this is something interesting. You know, it's like, like, oh, goodness, I keep finding you are, at least hills in the pocket. Okay. I think only took one. I would definitely have felt it. Now it's been two hours. Let's take one and a half Friday. It's a good day to be awake and alert and happy and alive. So I went to work also on my dad's project. I want to start looking for some of these grants to write. I thought I could also reach out to Sol and I thought I could make kind of a gamified dashboard for my objectives as the CEO, interim CEO, I CEO. And I love talking with Alex yesterday. We got to the point where we actually were getting kind of vulnerable and intimate. I had a friend tell me how he wants to die. And I mean, how he wants me to respond to him if and when, when God forbid it ever happens, he gets to the point where he needs to be accompanied into serious, debilitating illness. And I would like my friends, my dearest friend, okay, that is, I think, the mark of a true friendship. A true friend is the one whom you may take time away from your family, from your infant, to accompany them in an illness to raise money for them if they're sick. You know, I would have been peer pressured to supporting Nagel. I mean, Nagel was nice to me and kind to me. When I met him, he did actually offer me some connections to the GoClay method and this lady and he was sharing what he was learning and what he loved. And now he's sick. What responsibility do I have for that person? I thought also I could talk to Ali Hali. I could talk to Irene. I really want to do that. Maybe I should just do that right now because it's one of those things where it's like on my line to do and then I forget. And man, the ladies in Kurdistan, it's so interesting. I have kind of a type that you might say based on the people that have loved or found myself, my heart been clanging towards in the West. It's changed. Initially, it was small enough girls with bangs and I think the bangs are a consistent theme. But the person that I found myself really liking was Sema, I think, in Kurdistan. Something about this Kurdish lady was so beautiful to me. And also her personality, her presence in her way, I think. I think it's okay. It's okay to admire and to love and to respect people. I mean, that way. I mean, I'm sure. And on the flip side, I'm handsome. I'm sure people think that. But my body, yeah. So interesting. People might look at the superficial shell of myself and perhaps I will look at a superficial shell of a woman or someone that I may find physically attractive, but they may feel bad in their body. For instance, I am considered to be a physically attractive person, I think, except what you don't know is that I can't touch my toes, my hips hurt, and I could be sick. I could be looking at someone, find them devastating. Is that like a word that people use? Yeah. Find them devastating and dashing and beautiful and just a draw, right? And then realize like they have cancer or they have a terminal illness and that draw, that superficial attraction may change, may become something else, may become pity. And it changes. What does attraction do? Right? It's like, should I be with this person because they're beautiful? I mean, what is the purpose of beauty? And if God is beautiful and he loves that which is beauty, is a relationship between the love of God and beauty. So God is beautiful and he loves and the thing is like you could try to take that more abstractly. Sorry, baby. You could try to take it more abstractly and try to talk about the concept of beauty and mathematical ideals and the beauty of fresh fall and snow and the landscape. But also, this was the prophet talking about someone using money to buy clothes, right? Like it was something like that. There was someone who was like, I love nice clothes. Is it okay for me to... Oh, he has a pacifier. To... Wow. Wow. Is it okay for me to... It came from me to wear and desire and purchase clothes that I find attractive. And the prophet said that God is beautiful and he loves that which is beautiful. And I think there's something about this Ahsan and I remember Brother Ahsan Americanan, he had this love of fashion, this love of... I don't know what this is called, like suits, you know? And I think that learning to be... How does it go? Have the world in your hands, but don't close your fingers, something like that. Like own the world. It's okay for your heart to be in the world, but don't fill your heart with the world. I need to remember that there's a really beautiful quote about this, like being in the world and appreciating it. But being like a boat, right? And it's like floating and you can move from part to part and you can get and you can lose. I think that's a little bit of what Bhagava was trying to do with me when he was suggesting that I don't fall too deeply in love with my baby somehow. He was saying, \"Do your duty, love, but don't grasp.\" And of course he's speaking from his experience and the experiences he has attempting... Not even attempting, I wouldn't say Bhagava does much trying. He's definitely more of the doing kind of person, but he is becoming less... He's becoming more transparent. He's losing and wanting to associate more with oneness and non-dual states, I think. That's one way of saying it. But he's also not able to spend time with his kids because he's in a divorce and his wife's parents, I think, don't want him to spend so much time with their children. I have my baby here, my big little baby Sulayman, and he's growing up in France, but he's hearing me speak in English and insha'Allah he's also learning from me some Arabic, some Arabic. I would like to hold him lightly and accept his tears and his cry, his squirminess, such a squirmy little guy. It's so beautiful. This place, the snow on this grass, the cold winter. What a beautiful, beautiful world. Insha'Allah, seriously, insha'Allah. Yeah. So what is the point of this beauty? I think the point of this beauty is to say, make sure, protect this beautiful world of yours. Make us the good caretakers, make us able to make it possible for us to respect, become the people who deserve a world of such beauty and diversity and diverse landscapes, diverse plant life. Wow, look at that. There's steam coming out of the compost because of the organisms inside of it alive and cooking it, you know. So beautiful. I think I'll go inside of the citadel, walk for a little bit, maybe go to cup. Not sure if it's open, but probably quite a bit of a walk. And I hope the baby will be able to handle it. She's got to be back home by 10 30 11 to eat. Maybe a little long to go to cup, but just coming here is beautiful. Next time I'll wear him sooner and leave sooner so I can wear him and maybe have him be awake to show him, to share with him this wonderful world of ours. The citadel's moat is frozen and we were reflecting on beauty, purpose of beauty. Oh man, Insha'Allah. Insha'Allah. I feel like, you know, the beauty of nature and the beauty of even people and beauty of abstract beauty and the beauty of wearing good clothes. Like what happens when you wear good clothes? You feel good about yourself. You feel more confident. You feel like you respect. You know, it's like an altar. It's just like Shiloh is working on, right? The simple adornment of the human body which houses the soul with good skin, good teeth, good muscles, good clothes, good perfume, good beautiful composition is to honor that which is within us that has the divine and the divine potential to unfold beautiful character. I feel like the beauty of our clothing and the beauty of our teeth and our attempts to beautify our bodies with perfume and the right colors, all of these things. These, it's so interesting, everybody has a distinct composition of color, of hair, of eyes that requires a different external adornment. And this is sort of like acknowledging myself, my lack of capacity in language while at the same time my excess of capacity in creativity. For instance, yesterday I made a joke. What was this joke? A joke was like, um, should I exit here? Let me just double check it. I'm not sure if I'll be able to exit further. So let's look. Oh, it's already done. The joke of marketing, um, okay, um, the joke of marketing was something like, no, I can't remember it because I did it in a different language. So I'm just thinking. Yeah, I can't even remember the joke. Okay, so we're gonna leave here and, uh, potentially, yeah, it's 25 miles. I think it's a 24 minute walk. I think it's possible to do it much shorter if I exit diagonally, but, uh, yeah, let's do it. Let's go like that. Look up and go home. I'm gonna have to take bigger steps. Okay, so yeah, I told this funny joke yesterday and I think I was trying to explain my honest capacities and, and yesterday I was reflecting on my possible position as a, as an early stage founder and technical businesses, especially businesses that have, um, kind of a mission, uh, to do something, right? To, uh, solve the water crisis, for instance, or a recycling project or something that is good. And I think part of that comes from my previous need to not hurt anybody and to prove that I'm good, but also I need to acknowledge and I need to affirm the fact that God gave me technically competent, creative, interdisciplinary mind. For instance, I made, of course, using chat GPT to support, but not everyone can do this, a tool to help make a refrigerator. And this refrigerator, I guess I could conduct experiments. For instance, I don't have to just trust it. I could trust and verify. I could take the output of the temperature and actually measure it. And the cool thing is I actually have tools to do that now. And yeah, I think I'd like to get a new SIM card, put it in the basement, take the other power supply down there, set up my electronics bench, and really just get a little bit more organized in my creative work. I feel like I definitely remember seeing that there was some water research that came out that had promise. And I would like to do a landscape review of some of the water treatment possibilities, especially since we're getting into this design. And why just go and do what we know? Why not go and do the best job we possibly can and ensure that even if we're working with this design firm that I use my mind, I use Bob's mind, we use Steve's mind, and we use the best of the best of wherever it is, especially nature. And there's that element actually that I would really like to explore of like, how does falling water and the polarity of a water molecule that I have heard is possible to create power from, from Ramesh Kent. Let's go back into my notes, which I have actually inside of my E tablet, which is nice to know, actually, I'm realizing that it's pretty valuable. I wish I was better at selling things. I would sell that and maybe get a remarkable, something that's just faster to turn off than I think this problem with that is it's just really hard to turn off. And I think it's also really hard to select the pages. And maybe that's what I need to do. I need to print it. You print it, review it monthly, and then store it in the basement or something like that. I just store it. I like this. I actually think sounds like a, sounds pretty cool, actually. Take notes, just do a quick scan, that's scribble. And then maybe shrink them down. Take notes in the margins of the important parts, like a double underline or something like that. And then, or yeah, and of course, I have the GPT, continue with the process of making this record. And then from there, I could then, I don't, I always think I need to buy stuff. I have this. If I, if it sells, sell it and then buy a remarkable, if it doesn't sell, don't sell it. I could sell that tablet. I could sell my thing. I could make some of this money that I would need to be able to buy is some VR headset. And that's actually one of the things I don't want to talk about initially. And then we moved towards talking about beauty. And then from beauty, we moved to gratitude. And then from gratitude, we moved to another topic. And I feel like you may think that this is distracting and confusing, but you got to realize that one season leads to another and one conversation flows into another. And my mind works like this. Not everyone's mind works like this. And so I would like to just allow myself to be who I am, but at the same time, I would like to be sure to be able to remember it. I know the Prophet SallAllahu ah and to attend to things. And so when I say something interesting, I want to deepen deeply into that topic. And maybe a simple thing I can do is just say double underline or \"Hondre, friejolli.\" Yeah, I love this guy. I love people. Okay, hand me the left. Please be left. Please, please, please. I think something really important. First instinct, first impression of the other is love. Is Nasha Allah. How amazing is it that we get to share this beautiful world? Don't look first to objectify or judge or... And if you see beauty, say Nasha Allah. My God, grant them an increase in inner beauty. Oh yes, the thing that I was exploring earlier about the relationship and the importance of inner beauty and the relationship it has with external beauty, I think was really something powerful, I think. And actually, surprisingly enough, I'm passing day by day. I can get my jar now. And what else did I want from here? You know, I really wanted to get this razor thing that is reusable. And maybe I'll do it now. How do I get rid of all the other rages? Let's see. Bismillah, bismillah. Shabbat. Oh, tres bien. Merci for asking. And on anglais, we sometimes say, \"Thank you for asking.\" You don't say, \"Just mercy.\" Merci a... Merci a... Merci a toi. That shows. I went yesterday. May you are closed from like 1.30 to 2.30, 50 waves. And she was walking. I was like, \"Ah, okay.\" So I had to make a loop. Leperon, saranik. I have some. Do I need to recharge them sometimes? Boiled? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Once a month. Ah, okay. Then I need to do it. How long do they last? Really? Havi bibibi. One second. I forgot the other thing I wanted. One second. Lemon would be important. Let's get out two lemons. Havi bibibi. Baby, baby. Okay, lemons. Those guys. I forget. It's okay. Oh, yeah. I wanted to replace my razor with something like this. On the bottom. Yeah. I'm trying to figure. I want to replace the reusable ones. The one time use would be reusable. I'm not sure which one. Yeah. Ah. Yeah. Okay. I want to replace, but maybe not today. Okay. Do you have like a... Ah. Interreso. All right. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Ah. Okay. Ah. Okay. Yeah. It's really good. But, we have to read the book and read it. Oh, the chocolat. Okay. Okay, bien tout, bonjour mes, salam parais, Alice. Yeah, here we go, baby. Let's go. All right, here we go. So we got some of these jars. And two lemons. That's great. So I was going upward this way. And then this is actually a very nice big one. I think it's fun. We can hold it all together. We can put it in the basement. And just keep some big ones. Don't worry so much about the little ones. Maybe take the little ones that are used to fill up the big one. Or can I get some water? I wonder if I can fill up soon. But not yet. Oh, it's raining. You know, maybe I can take that collected water in the flower pot upstairs. I really should have brought this stuff in. Okay, so, Habibi, we were reflecting on friends that I would. This is one of them, or one of them's friends, that I would accompany if they had cancer. So right now it's not Shiloh. I don't think I would. She is. Either she is distancing or I'm distancing. We reach out to the types of men. Sue, it is before I forget. I wanted to reach out to Shabana and Sue. What's her name? Oh, goodness. The Pakistani lady who was at the Ambien Conference because she and I and Shabana all come from the Muslim tradition and I feel like we may have some things to share with each other. Some sort of Islamic stuff. Then I need to do this. Maybe if I say the word \"double underline\" and maybe the baby will be talked to, he won't have to be distracted by the loud noises. Then from that place, I think it should be faster to go home and the baby can eat. Yeah, \"double underline\" and that way when I send this into the AI, it will know the double underline stuff as a theme or as a topic. So we can do that. We had our to-do. So I can say this is a to-do. I messaged Shabana and the Pakistani poet lady from the Ambien Conference. Another to-do is to message Shri Sun's partner whom I emailed. So I should have her email in my message box. Another to-do is to send the book to Krista Sifit from Sister Chang Kong, the Thich Nhat Hanh's student teacher and to in the gift/thank you note, ask her to connect me with a South African lady who is connected to Desmond Tutu and to connect me with the lady who is in Costa Rica, I think, but is a person who is affiliated or was a student of Thich Nhat Hanh's. And then I want to continue the reflections that I've been having about the friends. So you know, it's strange. I think even Murataba or Mursaba, even if they are not always in touch, I think that they would be people, at least Murs for sure. He is a friend. He is a friend because he has shown even if he's not able to enact consistently, he has shown that he wants to be there for me. And I love it. And I mean, I don't think I'd be there for Danny or Ali or Adli or others. My brother, yeah, I think that would go just because my brother would be someone who is a responsibility for me. So this is like the responsibilities, right? Like my parents, they're already old, already thinking it must like to spend more time with them. And I think this process of me work, you know, once a month is too, is frequently enough, but it feels so little for the contribution that I want to make for my family. But hopefully with kind of like a precision kind of. Oh, wait. Okay, so. Yeah, so precision interventions that I want to be having. I think that would be really great to do. Get easy to clean white pants that fit. Maybe from that thrift store that Josephine recommended to do, get easy to clean black jeans, something like just like something that's really easy to maintain and keep that clean, but also is like and fits very well. I think I'm not sure if I'm going to be the kind of. Yeah, I mean, it's not called the. Okay, so the. I'm not going to be the kind of guy that wears like super. Like suits, you know, I'm not going to look like local nice, but I do want to wear something or something like, wow, like I, the guy likes himself. Like I likes honors the God within and maybe something that is. I want to write something that is a little bit. Long. It takes about. Maybe it's a little bit. So. Yes, she's a 10 30 11. She'll be fine. So let's go home and then let's. Big steps. Okay, baby. So. Good morning. Hello. Yeah, so I think I have some of these connections to make. I don't really know today. I'll go pick up my bike and I don't really need to work that hard on getting it electrified, but it would be nice. I don't know if I should be doing that. You know, I was thinking about becoming a seller of storage material, but maybe it could be a way of getting to know people. And you got to give before you receive. And I don't think I've actually given, you know, here in France. The baby is probably going to wake up soon. Definitely will wake up on the way back and I can hear him kind of taking a deeper breath. I love this baby. And yeah, I was trying to think of my friends. I think I lost my connection to Mike. I don't know that well enough. I know that he loves me forever, but. Farms? I think so. I think so. And who else? Hana. This is my first friend. Sarnes is a friend I just grew up in. Close enough. Over time. Séremade. And all these cheap wallet. And you friends? I'm not sure. And the... There's something going on over there. And we go home. Yeah. How come I get lost here all the time? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know if I have a lot of friends I can remember. It's a little sad. Not too sad. Mm-hmm. Peptides. Something about peptides. I got a little research. Like, what the heck? This is peptide. And then I reached out to both Sheikh and Mukhadar. And I could actually return my call to Sheikh and Mukhadar and tell him about spraying a tikhara. How can I increase my sense of presence in the world? Because I don't really think I did that. And, you know, they say God is closer to you than you're jumping in your vein. And God is definitely a presence. How else would anything exist? And so there's like... I don't know how you'd say it, but like infinite presence right here that is... I'm not recognizing? You know something like that? I'm not exactly sure how to say that. Okay, cup is open. I found that it's so hard for me. It's a deal with these kind of whiskey-turny cities. I'll tell you what, I'm coming back. The baby's waking up. And let me pause this for a minute. Get into cup. There we go. Now we're going to walk home. And I'm going to hold this bag with a handle just in case it slips. And we're going to make sure that the baby doesn't wake up until we're there. And we can do a pen. Okay, so let's close that. And then put it in my back pocket. And then there you go. There you go. Merci, au revoir. See you when I can sit and have a coffee one day. Bye. Au revoir. Take care. Have a nice day. And go to bed. Thank you. All right, so now it's a garbage day, but we still got to go home. So do we follow the garbage truck? Is there a way to go home without following the garbage truck? I think I got to go this way and then away from the garbage. Actually, it's kind of nice. I know, actually. It's that way. Doo doo doo doo doo. And I have an espresso. And then I go left. And then I go right to the office. And then I go to the office. Connected to the internet. Okay, baby, we're going home. We'll be there in a bit. Don't worry. We're actually quite close right now. Very close. I'd say maybe five minutes. That's great. Five minutes is great. And so this idea of respecting beauty housed within you, with beauty on your shoulders, but at the same time to not have it be a--I'm so sorry, are there any ear problems? Wow, so loud. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You know, we don't need a--it's like the beauty within you, not necessarily the--how do you say it? The spirit, the beauty within it. Yeah, something about this beauty that is-- And this gem, this jewel, I think it's common language in some traditions to talk about it in that way. This jewel of consciousness is a miracle. And yeah, maybe it is, you know? Maybe we can call it a gem because it shines brilliantly. I mean, look at the shine that I'm able to see. You can only see what you are. Is that true? Why? I'm passing you full teardowns. But yeah, like, my capacity for--it's like a knowing nod, you know? When parents look at each other and they're like, \"Oh yeah, I know. What have you been through?\" I don't even feel it anymore. I can't acknowledge the experience of it. I can't feel it right now, but somehow, in some way or another, I remember and I know. So like this is it. This is the phytr, like the fact that I can be struck by the beauty of frost on a stem of a plant that for all--for any human interest is of no interest. A plant that is dead to us in some way. It's not going to feed us. It's not going to blossom. It will soon fade into compost. Yet I look at it and why do I recognize this beauty? Like what am I seeing in that plant to be able to say to myself, like, \"I need to say it's a recognition.\" And so I think we need moments, bonjour, the morning of touching, looking, feeling, knowing, knowing deeply that there is this jewel sort of within us. I think I should develop all the film here and just-- it takes so much time and effort to do it at home and I don't get to see it. I think I'll just take it here. It'll be expensive, but it'll give me a reason to engage with people again. Yeah, you know, it's related. It gives me a reason to reach out, connect, and touch base with people. And all of this beauty out here, the only reason I am able to know it's beautiful must be because there's a part of me that is beautiful, that knows beauty. I mean, what is it about that? It's like, you know, if you want to take this reductionist evolutionary principle, it's like, \"Yeah, so this plant is beautiful because I can eat it.\" And it will give me some kind of energy or-- Hey, guys. How's that? How's it going to be, some kind of energy or something, right? But-- or this person is beautiful because-- Of course. --their rosy cheeks represent the possibility of procreation, right? But then you realize procreation is suffering and struggle and pain and sleepless nights and just the difficulty. And real difficulty. And it's like a beauty of something else that we are acknowledging. It's a beauty of service. It's a beauty of-- It's the beauty of being, man. It's the beauty of just realizing that I can be conscious and I can choose gratitude. And I think if we have more opportunities, more time in our lives to take a second to-- See beauty of every chisel mark. Thousands of people, thousands of men, we're spent on this ground making it less painful for people to walk on it. They fall. We're swinging it. We'll just say hi and then we will go home and say hi to Melissa. Okay. Hello. Hello, hello, hello. Yeah, I just came to say hi and I hope you guys have a beautiful day. Oh, I came to just say hi. But then I saw this and-- Yeah. Because we already have a baguette. We are okay today. May I-- Yeah. Yeah, the baby, the dog-- We're a boy. Baby, baby, sweet man. Yeah. Yeah, do. Yeah. He's a man. Yeah. Soon he's going to go home and eat. Thank you. Hello, everyone. Hello. The name, the champlainon, is the first one. And the phoenix oyster. Phoenix. Come the-- Phoenix? Come the-- The fire. From the fire, the ashes, the phoenix, right? Yeah. How do you say it in French? I don't know. Phoenix? Phoenix, I don't know. You know the bird mythological creature? I know the bird, but I don't know. Yeah. The oyster. I don't know the machine. Yeah, it's the tip, the plurot, phoenix oyster. Oh, the plurot. Yeah, the tip, phoenix. Okay. Bonjour, nay. Au revoir. Bye, au revoir. Oop, de de l'éville. Here we go. All right. Let's go home, baby. Let's check out also this bucket. Buckets are useful, you know? We can use that bucket to make a still air box. Wow, what is this? That is, I think, frozen water or something, or plastic. We're going to go home now. And you're going to eat. You're going to be so happy. You would have a nice, nice bobbin time hanging out. And then we're going to go home. Oh, you can still hear myself. Okay. So, I don't have any underlines. I think some of the important things are this recognition. And imagine, this is what I was doing when I was doing my journaling. But there's something about walking and seeing the world in journaling versus this idea of just being on paper and pencil. And I think they serve very different purposes. One, you see the world. And then two, you see within. And you might be able to get distracted a little bit. I want you to go find the onjoh, the iron nokkon that says, and they look around in the world and in themselves. And there are signs everywhere for the people who see. And it's interesting, the people who see a nokkon, not exactly sure what it says. And yeah, so first of all, I might as well use it. But yeah, the signs are for the people that choose to see the signs, who are opening themselves up to the signs. And yeah, Aloha, Aloha, please protect and liberate from injustice. All the people in Palestine and Congo, increase them in their ranks, increase them in their heart, to increase them in their ability to protect their hearts from hatred. And two, please transform the hearts of the oppressors. Give them the possibility for redemption before it's too late. Allow the people of the book, the Jews, to see the Muslim tradition with fresh eyes and to really understand that these \"beards\" that they're killing are followers of that which should be followed according to their traditions and have them give them a moment of true inspiration and bring us all closer to you.",

      "content": "Revised Journal Entry for January 19, 2023:\n\n---\n\n**Walking with the Baby:**\nHey, today's a special day for me – spending it with my baby. He's asleep on my chest, and we're out for a walk. Maybe we'll head to the Citadel. It's really nice to have this time together. Oh, and I must remind myself to get that shoe aid, you know, the one that helps you slip into shoes without bending down? That would be a lifesaver when holding the baby.\n\n**Professional and Personal Reflections:**\nI've been thinking a lot about messaging Krista. Want to talk about compassionate leadership and muscular compassion. It's all about finding those leverage points, understanding how much pain to allow for the greater good of our culture. Also, I need to reach out to Gaia, Mushon, and Joe Edelman. Need to ask Pascal about when to come to Paris. And yes, today's the day to buy those glasses. I'll send a message to Amen and check with Shalomah about their availability. I wonder about the import fees if it's by air mail. Might be simpler if someone can bring it from France. \n\n**Health and Wellness Considerations:**\nIt's funny, you know, I keep finding these pills in my pocket. Okay, I think I only took one. It's been two hours, so let's take one and a half. Friday – it's good to be awake, alert, happy, and alive. Also, I've been working on my dad's project. I need to start looking into some grants. And oh, I had this idea about a gamified dashboard for my objectives as the interim CEO, I CEO. Loved talking with Alex yesterday, we got quite vulnerable and intimate. \n\n**Deep Friendship and Responsibility:**\nA friend told me about his wishes for when he's seriously ill. It makes me think – a true friend is someone you take time away from your family, even your infant, to accompany in illness, to raise money for if they're sick. Like Nagel, he was nice and kind when we met, offered me connections. Now he's sick, what's my responsibility towards him? And I've been thinking about reaching out to Ali Hali, Irene, and the ladies in Kurdistan. \n\n**Beauty and Attraction:**\nYou know, my perception of beauty has changed over time. Like, I used to be attracted to small girls with bangs, but now, it's different. Take Sema in Kurdistan, for instance. There's something about her – not just her looks but her personality. And then there's me, handsome, I guess. But beneath the surface, there are things like not being able to touch my toes, hip pain... Beauty is transient, isn't it? What is the purpose of beauty? And there's this connection between God's love for beauty and our perception of it. \n\n**Daily Errands and Tasks:**\nSo, I went out and did a bunch of stuff. Had to remember to buy glasses, message a bunch of people – Gaia, Mushon, Joe Edelman, and Pascal. Need to coordinate with Amen and Shalomah about getting glasses to France. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here, but I believe in following these leads. And then, all these pills I keep finding in my pocket. I need to be more careful with them. I've been awake for two hours now, so it's time for another half pill. \n\n**Reflection on Spiritual and Personal Growth:**\nI've been reflecting on how to be a better person, how to grow spiritually. I'm thinking about reaching out to Sheikh and Mukhadar for guidance. I'm also considering my role as an early stage founder in technical businesses, especially those with a mission to solve real-world problems like the water crisis. God has given me a technically competent, creative, interdisciplinary mind, and I want to use it well. \n\n**Closing Thoughts:**\nI'm trying to be more mindful, to see the beauty in the world around me, to appreciate the small things. There's so much beauty in nature, in people, in the everyday. I want to protect this beautiful world, to be a good caretaker of it. As I walk through the Citadel, I'm struck by the beauty of the frozen moat, the steam rising from the compost. It's all so beautiful. Insha'Allah, may we all be able to see and protect this beauty.",

      "content": "compare and contrast this with this other journal entry:\nAlright, so here we go. We're gonna be walking for a bit to get to the day by day where I will hopefully get one of those jars actually because then I could use that nice lid that I have at home and got vinegar yesterday so I don't think I need anything else from there. I need to get a patch from my jacket. I'd also like to just go to a coffee shop and drink a coffee for the course of 15 minutes without talking or thinking or doing something. That's gonna be my practice for the day. I would like to actually get back onto my meditation practice. I think 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes in the evening would be wonderful if I could pull it off. I miss my baby and I'm here so I really would like to find a way to talk to him. Ya Allah Ya Kareem Ya Kareem Ya Kareem Ya Kareem Ya Kareem. Instead of talking to myself, I could be talking to God. Talking to the least one of you. Talking to the better and most gracious version of myself. And I'm in old need, which is beautiful. And I would like to be permeated by the beauty. There is a loss. I felt really happy to see the baby and Josephine. It's really sweet. And I just want to hold the baby. I want to squeeze him and hold him and he's in the evening not having it. He's just kind of squirmy. He's pretty. Slippery. I'm pretty alone here in France. I connect to people from afar on the telephone. Maybe I need to connect people from a close with my body. And I'm going to start using my calendar. My freedom isn't going to be, I'm not going to be dominated by time. But I will be more free by sitting up flexible big blocks of how I like to be just flowing with things. And then I need to put things in there to make sure that I do the things that I need to do. For instance, I want to have a follow up meeting, a two week post family time follow up. I want to make sure to reach out to the person from Kup. And I would also like to reach out to Sylvanna. She had a baby. It's been a month now. I should definitely reach out to her. There's such beautiful sunlight here. It's darkness and the shine of the snow. And inside the city there's very little light. I need to return. Next month I will, I'm going to in short I'll have a salary. And then when I get the salary I will pay for a few things. Probably pay for the air table. Pay for my gym membership and pay for the co-working space. I had an idea to return to my English teaching here to meet people. But also I thought I would put up free small business, actually free business consulting. Why don't you say small? Free business consulting for anybody that wants to take advantage of an English speaking international person who has lots of experience doing lots of different things. And I think I need to look at the phone for a second. I'm sorry guys. I keep thinking I can see. Oh is that it over there? No. Just one more stop. So hardware store. You know I'm going to get another one of those pen loops for my notebook because I gave mine to my dad. And I will, if I lay why not, just enjoy my day. Go to the hardware store, check out for that clip. Go to the flag, get the pen loop. On Amazon get the jacket patch. Do something social, call your sister. Get some snacks. Oh I remember I was going to get the actual jar here. And yeah so I have all of those straws up there. Lion's mane, main petri dish. I think I want to try to just like get a backup. You know like this thing that will keep the elements all backed up. All of the different species because I really don't want to lose any of the species because I have this squishy one which is rare and I have it in a few forms but just got to make sure that I clean up the agar. I can get some of those. What is that? It's like back to agar. They call it antimicrobial agar. Just to be sure that that's like my home agar base. It's clean. It's not going to have any problems. And this is a hobby. This exploration and foraging is a hobby. Beautiful. To go out regularly and to see nature and I think it's really important. And yeah I think what I want to do actually is get into startup mode and get into the early stage boot up phase which is I think where I thrive in many startups. Maybe even investing and joining later. I felt a lot if this project and my dad worked out and had the resources. I kind of like this idea. And it's closed. It's closed. Oh. I think it just opens up again at two thirty which is in fifteen minutes. Okay. Not a problem. They don't have any jars. That's okay. There they are. No jars. Perfect. Perfect. Okay so two thirty I come back here. And for now we will continue walking. And I'll take all of this audio and I'll ask Chad GPT to summarize it and fill out my to do list. And we'll just keep walking and talking to myself. And who cares about me. Who would want to hear me speak. They hear me think. Do I read poetry. No. Why would I read other people's poetry. Why would other people want to read my poetry if I don't read their poetry. It's a. It's unkind. It's not a beautiful way. I think I'm going to go walk through the park into the city and go to Wally's. Get a coffee. And. Oh my dad. I think I really would like to. Get on the call with Doug Song. Those people from back in Michigan you know the people who helped with the previous. Stuff that I was involved in could be really nice to have them in the. No. At the very least. And maybe even to. Yeah. It was called. I know so many people that it would be nice to. Some sort of connection to the past. And absolutely. Once I get this confirmation from my dad I should talk to me. And tell him that I would. Like to really make a push for this. And like I'm going to work with my dad half time and tell that as well. And then personally I think it's time to act. Not a time to empower. Especially these early stage businesses. And just to be sure that we have the confidence in that things that we're sharing are actually things that we can practically do. And yeah so these. These patents are something. The experience of managing a team. And I think. Actually. The. Even now. Sponsoring with the smallest of amounts. Water projects internationally. It will give us the ability to be on the radar. And it will give us the ability to find future volunteers and engineers. And. It would be important I think for. Urban farming projects and all sorts of different projects to have a. Series of different sized interventions. There's a lot of people. Water. It's so important. Water holds the earth together. It's earthquake prevention. Also. The way that we can. Should go meet up with that guy and a man. Or meet up with him or talk to him or send him a message maybe I can talk to her. He's can't. And tell him that. Tending to work on this water thing. I would like to. Get the blessing of my shape. If possible. Also I want to take. The French classes. Learning loops. I feel like. There's like different scales of fractal loop to loop through the loops. Where a learning loop is. The way that we can. Think of society and like that. That's moral. The arc. Of history is long. Bending towards justice and we can think of the loop. Being that. The way that the arc bends. You know like combing your hair back and forth and your arm goes in a circle and slowly slowly your hair gets straighter and straighter. And. You got to enjoy yourself man. Got a. Scoot. I miss my brother. A lot like me. And he is kind of crazy and chaotic and he thinks about many things. And. I have. I wonder if it's possible. I think I wonder if it's beneficial for me. To. Have these diverse interests. Is there a way. To bring in actually. The mycology. And to think about what. Water. Means for. These. Networks. How does the water. Under ground. Relates to the mycological. Networks and my this is beautiful mash up. Let's take a picture. Yeah so I'm wondering how the mycology works. Underground. Preserve the water. And also what am I supposed to do with this idea for the proof of inner work. I think. It would be amazing to potentially share it with the design people at Apple. They're probably staying very far away from currency. But they are like one of the world's biggest banks right through the Apple store. And they're beginning this journal. And I feel like. They could have. An experimental. Journal. That is. Integrated. With either a school. Or a. Fund funding organization. I'm sure I'm sure Apple has its own foundation. And if that they could then identify. Whom. To disperse funds to. But in a giving way rather than you taking your journal. And then. Unlocking funds. You do your journal. And if you do that you unlock the ability to validate. Other people's journals. It's it's got to be a two way street. So the idea is that you do your journal. And then it will. Unlock. Your ability to. Yeah validate somebody else's journal. But only if somebody has first validated that your journal. Gets two thumbs up and so there's kind of this. Moment of. Creating something to do something. Like a recursive loop so we have to break that. And how can we do that. Maybe it's. Maybe we actually use chat GPT. Chat GPT can finally. Help us. And identifying if it's the same person. That is valid that is writing like. How. There's got to be a way to use chat GPT. To identify distinct styles and writing. Tiny little. Ways that people. Pick their phrase the ologies. And. And through and through that then. Being able to. Say that this is the same person and not only is this the same person. They are reflecting on the thing that they said yesterday. And maybe actually. It needs. Everyone needs an agent to. Whoa. Everyone needs an agent that will be able to. Monitor and evaluate progress. I think this is potentially the element that was missing from before. It was. Needing this kind of feedback loop. And. You know I should just make it. No, no, no, no. Should I s- you know, I should write a proof of concept and ask for support and, um, maybe work with Moseh and Mortova to find young people in Iraq who can help with developing this into the future. I think I also want to talk with Joe about this and maybe Ben, and I think one of the other things I really need to figure out is like, I'm scared in this world, like, I don't feel super safe, I don't feel like I'm in a place where I can just talk and do and be without needing to be very careful because of- Like, even my friends, man, even Joe and stuff, I'm feeling nervous to connect with because I don't know where his head's at. And if he just disagrees with me, how will I be able to stand my ground? How will I be able to be completely true to myself and my beliefs in a non-zogmatic but clear and open, uh, to be changed sort of way? And the question is, am I? I'm not sure. I think there's a lot of feeling. That's just- and the thing is, the way that I feel, it's like, is it- What is the word for someone who only cares about xenophobic themselves and people that look like them? Like, do I really not care about the hostages in Israel? I don't think so. I would hate to see anybody- Innocent, injured. Anybody who's- just anybody, maybe not even anybody innocent. I believe in the sanctity of human life and the innocence of everyone until they're proven guilty. You never know. Like, I don't think- I don't think, to be really honest, that I would be as brave as the Jews. That are protesting the army and are, you know, able to- yeah. Are protesting the army and are- I just found a bunch of cool things in the garbage. Crazy. And are, you know, um, how do you say this? Boycoting, like going into service. Like, uh, what is the word? Yeah, it's just boycotting, I guess. This is not bad. These are nice- these are nice glasses. Why do they throw them away? Okay. Now, let's try not to break them. And then let's go. Yeah, so all those people- they're not Jewish. They're Israeli, right? Jewish people are around the world. Israelis that are boycotting the military service. I don't think I'm a spokesperson. I don't think I am a voice of wisdom yet. I am afraid. And I feel this retreat of, you know, a fear of criticism, I guess. Fear of being ostracized, wanting to not hurt people with my words. And actually, this results, I think, from when I was very young. My mother and father had to go into school to be held accountable for my words as a six- seven- five, six-year-old because I had been saying that the American soldiers in Iraq should die. And I know it was true for me then. Oh, cuteies. Okay, it's the future. And, uh, because that was all I knew. I was my entire, you know, world with my dad. And I think I would like to see the average development. I don't think, necessarily, that it is an intelligence thing. People keep saying, \"Oh, Palestinians are taught this.\" And from when they were very young and they're indoctrinated and they're backward and they will never be fair players. And I think maybe even Arabs feel the same way. Palestinians there might feel the same way about the Jewish population and Israeli population saying that they're indoctrinated and is there a place for a real conversation? That's the scary thing. A real conversation is. And I think a real conversation may require mediation, may require time and space and a higher power and a twelve-step program for listening. And maybe these are the things that we need to be teaching in school. I think the idea of dogmatism and this ingrained pinhole view of the world is leading people to very strange places. And it's so tied to truth and to salvation that they stay small when, in fact, I think we need to open up. I think the idea of a boycott is fighting with the tools of power. And I think mapping my models and trying to identify, like, am I still in a tribal identity is going to be something I'll have to sincerely interrogate. Like, I'm here. I have a heart. I have my feelings. And I'm awake and I'm drunk. My coffee. I'm alive. And now I got to figure out who I am, what I believe. And to find the poetry. To find the poetry in a baby that cries and talismanic prayers that don't perform their magic in a coffee that awakens me not. I remember meeting David White and making decisions based on my values, but realizing that I didn't feel like I could live up to them. But that's the real stretch, right? The real stretch is knowing who you want to be, being terrified by that vision, taking that first step. And I shouldn't be alone. We need to be accompanied. We're going far together. We shall law. Is it possible to be more like Patrick Colison and others? For me? Or is that not my lot? Because I am who I am. I am beloved with a crazy brain. Now I got to figure out if I'm going in the right direction. Okay, so I have lots of friends I'm not talking to regularly. But who are my true friends? I think people like Morge. But I need to be a better friend, too. How can I be a better friend? It's a question that I ask myself. I haven't even reflected on last year yet. I'm still just trying to keep marching on. I keep going into the future. But what was last year like? And, uh, wow, genes are totally in. It's like suddenly looking at a thing and all they even thought of was getting genes again. I'm no longer young. And I don't feel so old. I feel like I'm a middle aged. I'm approaching. I'm approaching it. It really depends on if we live forever or not, right? It was funny hearing Benjamin Franklin talking about his life. And, uh, whoops, he's coming up. Especially as an old man. Being like, yeah, no, I'm good. I'm done. I've done enough. And ever since I was really young, actually, I really appreciated Benjamin Franklin. And when I first heard of the leather apron, I don't know who told me. Somebody told me. But it was really inspiring. I thought, how cool. Somebody else sort of thinks he looks like me. I'm not sure what he had. I think this attention to detail, actually, and the writing down and the specification setting. And of course, not everything goes according to plan, but they do one's best to do that. To write down everything. And I wonder what it was like to write in his time, right? Like, would he have time and space and a desk? And, you know, he had children. Although they say he was not the best of parents. He definitely had distractions around. And why can't I write? Have I trained myself to be unable to write? I also have my cameras in France. I mean, in Lebanon. I like to get them back. And yeah, writing. Writing. Writing long hand. I wonder what would happen if I tried to write my story. Oh, there's Wallis. Maybe I should go to Wallis now and then move on. I wonder what would happen if I tried to write long hand that. Let's see if it's open. That story. Oh, and I told them that I attended since I should. And if there's anybody else I promised to connect with, I should probably send a reach out to Fetzer and also to Fetzer and the Wayfair. Very interesting, right? Yeah. Let's sit here. Have a coffee and be quiet for the same day. Where do you get some coffee for home? Bonjour. Is that you? Low coffee shop? Yeah. [ [",

      "content": "Good morning, Bilal. I've been reviewing your recent journal entries and I'd like to discuss a few points to help clarify and prioritize your tasks and ideas. Let's break them down:\n\n1. **Parenting and Family Time:**\n   - You've expressed a deep connection with your baby and family. How are you balancing this precious time with your professional commitments? Is there a specific routine or support you need to better manage this balance?\n\n2. **Professional Engagements and Networking:**\n   - You've mentioned reaching out to several individuals like Gaia, Mushon, Joe Edelman, Pascal, and Sylvanna. What are the specific goals or outcomes you're hoping to achieve with each of these interactions? Are any of these time-sensitive or can be scheduled for a later date?\n\n3. **Personal Projects and Hobbies:**\n   - You've shown interest in starting a mushroom cultivation project and returning to English teaching. How do these fit into your current priorities? Are these more for personal satisfaction or do they align with your professional goals?\n\n4. **Health and Wellness:**\n   - Your reflections show a keen awareness of your physical and mental well-being. Have you considered setting a regular schedule for exercise or meditation to help with this? What specific steps can we take to integrate these into your daily routine?\n\n5. **Community Engagement and Social Interests:**\n   - Offering free business consulting and reconnecting with past acquaintances like Doug Song suggests a desire to engage more with your community. How can we make these interactions more structured and beneficial for both parties?\n\n6. **Reflective Practices:**\n   - You've expressed a desire to return to meditation. Would setting a specific time for meditation help? Also, regarding your writing, would you like to allocate a dedicated time each day to journal or explore creative writing?\n\n7. **Daily Tasks and Errands:**\n   - There are several specific tasks like buying a shoe aid, getting a jacket patch, and purchasing specific items like jars. Shall we create a to-do list and set deadlines for these tasks to ensure they're completed efficiently?\n\n8. **Exploring Feelings and Ideas:**\n   - You've shared thoughts on various topics, including your sense of identity, social responsibilities, and philosophical inquiries. How important is it for you to explore these further? Would you like to set aside time for reading, research, or discussions with mentors or peers on these topics?\n\n9. **Personal Shopping and Maintenance:**\n   - Items like new jeans and easy-to-clean pants were mentioned. Is this something you'd like to prioritize soon, or can it wait? We can plan a shopping trip or look into online options.\n\n10. **Long-Term Plans and Aspirations:**\n    - Reflecting on your roles and ambitions, are there any long-term plans or aspirations you'd like to start working towards? This could include professional development, personal growth, or family planning.\n\nIt's essential to identify which of these areas require immediate attention and which can be scheduled for a later time. Let's work together to set achievable goals and timelines for each of these tasks.",

      "content": "jan 17\nok, so it's late and I'm wondering if I can do the agar before I sleep. I want to also write 750 words and I want to create this thing for my dad, it's an initial proposal of how I want to work with him. I asked chatGPT to write it and perhaps I should give it a shot here before trusting it. AUG 22?? oh wow ok so that's a set pattern.\n\nHere we go, so while talking to Dawn and Eric and others while in SF and thinking about it myself and asking my sheikhs and tonight insha'allah I'll do istikhara\n\nI think in order to:\n\n1) Relieve pressure from my father for this work\n\n2) Help the world's waterways by cleaning up rivers and polluted city water outfalls\n\n3) Support my family with a business that is more lucerative than my other projects\n\nI shall:\n\n1) Take on interum CEO role at WET (rebranding is one of my first order tasks)\n\nThis has the following subelements:\n\nTo work with the director of the board of WET to design a strategy moving forward\n\nto finalize current contracts with the team in Turkey and Iraq\n\nto develop a grant and funding strategy\n\nto develop a long term vision\n\nto develop and diversify revenue streams for WET\n\nto re-brand WET\n\nTo identify the approrpiate positioning for WET\n\nithink this is a good start to a todo list for me\n\ni'd like to be paid something like 12-16,000 dollars a month for a salary of 200K - which I think is appropriate for a CEO level role of a mid sized company while the CEO level role of a small company was at 150,000. So 12.5K a month would be good so that would mean that if I am paid 2k a month, the back pay would be 10.5 for 6 months\n\nalthough i sohuld be paid half of that so\n\n12.5/2 = 6.25 and so that would be 6.25 times 6 months is 37ish so if i am paid just 2k a month there is a remaining 4k a month. I think this is fair based on the average salary of a small business CEO in the united states being 150k.\n\nother than that the baby is growing fast, he sounds so different now a days his voice is deep and he is so squirmy and he moves a lot\n\nthank good ness his bellybutton is looking better. I am done with ym duo lingo and i did my morning pages... at midnight\n\nhaha\n\ni need to get better at doing this earlier. I wonder what my days will be like\n\ni should get a train ticket to paris, maybe i should find a reason to go to paris for multiple rasons\n\ni want to make a VR interview with the head of CRI\n\nand maybe Pascal\n\nmaybe pascal has some ideas of a good day to come to Paris and maybe i can talk to Ed\n\ni wonder if there are some people in ed's community that would be a good person to target for inviting to join the thing I'm working on\n\nwhat other names besides wet could it be\n\nwater tech\n\nWat-tech techwaterly\n\nhaha! i like that actually\n\nman my brain is hilarious it just smashes things together\n\nok so i have a fridge in the basement and five mins to finish thi sbefore \"tomorrow\" i want to get a dentists appointment and i want to have a meeting with DMN this week, I will reach out to him to see. I should watch Dara's video\n\ni should also follow up with Richie Davidson\n\nand whom else? I should have a call with Dug. I wantt o ask him about the water project and see what he thinks\n\nwho else do i know that might be interested\n\ni should also find volunteer research intern positions for the company where i can find \"free help\" oh yeah I also need to finish the proposal for my dad before I sleep. I wonder if I will be better adjusted tonight or if I will still be tired tomorrow I really want to spend some time with Baby in th emorning i wonder how often he'll wake up this evening\n\nthe baby is ... curious\n\nand looks around and is intense! so so intense, haha\n\ni guess like father like son :D\n\nhe cries, and when he cries he THROWS himself around, haha, children who ar eboys iheard that babies male babies especially are a bit intense is there anything else I should do\n\nok so mushrooms\n\ni took amar's little bit of liquid and splashed it on a bunch of agar dishes. let's see which one's work and then I'll need to repropogate them\n\ni have two liquid culture honey dishes up on the top, if they are still alive maybe I can take some of the goo inside them and move them into larger jars? It should be viable for a while right? \ni should also have some more jars with those things... those.... whatchamakallits the rubber stopper things so i can pull them out. Ok time for the wet stuff for my dad\n\nJan16\ncan you help me write specs for a \"proof of inner work\" crpytocurrency protocol including the coinnomics. The idea is that value comes from people understanding themsevles and the world deeply, finding a way to contribute and then performing in a consistent way to achieve actualizing that goodness in the world. you can call it entrepreneurship, or agency, or anything you want. That's what I think we should pay for, not time traded \"on the job\" treading water, or \"day trading\" trading your time so you can eek out an existence. The principle behind it is Life supports that which supports life. My thoughts are that we can monitor this \"inner work\" the grappling with the questions and if we can verify/validate/accompany each other in this process (anonymously?) we may be able to create a complementary currency. Or perhaps this is how funds can be disbursed from foundations to support dreamers who are verifying their dreams with each other. Before we get to specs I'd like to dialog with you to refine the idea. First I'd like to get your thoughts and expose for me any blindspots I may have about this project/idea.\n\n\nSo we will continue and it is almost 10 o’clock. You should be waking up but I am going to turn off my freezer. I guess tomorrow could be a good time to go get VR Sim card that I can use in my. My kind of affordable, portable mobile Wi-Fi how cold is here. I also got a look up and see ChatGPT. Drill Thats to pick it up you need. Oh my God really the movie the other drill upstairs solid. OK so we will take the drill and the water can’t believe that whole thing my idea calm down here so you think about it operating temperature uses energy maintain temperature uses all we need to figure this out so if it is watch straight into water until the water is boiling point and then we have to figure out, OK that’s gonna have a temperature rise and a temperature at 200° there was no heat loss I’m working on I say that we have the staying in the heat into it to meet the temperature and say we had a perfect saying that white heat so it will always be able to keep 28° in the other side -10° what happens Feedback loop so let’s think about think about it when how many yards of water heat of water degrees Celsius to 20 W and how much we have this bucket we have to see and bottom of it how much can the top of it more\n\nJan15\nBenjamin Franklin's autobiography - I am almost done with reading it.So, today I am going back home from a trip to the Santa Cruz mountains. I was at the onbeing Gathering. A space full of lovely people. In about 45 mins I will be home and I have not yet had a moment to digest the last week.\n\nI saw my grandfather, he burst out crying when he saw me - i think realizing that the last time we saw each other was when my Grandma was still alive. Death comes, it's coming every moment. Writing, how is it different than speaking. I think something about being in the mind of an audience reading vs being in your head formulating words is different. You are given we are given I am given the ability to imagine another - how they may pick it up. This word can be patient till the next comes without awkwardness.\n\ni can close my eyes and dig inward - which is something I cannot even do with a pencil or pen. Although again I wonder if that makes a difference\n\nOk, so Niko and his partner are doing this thing with nature\n\nnature retreat\n\nor something like that\n\ni thik they would LOVE sarmed. haha, they have to meet someday. so cool\n\nok, and then there's the lady hospice person\n\nshe was so sweet\n\nid' love to connect with her more\n\nof all the people - i don't know if it was \"helpful\" in a practical sense to be connecitng with her, yet I enjoyed our time\n\nconnected o to the jewish group hthere was a lof of cross learnins\n\ni am so sleepy\n\ni can feeel myself falling asleep, haha\n\ntomorrow i will take my medicine and i think it'l help realign me\n\ni know i talked to more people\n\naww Krista\n\ncoming to France in June\n\nI'll still be there\n\ni should write her a letter\n\nmaybe i'll write it\n\ni liked roshie joan - i need to read her books finally. haha!\n\nnot roashie, i mean Rebecca Solinit\n\nshe's a writer\n\ni could send her some of my manuscripts\n\nhaha, i wonder if she'll think they're garbage. They definitely don't have good grammar...\n\nI shoul dtell Medina that I met Rebcca Solnit\n\nI think thay she may lik ethat\n\nthe poets\n\nand artists\n\nand others did I take my\n\nI spoke with Eric and he inspired me to take my job with my dad more seriously\n\ni want to ask dawn to connect us with the water people\n\nconnect dawn twith the clean iraq people\n\ntell murt/muj about my idea to get this thing moving.\n\nhave a call with murt/muj to see\n\nstart looking for grants for the water project\n\ninterrum CEO sounds good\n\nhabibi\n\ni can't believe my baby will talk soon,how cute!!\n\ni also would like to make a few more o fthe petri dishes and\n\nuse them to make clones of the liquid samples that amar gave me\n\ni really hope they survived and that they will be a good growth\n\ni do think I'd like to grow and explore the idea of micro D for my ADD - Also realizing that cardio is esspecially impactful and systems\n\nReach out to the tax person... for one of those years. I'm not sure which that I still need to do and to file in France with a 0 for 2022.\n\nConnect with the art director lady at onBeing to see if Josephine has any possibility to ifnd a position.\n\nWho else did I connect with\n\nAaron I should reach out and he said he'd help host people for Tea in Paris and I can do my Iraqi paperwork...\n\nGet on a zoom call with baba to set up his calendly and also to get his bank connected to mine, insha'allah.\n\nAsk Aymen to ship the camera? It might be nice to use it. I like the idea of creating interesting foraging experiences.\n\nAsk Aymen to bring me the Apple headset. I'm really interested in making AR things - gotta stay up to date on my nerdiness.\n\nI want to see if there's a slow way to make good packaging? What mushroom grows fastest and has the most mycelium?\n\nI'd like to get a few more HEPA grade air filters. Find the person with the fan who made an at home air filter\n\nMessage the people in Belgium? I htink I'd also like to find the Peter Peiotr something from Finland to see what his proposal is to remove Hungary from positions of power. Ok, this is way more interesting than the other way\n\nMessage aaron wolf\n\nand tinzin's husband and I realized how cool tenzin is\n\nask if the people in our group want to start calls.\n\nmessage Richie and remind him that I am open to collaborations and that I do not currently have a job.\n\nI think I might start going back to the co-working space and paying for the gym. It's a worthwhile investment. Or at least use the office and get a nice table. Ask Josephine. I want a whiteboard, maybe I can get the whiteboard wallpaper. I need to visualize all this.\n\nMessage Nihal\n\nJan14 OK so here we are we are in the process of going home and I am trying to get to my gate right now. It’s been kind of crazy to be in gathering with all sorts of lovely people and you have been connected with some wonderful humans and feel so inspired by different times in this sort of ways there is really lovely moments often on and I think I should go straight to go home tired. Well now I’m in the big airport anymore airport like the airport. I don’t know the other side was less clear like it was some random local airport and now I’m like oh OK this is an airport and , yeah I’m here in Los Angeles and of course all Burberry Gucci Almaz etc. but going back today to trance and I hope to not forget anything I just feel so scattered I don’t know what to do how am I going to be able to sustain and maintain and manage a brand. I think it’s just could be because I’m tired, but not necessarily , I’m trying to reflect on my experience and I can’t I can’t it was intense just something about my brain not able to do it maybe I need to be a little more chill no do you know if I could just stay in place and eat more food and have more time for meditation and this whole thing with a baby too like have a baby and I’m trying to be present for him but how am I going to be able to do that? I can hardly be present with myself and brain is just kind of a little bit of a blurry blurry mess love notebook compensation meditation but I am not able to convince myself. I don’t prioritize the time time also yeah add effect they say meditation is one of those things that just keep doing it and get better and better and your mind changes it actually shapes itself, and sometimes I think to myself and my like expecting too little for me. Somehow I mean like I just really think I can so I can know is that I just have I’m gonna be tired and blah blah blah or something about like economics really like you think about it economics and how there’s some economic theories that I know I believe that scares you, but you know that there is still time that used cord somehow like the keys of where is my date 206 how do I get it 130 to 146? I need to go somewhere OK I’m getting I’m getting later. I really need to get out of here. I don’t know how to get 206 OK right? It looks like there’s an opening. This is exactly what I’m saying. It could be that distracted , not really I didn’t think it was realized my God about something like you know the difference between vans your presence and putting kids out prostituting 85 130 32685 arrivals you guys are going to be done Yeah there’s something about this really large and I guess I could’ve tried to go to that massage. Next time I come here I already passed. Give me a massage for free and I am realizing that this is so tough and nice people appreciate it. I think it’s important the spot OK so there is 5 to 6 minutes from the gate I’m bad it’s nice I get to go and do this thing so let’s try to be a little bit clever without reflection because I have another 900 word that I need to be to be able to make this makes sense. I will be going home to just leave at 2 AM will go home and get of you. I don’t think I have a train from Paris. Yeah let’s do it let’s get another train. Like to do that I didn’t really sit with the But that’s OK I guess I really thought that you know I would like to see you soon and a little guy soft cuddly, little teddy bear dude who is there that really want to talk to again I met up with people from both Farr Institute as well as the Wayfair where people come from The foundations and where is the money coming from as like related to the Bahaa if she like the person of the money or she just the person with the you know this isn’t being retired person is like not a good identity to be making but I would like to I loved having someone say the word God was cool and I want to yeah up between like traditionalism and not traditionalism like somehow have a nontraditional about truth and it’s not going back it’s going through what is and realizing mystery great I met some really nice people and I really like to Dante too and yeah that was cool and I think what could be cool as you know I connected with a little bit of everybody actually passed a bunch of These drawings yeah I took a picture of those two on the wall. It was kind of cool I forgot what it was so I’m wearing a mask unnecessarily but yeah I think the problem and right now is especially here as the person who is walking in the gate or the big walk , I didn’t really I didn’t see in the morning. It was kind of cool I had to meditation in the morning was kind of cool and I’m going back France now and I think oh yeah yeah you get last cool pretty I don’t know. Yeah I’m really not in the wrong place. I’m in the wrong place Really late if you like yell and scream, these little cars I should get my ticket for Paris what else I need to do when I land my mushroom friends have been growing up. I’ve got these little cutie mushroom in my bag I think of growing I think I saw I’m kind of getting a little rockier , yeah I need to find a way of increasing the growth how this airport is huge so I wasn’t right she doesn’t think I can do it I think maybe if I’m over here, close my eyes and talk to myself and think about how crazy of a trip was visiting my grandma Visited my auntie auntie and cutie is so cute. My lady is cute. I’m kind of excited to go home to Paris I’m the one who setting up to could’ve been you know considered that I’m talking to myself you know I’m not, but I can see how you could consider that Man that was good I’m not actually hungry because I had a good lunch. Glad I did it. Glad I was able to eat food and then I was super glad that I met. These people was able to spend quality time with OK that’s funny OK and there are some alligators , OK so they will feed me on a flight and I should definitely try to sleep as soon as possible. Don’t activate yourself more than needed by. Yeah I got to get to that game but so far it really feels like I had to go all the way from one end of the airport to the other there’s already that’s not the one I’m going to Hank download the movie they got movies in the headphones. I really need to watch any movies to watch changing turtles that funny I got a chance to see Jimmy she’s not crazy.

I realize actually that one of the miracles I wanna write down is the miracle that I had with Joséphine when I was about to break up with her and then I felt like you know especially because I was trying to follow the chronic on you know like the Kiran Holy book QURAN and I was working on listening to the sort of death and in this process I was realizing that you know and I would’ve been Atya and also was saying that be patient with the people that are praising God in the morning in the evening, seeking his account and seeking his face that’s not Joe so I decided that I break up with her call her to do it and the process of it she was like listen. I’ve been thinking about it a lot and I really need to get back to God to get back on my religion and spirituality and I felt like oh OK well there goes my plan to break up with you, there is a year would be, but we can take some precautions yeah we can plug into here and then I will see if it charges his phone and charging it so let’s charge it like they freak you out about these things but not a big deal. I actually have a good amount of time. I think I will make the 750 words today. I turn this phone off. Oh my God I’m gonna go all the way down to Santa at some point today. Been exhausting today now the time to take my vitamins and took all of these vitamins with me, random mushrooms and zinc and oh no cover I always get with these you know razor blades and put them in my pocket and do not do that. I got it safe now put that zip lock somewhere gonna give Don a gift. I need to think about that real quick I can give Don chocolate or chocolate that’s not that nice what else you got a card? OK you know my cards are like a messy person really would love it if I had more of my mind and wits about me but I just have like a very chaotic mind and clear when I do this sort of them not talking to the computer and getting my mind out of my mind and piece of paper onto this journaling app. This is your journaling sound like a crazy person , yeah found my notebook and what is that? That is model oh I know what I’ll give you on. Oh my God this makes so much sense. Oh my God this makes sense. I’m gonna get done my I have this thing that I just got bottle that would be just like exactly the right thing for not so I’m glad I figured that out and what I kind of just done that I should’ve should’ve thought about like a second ago but said it it I think it’s still going to keep that recording going because I’m trying to hit 750 words we’ll see if my rambling rambling kinda hit 750 or not and believe I took a bunch of seeds. Just gonna give me trouble when I go back , I hope not the vitamin bottle. I think that really wanted a little bit more bottles so I had to get ready to go come on everybody. Your phone was fast. It was fast once I’m there there there are definitely. So we’re just needing a few more. Take me 20 minutes to talk. I’m done with the Apple thing I dropped off my money in it and now go see Dawn and have a coffee. I’m gonna go over to Eric’s place there. I will. With Eric half an hour last night I saw my friend you and he was great pick me up in the airport and we hung out amazing Fam’s house. I need to ask him for an address so that I can host I might be a little more like a whole Wheels wheels wheels OK give this thing you can see other people give me chocolate and other stuff right now, so no reply Eric maybe I should I started off at the airport look at me here yeah and then my other phones my bad I got some oil to get off happy for you. You’re happy for you the cure ha ha ha yeah that’s why we have together and tag really nice magnet that be nice always with me. What do you think listening to me don’t know if you’re still going but I’d I’m trying to hit a little bit more of this these words and yeah at West Oakland with my friends and I have everything where there why do I not put my phone in my wallet don’t understand I just leave it to go OK so let us try to look if you recorded all the words that you said yourself interesting I’ll do that. I’ll just like I can make a tiny little microphone thing. I want to record all the words I say to myself, what do you do to yourself that’s why that’s why yourself man just try to make things harder for you than it needs to be why do you carry all this heavy I need to carry and then head out and then exciting.

How many words is needed? 750*2? that'll usually take too long... I think I gotta do somethign a little different\n\ni'm awake\n\ni am working on my brothers website\n\ntoday i helped my family by going through and working on things systematically to help them settle disputes and establish a good pattern moving forward. it was an intense 2 days here in michigan, haha\n\nthe family needs a lot of help and i don't know why they can't figure it out themselves\n\ni think they need a therapist / coach and lots o fsupport as they work on things\n\nit's seems to be ok right now\n\nnow that my other brother amar is ocming... i wish I coul dfacilitate something\n\namybe we'll do that at the airport\n\nso I gotta keep doing this. I am helping aymen set up his website i wonder if the name is propogated\n\ni need to get about an additional 500 wrods in order to be able to get this content to kick me into high gear. i really wonder if i can catch my day on duo lingo although that one has some streak repair support already there. shoul dhave paid in advance for this one i'm on the toilet ahha\n\ntyping these words triyng to fix a stilly game\n\ngames that kepe me accountable\n\nand help me be who i wanna be\n\nso is it a game\n\nlik eheaven and hell\n\nright they are games too\n\n\n\nok, day two. here we go. I'm feeling sick. I have a sinus infection I think... probably because I have been with a cold for the last 2...3...4/ weho knows how long, weeks. I should go back and look. I know I had it when my dad was here two weeks ago.\n\nanyhow, let's think i have a few things on my mind, i want to do these dayly journal things and my brain is so full and i have so little time while the baby is out and i have my full attention and i can do something complicated like i want to work on that thing that will code and run gpt for me when i'm not around so i can use all the credits i have thinking about making somethingso i can make money with it. i see all those things and i never do it i should get to chase and apply for a credit card for my business i think that'll help will it be in my name or in the businesses name i probably have someLLC accreditation to do at some point, opt man i'm a mess i have too many ideas and not enough systems i think maybe i should register something in estonia. that is getting easier and it is likely going to help with taxes and stuff i think i also decided that i would rather get a job with a consulting company doing consulting rather than full time i want to take 2 weeks to do workshops in azzahra and I don't think i can if i have a jobjob i also don't have time/space to do a job ojb let's say it's 70k a year... it's sort of like a garunteed 240 dollars a day 5,800/24 ok so that's half of a 5000 a day day rate aconsultant would get. i was once paid 5000 dollars an hour, do you think i can command that now? I mean look at me? I'm feeble i feel weak i don't feel smart i feel kind is kindness worth anything what if i go to the onbeing gathering and i feel nothing or connect with no one what is my morality what is my guiding star i'm so lost right now i don't have anything like that right now i should listen to some books by sheikh jailani i think it'll help although it's not really what i want to do i want to ... act i want to see myself being kind helping people touching them personally with my words i don't have money i think i can be kind with massage i can be kind with talking to those people who are left out of the bigger icture like ahmed and show kind ness although it's not what brings light and joy to my heart what does is my baby siling i can't wait till he is laughing i can't wait till he has no pain i also love nature i love walking in nature finding things connecting with the plants there, making things with nature like the mycedlium hat i think there might be other things i can do with nature like i can sell the dehydrated foot it's healthy it's nutritous and is local (no Co2 and it's sort of like the most organic food you can get although if our earth is a bit destroyed with pollution it could be not such a great thing. ok, so josephine wants me to get a job to help pay for things i want .... what? i think i don't know if i want to live in lille i could make it awesome i should definitely do something forMunir to show him what I want to do with Bloom I have dropped the ball SO hard on that, haha, it's like I forgot about it. I don't want to think aboutit he sent me a message and i'm ignoring it because it stressees me out i don't want to deal with it i know there are soeme god things and peopel in the world heck even ben probably sent me a happy new year thing i can't really feel inclined to open it i miss being naiive growing up and being a part of the systems being at the level of meta cognition is extremely painful because we can see how things are our fault and how the others think the way they do, it's sort of like a frieght train coming and you think to yourself oh dear yes, this will happen. it's horrible yet it will happen now what can we do about it .... nothing the torture of being able to see i wonder what ben franklin thought? i sort of think it's better to be a bit dumber andhappier i'm at the cusp of dumn and that's a painful place to be because i can see yet i canot enact is that true? perhaps not, i should watch that yoga nidra thing again.\n\ni wonder how it'll take to get to 400 more words. ok\n\ni can do it\n\ni think that my family needs me or someone\n\ni miss suli\n\nawwww! habibi\n\ni can't wait to go back and hold him\n\ni wanna make aymen some business cards\n\nmaybe i can work on the prompt here. make me business cards for my professional services company.

      "content": "Prioritizing your tasks effectively involves evaluating them based on urgency, importance, and the impact they have on your personal and professional life. Here's a suggested approach to help you prioritize the tasks from your journal entries:\n\n### 1. Categorize Tasks by Urgency and Importance\n- **Urgent and Important (Do First):** These are tasks that require immediate attention and have significant consequences if delayed. Examples include health-related appointments, urgent professional commitments, and immediate family needs.\n- **Important but Not Urgent (Schedule Next):** These tasks are important for your long-term goals but don't require immediate action. This category may include developing long-term strategies for WET, pursuing personal projects like the cryptocurrency protocol, and networking activities.\n- **Urgent but Less Important (Delegate or Do Quickly):** Tasks that need to be done soon but are less critical to your overall goals. These might include practical day-to-day tasks or administrative work.\n- **Neither Urgent nor Important (Do Last or Drop):** Tasks with the least impact on your goals or well-being. Consider if these tasks are necessary or can be dropped.\n\n### 2. Consider Time Sensitivity\n- Identify tasks with specific deadlines or time-sensitive nature, such as grant applications, contract finalizations, and travel arrangements.\n\n### 3. Balance Personal and Professional Needs\n- Ensure a balance between personal (family time, health, hobbies) and professional tasks. Overemphasis on one area can lead to long-term dissatisfaction or burnout.\n\n### 4. Set Realistic Goals and Deadlines\n- Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps with specific deadlines.\n- Set achievable goals for each week, focusing on a mix of urgent tasks and those that align with your long-term objectives.\n\n### 5. Regular Review and Adjustment\n- Regularly review your progress and adjust your priorities as needed. Life circumstances and goals can change, requiring a shift in focus.\n\n### Suggested First Actions\n- **Health and Wellness:** Schedule health-related appointments first. Your well-being impacts all other areas.\n- **Professional Urgent Tasks:** Address any immediate professional commitments like contract finalizations or urgent meetings.\n- **Family Time:** Ensure you're allocating daily quality time with your family, as this is a key area of your life.\n- **Long-Term Professional Strategy:** Start laying the groundwork for long-term projects like WET rebranding or personal entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nBy following this prioritization plan, you can ensure a balanced approach to achieving your goals while maintaining your well-being. Remember, flexibility is key, and it's important to adapt as circumstances change.",
