      "content": "You're asking for a **post-meeting reflection prompt** that dodges generic summaries and instead generates **structured, insightful, and actionable outputs**. You also want to know which thinker’s style—like **Tim Ferriss** or **Seth Godin**—might best shape such a prompt. Let’s break it down and deliver a first experiment.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Designer's Style Fits Best?**\n\n- **Tim Ferriss** is tactical: great for extracting learning, systems, next steps, and bottlenecks.\n- **Seth Godin** is reflective: great for surfacing meaning, trust, story, and long-term direction.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nUse **Ferriss** for structuring and action. Layer in **Godin** for context and meaning. Combine them.\n\n---\n\n### **First Prompt Experiment: \"The 7-Minute Meaning-Momentum Review\"**\n\nTry this immediately after your meeting:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**  \n> _Take 7 minutes. Reflect, write, and plan based on what just happened._  \n>   \n> 1. **Insight Snap** (What struck you?)  \n>     - What surprised or clarified something for you?  \n>     - What was *not said* that mattered?  \n>   \n> 2. **Bottleneck Radar**  \n>     - What’s blocking progress?  \n>     - Where is someone waiting for someone else?  \n>   \n> 3. **Next Step Calibration**  \n>     - What’s the *highest-leverage* next move I can make (or prompt)?  \n>     - What’s one thing to follow up on within 48 hours?  \n>   \n> 4. **Meaning Check (Godin-style)**  \n>     - What did this meeting move closer to—what story are we telling with this work?  \n>     - Where did trust grow or weaken?  \n>   \n> 5. **Energy Gauge**  \n>     - Am I more energized or depleted? Why?  \n>     - How might that affect the next meeting?\n\n---\n\n### **How to Improve This Prompt**\n\nAsk yourself after using it:\n- Which question felt most generative or surprising?\n- Did it result in better follow-up or clarity?\n- Was anything missing—emotions, timelines, relationships?\n- Was 7 minutes too long or too short?\n- Would a voice note version work better than text?\n\n---\n\nWould you like a version of this as a template in Notion, Google Docs, or voice memo format?",

home.\n02:39 Speaker A: How are you?\n02:40 Speaker B: How are you feeling?\n02:41 Speaker A: Oh, man, I.\n02:42 Speaker A: I told you yesterday, right?\n02:48 Speaker A: Oh, the WI fi.\n02:49 Speaker B: Oops, I can't.\n02:50 Speaker A: Oh, no.\n02:52 Speaker A: Here, one second.\n02:53 Speaker A: You know what?\n02:53 Speaker A: I'm gonna.\n02:54 Speaker B: Oops, I can't.\n02:55 Speaker A: I'm gonna connect on here.\n02:57 Speaker A: I might be just better for the talk, but I'll do here for video.\n03:00 Speaker A: Let me just turn that off for now and do this for.\n03:05 Speaker B: Your audio is fucked up video.\n03:07 Speaker A: One thing, one thing.\n03:10 Speaker B: Your audio is fucked up.\n03:11 Speaker A: Okay.\n03:11 Speaker A: Is this any better?\n03:15 Speaker A: Okay.\n03:15 Speaker A: I don't know why it's so messed up on the laptop.\n03:17 Speaker A: It would be nice because I want to do some sharing the screen stuff.\n03:21 Speaker A: But I told you I got pulled over yesterday, right?\n03:24 Speaker A: Yeah, that was.\n03:26 Speaker A: Have you ever been pulled over?\n03:28 Speaker B: Oh, regularly.\n03:35 Speaker A: In Germany?\n03:38 Speaker B: No, in Paris.\n03:39 Speaker A: Really?\n03:39 Speaker A: On the bike?\n03:41 Speaker B: Yeah, I could.\n03:43 Speaker B: Being pulled over as a practice.\n03:48 Speaker A: Yeah.\n03:49 Speaker A: For me though, it's like, first of all, my title is expired and I'm dealing with a lawyer to try to validate my titre sjour.\n04:01 Speaker A: I don't really speak French.\n04:03 Speaker A: I'm talking to these police officers in a car that is my grand.\n04:08 Speaker A: My wife's grandma's.\n04:10 Speaker A: And I'm like, just some weird Arab looking random.\n04:14 Speaker A: Anyway, I'm at home.\n04:19 Speaker A: The car is still at the gas station where they are not letting me drive it back home because technically I'm not allowed to drive in France, supposedly.\n04:28 Speaker A: And.\n04:30 Speaker A: And the funny thing is, I went to Brussels yesterday.\n04:34 Speaker A: I borrowed the car because I had an appointment with a doctor to do a diagnostic test for add.\n04:40 Speaker A: And so it's like.\n04:42 Speaker A: And then I think somewhere it slipped through the cracks that I should not take any medication three days before the thing.\n04:53 Speaker A: And I only didn't take medication for one day.\n04:56 Speaker A: So I drive an hour and a half to get to this place.\n04:59 Speaker A: And then she's like, okay, you gotta come back on Friday.\n05:01 Speaker A: And so I drive an hour and a half to get back and basically everything is a mess, right?\n05:06 Speaker A: It's all really messy and.\n05:11 Speaker A: And then I come home and then they, like, dropped me off at the train station and Josephine has to go tell her parents and she can't get the car until her grandma gives her a letter saying she can pick up the car.\n05:24 Speaker A: And it's just.\n05:25 Speaker A: Yeah, it just got messier and messier.\n05:29 Speaker B: Like so many other people like being drawn into it.\n05:32 Speaker A: Yeah, that's like the most embarrassing part.\n05:36 Speaker A: And then it sounds.\n05:37 Speaker A: It sounds really silly, but I found a little cut on my finger that I have no Idea where it came from, like.\n05:45 Speaker A: And it just broke me.\n05:46 Speaker A: I was like.\n05:46 Speaker A: I actually started crying.\n05:48 Speaker A: I just.\n05:49 Speaker A: I was like, I can't take it, you know, because the little cut represents like an add symptom of like just the chaos and just like not even knowing how you injure yourself.\n06:00 Speaker A: And.\n06:01 Speaker A: And so at the end of this long day of starting with trying to take care and treat and do something that will reduce the chaos in my life and just having a very messy day.\n06:14 Speaker A: And.\n06:15 Speaker A: Yeah, it was.\n06:15 Speaker A: It was a tough day.\n06:17 Speaker A: I slept early.\n06:18 Speaker A: It was nice.\n06:24 Speaker A: Yeah.\n06:25 Speaker A: But the good.\n06:26 Speaker B: So many.\n06:28 Speaker A: Yeah.\n06:29 Speaker B: You wanna.\n06:30 Speaker B: You wanna hear a story from me about instead of.\n06:34 Speaker A: Yeah.\n06:34 Speaker A: What happened?\n06:37 Speaker B: So I'll.\n06:38 Speaker B: I'll mix two stories together to make it more dramatic.\n06:41 Speaker B: Sounds good.\n06:43 Speaker B: But I think.\n06:44 Speaker B: I don't know, I think they were like.\n06:46 Speaker B: So I just learned driving into the car of my parents, not knowing really how, you know, like all of the things function.\n06:57 Speaker B: And so.\n07:00 Speaker B: And there's like three instances that actually happened quite closely behind each other.\n07:04 Speaker B: Which was like.\n07:06 Speaker B: The first one is I didn't know which fuel to put it.\n07:09 Speaker B: Oh no, I put the wrong fuel.\n07:12 Speaker A: Oh no, you put diesel instead of gas.\n07:16 Speaker A: Basically.\n07:19 Speaker B: I don't know if you've ever seen a car, what it does when you do that.\n07:23 Speaker A: It chokes and sputters and jerks.\n07:27 Speaker B: Like suddenly like, you know, like speeds up and suddenly it goes, you know, like.\n07:30 Speaker B: And you just.\n07:33 Speaker B: I almost broke, you know, like the car.\n07:36 Speaker B: Like they needed to.\n07:36 Speaker B: My grandpa needed to basically like suck out like the, you know, like the thing.\n07:41 Speaker B: And it was just really lucky that was still functioning.\n07:44 Speaker A: Yeah.\n07:45 Speaker B: Okay.\n07:46 Speaker B: So like that was like one week.\n07:47 Speaker A: Oh my God.\n07:49 Speaker B: The next weeks was driving at night and not knowing how to put the lights on.\n07:59 Speaker B: I thought they are broken.\n08:01 Speaker B: You know, like I could have used the wrong button.\n08:04 Speaker A: Oh no.\n08:05 Speaker A: So you kept like spraying water or something?\n08:08 Speaker B: No, no, it was just like.\n08:09 Speaker B: Basically it was like a night.\n08:10 Speaker B: So it was just basically like driving through like the neighborhood, not seeing the street.\n08:15 Speaker B: And the street was going like this.\n08:16 Speaker B: So I was going like really small slowly on the, on the.\n08:19 Speaker B: On the road where nobody could see me.\n08:23 Speaker A: But you didn't get pulled over.\n08:27 Speaker A: That's good.\n08:33 Speaker B: And then like another time we're just like.\n08:36 Speaker B: I don't know, like I did again, you know, it was.\n08:41 Speaker B: Was cold outside and so the.\n08:45 Speaker B: The window was basically just like fogging over and I didn't know the button to, you know, like make it unfog.\n08:53 Speaker B: And so basically it was just like I had this seat with which I was like, basically trying to, like, constantly, you know, like, clear out the.\n09:02 Speaker B: The window so that I can see something.\n09:04 Speaker A: Yeah.\n09:05 Speaker B: At some point I was driving just, like, putting the side window down and, like, looking outside.\n09:13 Speaker A: So you do have to put all these three stories together where the car is jerking like this.\n09:19 Speaker A: You can't see anything, and your head is sticking out the window, and you get pulled over as the ultimate driving story.\n09:28 Speaker B: I mean, that was.\n09:29 Speaker B: That's like.\n09:30 Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know.\n09:31 Speaker B: Like, I got pulled over never with a car, but, like, a lot of times with the bike.\n09:37 Speaker A: Yeah.\n09:37 Speaker A: What do they pull you over for.\n09:41 Speaker B: Driving over?\n09:42 Speaker B: Red lights, mostly.\n09:44 Speaker A: Do you get.\n09:45 Speaker A: Do you have to pay a fine for that?\n09:47 Speaker B: Yeah, I paid, like, I think, like, four times.\n09:50 Speaker B: I think I paid already, like, €70 or something, so.\n09:55 Speaker A: But there's no, like, record where it gets more expensive or something bad happens.\n10:02 Speaker A: They take away your ability to ride bikes.\n10:04 Speaker A: They break your legs.\n10:06 Speaker A: No.\n10:10 Speaker B: They break your legs.\n10:12 Speaker B: This is only what happens when you do it the third time.\n10:14 Speaker A: Yeah.\n10:15 Speaker B: Okay.\n10:15 Speaker B: No way of controlling this in any other way.\n10:18 Speaker A: Just like, you know, remove the foot.\n10:23 Speaker A: But, you know, for me, it was.\n10:26 Speaker A: There's like, four cops, you know, like France, you know, like, I don't know why there's four of them.\n10:32 Speaker A: And they're.\n10:33 Speaker A: Most of them are, like, unfriendly.\n10:36 Speaker A: One of them was sweet.\n10:37 Speaker A: I think, like, nicer than the rest.\n10:40 Speaker A: But most of them were kind of, like, not looking very friendly.\n10:43 Speaker A: They had the cameras and, like, all the gear, you know, and I'm, like, sitting in this tiny little grandma car, not speaking French and just.\n10:51 Speaker A: Just feeling weak, you know, really weak and overpowered and meek.\n11:02 Speaker A: And it reminded me of being in the court systems in America.\n11:06 Speaker A: There's this.\n11:07 Speaker A: This, like, bad trip feeling, you know, where you.\n11:12 Speaker A: You were like, you're going there, and you can't not go there because they're the police and they're going to take you in this direction.\n11:20 Speaker A: Just like your.\n11:21 Speaker A: Your mind can be dragged like that, you know, the negative spiral.\n11:23 Speaker A: But thankfully, like, in the moment, I was fairly calm.\n11:29 Speaker A: I didn't feel.\n11:30 Speaker A: Because.\n11:31 Speaker A: Because I.\n11:31 Speaker A: I remember what it used to feel like when I would get pulled over and I would get this, like, really elevated, like.\n11:37 Speaker A: Like tense and, like, fear.\n11:40 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.\n11:41 Speaker A: And kind of like you look at yourself.\n11:43 Speaker A: And I kept trying to remember what the right, like, chant.\n11:50 Speaker A: I've heard some of these stories of people, like, doing these chants and, like, police walking away, basically, but which they kind of did because they.\n12:00 Speaker A: They didn't.\n12:01 Speaker A: Apparently they didn't like the fact That I was wearing headphones while driving.\n12:04 Speaker A: That's like one of the big flags.\n12:07 Speaker A: And.\n12:07 Speaker A: Oh, yeah, the other one was I went like the road was gonna fork like this, and I didn't go to the right left early enough before the lines turned from dots to white.\n12:20 Speaker A: You know what I'm talking about?\n12:21 Speaker A: Like, the fork was gonna go for, like the highway was gonna go like this.\n12:24 Speaker A: And there's like a stripe thick line and then dots, my dear.\n12:31 Speaker A: So I went over there.\n12:32 Speaker A: I went over the white line, and that was it.\n12:36 Speaker A: They were like, oh, this guy.\n12:38 Speaker A: And they pulled me over for something silly.\n12:40 Speaker A: I wasn't going faster anyway.\n12:42 Speaker A: But they didn't write that down in my ticket.\n12:44 Speaker A: They only wrote driving without a license.\n12:47 Speaker A: Apparently my American license wasn't valid.\n12:50 Speaker B: Oh, that's very nice of them.\n12:52 Speaker A: Yeah.\n12:52 Speaker A: So I think it kind of, like, works out, except for.\n12:55 Speaker A: Should I call the gas station, dear?\n13:00 Speaker A: Might have to call the gas station and try to tell them that we're gonna.\n13:05 Speaker A: Because they.\n13:07 Speaker A: They're forcing us to leave the car at the gas station until.\n13:13 Speaker A: Until Joe gets all these papers and she has to go to the police station, validate the papers, and then go to the gas station.\n13:20 Speaker A: And I don't want the gas station to tow the car.\n13:22 Speaker A: And then it'll get more complicated.\n13:25 Speaker B: Yeah, sure.\n13:27 Speaker B: So.\n13:30 Speaker A: Should I try doing that?\n13:33 Speaker A: I'll try doing that and then I'll call you right back.\n13:35 Speaker A: Because Joe has had to handle a lot of things because of my lack of French.\n13:41 Speaker A: And this is the thing, like, the hard part of the hardest part is, like, feeling like I'm making everyone's life harder because of it, you know, And I feel like that a lot because of this add stuff.\n13:53 Speaker A: Right.\n13:53 Speaker A: Like, I forget things and I break things or just.\n13:59 Speaker A: And I.\n14:00 Speaker A: Yeah.\n14:01 Speaker A: And I can't handle bureaucracy or paperwork or taxes very easily.\n14:04 Speaker A: And, you know, like.\n14:05 Speaker A: And I think Joe had.\n14:06 Speaker A: Has to handle a lot of that, and it makes it bad, and then it makes me feel ashamed.\n14:12 Speaker A: And la dee da.\n14:14 Speaker B: We are like downs.\n14:20 Speaker B: And at the same time, you bring so much aliveness and beauty and creativity.\n14:25 Speaker B: So, you know, it's like it's a trade off, and we're all, you know, dependent on one another.\n14:30 Speaker B: So.\n14:31 Speaker A: Yeah, I think I actually lost one of my relationships that was potentially a good one because of that, because I had just no idea why someone might like me because I felt like I didn't provide anything.\n14:47 Speaker A: And then I realized, like, someone might just like me for being me.\n14:51 Speaker A: You know, I didn't realize that at the time.\n14:53 Speaker A: I was like, I don't have to give them.\n14:56 Speaker A: Because in a similar way, most of my relationships with women were like, they have the job, they have the house.\n15:03 Speaker A: They have the stability.\n15:04 Speaker A: They have all these things.\n15:06 Speaker A: And I come in, I'm like, well.\n15:09 Speaker B: That'S, you know, that's.\n15:10 Speaker B: That's how it balances out.\n15:11 Speaker B: Like, I mean, you know, you're providing something to each other.\n15:14 Speaker A: Right?\n15:14 Speaker B: Like, you need the stability part and the other person needs the lifeness part.\n15:17 Speaker B: You know, those two.\n15:18 Speaker A: Yeah.\n15:20 Speaker A: Yeah.\n15:20 Speaker A: But from coming from the alive side, it's really hard to, like, look at the other side and realize that you're contributing.\n15:27 Speaker A: You know, you're like, you have this, like, you.\n15:31 Speaker A: And you suffer to get it.\n15:32 Speaker A: You go to work, you do things you don't want to do.\n15:34 Speaker A: You.\n15:35 Speaker A: You don't really look very happy.\n15:37 Speaker A: You.\n15:39 Speaker A: And here's me, like, floating through your city and crashing on your couch and living with you.\n15:45 Speaker A: And.\n15:47 Speaker A: And that's something that provides something.\n15:49 Speaker A: It's.\n15:49 Speaker A: It's a weird thing to.\n15:51 Speaker A: To feel like you can provide the thing that people want to do, but they have forced themselves to do something else because they think they need the security.\n15:59 Speaker A: It's.\n16:00 Speaker A: It doesn't feel like a balance.\n16:01 Speaker A: You know what I mean?\n16:01 Speaker A: It feels like I get to be the chaotic guy who is enjoying life.\n16:07 Speaker B: I get to.\n16:08 Speaker A: And.\n16:08 Speaker A: And that's why it was really hard for me to recognize, I guess.\n16:12 Speaker B: Yeah.\n16:13 Speaker B: Okay.\n16:13 Speaker A: So, yeah, I'll call them.\n16:16 Speaker A: I'll do my best to tell them.\n16:22 Speaker A: Remove le voiture.\n16:25 Speaker A: Inshallah.\n16:30 Speaker A: I'll do Google Translate.\n16:32 Speaker B: Like.\n16:33 Speaker B: Like, create the text beforehand so that you can already know.\n16:37 Speaker A: Yeah.\n16:37 Speaker A: Yeah.\n16:38 Speaker A: And then I'll be back.\n16:39 Speaker A: Hopefully it won't take more than five minutes.\n16:40 Speaker A: And do you want to make a Google Doc with some, like, things that we should think about today?\n16:46 Speaker A: And then.\n16:47 Speaker A: Unless you already have that, you might already have that.\n16:53 Speaker B: Okay.\n16:54 Speaker A: Yeah.\n16:55 Speaker A: I'll be right back.\n19:12 Speaker A: Bonjour.\n19:14 Speaker A: Bonjour.\n19:16 Speaker A: Bonjour.\n19:32 Speaker A: Police.\n19:32 Speaker A: Lagare la.\n19:39 Speaker A: Okay.\n19:39 Speaker A: Mercy.\n19:40 Speaker A: Desert.\n19:40 Speaker A: Mercy.\n20:00 Speaker A: That's cool.\n20:03 Speaker A: I did it in French.\n20:05 Speaker A: That's cool.\n22:17 Speaker A: Yeah, you can ask her if she wants to reship or refund and tell her it's no problem either way and that we're really sorry.\n22:23 Speaker A: I'm not sure how I did that.\n22:24 Speaker A: So I accidentally sent her a pink Lotus instead of a rose.\n22:29 Speaker A: Oh, wait, she wants.\n22:31 Speaker A: Oh, pink Lotus.\n22:35 Speaker A: Which one?\n22:35 Speaker A: I sent her a Buckwood instead of the rose.\n22:37 Speaker A: She wants it.\n22:38 Speaker A: Yeah.\n22:38 Speaker A: I don't know how I did that.\n24:41 Speaker B: It's.\n36:37 Speaker A: Bonjour.\n36:51 Speaker B: Hello.\n37:04 Speaker A: Okay.\n37:52 Speaker B: Oops.\n37:53 Speaker B: Sorry, I didn't see.\n37:54 Speaker B: Sorry, I didn't see your message.\n37:56 Speaker B: Your message.\n38:01 Speaker A: Okay.\n38:02 Speaker A: Okay.\n38:05 Speaker A: Okay.\n38:06 Speaker A: Oh.\n38:08 Speaker A: Hello?\n38:09 Speaker A: Hello?\n38:12 Speaker A: Are you here?\n38:13 Speaker A: Where are you?\n38:20 Speaker A: Hello?\n38:24 Speaker A: I called them.\n38:25 Speaker B: Sorry.\n38:26 Speaker B: Sorry.\n38:27 Speaker A: No worries.\n38:29 Speaker A: I called them and they said, was it a success?\n38:32 Speaker A: Yeah, I think so.\n38:34 Speaker A: I think so.\n38:36 Speaker A: They said, no problem.\n38:42 Speaker A: Great.\n38:43 Speaker A: I.\n38:43 Speaker A: I hope they don't tell us.\n38:44 Speaker B: I mean, that's.\n38:45 Speaker B: It's such a.\n38:46 Speaker B: It's such a scary thing.\n38:48 Speaker B: Such a scary thing.\n38:49 Speaker A: Cars.\n38:50 Speaker B: Call them and to call them and not know what to say.\n38:53 Speaker B: Not know what to say.\n38:54 Speaker A: Yeah.\n38:55 Speaker A: Now the only thing I'm wondering is, did they understand me or are they.\n39:03 Speaker B: Just like, no problem, no problem.\n39:07 Speaker B: We like cars.\n39:08 Speaker A: No problem.\n39:08 Speaker A: It's already towed.\n39:12 Speaker A: Something like that.\n39:13 Speaker A: Yeah, I think it will be okay.\n39:20 Speaker B: I can hear myself.\n39:21 Speaker B: I can hear myself doubling.\n39:22 Speaker A: Oh, wait.\n39:23 Speaker A: I think I might have you over here.\n39:25 Speaker A: No, I don't.\n39:26 Speaker A: Let me plug in the headphones.\n39:33 Speaker A: Okay.\n39:43 Speaker A: Okay.\n39:43 Speaker A: How's that?\n39:46 Speaker B: Hello?\n39:46 Speaker B: Hello?\n39:47 Speaker A: Any better?\n39:48 Speaker A: Less.\n39:48 Speaker A: W.\n39:52 Speaker A: That's good.\n39:56 Speaker B: So the world is a little bit brighter.\n40:00 Speaker A: Yeah.\n40:01 Speaker A: After this.\n40:03 Speaker A: After the call or because of the sun or.\n40:08 Speaker B: I mean because of your courage of reaching out.\n40:17 Speaker B: 1.\n40:17 Speaker B: One thing less to worry about.\n40:19 Speaker A: One thing less to worry about.\n40:20 Speaker A: We'll see.\n40:21 Speaker A: Inshallah, it all goes well, by the end of the day, if we have the car again, then we're.\n40:28 Speaker A: We're good.\n40:29 Speaker A: Then we'll be good.\n40:32 Speaker B: What I propose to start with, you.\n40:35 Speaker A: Have a duck.\n40:38 Speaker B: A dog.\n40:39 Speaker B: But I want to start with like a little meditation.\n40:42 Speaker B: Like a three minute meditation.\n40:47 Speaker B: I'm just gonna see how to.\n40:53 Speaker B: Because I think we need to share tab, so.\n40:59 Speaker B: I don't have a Rick.\n41:00 Speaker B: I only have it on my laptop.\n41:02 Speaker B: I'm wondering.\n41:17 Speaker A: I haven't done a guided meditation in a long time.\n41:20 Speaker A: I meditate, but I haven't tried a guided one.\n41:29 Speaker B: Yeah, actually, I cannot.\n41:33 Speaker B: Let me.\n41:40 Speaker B: Okay, let me bring up, like a very classical one.\n41:42 Speaker B: I wanted to try out something else, but that experiment will need to wait for another time.\n41:50 Speaker B: We'll do a very quick dropping anchor.\n41:56 Speaker B: You know, Dropping anchor.\n41:59 Speaker A: Surprise me.\n42:03 Speaker B: Surprising you will be.\n42:07 Speaker B: So.\n42:09 Speaker A: Meditation, unlike any meditation.\n42:17 Speaker B: It is like the ultimate.\n42:25 Speaker B: It's pretty simple.\n42:28 Speaker C: Take a moment to just acknowledge the thoughts and feelings that are showing up for you right now.\n42:42 Speaker C: Just notice what your mind is doing.\n42:46 Speaker C: Is it racing?\n42:47 Speaker B: Work?\n42:49 Speaker C: Erring?\n42:50 Speaker C: Worrying?\n42:53 Speaker C: Notice what you can feel in your body.\n43:01 Speaker C: Are there some painful feelings in your body or is it numb or empty?\n43:07 Speaker B: Empty.\n43:09 Speaker C: And just take a moment to put into words what it is that you're feeling and thinking.\n43:17 Speaker C: You might say, I'm feeling angry.\n43:20 Speaker C: Or is my mind worrying now?\n43:26 Speaker C: Come back into your body.\n43:29 Speaker C: Push your feet into the floor.\n43:32 Speaker C: Straighten your back.\n43:35 Speaker C: Perhaps take a breath or two.\n43:40 Speaker C: Move your arms and legs in some way.\n43:44 Speaker C: Get a sense of control over your arms and legs.\n43:50 Speaker C: For example, maybe gently push your fingertips together.\n43:55 Speaker C: Maybe gently move your feet up and down.\n44:00 Speaker C: Perhaps have a gentle stretch sense of coming back into your body right now.\n44:10 Speaker C: And now engage with the world around you.\n44:15 Speaker C: Open your eyes and ears and look around and notice what can you see and hear, what can you touch and taste and smell.\n44:27 Speaker C: So there's a whole world around you right now.\n44:31 Speaker C: There are thoughts and feelings showing up, and there's a body here that you have control over, and there's a world around you that you can engage in.\n44:43 Speaker C: Notice where you are and what you're doing and consider where you need to put your attention right now to make the most of this situation that you're in.\n45:12 Speaker B: That was it.\n45:13 Speaker A: Yeah, you said it was going to be simple, but it wasn't.\n45:18 Speaker B: Where do we need to put our attention right now?\n45:24 Speaker A: Yeah, I think the.\n45:31 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I.\n45:31 Speaker B: Can you hear me?\n45:35 Speaker A: The place that we can put our attention is your video off.\n45:48 Speaker A: Hello?\n45:54 Speaker B: That you shared.\n45:55 Speaker A: Okay.\n45:56 Speaker A: So for whatever reason, the computer is not the good place to do this call, but the no safari maybe could be the reason.\n46:10 Speaker A: Yeah, attention.\n46:14 Speaker A: The place to put our attention.\n46:16 Speaker A: I was saying that, you know, you said it was a very simple meditation, but he said some crazy stuff, if you really think about it.\n46:27 Speaker A: That we have a body that we have control over and that there is a world around us that's not us and that we're perceivers.\n46:41 Speaker A: That's a big deal.\n46:42 Speaker A: That's some three foundational, huge things.\n47:03 Speaker A: Oh, this meditation itself.\n47:06 Speaker A: Okay.\n47:19 Speaker A: It's like Sam Harris's cousin or something.\n47:27 Speaker A: Meditation stuff.\n47:30 Speaker A: Yeah.\n47:31 Speaker A: I'm gonna get onto the computer because this would be a very small screen to see on the laptop, on the.\n47:35 Speaker A: On the phone.\n47:36 Speaker A: But yeah, I'm trying CRAM right now, but I can see it.\n47:40 Speaker A: Ikigai Dashboard website.\n47:45 Speaker A: Can we start with, like, an intention, you know, like, what is our intention?\n47:50 Speaker B: It, like kindness.\n48:33 Speaker B: Kiwi, which is wonderful, but, like, you know, it's a deliberately created to not need to put any thought or effort into it in the long term.\n48:44 Speaker B: Right.\n48:46 Speaker B: And so it's more like, I think about, like, building together, you know, like, think there's something here, like, you know, building together.\n48:55 Speaker B: And for me, like, really the aspect is also, like, about the together part.\n48:59 Speaker B: It's like, you know, building together for me, which implies kind of like thinking Together.\n49:10 Speaker B: And, like, one thing that I really appreciate is I think your thinking is a lot deeper than.\n49:17 Speaker B: Than mine.\n49:18 Speaker B: I'm more like on the practical kind of.\n49:23 Speaker B: I don't know, like, practical level.\n49:25 Speaker B: Like, I think I can.\n49:25 Speaker B: I can.\n49:26 Speaker A: This is good.\n49:27 Speaker A: So someone has to be that.\n49:29 Speaker B: Yeah, I think.\n49:30 Speaker B: I think I'm quite good at, like.\n49:32 Speaker B: Or I want to get to be, like, a good bridge between.\n49:39 Speaker B: You know, I kind of, like, hold the tension between, like, both the very practical and the kind of mystical.\n49:50 Speaker B: And I think you're more like a bit on the, you know, you're on the deeper level, but because of that, it doesn't connect often.\n49:59 Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely see that.\n50:02 Speaker A: For sure.\n50:04 Speaker B: It's a bit like the three horizon thing and like, you know, like this.\n50:08 Speaker B: Yeah.\n50:09 Speaker B: And so, yeah, I would love to.\n50:15 Speaker B: I would love to.\n50:16 Speaker B: Basically, like, I think that together we could actually.\n50:20 Speaker B: There's a third person missing maybe.\n50:24 Speaker B: Actually someone like Cat, which is, you know, because, like, you know, like, you're, like, completely honest.\n50:30 Speaker B: I'm, like, in the middle, I think, you know, like, what needs someone, like, in like, a third person that's like, really, like.\n50:37 Speaker B: No, more like, like, practical and really, like, concentrated on, like, you know, Josephine.\n50:43 Speaker A: Is kind of like that.\n50:44 Speaker A: Like.\n50:45 Speaker A: Yeah, I tell her stuff and she's like.\n50:47 Speaker A: Because she just wants things very clear and simple and like, exactly, like, she just.\n50:52 Speaker A: That's the.\n50:53 Speaker A: That's the thing that, like, I'm starting to notice, you know, like, when you and I see text written by LLMs, we're like, ouch.\n51:01 Speaker A: Ouch.\n51:01 Speaker A: Right?\n51:02 Speaker A: But there's just some people that are just, like, going for it.\n51:04 Speaker A: Just like, they put it out there.\n51:05 Speaker A: They're like, it works.\n51:07 Speaker A: Keep going, moving and acting and Anyway, so it's.\n51:11 Speaker A: It's interesting.\n51:12 Speaker A: But, yeah, I align a lot with those, like, intentions.\n51:19 Speaker A: Yeah, definitely.\n51:20 Speaker A: Building together, thinking together.\n51:25 Speaker A: For me, it's like, you know, because we have our primary intentions, I think, for whenever we talk about our work and unlocking human potential for positive change or helping people find what's beautiful inside and bring it into the world or.\n51:41 Speaker A: Or whatever it is.\n51:43 Speaker A: But it's towards that.\n51:44 Speaker A: Right.\n51:44 Speaker A: It's like getting a.\n51:53 Speaker A: An exploration buddy that helps make our clarifying intentions real by doing it right.\n52:06 Speaker A: Because we're doing it individually.\n52:09 Speaker A: And like you were saying, you're way more practical, which helps it be real.\n52:17 Speaker A: I'm gonna try.\n52:18 Speaker A: Try to say something that is important for me, but I don't have the exact language.\n52:23 Speaker A: But it's like, I'm so excited to love somebody by working with them well enough to know and trust their intentions.\n52:31 Speaker A: Does that make sense?\n52:35 Speaker B: Yeah.\n52:36 Speaker A: Where I can trust them.\n52:37 Speaker A: Like what?\n52:38 Speaker A: Like that.\n52:39 Speaker A: You know, because a lot of times I see sometimes people's work and because I don't know them well enough, I'm like, do they just want to be famous or they just want to like, make money or they.\n52:48 Speaker A: But like, to know and to trust that.\n52:50 Speaker A: Okay, you know, we have different languages to talk about what meaning is and what is meaningful and what is good.\n52:58 Speaker A: Like, maybe in my heart and with my own, like, communities, I'll use a specific language, but to, to know and to trust that we're serving the same good, you know, somehow like that, even if it's not in the same spiritual community or religious dogma or language.\n53:18 Speaker A: And I think working to build together and to talk about, like, our intentions and the why and the what back and forth will help me.\n53:30 Speaker A: Yeah.\n53:32 Speaker A: Build that loving relationship.\n53:34 Speaker A: Like, good guy, something.\n53:38 Speaker A: Like, I don't, I don't know if that makes sense, but there's something there for me.\n53:45 Speaker B: I think also there's like this, there's a lot in there, right?\n53:50 Speaker B: Like this, like the.\n53:53 Speaker B: Essentially like the kind of.\n53:56 Speaker B: I think the, the profound thing behind that is that it's more of like an intuition.\n54:09 Speaker B: But the, you know, co founders tend to fail in a way.\n54:14 Speaker B: Like, like, not tend to fail, but like tend to diverge.\n54:20 Speaker B: Because I mean, the things.\n54:23 Speaker B: There's two things.\n54:24 Speaker B: There's like the.\n54:25 Speaker B: Or maybe it's the same thing.\n54:27 Speaker B: I don't know.\n54:27 Speaker B: But like, it's like something around, like egocenteredness, you know, you're trying to get something out for yourself versus moving like the idea of like serving the same good, moving towards the same kind of like transcendental objective in a way.\n54:55 Speaker B: And I'm kind of.\n54:58 Speaker A: Yeah, when you have this transcendental objective, like, you evolve, right.\n55:03 Speaker A: But when you're both committed to that greater thing, like you can.\n55:07 Speaker A: And you, you attune with each other, you understand, like, why are we making these different decisions versus these decisions?\n55:12 Speaker A: You can, you can sort of go towards something together rather than like ego.\n55:17 Speaker A: Like egos are different.\n55:18 Speaker A: Right.\n55:18 Speaker A: They're going to be orthogonal or another goal.\n55:21 Speaker A: Right.\n55:21 Speaker A: It could be like, I don't know, like, to prove your parents wrong or something.\n55:25 Speaker A: And you, you don't know that about your co founder, but that's actually the motivator.\n55:31 Speaker A: And then, and then you can drift apart.\n55:34 Speaker A: And I think that, you know, for me with Munir, like, I.\n55:37 Speaker A: I see a lot of times.\n55:38 Speaker A: And the thing is he changes.\n55:40 Speaker A: He's changing.\n55:40 Speaker A: And so I, I do see like over time that we're were, were aligning but there were some times where he's like, we have to work faster to save the world.\n55:47 Speaker A: And there was this kind of fear language that I wasn't really happy to be using and I felt estranged from that way of thinking and I don't know, you know, where that was coming from.\n56:00 Speaker A: And I.\n56:02 Speaker A: Anyway, that's just a specific thing but I think these are some good, good intentions here.\n56:07 Speaker A: There's something about serving the greater and seeing each other.\n56:11 Speaker A: Something like that.\n56:13 Speaker B: Yeah.\n56:14 Speaker B: And I think there's also like, maybe there's like this thing of like which comes back to me which is like playfully.\n56:21 Speaker A: Yeah.\n56:21 Speaker A: And also.\n56:22 Speaker A: Can you just put like a bunch of dollar bills somewhere?\n56:25 Speaker B: Oh yeah.\n56:29 Speaker A: Playful.\n56:29 Speaker A: Playfully and sustainably.\n56:30 Speaker A: I guess could be the worst.\n56:40 Speaker A: Yeah.\n56:40 Speaker A: I guess for me a personal intention which is related to something you mentioned before is to, to feel like I'm actually taking being usefully intelligent instead of stupidly intelligent.\n56:56 Speaker A: I feel like I have a lot to offer and give that no one knows that I can't share because of.\n57:02 Speaker A: I'm stuck in my way of being.\n57:04 Speaker A: That puts me into this super ultra meta cognitive way of thinking where I'm always.\n57:09 Speaker A: What's the principle behind that?\n57:11 Speaker A: How does that principle come up?\n57:12 Speaker A: What are the, you know, and I can never make it useful for anybody.\n57:17 Speaker A: And so that's, I guess a practical thing for me is like I, I want to be in service and I can't on my own.\n57:24 Speaker A: It seems that's what it seems I could learn potentially but it's not my natural way partners.\n57:31 Speaker B: I think it's a trade off.\n57:32 Speaker B: You know, this is what I'm trying to do essentially.\n57:34 Speaker B: And it's a, it's a stretching exercise.\n57:36 Speaker B: Right.\n57:37 Speaker B: I both need to stretch more into the direction practical and at the same time I'm trying to stretch, you know, like it's a direction of making it more deep, you know, like making it more right.\n57:48 Speaker A: In a way more conforming to reality.\n57:52 Speaker A: That's where coherence.\n57:53 Speaker B: Yes.\n57:54 Speaker B: Yeah.\n57:58 Speaker B: Well, I just updated my ikigai statement this morning.\n58:10 Speaker B: I actually just changed.\n58:12 Speaker B: I changed two words recently.\n58:16 Speaker B: So it was for a long time.\n58:19 Speaker B: I create spaces that bring people to life and then shifted to.\n58:28 Speaker B: I create experiences.\n58:34 Speaker A: Oh, I remember.\n58:35 Speaker B: Yeah, that spark aliveness and so the shift towards experiences and also like a bit more humility.\n58:41 Speaker B: Spark aliveness feels a bit more concise and real.\n58:48 Speaker B: And this morning it was just a reminder of like I want to Co create experiences and not do it alone.\n58:58 Speaker B: Yeah.\n58:59 Speaker B: And I, I like this thing of like, loving transformational experience designer.\n59:05 Speaker B: It's a bit heavy.\n59:07 Speaker B: Maybe there's like a easier way to say it, but like, is the bridging the gap between the mystical and the practical, making deep wisdom accessible and applicable to everyday lives and making that stretch?\n59:21 Speaker A: Yeah.\n59:23 Speaker A: And yeah, it's, it's so interesting because that's a lot of the.\n59:27 Speaker A: You know, I spent three hours in a car yesterday before I got pulled over.\n59:31 Speaker A: And the crazy thing is right before I got pulled over, I was making some significant process progress on Descartesian dualism, and therefore I am.\n59:42 Speaker A: And what are the foundational observable properties of awareness that can lead to alignment on values?\n59:50 Speaker A: Is there anything there?\n59:51 Speaker A: Anyway, so I was actually making progress and the re.\n59:54 Speaker A: Wait, where'd it go?\n59:54 Speaker A: You, you.\n59:55 Speaker A: Oh, no, here.\n59:56 Speaker A: Making deep wisdom accessible and applicable to everyday life.\n60:00 Speaker A: And it's this idea of, of, of wisdom and agreeing on what wisdom is.\n60:06 Speaker A: The, the scary thing is the, the, the thing that I'm trying not to do is to impose, you know, any of my cultural or impersonal ideas about what, what goodness is, where, what wisdom might look like.\n60:20 Speaker A: And so the thing that I have been really.\n60:24 Speaker A: And maybe this is not what we're going to do here because it is extremely philosophical.\n60:28 Speaker A: Like, the thing that I was working on yesterday might not fit here, but it is related to the prompt that I gave you.\n60:33 Speaker A: And the reason why that prompt exists is related here because this, it relates to Joe's work and the values realism work.\n60:42 Speaker A: The problem with values realism is not everyone agrees values realism is that you can actually listen within to some kind of wisdom and it helps you identify actions.\n60:55 Speaker A: You, you can know what is meaningful for you.\n60:58 Speaker A: That is, in a sense, true and that there's actually a way of articulating it so that people can see layers of more meaningful or less meaningful things.\n61:14 Speaker A: Like, you don't have to agree with someone, but you can actually agree that in their context that this is a more meaningful way of being.\n61:20 Speaker A: And that was Joe's research and his values graph stuff and the values graph process.\n61:25 Speaker A: The problem with this is you have to have a specific belief of like your ontology and your epistemology.\n61:36 Speaker A: So in your epistemology, you have to accept inner observation as information that this is a real thing.\n61:44 Speaker A: And for the.\n61:46 Speaker A: Anyway, sorry, I don't want to get too, too deep into it, but not everyone believes this.\n61:50 Speaker A: And so I was trying to figure out, can we come to what I was Describing as like a meta epistemology, like what are the ground rules?\n61:59 Speaker A: And for, for Descartes it was I think, therefore I am.\n62:01 Speaker A: And I was wondering, can we go and find other clearly knowable and experiential things that are as foundational as I think therefore I am, or the.\n62:15 Speaker A: Oh no.\n62:17 Speaker B: Touching the ground, something.\n62:21 Speaker A: Something clips.\n62:21 Speaker A: Yeah, touching the ground of being, but making it something that is, is you could basically tell in a short story and then creating these fundamental principles from which we can get to a form or a minimum subset of values.\n62:39 Speaker A: Realism.\n62:40 Speaker A: Because without that it's going to be really hard to talk about.\n62:43 Speaker A: Like what is wisdom in a way that can be cross culturally relevant or, or actually are you true.\n62:50 Speaker B: Are you reinventing Buddhism?\n62:53 Speaker A: The thing is, I think Buddhism, yes, is a big inspiration because they are talking about the problem with Buddhism is they already include inner observation as a form of Data for Science 2.0.\n63:07 Speaker A: And so Science 2.0 needs this shared meta ontology that we can bring people along for the ride essentially into Buddhism.\n63:16 Speaker A: And then that's what I was thinking.\n63:18 Speaker A: You know, parliaments or come alive could be data sources for wisdom 2.0 or sorry, science 2.0, using the internal observation stuff.\n63:29 Speaker A: But before building out that stack, I wanted to come up with the, the foundational like principles so that we can get people to agree that internal observation is a reliable source of, of truth.\n63:42 Speaker A: But that's, that's a big, a big question and maybe not the one that we're going to talk about today because it's still in development and not applied enough.\n63:52 Speaker A: I think if we worked just on, you know, there's things that sound true.\n63:59 Speaker A: There's like literally a whole industry built around this idea of wisdom is like, yeah, good enough.\n64:06 Speaker A: It sounds true.\n64:07 Speaker B: Yeah.\n64:08 Speaker A: And we could probably just work with that.\n64:12 Speaker B: Yeah.\n64:14 Speaker B: So let's bring this together like in terms of like clarifying intentions.\n64:22 Speaker B: Maybe we can just say like, maybe like should we just break it down to, let's say, you know, like five principles or something like this, like this.\n64:35 Speaker A: This person's been calling me a bunch.\n64:36 Speaker A: I'm just gonna.\n64:38 Speaker A: Bonjour.\n64:46 Speaker A: Doorbell.\n64:47 Speaker A: How you say doorbell?\n64:52 Speaker A: Ring the.\n64:54 Speaker B: Which floor?\n64:54 Speaker B: Which floor?\n65:02 Speaker B: Yes.\n65:03 Speaker B: Yes.\n65:03 Speaker A: Okay, I'll open the door.\n65:24 Speaker B: Sa.\n65:55 Speaker A: Okay.\n65:56 Speaker A: Okay.\n66:17 Speaker A: Allah is Ar Rahman.\n66:22 Speaker A: Ar Rahman means infinite good, compassionate love and all our grace and mercy.\n66:32 Speaker A: Rahma is an outpouring of goodness and benefaction to any need, serving the whole out of love and compassion and kind.\n66:43 Speaker B: Of like bridging the gap between it is all kind of like, let's Say deep.\n66:47 Speaker B: Embrace deep and practical or something, I guess, yeah.\n66:51 Speaker A: Finding the deep, making it practical.\n66:56 Speaker A: Because there's something about, like, I could just say making that exploration and making it practical, like, serving the whole sustainable.\n67:06 Speaker B: Five.\n67:07 Speaker A: Was there five?\n67:08 Speaker B: I don't know.\n67:09 Speaker A: It's like, five is a good number.\n67:11 Speaker A: It's.\n67:12 Speaker B: It's nice.\n67:13 Speaker B: I mean, one thing that I added at the bottom is, like, for me is this idea of, like, Dharma Gates.\n67:18 Speaker B: It's kind of like, how do we create entry points that enable people to, I mean, very practically for themselves, you know, like, from an individualistic standpoint, it's like, oh, I'm feeling good.\n67:34 Speaker B: But then from, like, a deeper standpoint, it, like, invites them into this journey to basically come more and more alive and, like, decenter from themselves and become good for others as well.\n67:51 Speaker A: So do you mean other people to be a part of the thinking process of what the.\n67:59 Speaker A: What's like, behind the design of the.\n68:03 Speaker B: No, no, not.\n68:04 Speaker A: That's not protocols or the people.\n68:07 Speaker B: People.\n68:07 Speaker B: People come alive, you know, in their own ways.\n68:11 Speaker B: The tools that are being built support them to both thrive themselves, but also become useful for others and like good.\n68:19 Speaker A: Fathers and serve together with us.\n68:23 Speaker A: So basically, you're talking about, like, a domino effect or a cascade or how does what we share help people share the same?\n68:30 Speaker A: Or.\n68:31 Speaker B: I mean, basically, like, for me, it's just more like kind of this question of, like, how do you mobilize more people to wake up, grow up, and, like, show up so that we can, you know, not so we can do this together.\n68:46 Speaker B: And it's also like, kind of like this thing of we're in this process with them, you know, kind of like, it's like we're.\n68:55 Speaker B: We're building tools to enable ourselves to wake up, grow up, show up, you know, clean up.\n69:04 Speaker B: But those tools are useful for others, and so we can walk this path together.\n69:11 Speaker B: For me, like, whenever I need something that's kind of like the idea.\n69:18 Speaker A: That's why I think what we're.\n69:20 Speaker A: What you are doing in particular, and being involved in a school system is so interesting because I was thinking about where materialism gets introduced and the idea of separation gets introduced.\n69:36 Speaker A: And it's cool.\n69:37 Speaker A: Like, where else?\n69:38 Speaker A: It's like, it's a pop school, popular culture, it's in the environment.\n69:42 Speaker A: But a lot of it is kind of encoded in the.\n69:47 Speaker A: The theory of evolution.\n69:49 Speaker A: Even very simply put, like, there are a lot of implicit implications.\n69:53 Speaker A: Even though modern evolutionary biology is changing its opinion, there isn't this modern evolutionary biology opinion in elementary school or in Middle school, it's like animals kill each other and the one that wins, wins, and we don't really know what good is, but you're alive and, you know, anyways, like.\n70:11 Speaker A: And so you being in school, I think, is a big deal, but I think there needs.\n70:16 Speaker A: And.\n70:16 Speaker A: And that could be how this.\n70:18 Speaker A: This thing works.\n70:19 Speaker A: Right?\n70:20 Speaker A: Like, you're mobilizing others is in working within the systems and finding how whatever we build plugs into them in an easy way.\n70:33 Speaker A: Right.\n70:34 Speaker A: Like, I was thinking about the tools that I'm exploring, like, come alive and other things like that.\n70:40 Speaker A: And I thought, like, should it be something else that people go to or should we find a way of integrating into people's flows?\n70:46 Speaker A: You know, like.\n70:50 Speaker A: Like we can.\n70:52 Speaker A: One of the ideas that I had was like, okay, it could be a.\n70:55 Speaker A: I'll help you come up with your social media strategy and you talk with it and you like, it helps you think about what you should post, but in doing so, it's actually going through these processes behind the scenes.\n71:06 Speaker A: Right?\n71:07 Speaker B: Yeah.\n71:07 Speaker A: Anyhow.\n71:08 Speaker A: So this idea.\n71:09 Speaker B: But I mean, that's essentially what.\n71:12 Speaker B: That's what essentially what many mystics do in the end.\n71:14 Speaker B: Right.\n71:14 Speaker B: Is like, they're kind of like inserting it into different processes.\n71:16 Speaker B: I don't know.\n71:17 Speaker B: You have like.\n71:18 Speaker B: Or they create certain principles that then inform, you know, I don't know.\n71:23 Speaker B: I was thinking of Steiner.\n71:26 Speaker B: And like, you know, it informs schools and then it informs farming, and then it informs, you know, like, I don't know, something else.\n71:35 Speaker B: Like movement practices.\n71:37 Speaker A: Yeah.\n71:38 Speaker A: Like even just objects, materials.\n71:42 Speaker A: Like, what do they say?\n71:44 Speaker A: The medium is the message.\n71:46 Speaker A: And the way that our mostly digital landscape is set up is the message.\n71:54 Speaker A: And so the.\n71:57 Speaker A: Anyway, this gets into like techniques.\n72:00 Speaker A: But I was thinking, like, what are the implications within the protocols that we use of communication?\n72:09 Speaker A: You know, they call it communication technology.\n72:12 Speaker A: As if, like, communication is neutral.\n72:14 Speaker A: It's just the transmission of.\n72:15 Speaker A: Of knowledge, of information instead of cooperation.\n72:20 Speaker A: Technology.\n72:21 Speaker A: Right.\n72:21 Speaker A: Like technology.\n72:22 Speaker A: Like, the real purpose of communication is like humans cooperating with each other, talking with each other, thinking, being, aligning, and making that like a foundational part of the protocol.\n72:35 Speaker A: Because right now it's just, did you get these set of characters transmitted versus was there mutual understanding formed across the parties?\n72:44 Speaker A: Like, did people actually.\n72:46 Speaker A: You know, and what if that was a part of the.\n72:50 Speaker A: I don't know if you know anything about how HTTP is formalized, but there's like this thing, it's called ack, which is an acknowledgement.\n72:55 Speaker A: Meaning.\n72:56 Speaker A: Meaning that the packages came and are confirmed to be valid and that act happens in a conversation with people where you can actually see and feel and understand whether or not that resonance that you actually were able to get your idea across, you feel heard.\n73:14 Speaker A: Right.\n73:15 Speaker A: And there's none of that in the protocols.\n73:17 Speaker A: And so anyway, we're getting into some of the, like the strategic stuff.\n73:22 Speaker B: Let me just see if we car.\n73:25 Speaker B: Let's, let's, let's refine the common intention.\n73:29 Speaker A: I think it's sustainable, promoting aliveness.\n73:35 Speaker A: How's one and two different?\n73:39 Speaker B: Which one?\n73:40 Speaker A: Serving the whole and promoting aliveness.\n73:42 Speaker A: It seems very debatably different, but I think it's good.\n73:48 Speaker A: Maybe it's.\n73:48 Speaker A: It clarifies things.\n73:50 Speaker B: Yeah.\n73:51 Speaker A: Specific.\n73:53 Speaker B: Or I.\n73:54 Speaker B: Maybe you could also like.\n73:58 Speaker B: I mean in the end it's like kind of like something like the theory of changes could be something like this.\n74:03 Speaker B: Right.\n74:04 Speaker B: Like the.\n74:05 Speaker B: I think we both are like deeply inspired by the don't ask what the world needs.\n74:09 Speaker B: Yeah.\n74:11 Speaker B: Right.\n74:11 Speaker B: So you can say.\n74:13 Speaker A: And I think the, the implication is that there's a.\n74:18 Speaker A: That there's something outside of us.\n74:20 Speaker A: There's something that is not necessarily us, that helps us know what is meaningful to us to be able to get beyond who we currently are to who we can become.\n74:30 Speaker A: You know, that's, that's the interesting thing about Come Alive is that you kind of have to go against, you might call it your natural lower level inclination to do the thing that comes from beyond you that will help you become Right.\n74:48 Speaker A: That you know is going to be amazing, but might be hard to do like making that difficult phone call or telling your mom you love her or any of these things.\n74:58 Speaker B: Okay, so we have number one, promoting aliveness to serving the whole.\n75:03 Speaker B: Number two, deeply practical.\n75:07 Speaker B: Bridging the gap between deep and practical.\n75:09 Speaker B: Deeply practical.\n75:10 Speaker A: Yeah.\n75:12 Speaker B: Building.\n75:14 Speaker A: Yeah.\n75:14 Speaker A: It could be three, building a sustainable process.\n75:17 Speaker B: Building together sustainably.\n75:19 Speaker A: Yeah.\n75:22 Speaker B: Together in a sustainable manner.\n75:26 Speaker A: I think like the building.\n75:28 Speaker A: And like, could there be some exploring in here?\n75:30 Speaker A: Because there's something about like co sensing, co feeling, co thinking, like building and doing.\n75:36 Speaker A: The word is praxis.\n75:38 Speaker B: Yeah.\n75:41 Speaker A: Doing.\n75:42 Speaker B: We're doing together.\n75:43 Speaker A: Yeah, whatever you want to call it.\n75:45 Speaker A: Building is good.\n75:46 Speaker B: Kind of like building in the sense of just like there's like this, there's this continuity in time and this like, dedication to like make something grow.\n75:58 Speaker A: Hold on.\n75:59 Speaker A: Crafting.\n76:00 Speaker A: Cultivating co.\n76:02 Speaker A: Crafting.\n76:04 Speaker B: Cultivating co.\n76:06 Speaker B: Craft.\n76:08 Speaker A: I think the next thing that I do, I would really like to take this kind of craft attitude of like, like, like wise creativity, like doing it well, beautifully, usefully.\n76:24 Speaker A: Craft is also useful, right?\n76:25 Speaker A: Usually.\n76:25 Speaker B: Yeah.\n76:26 Speaker B: There's maybe Like a fourth one that I would add, which is something around, like, play.\n76:31 Speaker B: I don't know, something playful.\n76:35 Speaker B: Meaning, fun.\n76:36 Speaker B: I don't know.\n76:37 Speaker B: You know, like.\n76:37 Speaker B: Like the.\n76:39 Speaker B: There's, like.\n76:41 Speaker B: I guess playful and beautiful is kind of the meaning.\n76:43 Speaker B: Fun thing.\n76:44 Speaker A: Yeah, beautifully playful.\n76:46 Speaker A: Meaning.\n76:47 Speaker B: Finally, beautiful.\n76:54 Speaker A: It could be interesting to see, like, a lot of these.\n76:57 Speaker A: As kind of these tensions between two things, right?\n77:00 Speaker A: Like, grounded and fun, grounded and playful.\n77:07 Speaker A: For the last one, co.\n77:08 Speaker A: Crafting sustainably is like thinking and the doing, which is kind of like deeply practical.\n77:15 Speaker C: Right?\n77:16 Speaker B: Tensions.\n77:17 Speaker B: We are exploring aliveness and service.\n77:31 Speaker B: Deep and practical.\n77:35 Speaker A: Thinking and doing.\n77:36 Speaker B: Or being and doing.\n77:43 Speaker B: Being and doing.\n77:44 Speaker B: Something like that.\n77:45 Speaker B: And then.\n77:46 Speaker B: And meaning and.\n77:50 Speaker B: And what is fun?\n77:53 Speaker B: It's just, like, pleasantness kind of like.\n77:55 Speaker B: It's like hedonism.\n77:59 Speaker B: It's like, kind of.\n78:01 Speaker B: I mean, it's basically the hedonism and Judah Monia thing, right?\n78:08 Speaker A: Eudaimonia includes meaning inside of it in a sense, I would say is meaning.\n78:14 Speaker B: And then the fun part is more like the pleasantness kind of like the hedonism.\n78:20 Speaker B: Meaning and enjoyable.\n78:23 Speaker B: Enjoy.\n78:24 Speaker B: Meaningful and enjoyable.\n78:26 Speaker A: You don't think it's playful?\n78:27 Speaker A: Because there's something about, like.\n78:29 Speaker B: I mean, I like playful, like, just in general.\n78:31 Speaker B: Like, I think.\n78:32 Speaker B: I think playful is, you know, like, it's a.\n78:34 Speaker B: It's a.\n78:35 Speaker B: It's the subcategory that I like probably the most, but it's the whole, you know, like, it's like a pleasantness is like, probably the.\n78:46 Speaker B: It's like a better expression.\n78:49 Speaker B: Like the kind of sad guru thing that, like, you know, everything is ultimately towards pleasantness, like, promoting more pleasantness.\n78:58 Speaker A: I thought it was also, like, avoiding discomfort, but.\n79:05 Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's like.\n79:06 Speaker B: There's just another way of saying, you know, that was not pleasant.\n79:11 Speaker B: Not pleasant.\n79:12 Speaker B: Pleasant.\n79:13 Speaker A: This is a good.\n79:14 Speaker A: A good set of tension.\n79:15 Speaker A: I like designing them as tensions like that.\n79:20 Speaker A: Nice.\n79:21 Speaker A: This is great.\n79:21 Speaker A: Spark, aliveness, inspire.\n79:23 Speaker A: Purposeful action.\n79:27 Speaker A: Okay, now how are we gonna do it?\n79:30 Speaker B: Yeah, I'm gonna.\n79:35 Speaker B: Yeah, I think I'm gonna remove the other ones.\n79:37 Speaker B: I think.\n79:39 Speaker A: Yeah, I think they got clustered.\n79:43 Speaker A: You want to give me the doc as well?\n79:46 Speaker B: Yes.\n79:59 Speaker B: Oh, wait.\n80:02 Speaker B: Oh, should be edited.\n80:04 Speaker B: Can you see if you're editing?\n80:06 Speaker A: Okay.\n80:07 Speaker A: They probably sent me an email to my BG account.\n80:13 Speaker B: Probably.\n80:14 Speaker B: I.\n80:15 Speaker B: I also shared the link, I think.\n80:18 Speaker A: Okay, let me just open it here.\n80:20 Speaker A: Let's see.\n80:22 Speaker B: And I'm gonna use the bathroom.\n80:24 Speaker A: I'm gonna request access.\n80:27 Speaker A: Do it.\n80:28 Speaker A: I'll reheat my T.\n80:55 Speaker B: It.\n81:29 Speaker B: Okay.\n81:30 Speaker A: All right.\n81:32 Speaker A: Nice.\n81:32 Speaker A: Bb.\n81:43 Speaker B: Okay, one thing.\n81:46 Speaker B: As we transition Our first, you know, like mini baby kindness Kiwi.\n81:53 Speaker A: Oh yeah.\n81:54 Speaker B: I wanna, I wanna use it both at the sandbox summit.\n82:00 Speaker A: Okay.\n82:01 Speaker B: Hand out like stickers there and just put like acts.\n82:05 Speaker B: I mean it's kind of already by default that people are like doing acts of kindness.\n82:11 Speaker A: Yeah.\n82:12 Speaker B: But I just, I think it's like.\n82:15 Speaker B: Would be like a funny just kind of like promotion thing.\n82:18 Speaker B: I think maybe I'll just create like a.\n82:20 Speaker B: Could create like a table or something like this.\n82:22 Speaker B: With the stickers.\n82:23 Speaker B: Yeah, like, you know, like basically just encourage people, like put stickers in different places and encourage people for like acts of kindness.\n82:31 Speaker B: And I would also like to use it at the conference.\n82:33 Speaker B: I think at the well being conference.\n82:35 Speaker B: People will love it.\n82:36 Speaker A: They did email me yesterday and asked me to facilitate.\n82:39 Speaker A: Facilitate something, I think.\n82:41 Speaker A: Okay, so we do have.\n82:44 Speaker B: You mean at the summit itself or.\n82:47 Speaker A: Let me see, at Fernanda.\n82:48 Speaker A: Invitation to facilitate at the core community gathering Global Hearth Summit.\n82:54 Speaker B: Okay, so like the 10 minutes.\n82:58 Speaker B: Oh no.\n82:59 Speaker A: I have 80 to 100 participants.\n83:02 Speaker A: I'll be supported by a well Being project team member who will be my co facilitator.\n83:07 Speaker A: They'll be hosting a facilitation training session in the coming weeks.\n83:13 Speaker A: We'll be delighted to have you if it sounds good.\n83:15 Speaker A: So on the 17th, as a part of the core community, one of the breakout sessions.\n83:22 Speaker A: Okay.\n83:22 Speaker A: Yeah, so I have a breakout session.\n83:24 Speaker A: So could do something that.\n83:27 Speaker A: I don't know how long it is, but you know, I'm gonna be in this facilitation training session.\n83:33 Speaker A: Apparently there's this person, do you know Eric Mulholland, Inner Development Program, Dean of the well Being Project?\n83:43 Speaker A: I've never heard of that.\n83:49 Speaker A: I've never heard of that.\n83:51 Speaker A: Or him.\n83:56 Speaker A: In any case, that's.\n83:57 Speaker A: That's an opportunity to bring the stickers.\n84:07 Speaker B: Okay.\n84:08 Speaker B: So that's like a.\n84:12 Speaker B: Those are some interesting.\n84:15 Speaker B: Like just to say that like I think it will continue to be.\n84:21 Speaker B: To like evolve in like tiny little ways and.\n84:25 Speaker A: Yeah, I'm wondering what are ways that we can create affordances that make it really simple and easy and like that would be fun for us to sustain like just some stickers, but have it be maybe like breadcrumbs to something else or I don't know.\n84:43 Speaker B: See, I mean like one thing, one thing could be, you know, we could create like an A4.\n84:50 Speaker A: Yeah.\n84:51 Speaker B: With basically just this list of, you know, like 50 or like 30 or whatever.\n85:00 Speaker B: Like.\n85:01 Speaker B: Or 25.\n85:02 Speaker B: Whatever.\n85:02 Speaker B: Like kindness actions.\n85:05 Speaker B: And then above it it says, you know, pick a number and you know, find your mission.\n85:10 Speaker B: And then we Just attach to that the stickers with the, with the kindness, like, so that people can basically like, you know, kind of like become a kindness kiwi, you know, and like, then you like, pick your mission.\n85:25 Speaker B: Something like this, you know, become a kindness kiwi.\n85:27 Speaker B: Pick your mission.\n85:28 Speaker B: And that's.\n85:28 Speaker B: I don't know.\n85:29 Speaker A: You're only allowed to wear the sticker once you do it.\n85:31 Speaker A: Just like the I voted thing.\n85:33 Speaker B: Yeah.\n85:35 Speaker B: Oh, yeah.\n85:35 Speaker B: We could, you know, like, become a kindness, sweetie.\n85:38 Speaker B: Take a mission.\n85:39 Speaker B: Earn a sticker.\n85:41 Speaker A: Yeah.\n85:41 Speaker B: You know?\n85:42 Speaker A: Yeah.\n85:43 Speaker A: Want a sticker?\n85:44 Speaker B: Wait, you know, it's like, you know, it's like your reward for like doing like a kindness mission.\n85:52 Speaker B: I don't know, something.\n85:53 Speaker B: Something like this a 4 that we can hang out at in different places.\n85:58 Speaker A: And we can also update our LinkedIn profile and just say, we are kindness Kiwis.\n86:03 Speaker A: Facilitator trainer.\n86:05 Speaker A: Kiwi.\n86:10 Speaker A: Okay.\n86:11 Speaker B: Okay, let's go.\n86:13 Speaker A: Yeah, let's see.\n86:17 Speaker B: So very, very practical.\n86:22 Speaker B: No?\n86:23 Speaker B: So let me just start from like, kind of like from scratch here.\n86:27 Speaker B: So the point where I am currently at in my work is basically having this kind of like, you know, ikigai.\n86:43 Speaker B: Like ikigai short form assessment.\n86:49 Speaker B: And I want to use that as an entry point into.\n86:55 Speaker A: I'm getting a call.\n86:56 Speaker A: One second.\n87:02 Speaker A: Okay.\n87:28 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n87:38 Speaker B: So open the door.\n87:46 Speaker A: Okay then, then.\n87:52 Speaker A: Okay, fine, fine.\n87:55 Speaker A: I'll figure it out.\n87:56 Speaker B: He's down.\n88:00 Speaker A: Should I learn French or should I not learn French?\n88:01 Speaker B: I don't.\n88:02 Speaker A: I don't really know.\n88:03 Speaker B: So he's basically saying he's standing in front of the door.\n88:06 Speaker A: Yeah.\n88:07 Speaker A: Okay.\n88:08 Speaker A: Pierre.\n88:10 Speaker A: No, what's his name?\n88:15 Speaker A: But he should just push the button.\n88:16 Speaker A: I was trying to tell him, but it's not P LA B.\n88:19 Speaker A: Right?\n88:19 Speaker A: That's not the right word, huh?\n88:20 Speaker B: I mean, it's.\n88:21 Speaker B: Okay.\n88:21 Speaker B: Yeah.\n88:22 Speaker A: Okay, so push the doorbell.\n88:27 Speaker A: Okay, let's try this.\n88:42 Speaker A: Compassionate silver.\n88:45 Speaker A: Embracing mercy.\n88:48 Speaker A: Rahma is an outpouring of good.\n88:51 Speaker B: You said.\n88:52 Speaker B: I mean, basically the door is the.\n88:54 Speaker B: The person is already in front of the door.\n88:56 Speaker A: Yeah, he said.\n88:57 Speaker A: He said, right?\n88:59 Speaker B: No, no, he said like he is there.\n89:00 Speaker A: It is all inclusive.\n89:02 Speaker A: Well, well, well.\n89:03 Speaker B: Embracing the desire, which basically means like I'm.\n89:06 Speaker B: I'm there.\n89:07 Speaker A: In the Quran, Allah says, call upon Allah or call upon Arachman.\n89:13 Speaker B: But is, is he in front of like your door or in front of the.\n89:16 Speaker A: He's in front of Josephine's parents door.\n89:23 Speaker A: Let's see.\n89:24 Speaker A: Hopefully he gets in and just drops off the box and I don't have to deal with this.\n89:29 Speaker A: Okay.\n89:29 Speaker A: Bismillah.\n89:34 Speaker A: Okay.\n89:36 Speaker A: It shouldn't be this stressful just to get a package.\n89:39 Speaker A: Right?\n89:39 Speaker A: It's say.\n89:41 Speaker B: I mean, it is not stressful.\n89:43 Speaker A: It's just, it's language barriers.\n89:45 Speaker B: It's the language.\n89:46 Speaker B: If you don't know how to express things, then that's stressful.\n89:50 Speaker A: It's interesting because like the baby is in the same position as I am and he gets stressed and he screams.\n89:55 Speaker A: He's like, give me that.\n89:57 Speaker A: I'm like, you want water?\n89:58 Speaker A: He's like, no, not water.\n90:01 Speaker B: What are you doing?\n90:03 Speaker A: Open the door.\n90:05 Speaker B: I mean, you know, language is magic.\n90:07 Speaker B: You know, it can get you exactly what the things that you want.\n90:10 Speaker A: Yeah.\n90:10 Speaker A: Okay, let's, let's try to focus and see if.\n90:15 Speaker A: Let's, let's get a overview of where you're at.\n90:19 Speaker A: Okay.\n90:19 Speaker A: Because also a part of the idea for these calls in this exploration is to open up like the broader door, but is also to hopefully do something very practical near term that we can be paid for, that would be for your project that you're actively working on.\n90:36 Speaker A: So let's, let's try to get the information about that and if you do.\n90:40 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.\n90:42 Speaker B: And like, I want to, I want to say both with like the.\n90:47 Speaker B: So, you know, basically what we've built is like an AI framework to run flows.\n90:58 Speaker B: So to run flows on WhatsApp.\n91:02 Speaker B: Okay.\n91:02 Speaker B: So we have that.\n91:04 Speaker B: It's going to be hopefully live in the next few days.\n91:10 Speaker A: Have you ever seen it actually not on WhatsApp.\n91:15 Speaker B: Do you want me to show you for a second?\n91:16 Speaker A: Yeah, show me how it works.\n91:19 Speaker B: Okay, wait.\n91:56 Speaker B: Okay.\n91:56 Speaker B: I don't know how to restart.\n92:00 Speaker B: Let me see.\n92:01 Speaker B: I think the, the dev server is.\n92:06 Speaker B: See.\n92:09 Speaker A: Okay.\n92:10 Speaker B: So basically the, the user gets a link, they arrive directly here.\n92:15 Speaker B: We've already.\n92:20 Speaker B: And what the framework is able to do at this point is basically like, you know, send images, text, send any kind of buttons.\n92:34 Speaker B: So I can basically create an onboarding videos.\n92:40 Speaker A: So the flow is how is it on the back end?\n92:46 Speaker A: Is it just like a text CSV or like you upload a strict process.\n92:54 Speaker B: Or how is it so on the back end?\n92:58 Speaker B: The way that it looks like, for example, like here you have kind of different flow steps like send image flow step or send message message close steps GPT assistant step.\n93:16 Speaker A: Interesting.\n93:17 Speaker A: So it's not, it's not like in any sort of design, it's actually directly in the code.\n93:23 Speaker A: There's no like designer or even spreadsheet or CSV where you can define the flows or fork the flow or.\n93:32 Speaker B: No, not at the moment, but I don't think it would be difficult to.\n93:35 Speaker A: To do yeah, you just have to.\n93:38 Speaker B: Was just so that I can build, you know, stop building.\n93:40 Speaker A: Yeah, that's cool.\n93:41 Speaker A: Wait, what?\n93:42 Speaker A: I want to see what the different properties are.\n93:43 Speaker A: Can you take back.\n93:44 Speaker A: It's like assistant prompt.\n93:48 Speaker B: I mean basically like, you know, there's a framework.\n93:50 Speaker B: So like.\n93:51 Speaker A: Cool.\n93:51 Speaker B: Complement.\n93:52 Speaker B: Like it's more complicated, but you know, like, it's like.\n93:54 Speaker B: Basically there's like predefined functions.\n93:57 Speaker B: Like for example, you know, like.\n93:58 Speaker B: Start prompt.\n93:59 Speaker A: Yeah.\n93:59 Speaker B: Through the start prompt I put in anything that is necessary for the flow.\n94:05 Speaker B: So for example, you know, like the.\n94:07 Speaker B: It's basically just like the first message that you sent to the assistant.\n94:13 Speaker A: Yeah.\n94:13 Speaker A: And it's using a credits, right?\n94:19 Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.\n94:20 Speaker A: And this is not connected yet.\n94:24 Speaker A: So like this conversation is happening fresh every time.\n94:30 Speaker A: There's no like phone number.\n94:33 Speaker B: It's basically bringing in like it's fresh.\n94:35 Speaker B: Yes, but with this start prompt, you input like, you know, like all the things that you feel are relevant to this bot.\n94:42 Speaker B: So you know, for example, like if I have two bots, you know, like one after the other, I would save everything that's relevant here from bot one and then input that in bot two, which also reduces, you know, like the long context windows, like the pricing that rises as the context window.\n95:02 Speaker A: That's.\n95:02 Speaker A: That's very, very interesting because that's kind of the.\n95:05 Speaker A: The question is like what is relevant sort of how.\n95:09 Speaker A: I was thinking about the theory of mind that includes like the user's goals, emotions, etc, and how it tries to codify that and give its confidence scores and things like that.\n95:26 Speaker A: So that, that could be an interesting place for that to happen.\n95:33 Speaker B: And that could see like, you know, like that could be like super powerful in the sense of just like a pre prompt, for example, you know, that like takes all of your information from your profile and then decides what is relevant for that particular bot.\n95:53 Speaker B: Yeah, the.\n95:55 Speaker B: The goal that I'm.\n95:56 Speaker B: And what I think AI is so cool at, like so powerful in this.\n96:01 Speaker B: Like, we can like literally chart kind of like a conversational path that adapts to what the user needs.\n96:09 Speaker A: Like.\n96:12 Speaker B: I mean basically just like, you know, we can like take them on the whole journey of like, you know, like discovering their values and then their strengths and then you know, like.\n96:20 Speaker B: And yeah, input into assistant whatever is necessary.\n96:29 Speaker B: Like, so that's kind of like, you know, let's say this is like the starting place.\n96:37 Speaker B: You know, there's an AI framework.\n96:39 Speaker B: There's already like a first kind of like assessment that, you know, can just be like shared.\n96:44 Speaker B: And that is like basically to me that's like entry point and that creates like a pretty solid profile of the person, you know, like first.\n96:56 Speaker B: First profile of the person.\n96:57 Speaker A: So before.\n96:58 Speaker A: So this is after they run the flow.\n97:00 Speaker A: So your imagination for the first time someone engages with the platform would be here now.\n97:06 Speaker A: It's no longer on this call.\n97:09 Speaker A: It's no longer.\n97:10 Speaker B: Yeah.\n97:12 Speaker A: Or even if it's in the classroom, it would start with this.\n97:15 Speaker B: I mean, the good thing is, you know, like it's an, it's an API and so we can put it on any platform.\n97:22 Speaker B: So we could also connect it to like, we want to connect it to a web platform, you know, so that we can just run it on a website.\n97:29 Speaker A: Yeah.\n97:30 Speaker A: The reason why I'm asking these questions is because of, I'm interested in maintaining a context history for our user profile.\n97:39 Speaker A: And if we keep it on WhatsApp, we can like align it with some kind of encrypted phone number.\n97:44 Speaker A: Like, we don't need to know who exactly they are, but we need to be able to find that identity.\n97:49 Speaker A: And like, let's say that we're going to have a micro server store just the digested information that can be pulled back if they come back.\n97:58 Speaker A: Right.\n97:58 Speaker A: But if they're on these different platforms, they will all be disjointed and they.\n98:02 Speaker A: There's no like login, there's no one profile.\n98:06 Speaker A: So I think it could be.\n98:07 Speaker B: This is why the profile is kind of saved on the back end and then it connects to different front ends.\n98:13 Speaker A: But how do you map the profile to the WhatsApp?\n98:15 Speaker A: Map the profile to the discord.\n98:16 Speaker A: Map the profile to the web website?\n98:18 Speaker A: Like, what's the main account like?\n98:22 Speaker B: Yeah.\n98:23 Speaker A: If you lose your WhatsApp phone number, can you log in and attach it to a new number or is it your number?\n98:30 Speaker B: That's a good question.\n98:31 Speaker B: I mean, one thing that the projects team developed already is kind of like this like universal login that seems to be like a very complex, authentic, like, but like very good authentication system that already, for example, universities can plug in by default.\n98:52 Speaker B: So, you know, you can set up basically like any university I think at the moment in France and soon it's going to be in Europe that just basically people can log in already with their student emails.\n99:08 Speaker A: I think that's kind of interesting.\n99:10 Speaker A: Like it would.\n99:11 Speaker A: So maybe this is too like, technical to talk about now, but I'm interested in maintaining that context over time across space.\n99:21 Speaker A: So if they could just put in their email, you know, when they talk, whenever they talk, and then we can at least just have that and use it as the link.\n99:29 Speaker A: And then if they ever want to log in and see all of their conversations and see all of the places and user profile, they use the LPI1 login email thing.\n99:39 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.\n99:41 Speaker B: I mean it could be basically.\n99:43 Speaker A: And there's a very easy way to do the authentication, which is how a lot of authentication is happening these days is like you get an email and then just click to confirm and then the conversation can continue because you want to make sure that they actually are that person.\n99:59 Speaker A: Right.\n100:02 Speaker B: So okay, so entry point.\n100:05 Speaker B: Ikigai assessment creates profile of the person.\n100:08 Speaker B: So that's kind of like where it is.\n100:10 Speaker B: There's also, there are also about like 20 to 30 different assistants that I've created.\n100:21 Speaker A: Oh yeah.\n100:23 Speaker B: That kind of like form like the ikigai like pedagogy and that are kind of like pretty refined and that have their own flows.\n100:32 Speaker B: But I don't want to have people run linearly through you know, like 20 different assistants.\n100:39 Speaker A: It's parliament time.\n100:41 Speaker A: This is great.\n100:42 Speaker A: One of the things that I've been working on the parliaments is the algorithm I call Duke it out where there's a moderator.\n100:49 Speaker A: And so after someone goes through the first, you know, proposal of the, the assessment, each of those agents that you could create would defend their position in front of the moderator to be allowed to be the next part of the flow.\n101:07 Speaker A: And they would have to defend it with arguments and you know, anyway based on what happened.\n101:13 Speaker A: So that's parliament.\n101:14 Speaker A: So this is exactly like when parliament.\n101:16 Speaker B: Fits in that could kind of like connect in there and just basically say like here like you know, like you have this also like this moderator flow where you basically talk about maybe like you do a check in and you say what you need next and it's justice.\n101:33 Speaker B: I think also something that like is interesting as an idea is like the you know, let's create you like a five day program or something.\n101:43 Speaker B: You know, like you, you share something then you know like it's.\n101:47 Speaker B: It basically like gives you like a multi day program that you can use to.\n101:57 Speaker B: Yeah.\n101:58 Speaker B: That you can use to kind of move forward Parliament.\n102:03 Speaker B: What law should go next.\n102:07 Speaker A: That could happen every time.\n102:08 Speaker A: That's the interesting thing about this process is even if you design the five days, if something happens in the next conversation, things could get reordered.\n102:18 Speaker A: It could just be like do you commit to like there can be five of Agent 5 Personas coming to chat with you over the next days helping you learn and grow based on your conversations.\n102:33 Speaker A: And you know, it could, it could be defined after each session.\n102:40 Speaker B: It's a bit like so called, like a, like a Spotify playlist, you know, like, like it's just like it automatically arranges itself.\n102:50 Speaker B: But then I think when you're pressing next, for example, because if you didn't like that song, I think it shuffles the playlist again.\n102:56 Speaker A: And also maybe instead of just telling you who's next, it could give you the top three contenders and why, and then you pick, because then there's some agency in it and it'll actually give us deeper information to improve the recommendation engine.\n103:13 Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually really good.\n103:19 Speaker A: But we don't have to give them 20 agents.\n103:22 Speaker A: We just give them, we just show them the, the top three or something.\n103:25 Speaker B: Like that and something like that.\n103:27 Speaker B: Like what you could do then actually is just like, you know, we could create like the first, you know, like, I don't know, like three days, you know, like will be for free for you.\n103:38 Speaker B: And then basically just kind of, you know, like you pay for like the next, I don't know, you know, pay for the next two weeks or something like for the next five days.\n103:49 Speaker B: I don't know, like what would be the right framing?\n103:51 Speaker B: But basically, you know, like you have this personalized program where you could also even get, you know, like a subscription to just, you know, like continue this like day by day.\n104:01 Speaker B: And each day you get like an exercise to move forward kind of like dynamically.\n104:06 Speaker B: I don't know, something.\n104:08 Speaker B: There's like something to do there.\n104:10 Speaker A: There's something interesting about the three free days, especially if it was paid by somebody else.\n104:16 Speaker A: It could be us in the beginning, but we could say, would you like to pay for 6 days and cover the next person's 3 first free days?\n104:25 Speaker A: You know, and then they feel like they received and they are contributing somehow.\n104:29 Speaker A: Right.\n104:29 Speaker A: Subscription would be nicer, but we can try to think of how to make that connected to this idea of generosity and.\n104:38 Speaker A: Yeah, and it could be really nice to have these days are sponsored by.\n104:45 Speaker A: And then you know how you sometimes go onto a platform and it creates like these weird names like Zippity Zebra or something.\n104:56 Speaker A: It could be like that.\n104:57 Speaker A: Like we don't need to actually get people's names, but we should say like this person, Zippity Zebra has sponsored your three days.\n105:04 Speaker A: At the end, you will be asked of your three days.\n105:07 Speaker A: You'll be asked if you want to continue and sponsor somebody else's three days.\n105:11 Speaker A: And if you can't afford the six, pay for three.\n105:14 Speaker A: But you know, we really hope that you pay for the Next person, Something like that.\n105:20 Speaker B: Yeah, these kind of things is like one thing, one thing what I would like to build is that there's a part of it, you know, basically the, the framework and everything.\n105:41 Speaker B: And like, my work has been paid by the lpi, right.\n105:45 Speaker B: And so I, I do want to like, basically create like a sustainable business model, you know, that works for that, like that benefits the lpi, right.\n105:58 Speaker B: So I'm not completely in like, in the, in like in a freelance position of like, you know, let's just create like a business together and then, you know, like, it's, it runs.\n106:07 Speaker B: What I would like to do is essentially that contributors that create flows are paid by the flows.\n106:18 Speaker B: And so like, you know, I can create something or like, you know, for example, I can hire you through the LPI and we can do something.\n106:25 Speaker B: We can create the overall structure that is retribute.\n106:30 Speaker B: Like that retributes the LPI because the money came from there.\n106:34 Speaker A: But the Iot of the prompt and the prompt flows.\n106:40 Speaker B: I mean, that is a different thing, but kind of like the assistance that are basically contributing to this process, you know, like this, this ecosystem of flows that the user goes through, they belong to the creators.\n107:02 Speaker B: And so this also creates like this possibility of an ecosystem of, you know, like, contributors where we can create different flows, different tools.\n107:11 Speaker B: And part of the money that from using those flows goes to the LPI and part of the money goes to the creator.\n107:18 Speaker B: Does that make sense?\n107:21 Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if it makes.\n107:23 Speaker A: Financial sense, but it's a little messy because of the, like, the, the business structure needs to be clarified.\n107:32 Speaker A: There are some ways of doing this that I can imagine would be different.\n107:38 Speaker A: Like, you can imagine the LPI being like a founding sponsor and, and they basically paid the three credits for the first, you know, 5,000 people.\n107:50 Speaker A: And when people come on, they pay the next, you know, six.\n107:55 Speaker A: The three credits goes back to replenishing or funding the LPI's initial investments or I'm not sure what, what the agreement is with, with the LPI to be able to think through the, the business implications.\n108:10 Speaker A: The flows are kind of interesting, but one of the big challenges is it's going to have recurring costs with servers.\n108:20 Speaker A: We could always have it be like $0.10 more expensive per thing.\n108:24 Speaker A: And then we kind of figure it out.\n108:27 Speaker A: But it's like, even if you design a really good flow, it costs LPI or the person running this bot every time that flow is operating.\n108:39 Speaker B: Yeah, that's why I was thinking like, you know, like the same way that you have here like the, you know, the three content.\n108:46 Speaker B: Like basically like this kind of like you pay for five days, you know, in that five days it would be like, you know, like a larger version of what you would pay for the credits.\n108:56 Speaker B: Right?\n108:57 Speaker B: So like if you, you know, like if a normal conversation cost us like 5 cents or something like this, or 10 cents, maybe the day costs, you know, 50 cents.\n109:10 Speaker B: Right.\n109:12 Speaker B: And so I don't know, something, something along those lines until then like the, if you pick for example, you know, like, if you say that like, for example, like LLMs, you know, cost $0.10 and gradually hopefully that number is going to decrease because we maybe start using our own servers, etc.\n109:35 Speaker B: So LLMs are getting cheaper than cents cost per user is you know, like 50 cents per day or something like this.\n109:50 Speaker B: LLM 10 cents and then you know, like maybe like 20 cents or like, I don't know, 30 cents by default go to LPI and then 10 cents go to Creator of that flow.\n110:07 Speaker B: I don't know if that makes sense.\n110:09 Speaker B: You would have.\n110:11 Speaker A: Yeah.\n110:11 Speaker A: You know, there's, there's something really interesting here that's related to the, the ideas that I was exploring with building out the Parliament system, which is the idea that every question represents attention towards who you might become.\n110:31 Speaker A: You might ask like, I don't know, like whatever it is you ask a question about how do I make some sourdough.\n110:41 Speaker A: Right.\n110:41 Speaker A: And there's like some implied reason for it.\n110:45 Speaker A: Like for me it's if the machine had some context, it would know potentially that I'm trying to make it for my wife and my baby and digestion and all these.\n110:54 Speaker A: Anyway, so there's like, there's this vector that goes from where you are and then the map that the LLM has for who you are right now, the context and then the question has a assumed vector.\n111:06 Speaker A: The reason why this is important is because my, my idea for the Parliament system was that the, to create not a library of flows and custom GPTs which are predefined, but to define them by that vector.\n111:27 Speaker A: Right.\n111:28 Speaker A: And then you kind of say okay, well instead of that, instead of that being the library.\n111:32 Speaker A: The library is.\n111:33 Speaker A: I thought it could be interesting to kind of make a library of, of agents with, with constitutive attentional policies for how they attend inside of a conversation being the defined thing about them amongst other variables, but that kind of being the primary thing.\n111:53 Speaker A: So one of them would always be kind of antagonistic.\n111:56 Speaker A: Right.\n111:56 Speaker A: And it would be like I look for ways for sharpening someone's thinking or, and, and that could be defined by a Persona like Nietzsche.\n112:04 Speaker A: Okay.\n112:05 Speaker A: And then anyway, so on and so forth.\n112:07 Speaker A: And then these agents would be defined by that initial vector.\n112:11 Speaker A: And you wouldn't need the flows, you wouldn't need the library.\n112:15 Speaker A: You would basically at the end of anyway.\n112:18 Speaker A: So this is like the abstract, more generic meta process.\n112:22 Speaker B: Yeah.\n112:23 Speaker B: So there's like two things here, which is like basically what I created now with the things like, so this, the Ikigai assessment.\n112:31 Speaker B: And I will add for the beginning, just a moving forward flow.\n112:37 Speaker B: And what this flow does essentially is it asks you to check in what's your biggest need to move forward, helps you to clarify that.\n112:47 Speaker B: And then based on that biggest need, it says like, okay, so you would need to talk to a person that has this, this and this criteria.\n112:57 Speaker B: And then it identifies two experts, have like different approaches to this, that have different approaches to this.\n113:09 Speaker B: And then you choose the expert that you want.\n113:13 Speaker B: It proposes like a five step process of how to get there, or like a step by step process of how to get there.\n113:19 Speaker B: And then it takes on that role and that process to help you move that.\n113:25 Speaker B: And so something like this could already happen just in the, in the background and you just make the decision between different, you know, like experts to like, you know, different approaches.\n113:36 Speaker B: Basically you just agree on approach.\n113:38 Speaker A: It wouldn't, it wouldn't need a whole parliament system.\n113:40 Speaker A: It would just need to be schizophrenic and which sense in that it would basically identify, talk with you pick these things and then change who it is.\n113:51 Speaker A: Exactly.\n113:51 Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.\n113:52 Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.\n113:54 Speaker B: So that's, that's the thing that I wanted to try out first because basically that allows, how do you say that it allows us to actually collect the trajectories of people.\n114:08 Speaker B: You know, what do they, what is their profile, what do they need to move forward?\n114:12 Speaker B: You know, kind of.\n114:13 Speaker B: And like it actually creates already bots.\n114:15 Speaker B: Yeah, but bots that are not refined, right.\n114:20 Speaker B: You know, they're like basically just kind of like a standard ish kind of flow.\n114:24 Speaker B: And what we could do is then basically take the ones that are really, really popular and turn them into full pedagogical, you know, like experiences where there's more context around it, where there's more thinking around it, how to make it richer.\n114:41 Speaker B: And so kind of you move gradually towards like collecting all of the different needs that people actually have so it's grounded in where they're at.\n114:50 Speaker B: And you kind of build out this library of flows that are really like, you know, targeted, that can like, that are like Optimized.\n115:04 Speaker A: Yeah.\n115:04 Speaker A: I think it's interesting, like that's, that's a balance between the system that I was devising to be super arbitrary.\n115:16 Speaker A: Right.\n115:16 Speaker A: It's not designed for a pedagogy.\n115:21 Speaker A: It's designed for answering questions, developing parliaments, and helping you go from who you are to who it thinks you want to be transparently.\n115:31 Speaker A: Right.\n115:32 Speaker A: And like custom creating, it's like, I think what's, what's interesting is my expectation is that it's likely that these generated prompts would be pretty good and that we don't need the.\n115:56 Speaker B: To create as flows.\n115:58 Speaker A: Yeah.\n115:59 Speaker A: This is why like come alive became a parliament.\n116:03 Speaker A: This is how I came up with this idea.\n116:04 Speaker A: I was like, how am I just doing the same thing?\n116:06 Speaker A: Do I really need to do this?\n116:07 Speaker A: Like, I keep making, Basically I'm using LLMs to make the prompt anyway.\n116:11 Speaker A: Could I just have that be in a meta prompt?\n116:13 Speaker A: And we're designing the meta prompts better and better.\n116:16 Speaker A: And then this is why I needed to figure out like, okay, well, what is a human need?\n116:20 Speaker A: What is growth?\n116:21 Speaker A: What is, you know, like all of that kind of super abstract stuff.\n116:26 Speaker A: What cognitive development?\n116:27 Speaker A: How do we understand like the meta complexity of the person and this current time and, and that.\n116:33 Speaker A: But I do think in the context that you're working in, this makes it way more practical and auditable and potentially less prone to error and making assumptions and having a lot of the problems of like arbitrary LLM use.\n116:51 Speaker A: Right.\n116:51 Speaker A: Like there's, there's something about human intelligence that is, is beneficial in the system that has this like, okay, well, people will give you their trajectories and then we see which ones are better and we refine them.\n117:04 Speaker B: You can make it, you can make it richer in a way as well.\n117:06 Speaker B: You know, kind of like add more like, okay, you know, it would be the, in a sense you can also like, I mean, basically, I don't know, there's kind of like a, you know, I was just thinking, basically you can, you can nudge in a certain direction.\n117:24 Speaker B: For example, you can add like poetry and you know, kind of, I don't know, like.\n117:28 Speaker B: But those might actually be the things that then the person is like you, you know, like, I don't want poetry, woohoo kind of system.\n117:37 Speaker B: So where actually your approach would be more like adapts really to who the person is, but maybe doesn't nudge them or nudges them gently towards that direction.\n117:47 Speaker A: Do you know what a Markov chain is?\n117:50 Speaker B: No.\n117:51 Speaker A: Here, let me just send this to you because this could Be kind of a balance in the forces.\n117:57 Speaker A: You can just click that link maybe.\n118:01 Speaker A: So a Markov chain has states, but it's non deterministic, it's probabilistic.\n118:08 Speaker A: Right.\n118:09 Speaker A: So you could say, okay, we're going to design the curriculum.\n118:12 Speaker A: And you know how you initially were saying, you take the first assessment and then it designs your five days for you.\n118:18 Speaker A: It could be a probabilistic five days that then gets modified by the actions that happened and then reshuffled accordingly.\n118:28 Speaker A: And, and similarly it could be like, you know, you have this idea of making it with poetry or having this thing.\n118:35 Speaker A: And as a, as a, you know, as a, as a facilitator, I think you, it makes a lot of sense to do it this probabilistic way.\n118:41 Speaker A: You say, this is how I intend to run the class.\n118:46 Speaker A: Okay, we're going to start with this, we're going to start with that.\n118:48 Speaker A: We're going to go here and then everyone's going to be all writing poetry and we're going to share at the end.\n118:52 Speaker A: It's going to be great.\n118:52 Speaker A: And then you go.\n118:53 Speaker A: And then it's different.\n118:54 Speaker A: And then you have to be a real facilitator and you actually be dynamic and adapt and maybe you shift things around or, you know, so something like that, I think is an interesting thing.\n119:04 Speaker B: That's true.\n119:05 Speaker B: But also it adds kind of complexity.\n119:07 Speaker B: So it does, it adds beauty and complexity.\n119:12 Speaker B: So definitely edit for like somewhere later.\n119:17 Speaker B: But let's, since we have 30 minutes left, let's kind of.\n119:28 Speaker B: I mean, what I see here is like.\n119:33 Speaker B: So what is relevant for this conversation?\n119:35 Speaker B: Yes, basically we have here like already like a kind of a whole program.\n119:40 Speaker B: Right.\n119:40 Speaker B: Like from the.\n119:42 Speaker B: Actually here it's kind of, that's kind of like step by step.\n119:53 Speaker B: Right.\n119:53 Speaker B: So you have like the.\n119:59 Speaker B: Actually, I think it's more like this.\n120:04 Speaker B: Right.\n120:04 Speaker B: So you kind of have the initial assessment, whatever it is.\n120:09 Speaker B: Right.\n120:09 Speaker B: Whatever that assessment would be, or like something, initial thing, an initial conversation of any kind.\n120:17 Speaker B: And then that enables you to infer from that responses a richer profile.\n120:27 Speaker B: Right.\n120:28 Speaker B: So you kind of take the limited information that you have, you blow it up, but you blow it up kind of based on probability.\n120:37 Speaker B: And in a way that's what I did as well with the guessing game that basically just like boldly guesses things about you.\n120:43 Speaker A: Yeah.\n120:44 Speaker B: And so like from the inferences that it already makes, actually inferences there by itself, you know, it's like.\n120:53 Speaker B: And so it kind of blows it up and then the user selects what if that is true and what is not true.\n121:00 Speaker B: Which seems to work reasonably well, but also has like the potential downside of you just agreeing too easily.\n121:11 Speaker B: That's why I changed many of the prompts to basically make the user deliberately disagree.\n121:17 Speaker B: You know, like no.\n121:19 Speaker B: And you know, just like finish the sentence no, like no, this is wrong because, you know, but so we have this kind of like a initial assessment, create a dashboard based on that.\n121:38 Speaker B: Then actually, then you have the parliament that based on the dashboard, suggest you the things to go next to do next.\n121:51 Speaker B: You pick from different kind of like contenders.\n121:53 Speaker B: What is the thing that you actually would like to do.\n121:56 Speaker B: What feels most relevant to you and then input it into this conversation is essentially like an assumption of what is necessary.\n122:08 Speaker B: Right?\n122:09 Speaker A: Yeah.\n122:10 Speaker A: I think one of the really interesting things, things to work on right now is first things first is that profile generator and the questions that you're asking and the way that it was blowing it up.\n122:21 Speaker A: And also what is in the profile?\n122:26 Speaker A: And it's, it's, it's related to this, you know, the theory of mind.\n122:33 Speaker A: But that's just one idea because what, like what are the frameworks that we want to be using that is standard and we want the frameworks to also be dynamic or adaptive.\n122:47 Speaker A: Right.\n122:47 Speaker A: Like it could guess their ocean profile, if you know what that is like.\n122:50 Speaker A: But you know, there's a lot of debate about that, whether it's a useful way of thinking about people or not.\n122:57 Speaker A: And so how do we, how do we think about this information?\n123:03 Speaker A: Because we do we.\n123:04 Speaker A: Because basically we don't need to extract that as long as it's in the context.\n123:09 Speaker A: Because we could just generate it as long when we're there.\n123:11 Speaker A: Right.\n123:11 Speaker A: We could generate this, we could generate that and it's going to be giving you some information anyway.\n123:15 Speaker A: But once we want to like take it out and do something with it or, or expose it to the, the participant, we need to plop it into a framework.\n123:26 Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, one thing that I'm wondering about is like, you know, people love profiles, you know, they just like love to have Harry Potter.\n123:35 Speaker A: Owl are you.\n123:37 Speaker B: But normally profiles are like, you know, static.\n123:42 Speaker B: You know, like you just get this stuff as a final result and then it just, you know, tells you this is true.\n123:48 Speaker B: What's interesting, what you want to input into.\n123:51 Speaker A: Now I'm just an introvert for the rest of my life.\n123:56 Speaker B: What you, what you want to input, like you want to input into the LLM approximation of you.\n124:04 Speaker B: Like good enough, you know, so that it can give you relevant stuff.\n124:09 Speaker B: It doesn't need to be actually that precise.\n124:10 Speaker B: It just needs to be, like, approximately good enough, Right?\n124:16 Speaker B: So if you had, like, a.\n124:17 Speaker B: It generates for you, like, a profiling of yourself with different credit criteria.\n124:23 Speaker B: You could say, for example, like, the ocean.\n124:25 Speaker B: And it gives you, like, a slider, you know, from, like, 0 to 5, and it puts you at 3.7, you know, and that's, like, just, like, in, like, basically the basic way of how, you know, like, has set the.\n124:37 Speaker B: The scores, and then you can basically say, like, no, no, I'm not a 3.7.\n124:43 Speaker B: You know, I'm like a 4.0 or something like this, you know, so you can, like, move that slider and, like, adjust it.\n124:52 Speaker B: And so basically, you can create, like, your own.\n124:57 Speaker B: You can basically adjust your own, like, profile in always and the information that is being used.\n125:04 Speaker B: But, for example, it could also say, like, you know, like, okay, you can use an independent test here to see your ocean profile.\n125:10 Speaker B: You know, if you.\n125:11 Speaker B: If you're curious about this, you know, do that and come back and, you know, like, change your scores or even, like.\n125:17 Speaker A: Yeah.\n125:18 Speaker A: Do you remember the toy object I made of myself?\n125:27 Speaker B: Nope.\n125:28 Speaker A: Oh, you.\n125:28 Speaker A: I didn't show you that picture, like, I think I said to you, and you said you wanted to do it.\n125:32 Speaker A: That, like.\n125:34 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.\n125:34 Speaker B: Look at.\n125:35 Speaker B: Look at this way, Dixie.\n125:38 Speaker B: I'm making everybody else do it.\n125:41 Speaker A: You know what's interesting about this?\n125:43 Speaker A: Oh, Cat is gonna be Cat.\n125:45 Speaker B: Wait, no.\n125:50 Speaker B: So for the Ikigai course, they're gonna do this initial assessment, and then they have a delivery.\n125:57 Speaker A: Is that you?\n125:58 Speaker A: Yeah.\n125:59 Speaker A: That's cool.\n126:00 Speaker A: Okay.\n126:00 Speaker A: But, you know, I was thinking we are in a very new and interesting space where two things, as you were talking came to me.\n126:08 Speaker A: It's like, we don't have to have the same.\n126:12 Speaker A: Like, here, fill in with a number two pencil.\n126:16 Speaker A: You know, color in the circles, which value you think you are.\n126:19 Speaker A: And then we'll give you an ocean profile.\n126:21 Speaker A: And, like, the static thing we can make.\n126:24 Speaker A: Remember there was this image of there's a bunch of people on a boat, and, like, which one represents you the most?\n126:29 Speaker A: We can ask the LLM to create a visual representation of these different profiles, including the ocean and whatever else we want to do.\n126:37 Speaker A: And it can be like, it could explain it as well.\n126:40 Speaker A: And then the person can interact with it a little bit differently.\n126:43 Speaker A: And the other element that I thought was interesting was to create a tensions, you know, rather than saying where you are, just like we did with our intentions, we're balancing between, you know, meaning and fun.\n126:56 Speaker A: And meaning fun.\n126:57 Speaker A: And people can be intention, directed towards, towards something.\n127:01 Speaker A: And we could have the profile be saying, like, listen, like, we think you're here, going there and these are the tensions you're dealing with.\n127:10 Speaker A: And it could be more informative about the developmental process that we're trying to take people through.\n127:14 Speaker A: Anyway, so both of these things, I don't know, like, I thought of both of them at the same time.\n127:18 Speaker A: Like the, the visualizing it and making it a thing.\n127:21 Speaker A: Like the thing is if you did it in Claude, you could actually ask it to make a JavaScript thinkable about your tensions in a interactive visual website way.\n127:32 Speaker A: It'll be kind of fun.\n127:33 Speaker A: It doesn't have to be static anymore, man.\n127:35 Speaker A: Like we're in a new era.\n127:37 Speaker A: It's really, if you can think about what's possible here, it's really cool.\n127:45 Speaker B: It was to make me think about like one way of how I define purpose and at some point is, was kind of like a, in like an intention.\n127:54 Speaker B: Like it's like a tension between who you are right now and who you want to be.\n127:58 Speaker B: And so you kind of like, yeah, purpose is the vector.\n128:02 Speaker B: Exactly.\n128:02 Speaker B: Yeah.\n128:03 Speaker B: And like the tension is really like the thing, you know, like, it's like for example, for me the tension is towards like more like aliveness, you know, like I can see a contrast between.\n128:13 Speaker B: I can, I can see, you know, like a distance between how alive I could be.\n128:19 Speaker B: I can feel my own numbness and I get an idea of who I want to be.\n128:25 Speaker B: And that basically is like cool.\n128:27 Speaker B: It gives me like a direction.\n128:28 Speaker B: It gives me like a tension to move forward to.\n128:30 Speaker B: And this tensions can actually be the things that we explore with future, with future tasks.\n128:41 Speaker B: Right.\n128:41 Speaker B: With future flows.\n128:44 Speaker A: So, so this is, this is all like really great and I think it's interesting to think about the things between you and I, but I keep wondering actually about what is this specific thing because part of me is like, okay, I got this like Parliament's idea that I'm working on.\n129:00 Speaker A: I want to build it up and I can see how these things from that idea fit in here.\n129:04 Speaker A: But what's the intent?\n129:05 Speaker A: Intention of the Ikki Is this the Ikigai app, the mooc, the mood?\n129:12 Speaker A: What is it?\n129:12 Speaker A: And what is like the expected goals and what are the.\n129:16 Speaker A: Like is it.\n129:17 Speaker A: Because right now we're thinking very like abstractly and as if it's a product and we can have people on, on a subscription or is it a six day thing?\n129:23 Speaker A: But like I have no bounding box for my creativity right now.\n129:27 Speaker A: You know what I mean?\n129:28 Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.\n129:29 Speaker B: So I mean there's like this.\n129:31 Speaker B: There's two expectations.\n129:35 Speaker B: What.\n129:35 Speaker B: Which are two phases, which is like phase one, create your ikigai.\n129:44 Speaker B: Okay, right.\n129:47 Speaker B: And there's like the short version and then there's the super long version.\n129:52 Speaker B: Right.\n129:54 Speaker B: So the way that I've been thinking about it is like basically like short, you know, like, let's say 30 minutes.\n130:03 Speaker B: Use that to create a first draft of your ikigai profile and then see which parts of the long version you need to, you know, like you need to deepen your profile.\n130:29 Speaker A: Okay, so.\n130:29 Speaker B: Okay, does that make sense?\n130:31 Speaker A: The short profile?\n130:32 Speaker A: And then if we followed like one of the methods that I use is like you have a confidence score for each of the elements of the profile and the ones that have the least confidence, you would direct them to fill out the.\n130:44 Speaker B: Okay, yeah, exactly.\n130:45 Speaker B: Yeah.\n130:46 Speaker B: So first of the IQA profile with confidence scores of evidence, I usually like to add evidence.\n130:55 Speaker A: It's like you have the confidence explanation and evidence and that way you know why.\n131:01 Speaker A: And then what you can, what you need to be confident about this.\n131:05 Speaker A: And that could help with the next stage.\n131:08 Speaker B: Yeah, so that's, that's the first part.\n131:12 Speaker B: And then phase two, which is basically living your I, which to me is basically just moving towards aliveness and service.\n131:27 Speaker B: And so that's.\n131:31 Speaker B: Yeah, that's basically like that could be the thing that we talked about with the program.\n131:39 Speaker A: A part of a mood.\n131:41 Speaker A: Is it a.\n131:42 Speaker A: Like, do, do we have people that we're expecting to need to do it or is it something that is just an open offering on the Internet offer to LPI students or other students in the universities that are working on like, what is.\n131:59 Speaker A: So the audience that we expect to be working with and how long do we get to work with them and do we ask them to pay or there is LPI subsidizing some unit of them or, you know.\n132:12 Speaker B: Yeah, so there's different audiences, for example.\n132:15 Speaker B: So for the mood, there's now like 10 people that will do just the ikigai sport assessment, you know, just like the initial draft and that will be it.\n132:29 Speaker B: Afterwards there's going to be a hundred people which will use hopefully the short one plus some of that thinking, like, plus a longer one.\n132:45 Speaker A: Are these people that we could have like paste things into chat GPT or like, are, are they like test users that we know or are these like, is this a part of a project or program?\n132:57 Speaker B: This is part of a program.\n132:59 Speaker A: Okay.\n133:01 Speaker A: Even the 10.\n133:03 Speaker A: The 10 are part of a program?\n133:06 Speaker B: Yeah, kind of.\n133:07 Speaker B: But like it's like a focus group which Will basically start next week, so.\n133:12 Speaker A: Okay, cool.\n133:17 Speaker B: And then we have CY, which is 550, which will run through an ikigai program, but it's basically to find your ikigai.\n133:32 Speaker B: So find your ikigai.\n133:34 Speaker B: Last year they did kind of like a classroom session and then four hours of individual work.\n133:42 Speaker B: So for me, that's basically like also the longer pace, like longer ikigai discovery.\n133:51 Speaker B: I'll just say find ikigai and hopefully plus kind of like 1,000 others here.\n134:04 Speaker A: Outreach.\n134:05 Speaker B: Yeah, so but these are more like kind of, you know, are going to.\n134:10 Speaker A: Be like, who's paying for their tokens?\n134:14 Speaker B: The lpi, Because CY has paid them already beforehand.\n134:19 Speaker B: The Mood is currently like a free project lpi, but, you know, hopefully gradually find a way of financing it.\n134:28 Speaker B: Then we have Friendship, which will have 3,400 students, hopefully from September.\n134:40 Speaker B: Yeah, that's cool.\n134:43 Speaker B: And that's paid by grant.\n134:45 Speaker B: So all of these are more about like, kind of, you know, like the.\n134:48 Speaker B: The first part here.\n134:51 Speaker B: But actually, I think the way that phase one and phase two could work is actually could be just as.\n134:59 Speaker B: Could work in the same way, you know, and we basically just define how much time do they get to spend.\n135:09 Speaker B: I think that could be like a really good way to think about is like how much time in.\n135:17 Speaker B: In kind of like you could say credits does a user get is like, main difference is this, you know.\n135:30 Speaker A: Yeah.\n135:31 Speaker A: And.\n135:31 Speaker A: And the thing that's happening next week with the 10, like, it would be interesting to.\n135:37 Speaker A: To see like, what questions we have that we want to explore.\n135:42 Speaker A: Like what can we do?\n135:43 Speaker A: Because this is quite soon, but as we're.\n135:47 Speaker A: We're like rolling out to these various spaces and we have these different use cases, it will be interesting to have.\n135:54 Speaker A: Yeah.\n135:55 Speaker A: Like questions that we want to answer, things that we can test that are simple but not big changes.\n136:02 Speaker A: And one of the two questions that.\n136:05 Speaker A: One that came up a while ago, but I didn't a chance to ask yet, and the other is about the login stuff.\n136:10 Speaker A: Like, well, we know these 10 people.\n136:12 Speaker A: Will we have the ability to access their.\n136:16 Speaker A: Like, if they do it again, how do we get them to fill out the larger ikigai?\n136:24 Speaker A: Do we know who they are?\n136:26 Speaker A: Like, is there a way that we can know who they are?\n136:29 Speaker B: Yes.\n136:30 Speaker B: This first conversation, like, the first thing with the Mood here will be only using ChatGPT, basically short.\n136:39 Speaker B: Okay, using Chat GPT.\n136:41 Speaker B: And the only information, you know, the.\n136:45 Speaker B: The only information that we get on them is hopefully that they introduce themselves here with this, which doesn't give us Much information.\n136:54 Speaker B: But like, you know, it will basically create like a profile here.\n136:59 Speaker A: That's cool.\n137:00 Speaker B: And we can.\n137:03 Speaker A: Is this circle?\n137:05 Speaker B: Huh?\n137:06 Speaker A: Is this circle like this platform?\n137:10 Speaker B: It's mighty Networks.\n137:12 Speaker A: Mighty networks.\n137:13 Speaker A: Okay.\n137:15 Speaker B: And so basically the information that will have just like an introduction of themselves, kind of like a profiling that the bot already kind of creates like a 60 second pitch and then they adapt it a little bit to present themselves.\n137:33 Speaker B: And there's something else.\n137:40 Speaker B: One second.\n137:43 Speaker B: And there will be, I will add here like so this will.\n137:49 Speaker B: The story of me part will disappear.\n137:50 Speaker B: So there'll be like a third part here which is just give feedback.\n137:55 Speaker A: Okay.\n137:56 Speaker B: So for that part we could basically already ask for feedback in terms of something, you know, to ask for feedback for something.\n138:10 Speaker A: Okay, the, the other question I'm not sure is it's just been a really big question for me in general, just how is, is it possible to include more humans in the loop, to make it more personal, to make it more relational?\n138:30 Speaker A: And part of the like.\n138:33 Speaker A: Is this like the craziest idea?\n138:35 Speaker A: Or maybe not the craziest.\n138:35 Speaker A: This is like one, one idea that might not be practical at all, but it's that you never actually talk to the machine, but the machine offers insights to a human and then offers you.\n138:46 Speaker A: The human like decides to accept or reject, but writes and shares with you their understanding.\n138:52 Speaker A: You know what I mean?\n138:53 Speaker A: Like it's a AI powered icky guy mentor, not a bot.\n139:00 Speaker A: And that's like one of the things that I'm.\n139:03 Speaker A: It's like a bit of a sticking point for me because I want to connect people with each other and I think there, it'll be juicier.\n139:13 Speaker A: There's also potential scalability benefits in terms of other people being aware of what we're doing and of what can be done.\n139:21 Speaker B: I mean one, one part of that is like I've thought about different ways already.\n139:28 Speaker B: One which is including it.\n139:34 Speaker B: So including it into a larger program, that's the easiest one.\n139:41 Speaker B: You know, for example, with the mood, they're going to be like matched in groups and so they're going to be brought together around their questions.\n139:50 Speaker B: So based on the Ikigai profile and another bot that they're using, like basically sources of meaning bot, they will create what they.\n140:01 Speaker B: It's called a story of me, like a video of their story and why they care what they're doing now.\n140:09 Speaker B: So, and then based on that, you can vote for people that you want to be in a group together with and then they will work together in groups around this.\n140:23 Speaker B: So the setup of the mood is that, you know, basically people do this individual reflection and then they work together in groups.\n140:29 Speaker B: So that's one part you said the ikigai mentor is one thing, AI enhanced ikigai mentor is another one.\n140:42 Speaker B: And then there is also one thing that I prototype, which is basically like an ikigai conversation in the style of 36.\n140:55 Speaker B: Actually I'll just call it 36 questions to or to find your purpose in pairs.\n141:07 Speaker B: So then basically you just talk, you have these questions, you know, like to guide you, but it's really just like a meaningful conversation that you have between you and AI can record this and basically help to help you to move forward with.\n141:23 Speaker A: That's kind of interesting.\n141:26 Speaker A: I, I sort of, I don't want to change everything you've done, but I wonder if like this conversation and that bold guess after 36 questions might be better than, you know, depending on what the questions are and how they're designed, could be like really good for the full icky guy and even, especially for the small ikigai.\n141:49 Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I guess the question is just, you know, like, kind of like how do you get to the profile that you can then use to like make it useful for you?\n142:00 Speaker B: And then I mean like a classical thing is, you know, like connecting like matching people based on the ikigai statements or ikigai profiles.\n142:23 Speaker B: And then another one is co development.\n142:27 Speaker B: So these are kind of like the things that I've already thought about, but then I've rarely executed just because it's too complex.\n142:35 Speaker B: Yeah, I've done basically, I've done all of them in some way, but not, not as much.\n142:43 Speaker A: There's a, there's something interesting about this, like the matching the questions, the having basically the, the AIs be observers and it relates to some of the, the crazy philosophical stuff that we talked initially about because.\n143:00 Speaker A: Okay, I'm just going to say it in, in stupid words, but here's, here's the stupid way of saying it that's not philosophically rigorous.\n143:07 Speaker A: People have been talking about muses, they've been talking about inspiration.\n143:10 Speaker A: And essentially I don't think that people are, you know, compiling ideas, generating tokens and then putting them out into the keyboard.\n143:19 Speaker A: And basically everything that we've taught the LLMs has come from something other.\n143:23 Speaker A: Okay, anything new, novel, interesting has come from the same place that meaning comes from.\n143:29 Speaker A: And people say this all the time when they talk about Francois.\n143:32 Speaker A: I was like, I woke up with the idea complete in my head, fresh.\n143:35 Speaker A: Right.\n143:35 Speaker A: That is what is adding to what is called human knowledge.\n143:40 Speaker A: If we just give people these mirrors from the LLMs without letting a human being have any bit of inspiration to add to give of the moment of the literal like transmission from what's happening in the moment.\n143:53 Speaker A: We are going to be eating our dog food and potentially creating these self recursive like spirals and non development like we won't grow like as, as, as humanity.\n144:04 Speaker A: And so I really think bringing a human in here and creating spaces for inspiration is really important even if it's themselves.\n144:12 Speaker A: So one of the things that I do with, with LLMs that I think is very useful is starting over from scratch.\n144:20 Speaker A: Not ever copying and pasting until it's me, until it's mine.\n144:24 Speaker A: You know, you are able to give me the history of your ikigai evolution and what matters to you and the words.\n144:31 Speaker A: And I think a lot of the times when I use like a tool that gives me the dopamine hit of inspiration or insight, like oh yeah, that's awesome.\n144:41 Speaker A: Like this is exactly me.\n144:42 Speaker A: Like I wouldn't be able to tell you what it was tomorrow.\n144:45 Speaker A: You know, I just go to the next thing and the next thing and so how do we make that something that is theirs?\n144:52 Speaker A: And it could be that there's an air gap and maybe this idea of preserving context and getting the profile and then updating it and giving them even like a graphic or a card is actually not helpful.\n145:03 Speaker A: What is helpful is having them do it and then asking them tomorrow from scratch, like what was your ikigai and why did it matter to you what's still resonating with you today or having a conversation with somebody and until it becomes real.\n145:19 Speaker A: Right.\n145:19 Speaker A: And, and then there's the whole learning by doing.\n145:22 Speaker B: I was thinking as well, it's like you can only get your profile after it has been reviewed by two other people.\n145:28 Speaker B: And like the people that are playing with the buttons, you know, like the like changing the assessment are the.\n145:38 Speaker A: Your friends, you're not allowed to move the scale.\n145:41 Speaker A: Like you have to be like am I really like that?\n145:44 Speaker B: That's interesting.\n145:46 Speaker A: Yeah.\n145:50 Speaker A: And this actually was.\n145:51 Speaker A: I know the simple solution that could be interesting here is.\n145:56 Speaker A: Or not solution.\n145:57 Speaker A: The simple like way to embed some of these principles is to make it so that people are not able to copy and paste any text.\n146:06 Speaker A: Okay.\n146:08 Speaker A: And the simple way of doing that is asking the LLM to make the text in a image.\n146:13 Speaker A: It's not the best.\n146:14 Speaker A: People can always find a way of getting the text out.\n146:16 Speaker A: But to put like just.\n146:19 Speaker A: I don't know, it's kind of like Limiting the ability for people to pretend that they have an insight that they don't have, you know, that they need to later be able to articulate it for themselves.\n146:30 Speaker A: Like you can't copy and paste the text and put it on your profile.\n146:33 Speaker A: In the mighty networks, you actually have to write it from scratch.\n146:38 Speaker A: So I don't know, there's something about from scratch and something about from togetherness and something about making it practical.\n146:43 Speaker A: Right?\n146:44 Speaker A: Like there's the complicated stuff, which is the AI enhanced mentor where you're always talking to a person but they're getting some updated information.\n146:52 Speaker A: And then there's the simpler solutions of in a classroom setting, which is why it's important to know know like who are we working with and what do we have in terms of infrastructure, both social infrastructure, physical rooms or mighty networks and WhatsApp.\n147:08 Speaker A: And like, because there's a lot of opportunity space and we need to kind of get some consolidation.\n147:15 Speaker A: But I do think that there's this principle that I'd like to question and figure out with you is like, where do we get fresh tokens into the space through inspiration, through relationality, through other humans?\n147:30 Speaker A: And this is actually one of the things that I realized recently that got me really excited is like, oh, shoot, we always will need people.\n147:36 Speaker A: Like the machines don't yet have access to inspiration, I think, and.\n147:42 Speaker A: But I need to prove that that is real.\n147:44 Speaker A: People have the experience of it, like Francois and others.\n147:49 Speaker B: I'm kind of taking it differently.\n147:50 Speaker B: I'm taking differently sense that like just, you know, you like each of the like things that Chat GPT outputs, for example, to me is a bit like a raw shot test.\n148:02 Speaker B: Yeah, it's like a personalized.\n148:04 Speaker B: Personalized Rasha test.\n148:06 Speaker B: It's maybe just like a different way of seeing any kind of interactions in general.\n148:10 Speaker B: You know, communication in general is kind of like you're throwing some symbols at another and they're like, oh.\n148:22 Speaker B: And then they're like, I think it means this.\n148:23 Speaker B: But you know, like often, for example, you know, you talked with me yesterday, the day before yesterday, I talked with Cat.\n148:29 Speaker B: I gave her an idea of mine.\n148:32 Speaker B: I was like, oh, wouldn't that be so cool?\n148:34 Speaker B: You know.\n148:35 Speaker B: And then yesterday she told me, I really loved your idea.\n148:40 Speaker B: And she presented a completely different one, you know.\n148:42 Speaker B: Yeah, but which was inspired by it, you know, and so it's like, I think, I don't know, I kind of see it like, maybe the LLM doesn't have inspiration, but that doesn't matter because it's like it basically exposes you to stuff.\n148:57 Speaker B: And it's a very clever way of exposing you to stuff that can foster, you know, inspiration.\n149:04 Speaker A: I call it ringing your bell.\n149:05 Speaker A: Right.\n149:06 Speaker A: Like it's gonna strike you and like what are you gonna.\n149:08 Speaker A: What's going to sound.\n149:10 Speaker B: Yeah, let's, let's, let's get, let's get kind of like very practical as we're going.\n149:18 Speaker A: Yeah, let's see.\n149:20 Speaker A: Where are we at?\n149:23 Speaker A: We need.\n149:24 Speaker A: Oh we were supposed to talk about like times and was this a good amount of time?\n149:30 Speaker A: It's a, it's a big chunk of time.\n149:34 Speaker B: It was a big chunk of time.\n149:35 Speaker B: I think it was like since we were like disrupted.\n149:38 Speaker B: It was like a good amount of time.\n149:39 Speaker A: Yeah, that's true.\n149:40 Speaker B: Maybe like an hour and a half is probably more like it helps you to focus more.\n149:47 Speaker A: I see.\n149:49 Speaker B: I think one thing that I, I mean I really love many of the ideas here like the kind of.\n150:00 Speaker B: Is like feeling.\n150:01 Speaker B: Feeling into the creative tensions of the person creating a dynamic profile that the user themselves or peers or family or peers or family regulate in order to give you a final.\n150:26 Speaker B: Like to give you an.\n150:28 Speaker B: What I would like is basically like what would be quite cool is you need to share it with 2.\n150:34 Speaker B: Share Ikiga profile with two people that like you know like validated and then you have.\n150:42 Speaker B: Then the.\n150:44 Speaker B: The other people are also curious you know what is this?\n150:48 Speaker B: And so it brings them to create their own profile.\n150:52 Speaker B: You know you can create like this kind of like virality in there as well while at the same time sharing your out vulnerably and you know like I think it's like.\n151:03 Speaker B: Or yeah, so that's, that's like a very I think interesting idea.\n151:14 Speaker B: And then inside of that profile mapping out the tension.\n151:22 Speaker B: I think that's also really interesting and the kind of theory of mind and like I don't know like ocean as you said.\n151:34 Speaker B: You know like could have different, different kinds of profiles that we could refer to.\n151:44 Speaker B: What could be the first echo already you know with the, with the assistant prompt that we have.\n151:55 Speaker B: You know if we take the.\n151:58 Speaker B: This kind of like 15 minute ikigai as a starting point.\n152:06 Speaker B: Yeah.\n152:07 Speaker B: What can, what can we do to enrich this?\n152:10 Speaker B: I mean might be just you know the thing of like okay using that to create a profile and how would that look like?\n152:19 Speaker A: Yeah.\n152:24 Speaker B: So you know basically we input an entire conversation.\n152:29 Speaker A: And we experiment with different interactive or non interactive visual non visual dynamic tension or the this scale and scope of profiles.\n152:43 Speaker A: Right.\n152:43 Speaker A: Like there's electrical scale, mental complexity.\n152:46 Speaker A: There's many, many things.\n152:47 Speaker A: And what would Be the most useful for the ikigai one.\n152:51 Speaker B: Yeah.\n152:52 Speaker A: And can I take the 15 minute thing?\n152:55 Speaker A: Where is it on WhatsApp or where would I take it?\n152:58 Speaker B: You can just use.\n153:00 Speaker B: I can share you here, the latest version.\n153:03 Speaker B: You can do it.\n153:04 Speaker B: I can share with you also the.\n153:10 Speaker B: Yeah, I'll send it as well on WhatsApp.\n153:17 Speaker B: What I would suggest is basically like I'll send you a full conversation of mine.\n153:23 Speaker A: That's great.\n153:23 Speaker B: And you send me a full conversation of yours.\n153:26 Speaker B: And then we use that to.\n153:29 Speaker B: To.\n153:31 Speaker B: To create kind of like basically like how.\n153:37 Speaker B: What could we put into the profile?\n153:40 Speaker B: You know, what could the profile look like that would enable us to enable people to move towards something that, you know, brings them more to life.\n153:52 Speaker A: Yeah.\n153:53 Speaker A: Which, which is connected to one of the.\n153:56 Speaker A: The last ideas that I don't think I have shared yet.\n153:59 Speaker A: Which is about.\n154:00 Speaker A: I think I mentioned it.\n154:01 Speaker A: But action.\n154:02 Speaker A: Right.\n154:03 Speaker A: Like coming alive generally moves something.\n154:07 Speaker A: Even if you have a moment of inspiration, you have like a chest expansion, you stand up.\n154:11 Speaker A: And I think that whatever we do with the icky guy, for me, if it doesn't turn into some sort of behavior, like it's kind of like.\n154:20 Speaker A: Yeah.\n154:20 Speaker A: You know, even if the behavior is talking about it with your friend and having you like understanding, understand your profile better, like that's already like really cool.\n154:27 Speaker A: That's like intimacy, that's relationship, that's connection, that's clarity and conviction.\n154:33 Speaker B: So I have created, I've created like lots of different things, you know, like to.\n154:38 Speaker B: To do that.\n154:39 Speaker B: For example, it's like, okay, based on your profile suggesting new movies to watch or suggesting you like the perfect average weekend, know, like helping like you can co create like it's an assistant that basically based on your values and everything co creates with you a weekend and you can basically like refine it and then it turns it into like an image, you know, that basically summarizes like what you would do during the weekend.\n155:08 Speaker B: Like a schedule for the weekend.\n155:10 Speaker B: Yeah.\n155:10 Speaker B: And like with an image and like a title for the weekend.\n155:13 Speaker B: And so you have all of these weekend cards that you could use also to like, you know, I could share my perfect weekend with you or my love partner.\n155:22 Speaker A: Yeah.\n155:22 Speaker B: You know.\n155:24 Speaker B: Yeah, use the live wheel.\n155:25 Speaker B: I don't know.\n155:25 Speaker B: You know, there's like lots of different.\n155:27 Speaker A: Yeah, I was thinking about that for the profile or something like that.\n155:30 Speaker A: There's actually something that I think is.\n155:32 Speaker A: Is very interesting.\n155:34 Speaker A: I've been playing with this idea of assessment using cultural choice.\n155:42 Speaker A: So Ratatouille or A Beautiful Mind.\n155:46 Speaker A: Right.\n155:46 Speaker A: And I think There's a lot of information that we can pull out from a person who answers these two things.\n155:54 Speaker A: In terms of the Ricky guy.\n155:56 Speaker B: Say that again.\n155:58 Speaker A: Ratatouille is a movie.\n156:00 Speaker A: A Beautiful Mind is a movie.\n156:02 Speaker A: And you just say A or B.\n156:03 Speaker A: And I think that it's actually really fast to go through, through an assessment like this without even writing sentences that will be able to do that exploded view really weirdly, richly.\n156:16 Speaker A: I think.\n156:16 Speaker A: I think this is a hypothesis.\n156:18 Speaker A: Okay.\n156:18 Speaker A: And so this is something else that I want to prototype for you and the icky guy is can we make your 15 minute assessment three minutes?\n156:26 Speaker A: I think so.\n156:27 Speaker A: I think it's possible because there's a lot of inference you can get from that.\n156:33 Speaker B: Yeah, I think so too.\n156:34 Speaker B: Yeah.\n156:35 Speaker B: And.\n156:35 Speaker B: And the question is then just like, how do you, how do you expose it?\n156:39 Speaker B: And like here, really the question is like of this, of this HK15, I mean, I put it out kind of almost like, you know, how I created it.\n156:50 Speaker B: It was like part of the onboarding.\n156:52 Speaker B: I wanted to have like a subsection that basically just creates like a, you know, like a first drop craft of the, of the, of the Ikigai, like a very rough, you know, sketch so that they can just get an idea.\n157:13 Speaker B: And then, then it was like I was like, oh, wait, actually that's in some ways.\n157:17 Speaker B: And maybe it's just because, you know, I've already know my answers in a way has been more precise than maybe the longer version in some way.\n157:27 Speaker A: Yeah.\n157:27 Speaker A: I have to pee and I have to eat.\n157:30 Speaker A: And I think we got some good ideas and I think we should focus on the profiling section.\n157:35 Speaker A: First things first.\n157:37 Speaker A: And we have some good ideas to explore.\n157:39 Speaker A: We just need like scheduling, I think two hours with the expectation that it's an hour and a half with space for two.\n157:46 Speaker A: If we go over, like, we probably will.\n157:48 Speaker A: Like we are now.\n157:49 Speaker B: Sure.\n157:50 Speaker B: So when.\n157:52 Speaker B: Or do you want to go to the.\n157:53 Speaker B: Go to the toilet first and then we take two more minutes.\n158:00 Speaker A: Let me just pee and I'll be right back.\n158:43 Speaker B: It.\n159:23 Speaker A: All right.\n159:29 Speaker B: All right, all right.\n159:31 Speaker A: Do you remember one of the early experiments I did with the LLM where I said AI way way but Iraqi, and it gave me the Iraqi aiway way.\n159:48 Speaker A: Yeah, because.\n159:50 Speaker A: Because if you think about the vector space, this is why that cultural association map thing will work really well, because it's like triangulating in a vector space and like, just imagine, you know, the, the focal points of a couple of these vectors that can, can be interesting.\n160:10 Speaker A: But the other thing that I, I was wondering that could be really cool, is my icky guy.\n160:18 Speaker A: But 20 years in the future, you.\n160:21 Speaker B: Know how it could evolve.\n160:23 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.\n160:24 Speaker A: And you can, you can likely figure that out and it might be very insightful.\n160:29 Speaker A: And then you get to decide like.\n160:30 Speaker B: Different, different trajectories, you know, like different trajectories.\n160:33 Speaker B: I mean, the thing is, you know, like, so I think Akis in general are already quite aspirational.\n160:41 Speaker B: So there's like, so there's like one thing that is like about how do you close the gap between where you're currently at?\n160:50 Speaker B: There's, there's actually kind of like, you know, like there's like your current profile actually, and then there's your profile.\n160:56 Speaker A: Yeah.\n160:57 Speaker B: And that, that creates actually attention as well.\n161:01 Speaker B: So the question is also like, how can we assess people's kind of current profile more accurately, you know, because just, you know, like if I say I'm good at facilitation, like, I don't know, you know, I have a current skill level, it doesn't really, you know, say much, you know, I added as my strength, but it doesn't say, I know.\n161:31 Speaker B: Yeah, there's.\n161:31 Speaker B: There's a tension already somewhere there.\n161:35 Speaker B: So there's a tension between current profile, AIGU profile and how it could evolve and trajectories of how it could evolve.\n161:51 Speaker A: Okay, do we want to work once a week, twice a week?\n161:58 Speaker A: What is this one?\n161:59 Speaker B: Okay, we could, I mean for me, what is.\n162:04 Speaker B: What works for you?\n162:11 Speaker A: Maybe we could do kind of a dynamic thing where we just look at our calendars and see what works best and when we want to, like, do we have pressing needs?\n162:22 Speaker A: This thing is coming up in a week.\n162:23 Speaker A: Do we want to try to prepare something before then or not?\n162:30 Speaker B: I mean, basically, you know, until Friday, I just.\n162:36 Speaker B: Or actually like it.\n162:37 Speaker B: It's going to be shared.\n162:39 Speaker B: The profile is going to be shared now with them already.\n162:41 Speaker B: So basically I think the next week is a done deal, but then for in two weeks or three weeks we're gonna run the one with hundred people.\n162:52 Speaker A: Okay.\n162:53 Speaker A: I mean we can hang out again on Thursday around this time maybe.\n162:59 Speaker A: Yeah, 10 to 12 and explore and, and kind of relatedly I want to figure out, not that I want to like really segment these things, but you know, I'm probably gonna build some kind of parliaments, maybe Come Alive is going to become a parliament inside of this meta structure and there's going to be a lot of ideas that are shared.\n163:27 Speaker A: Because.\n163:27 Speaker A: Because I'm bringing my ideas and I'm like sharing them here and I want you to Help me make this thing practical.\n163:33 Speaker A: That will help me achieve my icky guy of.\n163:36 Speaker A: Anyway, so like, I just want to figure out like, what should we just do both?\n163:42 Speaker A: Or like what's the scope of this versus that?\n163:45 Speaker B: Or I mean, you can see it as well as like a prototyping ground, you know, so, and like, you know, the, the underlying logic, you know, you can always like replicate them different in different ways.\n164:00 Speaker B: And now we just package it in one way, you know, and that package, you know, like we'll have like the good IP of the learning Institute, you know, Fine, right.\n164:09 Speaker B: But we're building at the same time our experience of, you know, like, what's the things that, that we want to build outside of that particular container.\n164:20 Speaker A: Well then maybe what I should share with you is the protocol, because that's the interoperable thing that I was trying to figure out.\n164:28 Speaker A: Including profiles, including like what, like what is an agent?\n164:34 Speaker A: How.\n164:34 Speaker A: What is the, the core prompt that creates the agents?\n164:36 Speaker A: So like, what is the, the architecture of a question, providing attention from who you are to who you become?\n164:45 Speaker A: How does that tension create a flock?\n164:47 Speaker A: What are those flocks?\n164:48 Speaker A: What are agents?\n164:49 Speaker A: What are consistent constitutive intentional policies?\n164:51 Speaker A: And how do they attend to a conversation?\n164:53 Speaker A: So I'm trying to figure out like more base architecturally, this idea of tension creating agents, creating awareness, inspiring action, if that makes sense.\n165:07 Speaker A: And like I'm trying to make that something to have a conversation around maybe as a public protocol that then I build either like Come Alive that uses the Parliament's like, strategy, right, to create the, the operating process for this facilitation that has various things, but to try to like create the protocol and then to figure out the implementations.\n165:33 Speaker A: And I think maybe that's one level that we could work on.\n165:36 Speaker A: Maybe it's open source because it's, it's kind of just like a big picture idea of like, what is a human?\n165:41 Speaker A: How do you live?\n165:43 Speaker A: How do we leverage this new technology that, you know, that we can use in these ways and can we make this interoperable so that, you know, growth and understand.\n165:53 Speaker A: This is why I wanted to get down to really understanding what can we align on as humans about life purpose, meaning, right, so that we can have this interoperability and other people that work in this space can be like, yeah, sure, I'll take that framework or that process or that even that prompt, or here's my version of this prompt and how it outputs similar.\n166:13 Speaker B: This is why, this is why I mean like the interoperability is like what allows for Co creation or like between different organizations, which is so difficult.\n166:24 Speaker B: So that's why I was also thinking of like, you know, using if the common ground is like, I don't know, like AI checkbox or like that's kind of like the medium that is chosen for that particular thing, which actually doesn't need to be.\n166:39 Speaker B: Or like if she doesn't need to be.\n166:40 Speaker B: But.\n166:43 Speaker B: But like you could, you can basically create like a shared business model around that.\n166:47 Speaker B: And also like there's in WhatsApp like a really cool function which is kind of like.\n166:55 Speaker B: I don't think you have ever.\n166:56 Speaker B: Maybe I've never seen it.\n166:57 Speaker B: But like you can disagree.\n166:59 Speaker B: Have these.\n167:01 Speaker B: You can, you can create like a scrolling bar with different images, like interactive.\n167:07 Speaker A: Elements and stuff like that.\n167:09 Speaker B: Yeah.\n167:09 Speaker B: And so it's like whatever.\n167:11 Speaker B: And so you can basically do it like a shop, you know.\n167:15 Speaker B: So what we could do is, you know, like all of the different flows that are like available, put them as packages, you know, for like different.\n167:25 Speaker B: For different.\n167:28 Speaker B: I don't know, like, basically like there's the moving forward package and there's like the getting unstuck package and I don't know, whatever.\n167:34 Speaker A: You should see one of the teams that we trained called eflow, they've basically built this WhatsApp framework a few years ago to run educational programs for refugees.\n167:46 Speaker A: That was like their core.\n167:48 Speaker A: What do you call beachhead market.\n167:51 Speaker A: And it's not open source or anything, it's their business.\n167:55 Speaker A: But this guy is really cool.\n167:57 Speaker A: He's also really into AI and he's been able to build a team and set this whole thing up and.\n168:04 Speaker A: And he's.\n168:05 Speaker A: Yeah, so it could be interesting.\n168:07 Speaker A: So I've seen that stuff over here and they have like the dashboard.\n168:10 Speaker A: So like there's the LLM side, but then the, the dashboard and then even the online learning content design.\n168:15 Speaker A: Basically they're building what you're building.\n168:17 Speaker A: I think almost.\n168:18 Speaker B: I think so.\n168:18 Speaker B: Yeah.\n168:21 Speaker B: They have like a nice platform, which is quite nice.\n168:26 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.\n168:27 Speaker A: And they've been.\n168:28 Speaker A: They were one of our teams in our programs and now they're like a real business and doing stuff.\n168:34 Speaker A: They were the 2020, remember the beetle Blast one?\n168:37 Speaker A: That was the.\n168:38 Speaker A: I was their teacher.\n168:41 Speaker A: But it could be interesting to talk to this guy.\n168:43 Speaker A: I'm not sure exactly how, but definitely the idea of if, if we can align on a protocol, you know, and that would really help.\n168:54 Speaker A: And one of the things that I'm getting stuck in personally is every time I try to align on the protocol and get the protocol defined, I try to Come up with a internationally valid way of thinking.\n169:09 Speaker A: Thinking about what a human is, what meaning is that people can align on to be able to accept the protocol and the framing.\n169:15 Speaker A: Right.\n169:16 Speaker A: But maybe I should just like go for.\n169:19 Speaker A: Okay.\n169:19 Speaker A: You know, most people won't think about things that hard and maybe it's okay just to take the idea of values, realism and like Joe's principles as a given and then just work off of that, you know, and see who accepts and who agrees without trying to get people to be on board with it and make it more of a try experientially like the Buddhist like philosophy of a science of, you know, epistemic humility plus lived reality.\n169:52 Speaker A: You know, just like, oh, it, it is real without having to explain it.\n169:57 Speaker A: But I'm trying to.\n170:00 Speaker A: I get too stuck in trying to explain plane.\n170:03 Speaker A: Anyway, I'm gonna go.\n170:05 Speaker A: We can meet on Thursday.\n170:06 Speaker B: What is the.\n170:07 Speaker B: What is the.\n170:08 Speaker B: She said Thursday at the same time.\n170:11 Speaker B: I'm wondering, would it be possible to do something that afternoon?\n170:18 Speaker A: Yeah, it's possible.\n170:20 Speaker A: One Thursday.\n170:23 Speaker B: Thursday or Friday, doesn't matter.\n170:25 Speaker A: Friday I'll be busy.\n170:27 Speaker A: Thursday is good.\n170:28 Speaker B: Good.\n170:28 Speaker A: Thursday I have to go back to do that test and.\n170:34 Speaker B: Oh yeah, Thursday in the afternoon or something.\n170:42 Speaker A: Yeah, after one.\n170:45 Speaker A: After one?\n170:45 Speaker A: Before four.\n170:48 Speaker B: So what do you think about two to four?\n170:49 Speaker B: Is that possible?\n170:50 Speaker A: Two to four?\n170:51 Speaker A: Yeah, but then I have to leave at four.\n170:53 Speaker B: Okay, so that gives us like an hour and a half, right?\n170:57 Speaker A: Yeah, two to four block.\n170:58 Speaker A: Hour and a half.\n170:59 Speaker A: Maybe I'll have half an hour to go for a run or something.\n171:05 Speaker A: I'm gonna think about the like this idea of can we like what would a three minute icky guy using cultural references triangulation assessment be?\n171:19 Speaker A: And then I'll think about what would a framework like what are some of the frameworks that could be interesting to have as a profile?\n171:29 Speaker A: That, yeah, that, that's.\n171:31 Speaker A: I think some of the interesting things I'd like to think about.\n171:33 Speaker B: Yeah.\n171:34 Speaker B: So.\n171:37 Speaker B: And just use the, use the ikigai 15 ones and then share with me your profile already.\n171:49 Speaker B: What's.\n171:49 Speaker B: What's the kind of information that is inside what's.\n171:52 Speaker A: It's possible to get people memory.\n171:56 Speaker A: Right?\n172:01 Speaker A: Cool.\n172:02 Speaker A: It's too bad, too bad.\n172:03 Speaker A: If they're around that in a user friendly way without copying and pasting and.\n172:09 Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I think I can make a plugin to do it actually.\n172:14 Speaker B: What you should do, you know that they check you and that becomes the first message of the agent and then there's a link.\n172:20 Speaker A: Then it compiles the J to the link results.\n172:26 Speaker A: Maybe if it lets us do that.\n172:28 Speaker A: It might not, but that could be cool.\n172:37 Speaker B: They cannot do.\n172:38 Speaker B: No.\n172:40 Speaker B: Okay, okay, okay.\n172:42 Speaker B: So I'll send you WhatsApp.\n172:46 Speaker B: So go through IKEA 15 share IKEA profile and I'll do steps two and three, like three minute version and create IQI profile and then we meet back on test after SA.\n173:39 Speaker B: Good.",

      "content": "### 7‑Minute “Meaning‑Momentum” Review  \n*(applied to your 1 h 45 m call of 6 May 2025 – Bilal + Johannes)*  \n\n| Section | Key capture from this meeting | Quick reflection / action |\n|---------|------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **1. Insight Snap**<br>*(what struck, surprised, clarified)* | *Personal‑context ↔ project entanglement* — the ADD‑driving incident, police stress and shame set an emotional backdrop that kept resurfacing.<br>*Unstuck idea* — pivot from static “flows” to a **dynamic Parliament protocol** that assembles agents on‑the‑fly; three‑minute culture‑choice assessment.<br>*Human‑in‑the‑loop* tension surfaced repeatedly: desire for AI scaffolding **without** losing fresh human inspiration. | Capture “Parliaments” one‑pager by Thu; note the *air‑gap* principle: don’t let people copy/paste—force re‑articulation. |\n| **2. Bottleneck Radar** | *Legal/vehicle issue* draining cognitive bandwidth until resolved.<br>*Unclear product boundaries*: Ikigai short vs. long, ownership/IP, financing flow‑costs.<br>*Calendaring*: next focus block not locked. | Schedule 30 min *today* to phone gas‑station & prefecture; get written timeline so it stops looping.<br>Create a one‑slide scope graphic before the next call. |\n| **3. Next‑Step Calibration** | 1. Exchange full Ikigai‑15 chat logs (Bilal ⇄ Johannes) by **Wed 17:00**.<br>2. Prototype 3‑minute cultural‑triangulation assessment; test on ourselves.<br>3. Meet **Thu 8 May, 14:00‑16:00 CET** – aim for 90 min deep work. | Put these three tasks in shared doc + calendar invites now. |\n| **4. Meaning Check (Godin lens)** | This call moved your shared story from *“two builders with overlapping toolkits”* to *“co‑crafting an open protocol that keeps humans awake.”*  The vulnerability around chaos/shame underlines **why** the work matters: tech that *amplifies aliveness* instead of swallowing it. | Re‑state that narrative at start of next session to keep focus on the bigger‑than-product purpose. |\n| **5. Energy Gauge** | **Bilal** started depleted (Wi‑Fi issues, police incident) → ended *curiously energized* once protocol talk crystallised.<br>**Johannes** steady‑practical → slight fatigue after 90 min but excitement about concrete deliverables. | Notice the inflection: technical brainstorming restored energy. Plan to open Thursday’s session **directly with a quick win demo** to recreate that uplift. |\n\n---\n\n#### Designer Lens: Ferriss × Godin effectiveness score\n\n| Dimension | Ferriss‑style (tactics) | Godin‑style (story) | Current meeting performance |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| Extracted learnings | 7/10 — lots of raw ideas, few distilled checklists | — | |\n| Leverageable next‑steps | 6/10 — you left with three tasks but no owner/time box until review above | — | |\n| Story/trust alignment | — | 8/10 — strong mutual vulnerability & shared north star | |\n\n*Blend fix*: open every meeting with a **tactical scoreboard** (Ferriss) *and* close with a **one‑sentence story of why this matters** (Godin).\n\n---\n\n### Prompt‑Iteration Questions\n1. Which section above felt *most/least* valuable reading it back?  \n2. Did the 7‑minute frame feel realistic, or do you need an *Express 3* and *Deep 15* version?  \n3. Should “Bottleneck Radar” explicitly separate *personal life blockers* from *project blockers*?  \n4. Would a voice‑note version (you speak, AI transcribes into the table) remove friction for you?  \n5. On the Ferriss‑Godin blend, do you want any other “guest editors” (e.g., Brené Brown for vulnerability check‑ins)?\n\nTry answering Q #1‑#3 right after you read this, while the call is still fresh; tweak the template before Thursday’s session.",
