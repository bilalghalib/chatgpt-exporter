      "content": "Here’s what I found:\n\n---\n\n## 🏷 Why are Carrefour and Starbucks on BDS-related boycott lists?\n\n- **Carrefour** is targeted by BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) primarily for its partnerships with Israeli companies, notably Electra Consumer Products and its subsidiary Yenot Bitan. BDS argues these business ties contribute to “apartheid, genocide, and human rights violations.” citeturn0search5turn0search9\n\n- **Starbucks**, while *not officially named* by the Palestinian-led BDS campaign, is nonetheless widely included on grassroots boycott lists. Protesters cite perceived complicity with Israel, including its legal action against Starbucks Workers United union after a pro‑Palestine post by the union. BDS-aligned activists have endorsed this boycott as part of solidarity actions. citeturn0search1turn0search12turn0search6\n\n---\n\n## 📉 What economic impact has the boycott had on their profits?\n\n### **Starbucks**\n\n- **Global financial losses**: In late 2023, the company attributed part of a dramatic decline in market value—estimated at around **$11 billion**—to backlash around the Gaza conflict and associated boycotts. Its stock also plunged ~20%. citeturn0search25turn0news20\n\n- **Profit declines**: In Q2 2024, Starbucks reported a **15% drop in net income**, heavily impacted by declining sales, especially in the U.S. and Middle East. citeturn0news21turn0news20\n\n- **Regional layoffs**: Its franchise operator in the Middle East (Alshaya Group) laid off over **2,000 employees** (~4% workforce) due to falling consumer traffic tied to boycott sentiment. citeturn0news21turn0search14\n\n- **European losses**: In the UK, over a 12-month period ending September 2024, Starbucks posted a **4% drop in sales** (£525.6 million) and recorded a **£35.2 million pre-tax loss**, versus £16.9 million earnings a year earlier. The company blamed “misperceptions” around the Israel‑Hamas conflict as one factor. citeturn0news19\n\n- **Sales dip by region**: North American revenue was down ~2%, and international sales fell ~7%, according to corporate reports. citeturn0search3turn0search8\n\n### **Carrefour**\n\n- While **specific profit figures for Carrefour** tied to BDS campaigns are harder to find, evidence shows **significant disruption** — such as closures of stores in Oman amid coordinated boycott activity. citeturn0search5turn0search9\n\n- Broader patterns indicate major Western brands from Coca‑Cola to McDonald’s and Carrefour are experiencing **declines in revenue in Muslim-majority markets**, driven by consumer boycotts over perceived ties to Israel. citeturn0news22turn0news21\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Summary Table\n\n| Company     | Why Targeted by BDS/Activists                              | Reported Financial Impact                                 |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Carrefour** | Partnerships with Israeli firms (Electra, Yenot Bitan)     | Store closures (e.g. Oman); broader sales declines in Middle East region |\n| **Starbucks** | Indirect BDS listing; backlash tied to alleged support for Israel and union dispute | ~$11 billion drop in market cap; sales & profit declines (2–7% or more); layoffs; UK losses recorded |\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Key context & nuance\n\n- **Official vs. informal boycott lists**: Starbucks isn’t formally listed by the Palestinian BDS National Committee, but pro‑Palestinian activists and local boycott campaigns include it due to perceived corporate neutrality—or worse, complicity. citeturn0search1turn0search4\n\n- **Long‑term vs. short‑term effects**: Some analysts suggest that temporary boycott waves (a few months) may not materially undercut long-term profitability. Yet the intensity of this wave—and global media attention—is causing real reputational risk. citeturn0search4turn0search8\n\n- **Corporate response**: Both brands have publicly denied having political agendas or funding any military efforts. Starbucks in particular has highlighted donations to humanitarian efforts (e.g. $3 million to World Central Kitchen) to counter backlash. citeturn0news21turn0search14\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Bottom line\n\n- **Carrefour** is on BDS-related boycott lists because of its Israeli business partnerships, and has seen regional operational impacts (store closures and rumored revenue drops).\n\n- **Starbucks**, though not officially listed by the BDS movement, is widely boycotted by activists for perceived support of Israel and corporate actions around its union. It has faced measurable setbacks in market value, sales, employment centers (notably in the Middle East), and pre-tax profits in markets like the UK.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to dive deeper into specific quarterly reporting or activist materials.\n\nnavlistRelated news turn0news21,turn0news22,turn0news19",

      "content": "Here are **some of the most clearly implicated companies** on the BDS (Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions) list, the actions that put them there, and what they have done in response:\n\n---\n\n## 🔝 Priority Targets & Key Complicit Companies\n\nBDS focuses its pressure on companies deemed **most directly involved** in supporting Israel's occupation and military apparatus, especially those with significant contracts, infrastructure ties, or visible activity in settlements citeturn0search28turn0search5:\n\n- **Elbit Systems**: An Israeli arms and surveillance company heavily involved in military operations, especially the West Bank barrier and electronic systems used in checkpoints and prisons. Targeted by international divestment campaigns and blacklists (e.g. Norway, France, Denmark) citeturn0search30turn0search5.\n\n- **Veolia** and **Alstom**: French multinationals linked to construction and operation of infrastructure in occupied Palestinian territories (e.g., Jerusalem light rail). Veolia divested its Israeli operations by 2015 under sustained pressure (~$20 bn impact claimed by BDS) citeturn0search28turn0search5turn0news24.\n\n- **G4S**: A global security firm that provided services to Israeli prisons, checkpoints, and settlements. Exited Israeli contracts around 2016 after international boycott campaigns citeturn0search27turn0search28.\n\n- **HP Inc. / Hewlett Packard Enterprise**: Accused of enabling Israeli biometric ID systems used to control Palestinian movement and servers for prisons. Faced union-led boycotts and divestment by organizations across several countries citeturn0search28turn0search5.\n\n- **AXA**: The French insurer, pressured to divest investments in Israeli arms manufacturers like Elbit Systems. Partial disinvestment occurred after BDS-linked campaigns citeturn0search28turn0search5.\n\n- **Orange (France)**: Former licensing partner of Israeli Partner Communications. Ended the Israeli partnership in early 2016 following multi-national pressure from BDS supporters citeturn0search28turn0search5.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Additional Notable Targets & Activist‑Led Campaigns\n\nBDS also supports **organic or grassroots boycott campaigns** for companies whose local franchises or partners have shown overt support for Israeli military actions. These were not always initiated by BDS centrally, but are endorsed due to the franchise's behavior:\n\n- **McDonald’s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Papa John’s, Domino’s Pizza**: In some countries the franchises in Israel publicly distributed free meals to Israeli soldiers or rescue forces. The National BDS Committee supports boycotts of these brands where that support occurred citeturn0search13turn0search2turn0search1.\n\n- **Microsoft / Xbox**: Added to BDS priority list in **April 2025**, accused of providing Azure cloud and AI infrastructure to the Israeli military. BDS calls for global public boycott of Microsoft products and divestment from its contracts citeturn0news21turn0search16.\n\n- **Puma**: Sponsor of the Israeli Football Association, which includes clubs based in occupied settlements. More than 200 Palestinian sports organizations have called for boycott; some universities and cities have actually severed sponsorships citeturn0search28turn0search31.\n\n- **Zara (Inditex)**: Though not initiated by BDS, hit with activist-level organic boycott over alleged complicit supply chains and retail presence in settlements. BDS officially endorses the campaign citeturn0search3turn0search10.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Why These Companies?\n\nBDS targets are selected based on two main criteria:\n\n1. **Direct complicity** with Israeli occupation through military contracts, settlement infrastructure, or surveillance systems.\n2. **Potential leverage or visibility**—companies whose boycott can create pressure, inspire broader solidarity, and attract media and financial scrutiny citeturn0search10turn0search13.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Summary Table\n\n| Company                  | Why Targeted by BDS                                                               | Actions Taken / Responses                                        |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Elbit Systems**       | Arms & surveillance in occupied territories                                       | Divestments by pension funds (Norway, Denmark, HSBC, AXA)        |\n| **Veolia / Alstom**     | Built light rail & infrastructure in settlements                                  | Complete exit from Israeli operations by Veolia, Alstom divestment |\n| **G4S**                 | Security services to prisons/checkpoints in West Bank                            | Contract termination and exit from Israeli operations            |\n| **HP Inc. / HPE**       | Biometric ID systems & servers in Israeli prisons                                 | Boycott campaigns by unions, public pressure, divestments        |\n| **AXA**                 | Financial investment in Israeli arms firms                                       | Partial divestment (Elbit), pressure campaigns                   |\n| **Orange**              | Telecom licensing with Israeli operator Partner Communications                    | Ended Israeli partnership in 2016                                |\n| **McDonald’s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Papa John’s, Domino’s** | Franchise-level support for Israeli soldiers                        | Endorsed grassroots boycotts; BDS supports consumer pressure     |\n| **Microsoft / Xbox**    | Technology (AI, cloud) to Israeli military                                       | Added to BDS priority list in April 2025; call for full boycott   |\n| **Puma**               | Sponsorship of Israeli settlement football teams via Israel Football Association   | University and activist-led sponsorship cancellations            |\n| **Zara / Inditex**      | Retail presence & operations tied to settlements                                 | BDS endorses grassroots campaigns targeting the company          |\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Bottom Line\n\nBDS pursues a **targeted strategy**—focusing on a relatively small number of companies seen as deeply involved in mechanisms of occupation or military support, while also backing broader grassroots boycotts when brands or franchises cross thresholds of complicity or visibility.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more detail on any specific company or campaign.\n\nnavlistRelevant news on recent BDS targetsturn0news21,turn0news24",
