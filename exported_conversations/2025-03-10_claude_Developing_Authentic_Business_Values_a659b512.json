Once that fundamental point is clear, then you can create all that other material to help you visualize your brand.\n1\n\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate.\n\nDefine your unique value proposition.\n\nWrite mission and vision statements for your brand. \n1 minute: Objectives\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate: You’ve gathered all this information, now we are going to try and define our business in a way that will resonate with your customer base.\nDefine your unique value proposition: Pinpoint the key area of your business that makes you unique.\nWrite your mission and vision statements for your business:  This is to have a clear written mission that is aligned with your brand. \n\n2\n\nBRAND CHAT\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: \"What brands do you connect with personally? What makes them meaningful to you?\"\nPotential Answers:\nSolve real problems in my life\nAlign with what matters to me\nHelp me live better according to my priorities\nFeel authentic and transparent\nUse resources efficiently in ways I respect\nFollow-Up: \"How do these meaningful connections benefit the business?\"\nPotential Answers:\nLoyal customers who spread the word\nLower marketing costs\nResilience against competition\n\nAsk: What are the different elements of a brand? What defines a brand? What do you think of when we talk about a brand?\nPotential answers:\nCreative elements (logo, colors, marketing, etc…)\nBig companies\nConsistency\nThe name of the market or product\nThe image that comes to mind when people interact with your brand\nGood quality, (or bad quality)\nUnique\nHas creative elements (logo, name, color or font scheme, etc…)\nA company’s environmental and social commitments\n Follow-up Question: How do you see sustainability influencing customer perceptions of a brand?\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n\n3\n\nELEMENTS OF YOUR BRAND\n\nAsk: What are the different elements of a brand? What defines a brand? What do you think of when we talk about a brand?\nPotential answers:\nCreative elements (logo, colors, marketing, etc…)\nBig companies\nConsistency\nThe name of the market or product\nThe image that comes to mind when people interact with your brand\nGood quality, (or bad quality)\nUnique\nHas creative elements (logo, name, color or font scheme, etc…)\nA company’s environmental and social commitments\n Follow-up Question: How do you see sustainability influencing customer perceptions of a brand?\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n4\n\n“A brand is defined by a customers overall perception of your business.”\nWHAT IS THIS?\n8 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What does this apple mean? \nPotential answers:\nHigh quality\nProfessional\nHigh tech\nInternational\nIntelligence\nInnovation\nSteve Jobs\nI phone\nIOS\nExpensive\nMobile phones + other products like computers and tablets\nFun or games\nSneaky or annoying sometimes \nMoney driven company\nSecurity\nTrustworthy\n\nSummary: I showed you a picture of an apple, and so much came to your mind. You mentioned the products that Apple has, their founder, that they are expensive, you all have stories about this brand and feeling around it. I can show this picture to people all around the world, and there will probably be a similar response. That is a strong brand! \n\nAsk: Why is having a strong brand so important?\nPotential answers:\nIt is the identity of your business\nIt is how you will be remembered\nYou want a good brand identity, not a bad one!\nMaintaining a positive brand image is important because it will have a lasting impression on customers! They don’t forget easily and they have power!\nYou can sell a brand, not only a product\nThe strategy and actions of a business could be good or bad. These actions will define your brand and will make an impact over the next several years.\n\nRecap: Having a brand is really important for a business. It helps customers differentiate you from the competitors and remember you for what you are good at. What do we want our customers to think about when they interact with our products?\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A BRAND?\nQuality\nProducts and services\nCreative elements\nMessage\nA brand is consistent in its:\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: What is a brand\nLet people answer freely, then cover these points below as well: \nQuality: iPhones are great quality. We know this because it is consistently true. I would never buy an iPhone and question the quality of it. It is the same in every box in every country (unless it is a fake product). \nProducts and services: Apple is consistent in their products and services as well. They are a technology company. I know that they won’t be coming out with furniture or kitchenware. That would make for a very confusing brand. When creating a brand, make sure you are consistent in the things you offer as well.\nCreative elements: Commercials, marketing materials, office layout, website, Facebook, and more! Everything is in line with the same creative elements. There is a consistency with color and font schemes. Logos use and all creative elements are consistent. \nYou saw the Apple logo and knew what it was immediately. If someone took another icon of a fruit with a bite in it, many of us will think of Apple. That is a strong brand! \nMessage: Your message is consistent across all channels, internally, and externally. Whether it is your commercials, the writing on your packaging, blogs that you write, your company culture, or anything else, your message is clear and consistent. What is the problem you are solving? What does your business do? Make sure those things are clear.\n\nRecap: Apply your branding across your business and evolve it as you grow. As you grow and expand, you want to make it as easy as possible for people to know exactly what you do. If you do too much, or aren’t consistent in these points, you make it hard for people to recognize you out of the crowd.\n\n5 minutes: Brief activity\nFor each of the logos, discuss if they have a good brand or not. Try to touch on all of the four points mentioned on the slide.\n\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n10 minutes: Discussion + Exercise\n\nA value proposition is a promise of meaningful value that your business delivers better than alternatives. It answers: \"Why should people choose you?\"\n\nAsk: \"How do your authentic values create a unique advantage in the market?\"\nGuide discussion to explore:\n\n1. Intersection of Meaning\n   - What meaningful experiences do your customers seek?\n   - How do your authentic values help create those experiences?\n   - What meaningful difference does your solution make compared to alternatives?\n\n2. Business Advantages\n   - Does your values-aligned approach create efficiency advantages?\n   - Can your authentic values reduce costs or risks in ways competitors can't?\n   - Do shared values with customers create stronger loyalty and reduce marketing costs?\n\nExercise:\nComplete this sentence: \"Unlike our competitors, we _____________ because we genuinely value _____________.\"\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia: \"Unlike typical outdoor brands, we help you keep using what you already own because we genuinely value reducing environmental impact.\"\n- Warby Parker: \"Unlike traditional eyewear companies, we make prescription glasses accessible to more people because we genuinely value equal access to vision care.\"\n\n\u000bOriginal [[[5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat is a unique value proposition?\nPotential answers could be:\nSomething that makes you unique\nA clear statement to describe what you do\nThe key offerings of your business\nIt is the point that differentiates you from your competitors\nShows why your product is better than other in the market\n]]]\n7\n\n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you”\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nState the definition of a value proposition and connect it to their ideas from before.\nAsk: \n How can we actually get to our unique value proposition? Does anyone have an idea? (What makes you stand out—whether it’s pricing, durability, or an extra benefit like helping customers save resources?) The answers here will frame the next slides.\nPotential answers:\nWe get it from our research\nUsers have to tell us\nWe have to look at what is already in the market\nLook at competitors to see what they are offering and what they are good at\nWe look at our business idea and what we are good at\nWe consider whether sustainability can be a unique differentiator (e.g., eco-friendly materials, ethical supply chains, low-carbon operations, waste reduction).\n \n Discussion Prompt: Could sustainability be a part of your Unique Value Proposition? If yes, how?\n\nRecap: Over the past month, you guys have been doing a ton of research. You have done a deep dive into the market to try to identify gaps and areas of opportunity. You now know 3 important factors needed to define our UVP:\nWhat you and your business are good at\nWhat the market wants and needs\nWhat competitors are offering\n Additional Consideration: Some businesses differentiate themselves by being the \"green alternative.\" Think about how sustainability could enhance your value proposition.\n\nYour business \nand what you \ndo well\nThe market \nand customers needs \n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo first there is you. You all came in here with business ideas and you want to see if there is a market for it. You have certain:\nCapabilities\nInterests\nInformation\nA business idea \nSkills\nExperience\n\nBut you also have the market. The market has:\nPeople with changing needs, wants, desires, frustrations, etc…\nThe market can be big or small\nYour market is where you can actually reach, so it can be limited geographically\nEtc…\n\nWhat we are searching for this month, is to see if people want your idea. Based on your capabilities of developing and delivering a product, will people want what you have? And the next question, is there enough people who want it? \nThrough the animation of the circles, show:\nThe more overlap between your business idea and the needs of the market means that there is more potential for your business to succeed. \nWhen there is a small overlap (a small number of people in the market interested in your idea), there is a smaller market potential. This could be considered a niche market.\nMake sure the size of the market is worth your time and energy! Ask yourself, “is this enough for me? Will I be satisfied from the returns of this market?”\n\nYour business \nand what you\ndo well\nThe market \nand customers\nneeds\nCompetitors\nUNIQUE \nVALUE PROPOSITION\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBut there is one more thing. The market also has something else, competitors! They:\nSell other things similar to yours\nServing your customers needs now!\nDon’t serve the needs of the whole market \nYou won’t ever have the whole market\n\nBecause not everyone's needs are being met. There is an opportunity to meet those customers needs and differentiate yourself from your competitors. \n\nAsk: Based on this visual, where should you focus your energy?\nOverlap between competitors and you: Don’t go here! The market doesn’t show any desire for these things! Don’t waste your energy or time.\nOverlap between competitors and market: You could try to go here, but it could be dangerous. You are competing with your competitors on something they are really good at, and you are not good at. You might be seen as a less desirable option to your customers. Or it will take some time to be a strong competitor.\nOverlap between the three circles: This is somehow the bare minimum. Customers want it, competitors do it, and you have the capabilities for it. You should probably be doing this too. \nOverlap between you and the market: This is where you will find your unique value proposition. Customers want it, but the competitors aren’t offering it! Here is where you can really add value and differentiate yourself from your competitors.\n\nWhy choose you?\n\nWHERE DO YOU CREATE UNIQUE VALUE?\nCheaper price?\nFaster service?\nHigher quality?\n10 minutes: Discussion + Activity\n\nAsk: Keeping what we just talked about in mind, what are your value propositions? What is the promise of value you will deliver to your customers? The primary reason customers buy from you instead of your competitor?\nTake some time to think about the UVP, then have everyone share their answers.\nTrainer note: Make sure they are not just explaining their product, listing features, or creating a slogan.\n\nOther examples you can bring up if needed:\nNike offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, customization, and brand/status (https://www.cleverism.com/company/nike/).\nThe value proposition of MailChimp that they offer is simple, direct, and bold.\nApple's Iphone value proposition offers a unique experience\nUber's value proposition, offers uber convenience (https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples)\n11\n\nPOSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE:\n(Target Personas)\n(Product Name)\n(Category)\n(Key Customer Benefit)\n(Nearest Competitive Alternatives)\nIs the one\nthat\nunlike\nTO\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation of Positioning statement and difference from UVP\nYour Positioning statement is a way to take your UVP and engage your customers. You are speaking to them in this statement. \nThe UVP and positioning statements are rooted in a clear understanding of your customers and what drives them emotionally\nA UVP shows what differentiates your product from your competitors’ products/services and makes it special.\nYour positioning statement captures the space you want to own in your customer’s mind, based on the unique value that you can offer.\nIf sustainability is a part of your business model, your positioning statement can reflect that.\n Trainer Notes:\n Encourage participants to think about whether sustainability could be a key differentiator in their positioning.\n Sustainability-driven positioning can help businesses attract customers who prioritize eco-friendly products and responsible brands.\n\n\nTO environmentally conscious travelers, \u000b(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \u000boffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \u000bstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: TO environmentally conscious travelers, \n(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \noffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \nstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\n\n13\n\nTO all global travelers, (Tourism App) is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: To all global travelers, Tourism App is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\nTO, **(EcoJourney App)** is the one travel planning platform that connects you with authentic local experiences while minimizing environmental impact, unlike standard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism regardless of its effects. \n14\n\nMISSION & VALUES\nMISSION & VALUES: WHAT TRULY MATTERS\n\n10 minutes: Guided Reflection & Discussion\n\nAsk: \"Think about a time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you - when you felt like what you were doing really mattered. What was happening in that moment?\"\n\nFacilitate sharing of these moments, noting common themes on the board.\n\nFollow-up: \"What made these experiences meaningful? What conditions or situations created that sense of purpose?\"\n\nConnect to Mission & Values:\n- Mission is not about grand statements, but about creating the conditions for meaningful experiences\n- Values are not abstract words, but the lived priorities that show up in your meaningful moments\n- When your business creates these same meaningful conditions for customers, employees and communities, you build authentic connection\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia's mission \"We're in business to save our home planet\" emerged from the founder's meaningful experiences in nature\n- Their repair program came from valuing durability and reducing waste, not from selecting \"sustainability\" from a word list\n\nAsk: \"How might creating these meaningful conditions for others also create business advantages?\"\nPotential answers:\n- Customers who share these values become loyal advocates\n- Employees find deeper motivation beyond paychecks\n- Decision-making becomes clearer and more consistent\n- Resource efficiency happens naturally when you focus on what truly matters\n\nOriginal: [[[\u000b10 minutes: Discussion\n\nMission, vision, and values\nSo, what are mission, vision, and value statements? What is the difference between them? \nWrite out their thoughts on the board separating mission and values\nMission statement: A Mission statement describes why the organization exists and why it does what it does.\nUsually is bigger than the organization itself\nMany times mission is “unrealistic”\nCan also reflect environmental and social commitments (e.g., Patagonia’s mission: “We’re in business to save our home planet”).\n\nValue statement: A value statement describes and lists the fundamental values and principles that the organization operates by.\nCompany focused\nWhere you hope to see the business down the line\nProduct related\nCan highlight sustainability commitments (e.g., responsible sourcing, reducing waste, ethical labor practices).\n\nEntrepreneurs might bring up vision statements as well. A vision statement describes the ideal future state of the organization.  It articulates what the organization is trying to accomplish.\n\nAsk: Why is it important to have clearly defined mission, vision, and value statements? (Customers care about consistency, trust, and whether a business is ethical, efficient, or innovative.)\nHave a discussion and write down all the thoughts on the board.\nPotential answers:\nStay focused on what is really important,\nBusinesses should be able to clearly talk about what they are trying to achieve (on a grander scale),\nThey should have a statement to show why they exist,\nHaving a clear statement provides direction for employees and management, \nKeeps businesses accountable for their environmental and social impact.\nHelps brands build long-term customer loyalty by aligning with sustainability values.\nKeeps your business customer/solution oriented instead of just focusing on profits,\nCommunicate the company’s beliefs to employees, customers, partners, and the general public,\nEstablish an identity, start a corporate culture,\nAttract like-minded employees,\nAid in the decision-making process (use the mission to reflect on the companies greater goals),\nKeeps you thinking about the future (great leaders/organizations always are)!\n]]]\n15\n\n“We create happiness by providing the finest in entertainment for people of all ages, everywhere”\n“To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful”\n“Simplify life for people around the world”\nMISSION STATEMENTS:\n“We are synergizing green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues.”\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\n8 minutes: Mission statements\nAsk: Take a look at these famous company mission statements. What do you see among all of them? \nPotential answers:\nMany people might reiterate some points from before\nNone of these missions state the products/services they sell\nIt is the end goal for the customers\nThey fulfill their “why”, their purpose, through their products and services\n\n10-15 minutes: Activity\nWrite your mission! So, what is it that you want to accomplish? Don’t think about money, don’t think about sustainable answers, or anything else. If you could see a change in the world that is meaningful for you, what would that look like?\nHave a few people read out their missions if they want to\n\nOther examples of mission statements:\nAmazon's mission hints at its world-ruling ambitions: \"It's our goal to be Earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything online.“\nFacebook's mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.“\nUber has a simple, bold, mission: \"Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.“\nTwitter's mission is \"To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.“\nDropbox’s mission is to “simplify life for people around the world.\"\nKESK’s mission is to: “Synergize green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues”\n\nKESK Mission Reference: https://www.keskco.com/about\n16\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nActivity: What do you value?\nGive out the list of verbs\nEach entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\nGo around the room and ask how many people have circled\nSome people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\nSome people might have chosen almost all of them. In this case, point out that it is great to have so many values; however, it is hard for one business to represent them all.\nGive the entrepreneurs 3 more minutes to choose only five.\n 5 minutes: Add a verb to each\nExamples: Live adventurously, create curiosity, build independence, etc…\n\nMultiply, promote, act, find, search for, establish, think, listen, laugh, hold, encourage, have, be, practice, unite, \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nShould I pick my values or company values? As the founder of your company, your values should be intertwined with your company values to a degree. The leadership of your company should embody the mission and values your company projects to the world. \nCan this change? Yes it can change; however, try to think of long lasting values that will help shape your company and its culture. These values should last far into the future. If these values are not in line with your customers and their needs, you might face problems. \n17\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES:\nIntegrity\nResponsibility\nSustainability\nWe need to replace this - takes too long and is too abstract and will be hard for young first time entrepreneurs : [[[20 minutes: Facilitated Activity\n\nIntroduction: \"Instead of selecting values from a list, we'll discover them in your most meaningful experiences.\"\n\nStep 1: Meaningful Moments (5 min - Individual)\n- Write down 2-3 specific moments when your work felt most meaningful\n- What was happening? Who was involved? What made it matter?\n\nStep 2: Identify Underlying Values (5 min - Individual)\n- For each meaningful moment, ask: \"What made this situation important to me?\"\n- What conditions or qualities were present that created meaning?\n- What would someone watching notice you cared about?\n\nStep 3: Connect to Customer Experience (5 min - Individual)\n- How might your customers experience similar meaningful moments through your business?\n- What conditions can your business create that would matter to them in similar ways?\n\nStep 4: Small Group Sharing (5 min)\n- Share your meaningful moments and the values you discovered\n- Help each other identify authentic values you might have missed\n- Discuss how these values could shape business decisions\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n- Authentic values come from lived experience, not abstract words\n- The same meaning-creating conditions that matter to you will likely matter to others\n- These authentic values will inform both your mission and your unique value proposition\n- Values aren't just what you say, but how you make decisions when trade-offs arise\n]]]\n18\n\nCreating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome.\nActing with courage, challenging the status quo.\nBeing present, connecting with transparency, dignity and respect.\nWe are performance driven, through the lens of humanity.\n\n“To inspire and nurture the human spiritone person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time ”\nSTARBUCKS\n10 minutes: Discussion\n\nStarbucks example:\nLet’s take a look at Starbucks mission and value statements. \nHow do they live by these statements?\nIs this something that is just written in their documents, or do they live by this?\n19\n\nRefine your brand positioning statement based on your unique value proposition. \nRefine your mission and vision statements for your brand.\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n20\n\nTHANK YOU!\nAny Questions?\n21\n"

Currently, the approach seems overly prescriptive with values presented as a simple list selection (Innovation, Teamwork, Commitment, etc.). This doesn't help entrepreneurs connect authentically to what truly matters to them or their potential customers.\n\nHere's how you could improve this section to make the values process more meaningful:\n\n## Replace the Value List Selection with Meaningful Experience Exploration\n\nInstead of having entrepreneurs select from a predetermined list of values, guide them through a reflective process that helps them discover authentic values from their own meaningful experiences:\n\n1. **Begin with meaningful moments**: Ask participants to recall 2-3 specific moments when their work felt deeply meaningful - times when they felt their work truly mattered. Have them write these down in detail.\n\n2. **Extract what mattered**: For each meaningful moment, have them reflect on what specifically made it meaningful. What conditions were present? What was happening that created that sense of purpose?\n\n3. **Connect to customer experience**: Ask how their customers might experience similar meaningful moments through their business. What conditions can their business create that would matter to others?\n\n4. **Identify patterns**: Look across these reflections to identify recurring themes that represent their authentic values - not just words, but the actual conditions that create meaning.\n\n## Framework for the Exercise\n\nCreate a worksheet with prompts like:\n\n- \"Describe a specific time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you.\"\n- \"What specifically made this moment matter to you?\"\n- \"What would someone observing notice you cared about in this moment?\"\n- \"How might your customers experience something similarly meaningful through your business?\"\n\n## Facilitate Small Group Sharing\n\nAfter individual reflection, have entrepreneurs share in small groups to help each other identify values they might have missed and discuss how these authentic values could shape business decisions.\n\n## Connect to Business Advantage\n\nHelp entrepreneurs see how these authentic values create business advantages:\n- Customers who share these values become loyal advocates\n- Decision-making becomes clearer when based on what truly matters\n- Resource efficiency happens naturally when focusing on meaningful outcomes\n\n## Example to Share\n\nInstead of generic value examples, share a concrete story of how a successful business discovered their values through meaningful experiences:\n\n\"Patagonia's commitment to environmental sustainability didn't come from selecting values from a list - it emerged from the founder's meaningful experiences in nature and seeing environmental degradation firsthand. Their repair program came from valuing durability and reducing waste, not from selecting 'sustainability' from a word list.\"\n\nThis approach will help entrepreneurs develop values that are authentic, meaningful, and actually guide their business decisions, rather than just picking nice-sounding words from a predetermined list.",

What conditions can their business create that would matter to others?\n\n4. **Identify patterns**: Look across these reflections to identify recurring themes that represent their authentic values - not just words, but the actual conditions that create meaning.\n\n## Framework for the Exercise\n\nCreate a worksheet with prompts like:\n\n- \"Describe a specific time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you.\"\n- \"What specifically made this moment matter to you?\"\n- \"What would someone observing notice you cared about in this moment?\"\n- \"How might your customers experience something similarly meaningful through your business?\"\n\n## Facilitate Small Group Sharing\n\nAfter individual reflection, have entrepreneurs share in small groups to help each other identify values they might have missed and discuss how these authentic values could shape business decisions.\n\n## Connect to Business Advantage\n\nHelp entrepreneurs see how these authentic values create business advantages:\n- Customers who share these values become loyal advocates\n- Decision-making becomes clearer when based on what truly matters\n- Resource efficiency happens naturally when focusing on meaningful outcomes\n\n## Example to Share\n\nInstead of generic value examples, share a concrete story of how a successful business discovered their values through meaningful experiences:\n\n\"Patagonia's commitment to environmental sustainability didn't come from selecting values from a list - it emerged from the founder's meaningful experiences in nature and seeing environmental degradation firsthand. Their repair program came from valuing durability and reducing waste, not from selecting 'sustainability' from a word list.\"\n\nThis approach will help entrepreneurs develop values that are authentic, meaningful, and actually guide their business decisions, rather than just picking nice-sounding words from a predetermined list.",

Once that fundamental point is clear, then you can create all that other material to help you visualize your brand.\n1\n\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate.\n\nDefine your unique value proposition.\n\nWrite mission and vision statements for your brand. \n1 minute: Objectives\nUnderstand how to use your brand to communicate: You’ve gathered all this information, now we are going to try and define our business in a way that will resonate with your customer base.\nDefine your unique value proposition: Pinpoint the key area of your business that makes you unique.\nWrite your mission and vision statements for your business:  This is to have a clear written mission that is aligned with your brand. \n\n2\n\nBRAND CHAT\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: \"What brands do you connect with personally? What makes them meaningful to you?\"\nPotential Answers:\nSolve real problems in my life\nAlign with what matters to me\nHelp me live better according to my priorities\nFeel authentic and transparent\nUse resources efficiently in ways I respect\nFollow-Up: \"How do these meaningful connections benefit the business?\"\nPotential Answers:\nLoyal customers who spread the word\nLower marketing costs\nResilience against competition\n\nAsk: What are the different elements of a brand? What defines a brand? What do you think of when we talk about a brand?\nPotential answers:\nCreative elements (logo, colors, marketing, etc…)\nBig companies\nConsistency\nThe name of the market or product\nThe image that comes to mind when people interact with your brand\nGood quality, (or bad quality)\nUnique\nHas creative elements (logo, name, color or font scheme, etc…)\nA company’s environmental and social commitments\n Follow-up Question: How do you see sustainability influencing customer perceptions of a brand?\nSummary: A brand is more than logo and visuals—it's a relationship based on shared values and meaningful experiences. When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n\n3\n\nELEMENTS OF YOUR BRAND\n\nAsk: What are the different elements of a brand? What defines a brand?

When customers connect with your brand on a values level, they become advocates, reducing marketing costs and building resilience against market shifts.\n4\n\n“A brand is defined by a customers overall perception of your business.”\nWHAT IS THIS?\n8 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What does this apple mean? \nPotential answers:\nHigh quality\nProfessional\nHigh tech\nInternational\nIntelligence\nInnovation\nSteve Jobs\nI phone\nIOS\nExpensive\nMobile phones + other products like computers and tablets\nFun or games\nSneaky or annoying sometimes \nMoney driven company\nSecurity\nTrustworthy\n\nSummary: I showed you a picture of an apple, and so much came to your mind. You mentioned the products that Apple has, their founder, that they are expensive, you all have stories about this brand and feeling around it. I can show this picture to people all around the world, and there will probably be a similar response. That is a strong brand! \n\nAsk: Why is having a strong brand so important?\nPotential answers:\nIt is the identity of your business\nIt is how you will be remembered\nYou want a good brand identity, not a bad one!\nMaintaining a positive brand image is important because it will have a lasting impression on customers! They don’t forget easily and they have power!\nYou can sell a brand, not only a product\nThe strategy and actions of a business could be good or bad. These actions will define your brand and will make an impact over the next several years.\n\nRecap: Having a brand is really important for a business. It helps customers differentiate you from the competitors and remember you for what you are good at. What do we want our customers to think about when they interact with our products?\n\n\n\nWHAT IS A BRAND?\nQuality\nProducts and services\nCreative elements\nMessage\nA brand is consistent in its:\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: What is a brand\nLet people answer freely, then cover these points below as well: \nQuality: iPhones are great quality. We know this because it is consistently true. I would never buy an iPhone and question the quality of it. It is the same in every box in every country (unless it is a fake product). \nProducts and services: Apple is consistent in their products and services as well. They are a technology company. I know that they won’t be coming out with furniture or kitchenware. That would make for a very confusing brand. When creating a brand, make sure you are consistent in the things you offer as well.\nCreative elements: Commercials, marketing materials, office layout, website, Facebook, and more! Everything is in line with the same creative elements. There is a consistency with color and font schemes. Logos use and all creative elements are consistent. \nYou saw the Apple logo and knew what it was immediately. If someone took another icon of a fruit with a bite in it, many of us will think of Apple. That is a strong brand! \nMessage: Your message is consistent across all channels, internally, and externally. Whether it is your commercials, the writing on your packaging, blogs that you write, your company culture, or anything else, your message is clear and consistent. What is the problem you are solving? What does your business do? Make sure those things are clear.\n\nRecap: Apply your branding across your business and evolve it as you grow. As you grow and expand, you want to make it as easy as possible for people to know exactly what you do. If you do too much, or aren’t consistent in these points, you make it hard for people to recognize you out of the crowd.\n\n5 minutes: Brief activity\nFor each of the logos, discuss if they have a good brand or not. Try to touch on all of the four points mentioned on the slide.\n\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n10 minutes: Discussion + Exercise\n\nA value proposition is a promise of meaningful value that your business delivers better than alternatives. It answers: \"Why should people choose you?\"\n\nAsk: \"How do your authentic values create a unique advantage in the market?\"\nGuide discussion to explore:\n\n1. Intersection of Meaning\n   - What meaningful experiences do your customers seek?\n   - How do your authentic values help create those experiences?\n   - What meaningful difference does your solution make compared to alternatives?\n\n2. Business Advantages\n   - Does your values-aligned approach create efficiency advantages?\n   - Can your authentic values reduce costs or risks in ways competitors can't?\n   - Do shared values with customers create stronger loyalty and reduce marketing costs?\n\nExercise:\nComplete this sentence: \"Unlike our competitors, we _____________ because we genuinely value _____________.\"\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia: \"Unlike typical outdoor brands, we help you keep using what you already own because we genuinely value reducing environmental impact.\"\n- Warby Parker: \"Unlike traditional eyewear companies, we make prescription glasses accessible to more people because we genuinely value equal access to vision care.\"\n\n\u000bOriginal [[[5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat is a unique value proposition?\nPotential answers could be:\nSomething that makes you unique\nA clear statement to describe what you do\nThe key offerings of your business\nIt is the point that differentiates you from your competitors\nShows why your product is better than other in the market\n]]]\n7\n\n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you”\nUNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nState the definition of a value proposition and connect it to their ideas from before.\nAsk: \n How can we actually get to our unique value proposition? Does anyone have an idea? (What makes you stand out—whether it’s pricing, durability, or an extra benefit like helping customers save resources?) The answers here will frame the next slides.\nPotential answers:\nWe get it from our research\nUsers have to tell us\nWe have to look at what is already in the market\nLook at competitors to see what they are offering and what they are good at\nWe look at our business idea and what we are good at\nWe consider whether sustainability can be a unique differentiator (e.g., eco-friendly materials, ethical supply chains, low-carbon operations, waste reduction)\n\nFacilitator notes: When forming your UVP, weave in how your core values shape a unique experience. For example, if you value ‘transparency,’ emphasize user-friendly pricing or open communication as part of your UVP.\n\n Discussion Prompt: Could sustainability be a part of your Unique Value Proposition? If yes, how?\n\nRecap: Over the past month, you guys have been doing a ton of research. You have done a deep dive into the market to try to identify gaps and areas of opportunity. You now know 3 important factors needed to define our UVP:\nWhat you and your business are good at\nWhat the market wants and needs\nWhat competitors are offering\n Additional Consideration: Some businesses differentiate themselves by being the \"green alternative.\" Think about how sustainability could enhance your value proposition.\n\nYour business \nand what you \ndo well\nThe market \nand customers needs \n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo first there is you. You all came in here with business ideas and you want to see if there is a market for it. You have certain:\nCapabilities\nInterests\nInformation\nA business idea \nSkills\nExperience\n\nBut you also have the market. The market has:\nPeople with changing needs, wants, desires, frustrations, etc…\nThe market can be big or small\nYour market is where you can actually reach, so it can be limited geographically\nEtc…\n\nWhat we are searching for this month, is to see if people want your idea. Based on your capabilities of developing and delivering a product, will people want what you have? And the next question, is there enough people who want it? \nThrough the animation of the circles, show:\nThe more overlap between your business idea and the needs of the market means that there is more potential for your business to succeed. \nWhen there is a small overlap (a small number of people in the market interested in your idea), there is a smaller market potential. This could be considered a niche market.\nMake sure the size of the market is worth your time and energy! Ask yourself, “is this enough for me? Will I be satisfied from the returns of this market?”\n\nYour business \nand what you\ndo well\nThe market \nand customers\nneeds\nCompetitors\nUNIQUE \nVALUE PROPOSITION\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBut there is one more thing. The market also has something else, competitors! They:\nSell other things similar to yours\nServing your customers needs now!\nDon’t serve the needs of the whole market \nYou won’t ever have the whole market\n\nBecause not everyone's needs are being met. There is an opportunity to meet those customers needs and differentiate yourself from your competitors. \n\nAsk: Based on this visual, where should you focus your energy?\nOverlap between competitors and you: Don’t go here! The market doesn’t show any desire for these things! Don’t waste your energy or time.\nOverlap between competitors and market: You could try to go here, but it could be dangerous. You are competing with your competitors on something they are really good at, and you are not good at. You might be seen as a less desirable option to your customers. Or it will take some time to be a strong competitor.\nOverlap between the three circles: This is somehow the bare minimum. Customers want it, competitors do it, and you have the capabilities for it. You should probably be doing this too. \nOverlap between you and the market: This is where you will find your unique value proposition. Customers want it, but the competitors aren’t offering it! Here is where you can really add value and differentiate yourself from your competitors.\n\nWhy choose you?\n\nWHERE DO YOU CREATE UNIQUE VALUE?\nCheaper price?\nFaster service?\nHigher quality?\n10 minutes: Discussion + Activity\n\nAsk: Keeping what we just talked about in mind, what are your value propositions? What is the promise of value you will deliver to your customers? The primary reason customers buy from you instead of your competitor?\nTake some time to think about the UVP, then have everyone share their answers.\nTrainer note: Make sure they are not just explaining their product, listing features, or creating a slogan.\n\nOther examples you can bring up if needed:\nNike offers four primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, customization, and brand/status (https://www.cleverism.com/company/nike/).\nThe value proposition of MailChimp that they offer is simple, direct, and bold.\nApple's Iphone value proposition offers a unique experience\nUber's value proposition, offers uber convenience (https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples)\n11\n\nPOSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE:\n(Target Personas)\n(Product Name)\n(Category)\n(Key Customer Benefit)\n(Nearest Competitive Alternatives)\nIs the one\nthat\nunlike\nTO\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation of Positioning statement and difference from UVP\nYour Positioning statement is a way to take your UVP and engage your customers. You are speaking to them in this statement. \nThe UVP and positioning statements are rooted in a clear understanding of your customers and what drives them emotionally\nA UVP shows what differentiates your product from your competitors’ products/services and makes it special.\nYour positioning statement captures the space you want to own in your customer’s mind, based on the unique value that you can offer.\nIf sustainability is a part of your business model, your positioning statement can reflect that.\n Trainer Notes:\n Encourage participants to think about whether sustainability could be a key differentiator in their positioning.\n Sustainability-driven positioning can help businesses attract customers who prioritize eco-friendly products and responsible brands.\n\n\nTO environmentally conscious travelers, \u000b(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \u000boffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \u000bstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: TO environmentally conscious travelers, \n(EcoJourney App) is the travel platform that \noffers authentic local experiences while also protecting the environment unlike \nstandard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism.\n\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\n\n13\n\nTO all global travelers, (Tourism App) is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nGo over the example on the board, then let everyone practice\nExample: Tourism application\nUVP: Convenient and customizable \nPositioning Statement: To all global travelers, Tourism App is the one digital platform that builds the ideal travel experience based on your needs unlike any other tourism option.\n\nEveryone should create their positioning statement.\n1-2 people to share if they want\nTO, **(EcoJourney App)** is the one travel planning platform that connects you with authentic local experiences while minimizing environmental impact, unlike standard tourism platforms that prioritize mass tourism regardless of its effects. \n14\n\nMISSION & VALUES\nMISSION & VALUES: WHAT TRULY MATTERS\n\n10 minutes: Guided Reflection & Discussion\n\nAsk: \"Think about a time when your work felt deeply meaningful to you - when you felt like what you were doing really mattered. What was happening in that moment?\"\n\nFacilitate sharing of these moments, noting common themes on the board.\n\nFollow-up: \"What made these experiences meaningful? What conditions or situations created that sense of purpose?\"\n\nConnect to Mission & Values:\n- Mission is not about grand statements, but about creating the conditions for meaningful experiences\n- Values are not abstract words, but the lived priorities that show up in your meaningful moments\n- When your business creates these same meaningful conditions for customers, employees and communities, you build authentic connection\n\nFacilitator Note: When drafting your mission, don’t just think about ‘what problem you solve.’ Ask yourself why you care about this problem or market gap in the first place. Your mission should reflect both the change you want to create and the authentic values that motivate you to pursue it.\n\nExamples to share:\n- Patagonia's mission \"We're in business to save our home planet\" emerged from the founder's meaningful experiences in nature\n- Their repair program came from valuing durability and reducing waste, not from selecting \"sustainability\" from a word list\n\nAsk: \"How might creating these meaningful conditions for others also create business advantages?\"\nPotential answers:\n- Customers who share these values become loyal advocates\n- Employees find deeper motivation beyond paychecks\n- Decision-making becomes clearer and more consistent\n- Resource efficiency happens naturally when you focus on what truly matters\n\nOriginal: [[[\u000b10 minutes: Discussion\n\nMission, vision, and values\nSo, what are mission, vision, and value statements? What is the difference between them? \nWrite out their thoughts on the board separating mission and values\nMission statement: A Mission statement describes why the organization exists and why it does what it does.\nUsually is bigger than the organization itself\nMany times mission is “unrealistic”\nCan also reflect environmental and social commitments (e.g., Patagonia’s mission: “We’re in business to save our home planet”).\n\nValue statement: A value statement describes and lists the fundamental values and principles that the organization operates by.\nCompany focused\nWhere you hope to see the business down the line\nProduct related\nCan highlight sustainability commitments (e.g., responsible sourcing, reducing waste, ethical labor practices).\n\nEntrepreneurs might bring up vision statements as well. A vision statement describes the ideal future state of the organization.  It articulates what the organization is trying to accomplish.\n\nAsk: Why is it important to have clearly defined mission, vision, and value statements? (Customers care about consistency, trust, and whether a business is ethical, efficient, or innovative.)\nHave a discussion and write down all the thoughts on the board.\nPotential answers:\nStay focused on what is really important,\nBusinesses should be able to clearly talk about what they are trying to achieve (on a grander scale),\nThey should have a statement to show why they exist,\nHaving a clear statement provides direction for employees and management, \nKeeps businesses accountable for their environmental and social impact.\nHelps brands build long-term customer loyalty by aligning with sustainability values.\nKeeps your business customer/solution oriented instead of just focusing on profits,\nCommunicate the company’s beliefs to employees, customers, partners, and the general public,\nEstablish an identity, start a corporate culture,\nAttract like-minded employees,\nAid in the decision-making process (use the mission to reflect on the companies greater goals),\nKeeps you thinking about the future (great leaders/organizations always are)!\n]]]\n15\n\n“We create happiness by providing the finest in entertainment for people of all ages, everywhere”\n“To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful”\n“Simplify life for people around the world”\nMISSION STATEMENTS:\n“We are synergizing green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues.”\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\n8 minutes: Mission statements\nAsk: Take a look at these famous company mission statements. What do you see among all of them? \nPotential answers:\nMany people might reiterate some points from before\nNone of these missions state the products/services they sell\nIt is the end goal for the customers\nThey fulfill their “why”, their purpose, through their products and services\n\n10-15 minutes: Activity\nWrite your mission! So, what is it that you want to accomplish? Don’t think about money, don’t think about sustainable answers, or anything else. If you could see a change in the world that is meaningful for you, what would that look like?\nHave a few people read out their missions if they want to\n\nOther examples of mission statements:\nAmazon's mission hints at its world-ruling ambitions: \"It's our goal to be Earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything online.“\nFacebook's mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.“\nUber has a simple, bold, mission: \"Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.“\nTwitter's mission is \"To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.“\nDropbox’s mission is to “simplify life for people around the world.\"\nKESK’s mission is to: “Synergize green power and cloud computing technologies to build alternative energy projects and generate new revenues”\n\nKESK Mission Reference: https://www.keskco.com/about \n16\n\nDETERMINE YOUR CORE VALUES: \nALIGNING WHAT MATTERS TO YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS\nInnovation\nTeamwork\nCommitment\nRemember: Values are not just buzzwords. They should reflect what truly matters to you and how you want to impact your customers and community. A strong ‘why’ behind each value will help you make consistent, authentic decisions.\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nActivity: What do you value?\nGive out the list of verbs\nEach entrepreneur should take about 5 minutes to choose all of the verbs that represent their business,\nGo around the room and ask how many people have circled\nSome people will have few values chosen which shows that they might have a clear picture and a focus already\nSome people might have chosen almost all of them. In this case, point out that it is great to have so many values; however, it is hard for one business to represent them all.\nGive the entrepreneurs 3 more minutes to choose only five.\n 5 minutes: Add a verb to each\nExamples: Live adventurously, create curiosity, build independence, etc…\n\nMultiply, promote, act, find, search for, establish, think, listen, laugh, hold, encourage, have, be, practice, unite, \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nShould I pick my values or company values? As the founder of your company, your values should be intertwined with your company values to a degree. The leadership of your company should embody the mission and values your company projects to the world. \nCan this change? Yes it can change; however, try to think of long lasting values that will help shape your company and its culture. These values should last far into the future. If these values are not in line with your customers and their needs, you might face problems. \n\nFacilitator notes: Encourage participants to reflect on the real motivation behind each selected value. For instance, if they choose ‘Responsibility,’ ask: Which group or problem do you feel responsible for? or How does this value show up in the way you solve a customer’s challenge? This ensures the values aren’t just words but reflect genuine priorities that will guide decisions\n17\n\nDISCOVER YOUR AUTHENTIC VALUES\nWhat motivated you to start (or consider) this venture in the first place?\nWhich issues, people, or communities do you care about helping?\nHow do you want your customers, team, or community to feel when they interact with your business?\nStart with meaningful experiences, not abstract words\nWhich principles or standards do you refuse to compromise on, even if it means slower growth or higher costs?\nWe need to replace this - takes too long and is too abstract and will be hard for young first time entrepreneurs : [[[20 minutes: Facilitated Activity\n\nIntroduction: \"Instead of selecting values from a list, we'll discover them in your most meaningful experiences.\"\n\nStep 1: Meaningful Moments (5 min - Individual)\n- Write down 2-3 specific moments when your work felt most meaningful\n- What was happening?

The changes flow well with the rest of the presentation while making the process more authentic. Here's feedback on the revised slides with just a few high-leverage adjustments:\n\n## What Works Well\n- The new slide \"MISSION & VALUES: WHAT TRULY MATTERS\" (slide 14) with the guided reflection approach is excellent. It connects values to meaningful experiences.\n- Slide 17's revised title \"DISCOVER YOUR AUTHENTIC VALUES\" and the reflection questions are good improvements.\n- Slide 18's \"CONNECT VALUES TO BUSINESS ADVANTAGE\" shows the practical benefits of authentic values.\n- The additional facilitator notes throughout provide helpful context.\n\n## High-Leverage Adjustments\n\n1. **Slide 17: DISCOVER YOUR AUTHENTIC VALUES**\n   - The 5 questions might be overwhelming. Consider consolidating to 3 stronger questions:\n   - \"What motivated you to start this venture in the first place?\"\n   - \"Which principles do you refuse to compromise on, even if it costs more?\"\n   - \"How do you want people to feel when they interact with your business?\"\n\n2. **Slide 18: CONNECT VALUES TO BUSINESS ADVANTAGE**\n   - Add a brief concrete example under each benefit:\n   - Under \"Builds customer trust and loyalty\": \"Example: Patagonia's repair guarantee\"\n   - Under \"Creates resilient relationships\": \"Example: Local sourcing during supply chain disruptions\"\n   - Under \"Reduces costs and future risks\": \"Example: Energy efficiency reducing operating costs\"\n\n3. **Add a Simple Worksheet Activity**\n   - After slide 18, consider adding a very simple 5-minute exercise:\n   - \"Take 2 minutes: Write down one meaningful moment from your work\"\n   - \"Take 1 minute: What value was present in that moment?\"\n   - \"Take 2 minutes: Share with a partner how this value could shape a business decision\"\n\n4. **Slide 21: TIE-IN TO BUSINESS ETHICS**\n   - This feels disconnected. Either integrate it directly into slide 18 as a note about how values lead to the triple bottom line, or strengthen it with a clearer connection:\n   - \"Your authentic values naturally lead to ethical choices. In a later session, we'll explore how these same values guide sustainability commitments and long-term impact through the Triple Bottom Line framework of People, Planet, and Profit.\"\n\nThese targeted changes maintain your overall flow while making the values section even more practical and actionable for early-stage entrepreneurs.
