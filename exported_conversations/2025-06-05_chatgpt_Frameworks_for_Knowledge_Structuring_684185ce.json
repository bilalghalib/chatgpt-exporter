      "content": "Great questions, Bilal. You're tapping into a deep and often hidden layer of how knowledge is made actionable. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 **1. The Big Idea: Structuring Knowledge into Systems**\nThis is often called **\"framework thinking\"** or **\"mental models\"**—ways to *package, simplify, and apply* abstract ideas across situations. These are **schemas** (cognitive shortcuts), **frameworks** (decision support structures), or **ontologies** (formal conceptual mappings). The goal is to make insights:\n- Transferable  \n- Actionable  \n- Memorable  \n- Repeatable  \n\nThis idea underpins a huge chunk of how:\n- **Consultants (e.g., McKinsey, BCG)** help clients think and act  \n- **Therapists** help clients reframe and integrate emotions  \n- **Coaches** help clients gain clarity and take action  \n\n---\n\n### 🔹 **2. Common Frameworks by Field**\n\n#### 🧠 **Consulting (McKinsey, BCG, Bain)**\n\n| Name | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **MECE** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) | Break down problems without overlap or gaps |\n| **3 Horizons Model** | Manage short-, medium-, and long-term innovation |\n| **BCG Matrix** | Evaluate business units: Stars, Cash Cows, Dogs, etc. |\n| **Porter’s Five Forces** | Industry analysis and strategic positioning |\n| **SWOT Analysis** | Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats |\n| **Value Chain Analysis** | Understand where value is added across operations |\n| **McKinsey 7S** | Align structure, strategy, systems, shared values, etc. |\n| **Issue Trees / Logic Trees** | Break complex problems into structured questions |\n\n#### 🧠 **Therapy (CBT, ACT, etc.)**\n\n| Name | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **CBT Triangle** (Thoughts-Feelings-Behaviors) | Understand loops between thought, emotion, and action |\n| **ACT Hexaflex** | Promote psychological flexibility through 6 processes |\n| **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** | Map inner \"parts\" (managers, exiles, self) |\n| **Polyvagal Theory** | Map nervous system states to behavior and emotion |\n| **Attachment Theory** | Understand relational patterns and early bonding |\n| **Window of Tolerance** | Track emotional regulation bandwidth |\n| **Drama Triangle** | Identify victim–rescuer–persecutor dynamics |\n\n#### 🧠 **Coaching**\n\n| Name | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **GROW Model** (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) | Structure coaching conversations |\n| **Wheel of Life** | Assess balance across life domains |\n| **Ikigai** | Find personal meaning at the intersection of passion, mission, vocation, and profession |\n| **SMART Goals** | Define Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound goals |\n| **Ladder of Inference** | Understand how we move from observation to belief to action |\n| **Transactional Analysis (Ego States)** | Analyze adult–child–parent patterns in dialogue |\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 **3. What Are These Systems Called?**\n\nHere are some general categories:\n- **Frameworks**: High-level conceptual tools (e.g., SWOT, 7S)\n- **Models**: Representations of dynamic processes (e.g., CBT, Polyvagal)\n- **Mental Models**: Cognitive simplifications (e.g., First Principles Thinking)\n- **Ontologies**: Formalized taxonomies of knowledge (e.g., AIF, ICD codes)\n- **Maps**: Visual schemas showing relations (e.g., Value Stream Maps)\n- **Protocols / Toolkits**: Actionable step-by-step guides (e.g., Theory U, Liberating Structures)\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 **4. Repositories and Compendiums**\n\nThere isn’t one central open-source repository for all frameworks, but here are some good places:\n\n#### 📘 For Business & Strategy\n- [Strategy Tools.io](https://www.strategytools.io/)\n- [Board of Innovation’s Tool Library](https://www.boardofinnovation.com/tools/)\n- [Business Model Navigator](https://businessmodelnavigator.com/)\n- [Lucidity Strategy Templates](https://getlucidity.io/strategy-resources/)\n- [The Decision Lab – Mental Models](https://thedecisionlab.com/mental-models)\n\n#### 📘 For Coaching & Personal Growth\n- [Coaching Tools Company](https://www.thecoachingtoolscompany.com/)\n- [PositivePsychology.com tools](https://positivepsychology.com/tools/)\n- [Liberating Structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/)\n- [Visual Coaching Tools (XPLANE, Grove, etc.)](https://thegrove.com/)\n\n#### 📘 For Therapy & Mental Health\n- [Therapist Aid](https://www.therapistaid.com/)\n- [ACT Mindfully](https://www.actmindfully.com.au/)\n- [IFS Institute](https://ifs-institute.com/)\n- [Psychwire Courses and Tools](https://psychwire.com/)\n\n#### 📘 Meta Framework Libraries\n- [Mental Models from Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)\n- [The LUMEN Database](https://www.lumenlearning.com/) (learning sciences)\n- [AcaWiki](https://acawiki.org/) – summaries of academic papers, some frameworks\n- [Miroverse](https://miro.com/miroverse/) – visual frameworks for facilitation\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 **5. Want to Build Your Own?**\nYou’re already doing it. Taking your ideas (like Come Alive, Parliaments, etc.) and structuring them into repeatable, teachable formats puts you in the realm of **framework designers**. You could:\n- Create a framework canvas (like BMC or Theory U)\n- Write a protocol (like Liberating Structures)\n- Build a multi-model ecosystem (like Theory of Change + Behavioral loops)\n\nIf you'd like, I can help draft a **meta-framework** for your own systems, showing where they fit in this landscape.\n\nWould that be helpful? Or do you want to go deeper into one of the above categories?",

      "content": "Below are **three ultra-lean “meta–framework generators”** an LLM could apply to *any* conversation.  \nEach is intentionally parsimonious—only the minimum moving parts—yet still honors:\n\n* **Theory of Mind** → the model tracks what the user *seems* to believe, feel, and want.  \n* **Second-order cybernetics** → the observer (LLM) treats itself as *inside* the system and can tweak its own behaviour in real time.\n\nI illustrate each with snippets drawn from *our* dialogue (CAP /IAP, tensions, values realism, etc.) so you can see how they would self-instantiate.\n\n---\n\n## 1 Tension → Policy Loop (TPL)\n\n| Slot | Minimal contents the LLM must infer |\n|------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Tension** | A live friction the user names or displays (e.g. *“rich with ideas but no clear path”*) |\n| **Value signal** | The underlying “pull” exposed by that tension (*coherence, impact, beauty…*) |\n| **Policy** | A 1-sentence attentional stance that would ease the tension (*“Attend to one idea long enough to prototype a tiny test.”*) |\n\n**How the LLM generates it**\n\n1. **Pattern spotting** – scan the conversation for any sentence that signals frustration, desire, or excitement.  \n2. **Value inference** – map the tension to the value lexicon (a 50-item generic list is enough).  \n3. **Policy drafting** – turn value + tension into an “attention directive” starting with a plural noun phrase (your CAP style).  \n\n> *Example from us:*  \n> • Tension: “cycles of deep engagement and existential questioning.”  \n> • Value: “Meaningful impact.”  \n> • Policy: “Moments of existential doubt become prompts to pick one practical micro-experiment.”\n\n**Why it’s parsimonious** – three fields, one loop. Every new utterance either updates the tension, refines the value, or replaces the policy. No broader ontology needed.\n\n---\n\n## 2 3-Layer Reflective Stack (3LRS)\n\n| Layer | Question | Typical token size |\n|-------|----------|--------------------|\n| **Phenomena** | *“What is the user actually saying / doing?”* | Raw excerpts (small) |\n| **Interpretation** | *“What does that imply about their beliefs, feelings, aims?”* | One sentence per excerpt |\n| **Schema hint** | *“Which canonical framework could digest this?”* | Just a hashtag (e.g. `#GROW`, `#Polyvagal`) |\n\n**How the LLM generates it**\n\n1. For every user turn, store a *micro-row* with the three columns above.  \n2. When several rows share a hashtag, collapse them into a *candidate schema* and surface it:  \n   > “You’ve mentioned energy cycles, dopamine, and CAP/IAP—these cluster under **#Double-Loop Learning**.”  \n3. Offer the distilled schema back as a simple diagram or next-step prompt.\n\n**Why it’s parsimonious** – it never stores the full frameworks; it only stores a one-word pointer. Retrieval is lazy: the bulky model description is fetched *only if* the user wants to dive deeper.\n\n---\n\n## 3 Cybernetic Double-Loop Canvas (CDLC)\n\nA 2×2 matrix updated in real time:\n\n| | **Inner loop** (Conversation) | **Outer loop** (Meta-conversation) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Sense** | parse current user utterance | track drift from stated goals |\n| **Act** | reply | adjust style, pace, or tool use |\n\n**How the LLM generates it**\n\n1. **Sense (inner):** tokenize and summarise the latest message.  \n2. **Act (inner):** craft a content response.  \n3. **Sense (outer):** compare the last three tensions/values with the user’s declared objective (if any).  \n4. **Act (outer):** optionally *tell* the user: “I notice we’ve veered into ontology design—pull back to solar curriculum?” or silently change strategy.\n\nOnly four boxes are stored at any moment; older state is rolled into a tiny “trajectory” vector (e.g. *+2 alignment drift, –1 energy*).\n\n**Why it’s parsimonious** – second-order oversight is collapsed into a single binary decision each turn: *intervene / continue*. No complex memory tree.\n\n---\n\n### Do we need extra user data?\n\n* **Mandatory**: live conversation text (obviously).  \n* **Nice-to-have**:  \n  * a short *goal statement* (can be elicited on the fly),  \n  * a lightweight *value glossary* (the model can bootstrap from generic lists),  \n  * and, for richer ToM, recency-weighted mood/energy tags (easy to infer from sentiment).\n\nAnything beyond that (demographics, full biography) is optional—helpful for nuance, but not required for these minimalist engines.\n\n---\n\n#### Choosing among them\n\n| If you want… | Pick |\n|--------------|------|\n| Rapid, laser-focused reframes | **TPL** |\n| Semi-structured note-taking that surfaces *known* frameworks | **3LRS** |\n| Ongoing meta-guidance on process quality | **CDLC** |\n\nEach can be layered: start with TPL for micro-tensions, use 3LRS to slot emerging patterns into bigger ideas, and let CDLC keep the whole dialogue *self-steering* in real time.",

      "content": "Below are **three “meta-generators”** an LLM can run in real time to spit out *just-in-time* tools—­a SWOT here, an Ikigai variant there—purely from the flow of a chat.  \nEach pathway answers four questions:\n\n1. **What does the model watch for?**  \n2. **How does it choose / build a canvas?**  \n3. **What micro-steps does it show the user?**  \n4. **Why is it small yet still powerful?**\n\n---\n\n## 1 Pattern-to-Canvas Mapper (PCM)\n\n| Stage | What the LLM actually does |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| **Detect** | Scan each turn for *grammatical markers* of: • DESIRE (“I want…”) • BLOCK (“I can’t…”) • CONTEXT (“because…”, “when…”) |\n| **Classify** | Route the triad into one of six archetypal tensions (e.g. **Goal ↔ Reality** → GROW; **Strength ↔ Weakness** → SWOT; **Need ↔ Offer** → Value-Proposition Canvas). |\n| **Instantiate** | Pre-fill a 2-column canvas: left side = excerpts; right side = blank cells + guiding questions. |\n| **Deliver** | Offer the semi-filled canvas as Markdown or link to a whiteboard template. |\n\n**Why it works:**  \nA single lookup table (6 tensions → 6 canvases) is all that’s needed. No deep ontology—just natural-language triggers.\n\n---\n\n## 2 Micro-Module Recombinator (MMR)\n\n1. **Atom library**   \n   Keep ~30 Lego-sized “blocks”: *Stakeholder*, *Obstacle*, *Signal*, *Experiment*, *Metric*, etc.\n\n2. **Conversation tagging**   \n   The model tags sentences with those atoms on the fly (few-shot examples show it how).\n\n3. **Grammar of assembly**   \n   Three hard-coded blueprints:  \n   * • **Reflection Loop** = [Signal → Obstacle → Experiment] (creates a CBT-style chain)  \n   * • **Opportunity Map** = [Stakeholder → Need → Solution → Metric] (creates a Lean Canvas slice)  \n   * • **Growth Path** = [Vision → Goal → Milestone → Habit] (creates a SMART-Goal board)\n\n4. **Compose & surface**   \n   Whichever blueprint hits a 60 % fill rate first is surfaced—with blanks highlighted for the user to finish.\n\n**Why it works:**  \nThe atoms are *content-agnostic*; only the sequence changes. One atom bank fuels dozens of possible canvases.\n\n---\n\n## 3 Ontology-Prompt Synthesizer (OPS)\n\n*Leverages your CAP/IAP vibe and second-order cybernetics.*\n\n1. **Light ontology** – four verbs only: *Observe, Interpret, Decide, Act.*\n\n2. **Slot filling** – the LLM keeps a rolling window (last N user turns) and tries to fit snippets into those four verbs.\n\n3. **Vector similarity** – each classical framework is stored as a 4-verb fingerprint  \n   * • **SMART**  = Observe---, Interpret---, Decide✓, Act✓  \n   * • **Drama Triangle** = Observe✓, Interpret✓, Decide---, Act---  \n   * • **Business Model Canvas** = Observe✓, Interpret✓, Decide✓, Act✓\n\n   Compute cosine distance between the live chat vector and the library; pick the nearest match.\n\n4. **Hybridise on the fly** – if no match is closer than 0.7 similarity, auto-blend the two best hits and output a *new* 4-panel board.\n\n**Why it works:**  \nEverything—old or newly minted—reduces to the same four verbs, so comparison + hybridisation are trivial math.  \n\n---\n\n### Minimal user data needed\n\n* **Live text only** (*plus one optional prompt*: “What outcome feels most alive to you right now?”).  \n* Sentiment or biography are helpful but not essential—the generators rely on linguistic cues, not demographics.\n\n---\n\n### Which to choose?\n\n| If the chat is… | Use |\n|-----------------|-----|\n| Full of clear “want / obstacle / why” sentences | **PCM** – quickest direct mapping |\n| Fragmented brainstorms with loose ideas | **MMR** – snap together atomically |\n| Philosophical meta-talk or brand-new territory | **OPS** – match & remix deep structure |\n\nRun any of these behind the curtain and you can gift the user a *fresh, tailored framework* before they even ask, while still letting them steer the blanks that matter.",

Lightweight Pattern Matching\n\nUse GPT to tag conversation snippets with pre-defined labels\nMatch against a decision tree of framework templates\nPro: Fast, deterministic, explainable\nCon: Limited to your pre-built library\n\n2. Embedding-Based Synthesis\n\nEmbed both conversation and framework descriptions\nUse vector similarity to find/blend nearest frameworks\nPro: Can create novel hybrids\nCon: May produce incoherent Frankenstein frameworks\n\n3. Generative with Constraints\n\nUse structured prompting to have GPT design frameworks from scratch\nConstrain output with schemas (JSON Schema, Pydantic)\nPro: Maximum flexibility and contextual fit\nCon: Harder to ensure quality/coherence\n\nThe Critical Design Decisions\nWhen to surface a framework? This is like knowing when to offer someone a map versus letting them wander. I'd track:\n\nRepetition of key tensions\nExplicit requests for structure\nSigns of cognitive overload (scattered topics)\n\nHow specific vs. generic? The PCM approach in your document hits a sweet spot - it uses universal patterns (want/block/context) but fills them with user-specific content.\nWhat about framework fatigue? Nobody wants a new canvas every five minutes. I'd implement a cooldown period and variety requirements.\nThe Pushback You Asked For\nThe hardest part isn't the technical implementation - it's the framework ontology problem. How do you know when someone needs a SWOT versus an Ikigai? The document's approaches sidestep this by using meta-patterns, but that might produce tools that feel generic rather than insightful.\nAlso, there's a risk of solutionism - sometimes the best response to complexity isn't another framework but simply sitting with the mess a bit longer.\nA Hybrid Proposal\nCombine all three approaches from your document:\n\nUse PCM for quick pattern detection\nApply MMR for modular assembly\nValidate with OPS's four-verb structure\n\nThen add a fourth layer: user feedback loops. Let them rate/modify generated frameworks, creating a personalized library over time.\nWould you want to explore the implementation details of any particular component? The embedding strategy feels like it could make or break this whole system.RetryBGyou can't use their approaches and have to take a first principles approach to design 3 new ones? what are \"50 cannonical frameworks\"? that doesn't sound like it makes sense,EditDeconstructed framework concept and brainstormed first-principles approaches6sThe user is pushing back on my approach - they want me to think from first principles rather than building on the document's ideas. They're also questioning the \"50 canonical frameworks\" concept, which does sound arbitrary and poorly defined.\nI need to:\n\nStart completely fresh with first principles thinking\nDesign 3 genuinely new approaches\nBe more precise about what frameworks actually are and how to identify them\n\nLet me think about what the fundamental problem is:\n\nWe have conversations that contain implicit structure\nWe want to extract that structure and make it explicit/actionable\nThe structure should fit the conversation, not force the conversation into pre-existing boxes\n\nFirst principles questions:\n\nWhat makes something a \"framework\"?\nHow do humans naturally create frameworks?\nWhat are the minimal ingredients needed?\nYou're right - \"50 canonical frameworks\" is hand-wavy nonsense. Let me start from scratch.\nFirst Principles: What Even Is a Framework?\nA framework is just a structure that makes decisions easier. At minimum, it needs:\n\nSpaces (where you put things)\nRelationships (how those spaces connect)\nConstraints (what can/can't go where)\n\nThat's it. Everything else is decoration.\nThree Fresh Approaches\n1. Tension Field Mapping\nInstead of matching to pre-existing frameworks, map the actual forces in play:\npython# Core insight: Every conversation has opposing forces\n# Framework = making those forces visible + actionable\n\ndef extract_tensions(conversation):\n    # Find pairs of conflicting statements/desires\n    # \"I want X but Y\"\n    # \"When I do A, B happens instead\"\n    # \"X is important. Also Z is important.\" (where X and Z compete)\n    \n    return TensionGraph(nodes=entities, edges=conflicts)\nThe framework emerges from the tension pattern itself. Three tensions in a triangle? You get a stability diagram. Linear chain of tensions? You get a process map. Hub-and-spoke? You get a resource allocation tool.\n2. Verb-Object Crystallization\nFrameworks are really just recurring patterns of action. So extract those:\npython# What people DO + what they do it TO\nactions = extract_verbs(conversation)  # analyze, build, avoid, measure...\nobjects = extract_nouns(conversation)  # revenue, team, anxiety, customers...\n\n# The framework is the unique fingerprint of verb-object pairs\nif \"measure\" + multiple_objects:\n    generate_dashboard_framework()\nelif \"choose\" + mutually_exclusive_objects:\n    generate_decision_matrix()\nelif \"transform\" + staged_objects:\n    generate_pipeline_framework()\nNo predetermined frameworks - just physics. Certain verb patterns naturally crystallize into certain structural shapes.\n3. Recursive Chunking\nStart with the raw conversation and recursively ask: \"What would make this clearer?\"\nLevel 0: Raw conversation\nLevel 1: Group similar statements\nLevel 2: Find what questions each group answers\nLevel 3: Arrange questions in order of dependency\nLevel 4: That arrangement IS your framework\nExample:\n\nUser talks about struggling with prioritization\nChunks emerge: {current tasks}, {ideal outcomes}, {blockers}\nQuestions: \"What am I doing?\" \"What should I achieve?\" \"What stops me?\"\nDependency: Can't answer #2 without knowing #1\nFramework: A simple 3-column board with flow arrows\n\nWhy These Are Different\nNo framework library. The structure emerges from the conversation's physics, not from pattern matching.\nNo predetermined categories. The conversation tells you what kind of tool it needs.\nComposable, not monolithic. You might get weird hybrids that no consultant has named yet.\nThe Meta-Question You're Really Asking\nHow do we help an LLM recognize when a conversation needs structure versus when structure would kill it?\nMaybe that's the wrong question. Maybe it's: How do we make structure so lightweight that it never feels like structure?\nThink of it like crystallization - you're not imposing form, you're just lowering the activation energy for the form that wants to emerge anyway.\nWhat do you think - does this feel more honest to what you're trying to build?RetryBGa bit although it's helpful to have an output from a conversation that helps them feel like they made progress, for isntance this conversation might be interesting to populate into a few templates/frameworks/maps, etc review the original list of things and then let's think about how to generate one for this and reverse enegineer the processEditMapped frameworks to conversation, explored generation strategies7sThe user wants me to:\n\nReview the original list of frameworks from the document\nApply some of those frameworks to our current conversation about framework generation\nReverse engineer how we got there\n\nLet me look at the key frameworks mentioned:\n\nConsulting: MECE, BCG Matrix, Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, Value Chain, McKinsey 7S, Issue Trees\nTherapy: CBT Triangle, ACT Hexaflex, IFS, Polyvagal Theory, Attachment Theory, Window of Tolerance, Drama Triangle\nCoaching: GROW Model, Wheel of Life, Ikigai, SMART Goals, Ladder of Inference, Transactional Analysis\n\nNow thinking about our conversation - we've discussed:\n\nThe problem of generating frameworks dynamically\nTension between pre-built vs emergent structures\nTechnical implementation approaches\nThe meta-question of when structure helps vs hinders\n\nThis could map to several frameworks...Looking at our conversation, I can see several frameworks trying to emerge. Let me populate a few and then reverse-engineer how we got there.\nFramework 1: Innovation Matrix (BCG-style)\n                High Novelty\n                     |\n    [Tension Field] | [Recursive \n      Mapping]      | Chunking]\n    ----------------+-----------------\n    [Pattern       | [Embed & \n     Matching]     | Synthesize]\n                     |\n                Low Novelty\n\n    Simple <----Implementation----> Complex\nOur approaches naturally sorted into quadrants based on technical complexity vs. novelty of output.\nFramework 2: Build-Measure-Learn Loop (Lean Canvas slice)\nBUILD               MEASURE           LEARN\n---------           ---------         ---------\n- Parser            • Pattern         • \"50 frameworks\"\n- Embeddings          density           is nonsense\n- Templates         • User rating     • Need emergence\n                    • Coherence         not matching\n                      score           • Verb-object \n                                       patterns matter\nOur conversation naturally followed this cycle - you built ideas, I measured them against reality, we learned and pivoted.\nFramework 3: Problem-Solution Fit Canvas\nPROBLEM SPACE                    SOLUTION SPACE\n-----------------               ------------------\nExisting Pain:                  Core Insight:\n\"Frameworks feel generic\"       \"Let structure emerge\"\n\nRoot Cause:                     Key Features:\n\"Pattern matching to            • Tension mapping\npre-built library\"             • Verb crystallization\n                               • Recursive chunking\n\nConsequences:                   Success Metrics:\n\"Solutionism\"                  \"Feels natural\"\n\"Framework fatigue\"            \"Actually helpful\"\nThe Reverse Engineering\nHere's what actually happened:\n\nComplaint-driven discovery: You pushed back on \"50 canonical frameworks\" → revealed the real problem\nConceptual forking: Each time I proposed something, you found the flaw → forced new branches\nConvergence through metaphor: \"Jazz musician,\" \"crystallization\" → these gave us shared language\n\nThe framework emerged because we had:\n\nTension (your pushback vs. my proposals)\nIteration (multiple rounds of refinement)\nConcrete examples (the code snippets grounded abstract ideas)\n\nMeta-Framework for Our Framework Generator\nINPUTS                  PROCESS              OUTPUTS\n---------              ---------            ---------\nConversation     →     1.

When we talked about opposing approaches, a 2x2 matrix appeared. When we discussed iteration, a loop emerged.\nSo maybe the generator should work like this:\npythondef generate_framework(conversation):\n    # Don't ask \"which framework fits?\"\n    # Ask \"what shape is this conversation?\"\n    \n    shape = identify_conversational_geometry(conversation)\n    # Shapes: opposing_pairs, sequential_flow, \n    #         hub_and_spoke, nested_hierarchy\n    \n    container = create_minimal_container(shape)\n    # Just enough structure to hold the content\n    \n    populated = fill_with_actual_quotes(container, conversation)\n    # Their words, not abstract labels\n    \n    return (container, populated, next_prompt)\nWant to try generating one more framework from our conversation? I'm curious what emerges if we focus on the learning journey aspect - how you went from \"generate frameworks\" to \"emergence over matching.\"RetryBGshould we have a list of frameworks to start with that matches different kinds of shapes? what could be a good list, what are the different domains, and the highest usefulness structures we can list, make at least 7 domains with at least 20 \n* Frameworks: High-level conceptual tools (e.g., SWOT, 7S)\n* Models: Representations of dynamic processes (e.g., CBT, Polyvagal)\n* Mental Models: Cognitive simplifications (e.g., First Principles Thinking)\n* Ontologies: Formalized taxonomies of knowledge (e.g., AIF, ICD codes)\n* Maps: Visual schemas showing relations (e.g., Value Stream Maps)\n* Protocols / Toolkits: Actionable step-by-step guides (e.g., Theory U, Liberating Structures)\n* In eachEditStrategized comprehensive framework list across diverse knowledge domains.6sThe user wants me to create a comprehensive list of frameworks/models/etc. across at least 7 domains, with at least 20 items per domain. They've given me 6 categories of tools to include in each domain:\n\nFrameworks\nModels\nMental Models\nOntologies\nMaps\nProtocols/Toolkits\n\nI need to think about what domains would be most useful and then populate each with high-utility structures across these categories. Let me think about domains that would cover a good range:\n\nBusiness Strategy & Operations\nPersonal Development & Productivity\nSoftware Development & Technology\nPsychology & Therapy\nEducation & Learning\nSystems Thinking & Complexity\nCommunication & Relationships\nFinance & Economics\nHealth & Wellness\nCreative Process & Innovation\n\nI'll pick 7 of these and aim for 20+ items each, distributed across the 6 categories.Looking at this challenge, I'll create a \"shape library\" - but let's be honest about what we're doing.

we can add `ModeledPerspective` later if multi-agent reasoning becomes central.\n\n---\n\n## 5 Sanity-check vs. your goals\n\n| Goal you stated                | Supported?  | Mechanism                           |\n| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| Map concepts, claims, insights | ✅           | `Concept`, `Claim`, `Insight`       |\n| Track CAPs & values            | ✅           | `CAP`, `Value + constitutedBy`      |\n| Surface blind-spots            | ✅           | 11 SKOS occlusion types + `reveals` |\n| Follow problems → solutions    | ✅           | `Problem`, `Solution`, `addresses`  |\n| Record & evolve work items     | ✅           | `Capture`, `progress`, `transforms` |\n| Compare perspectives / ToM     | ✅ (minimal) | `Perspective`, `PhilosophyStack`    |\n\n---\n\n## 6 Next micro-iterations\n\n1. **Load v 3.0** into a triplestore (Fuseki or GraphDB).\n2. Add 20–30 sample triples from one transcript.\n3. Run SPARQL like:\n\n```sparql\n# surfacing unseen scale occlusions\nSELECT ?gap WHERE {\n  ?gap a pgo:ScaleOcclusion .\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?insight pgo:reveals ?gap }\n}\n```\n\n4. Whatever feels clumsy → we add or rename in v 3.1.\n\nPing me when you hit the first friction point, and we’ll tighten further.",

Fill cells ➜ save as `FrameworkCapture`, link to Problems / CAPs via existing verbs.  \n5. If user edits the canvas later, log a new `pgo:Action` that **transforms** the previous capture into a new one (`pgo:progress` can track % completeness).\n\n---\n\n### 5 Why this fits the cybernetic loop\n\n* **Reference** – the template itself (`FrameworkTemplate`).  \n* **Action** – the generation & filling activities.  \n* **State** – the evolving `FrameworkCapture`.  \n* **Feedback** – Insights that the canvas **generates** or Occlusions it **reveals**.  \n\nEverything stays inside the nine core classes and eight verbs; you only add *two* subclasses and *zero* new properties. Frameworks become first-class citizens—queryable, versionable, and composable with CAPs, Values, and Problems—without bloating the ontology.",
