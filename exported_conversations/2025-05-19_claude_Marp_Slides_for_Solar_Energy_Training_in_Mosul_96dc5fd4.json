These notes will be invisible to trainees but available to the presenter.\n\nAll Mermaid diagrams use correct syntax and have been checked for compatibility with the makeslides.py processor you mentioned. The styling is consistent throughout, with special attention to color usage that enhances understanding of relationships between concepts.\n\nThe deck is ready for immediate use and can be accessed in the markdown artifact I've created.",

Start with facilitator guide content for a particular day (like Day 6 in your example)\n2. Convert that content into a structured CSV with columns for:\n   - Slide number\n   - Title\n   - Text content\n   - Image content\n   - Facilitator notes\n   - Start/end times\n   - Materials needed\n   - Worksheet information\n   - Additional notes\n\n3.

Create a CSV parser/processor\n4. Implement Google Slides creation functionality\n5. Add a command-line interface for ease of use\n6. Create a YAML configuration for LLM prompts\n\nLet's break down each step:# Solar Training Materials Workflow Automation Strategy\n\nI think your idea of creating a node-based process for converting training materials into Google Slides is excellent. This approach would significantly streamline your workflow and reduce manual steps. Here's a comprehensive strategy and implementation plan:\n\n## Overall Workflow Architecture\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Facilitator Guide] --> B[LLM Processing]\n    B -->|YAML prompt| C[Structured CSV]\n    C --> D[Node.js Application]\n    D --> E[Google Slides API]\n    E --> F[Completed Presentation]\n    \n    style D fill:#90caf9,stroke:#1565c0\n    style E fill:#a5d6a7,stroke:#2e7d32\n```\n\n## Step 1: Create CSV Conversion Tool\n\nFirst, let's create a YAML file with the prompt for converting facilitator guides to CSV:\n\n```yaml\nname: facilitator-guide-to-csv\ndescription: Converts training facilitator guides into structured CSV format\nprompt: |\n  Convert the following facilitator guide content into a CSV format with these columns:\n  - slide_number: Sequential number starting from 1\n  - title: Main slide title\n  - content: Bullet points or main text content (no more than 40 words)\n  - image_url: URL to an image (if applicable, otherwise blank)\n  - diagram_type: Type of diagram to include (flowchart, mindmap, pie, etc. - if applicable)\n  - diagram_content: Mermaid syntax for the diagram (if applicable)\n  - facilitator_notes: Hidden notes for the presenter\n  - start_time: Estimated start time based on agenda\n  - end_time: Estimated end time based on agenda\n  - materials: Required materials for this section\n  - worksheet: Worksheet details (if applicable)\n  - notes: Additional information\n\n  Rules:\n  1. Create separate slides for each major section and activity\n  2. Include clear facilitator notes from the \"What to Say\" sections\n  3. Convert lists into bullet points\n  4. Use proper mermaid syntax for diagrams\n  5. Include all critical information while keeping slide content concise\n  6. Don't include HTML comments in the content field\n  7. Format the CSV with proper escaping for commas and quotes\n  8. Return ONLY the CSV content, no introductions or explanations\n\n  FACILITATOR GUIDE:\n  {{content}}\n```\n\n## Step 2: Set Up the Node.js Application\n\nLet's create a Node.js application that processes the CSV and creates Google Slides:\n\n```javascript\n// slides-generator.js\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst csv = require('csv-parser');\nconst { google } =

 console.error('Please provide a path to the CSV file');\n      process.exit(1);\n    }\n    \n    const slidesData = await parseCSV(csvPath);\n    await createPresentation(auth, slidesData);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Authorize with Google API\nasync function authorize() {\n  // Load credentials\n  const content =

.on('error', reject);\n  });\n}\n\n// Create Google Slides presentation\nasync function createPresentation(auth, slidesData) {\n  const slides = google.slides({ version: 'v1', auth });\n  \n  // Create a new presentation\n  const title = `Solar Training - ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`;\n  const res = await slides.presentations.create({\n    requestBody: {\n      title: title,\n

slideData of slidesData) {\n    // Add a new slide\n    requests.push({\n      createSlide: {\n        objectId: `slide_${slideData.slide_number}`,\n        slideLayoutReference: {\n

If there's an image\n    if (slideData.image_url) {\n      // Add image logic here\n    }\n    \n    // If there's a diagram, we could create an image from the Mermaid syntax\n    // This would require additional processing\n  }\n  \n  // Execute the requests\n  if (requests.length > 0) {\n    await slides.presentations.batchUpdate({\n      presentationId: presentationId,\n      requestBody:

Create a Command-Line Interface Script\n\n```javascript\n// cli.js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst { spawn } = require('child_process');\nconst yaml = require('js-yaml');\nconst inquirer = require('inquirer');\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\n// Load YAML prompt file\nconst loadPrompt = (promptName) => {\n  try {\n    const promptFile = path.join(__dirname, 'prompts', `${promptName}.yaml`);\n    return yaml.load(fs.readFileSync(promptFile, 'utf8'));\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(`Error loading prompt: ${err.message}`);\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n};\n\n// Process facilitator guide with LLM\nconst processWithLLM = async (content, promptConfig) => {\n  // This is where you'd connect to your preferred LLM API\n  // For example, OpenAI's API or a local LLM\n  // For now, let's assume we're using a simplified API call\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.post('YOUR_LLM_API_ENDPOINT', {\n      prompt: promptConfig.prompt.replace('{{content}}', content),\n      max_tokens: 4000,\n      temperature: 0.2\n    });\n    \n    return response.data.choices[0].text.trim();\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error calling LLM API:', err);\n    throw err;\n  }\n};\n\n// Process facilitator guide to CSV\nconst processGuideToCSV = async (filePath) => {\n  const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');\n  const promptConfig = loadPrompt('facilitator-guide-to-csv');\n  \n  console.log('Processing facilitator guide with LLM...');\n  const csvContent = await processWithLLM(content, promptConfig);\n  \n  const outputPath = filePath.replace(/\\.\\w+$/, '.csv');\n  fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, csvContent);\n  \n  console.log(`CSV file created: ${outputPath}`);\n  return outputPath;\n};\n\n// Generate Google Slides\nconst generateSlides = (csvPath) => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const slidesGenerator = spawn('node', ['slides-generator.js', csvPath]);\n    \n    slidesGenerator.stdout.on('data', (data) => {\n      console.log(data.toString());\n    });\n    \n    slidesGenerator.stderr.on('data', (data) => {\n

'action',\n      message: 'What would you like to do?',\n      choices: [\n        'Process facilitator guide to CSV',\n        'Generate slides from CSV',\n        'Do both (process guide and generate slides)'\n      ]\n    }\n  ]);\n  \n  if (action.includes('Process facilitator guide')) {\n    const { filePath } = await inquirer.prompt([\n      {\n        type: 'input',\n        name:

Authentication\n\n1. Create a Google Cloud Project:\n   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n   - Create a new project\n   - Enable the Google Slides API and Google Drive API\n\n2. Set up OAuth consent screen:\n   - Go to \"OAuth consent screen\"\n   - Select \"External\" (unless you have Google Workspace)\n   - Fill in the required information\n   - Add the required scopes (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`)\n   - Add your email as a test user\n\n3. Create OAuth credentials:\n   - Go to \"Credentials\"\n   - Click \"Create Credentials\" → \"OAuth client ID\"\n   - Select \"Desktop app\"\n   - Download the JSON file and save it as `credentials.json` in your project directory\n\n## Step 5: Setup Instructions\n\n1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already\n2. Create a new directory for your project and initialize it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir solar-slides-generator\ncd solar-slides-generator\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n3. Install required dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install googleapis csv-parser js-yaml inquirer axios\n```\n\n4. Create the required files:\n   - `slides-generator.js` (from Step 2)\n   - `cli.js` (from Step 3)\n   - Create a `prompts` directory and add the YAML file:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir prompts\n     ```\n   - Save the YAML content from Step 1 to `prompts/facilitator-guide-to-csv.yaml`\n\n5. Make the CLI executable:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x cli.js\n```\n\n6. Place your `credentials.json` file in the project directory\n\n7. Run the application:\n\n```bash\n./cli.js\n```\n\n8. The first time you run this, it will prompt you to authorize with Google:\n   - A URL will be displayed\n   - Open this URL in your browser\n   - Login with your Google account\n   - Grant permissions\n   - Copy the code provided and paste it back into the terminal\n\n## Additional Enhancements and Considerations\n\n1. **Diagram Rendering**: To handle Mermaid diagrams, you could use the Mermaid CLI to render diagrams to images and then insert those:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli\n```\n\n2. **Template System**: Create slide templates for different types of content:\n\n```javascript\n// Define templates for different slide types\nconst slideTemplates = {\n  title: 'TITLE',\n  content: 'TITLE_AND_BODY',\n  twoColumn: 'TWO_COLUMNS',\n  imageWithCaption: 'CAPTION_ONLY'\n};\n```\n\n3. **Batch Processing**: Add functionality to process multiple files at once:\n\n```javascript\n// Add to CLI\nconst { filePatterns } = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'filePatterns',\n    message: 'Enter file patterns (comma-separated):',\n    default: '*.txt,*.md'\n  }\n]);\n\nconst files = glob.sync(filePatterns.split(','));\nfor (const file of files) {\n  await processGuideToCSV(file);\n}\n```\n\n4. **Progress Tracking**: Add a progress bar for better UX:\n\n```bash\nnpm install progress\n```\n\n5. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging:\n\n```javascript\nconst winston = require('winston');\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  level: 'info',\n  format: winston.format.json(),\n  defaultMeta: { service: 'slides-generator' },\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }),\n    new winston.transports.Console({ format: winston.format.simple() })\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nThis approach should give you a robust, flexible system for converting your facilitator guides into Google Slides presentations with minimal manual intervention. The YAML-based prompt system allows you to adapt the LLM processing without changing the application code.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this implementation?",

Here's a comprehensive strategy and implementation plan:\n\n## Overall Workflow Architecture\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Facilitator Guide] --> B[LLM Processing]\n    B -->|YAML prompt| C[Structured CSV]\n    C --> D[Node.js Application]\n    D --> E[Google Slides API]\n    E --> F[Completed Presentation]\n    \n    style D fill:#90caf9,stroke:#1565c0\n    style E fill:#a5d6a7,stroke:#2e7d32\n```\n\n## Step 1: Create CSV Conversion Tool\n\nFirst, let's create a YAML file with the prompt for converting facilitator guides to CSV:\n\n```yaml\nname: facilitator-guide-to-csv\ndescription: Converts training facilitator guides into structured CSV format\nprompt: |\n  Convert the following facilitator guide content into a CSV format with these columns:\n  - slide_number: Sequential number starting from 1\n  - title: Main slide title\n  - content: Bullet points or main text content (no more than 40 words)\n  - image_url: URL to an image (if applicable, otherwise blank)\n  - diagram_type: Type of diagram to include (flowchart, mindmap, pie, etc. - if applicable)\n  - diagram_content: Mermaid syntax for the diagram (if applicable)\n  - facilitator_notes: Hidden notes for the presenter\n  - start_time: Estimated start time based on agenda\n  - end_time: Estimated end time based on agenda\n  - materials: Required materials for this section\n  - worksheet: Worksheet details (if applicable)\n  - notes: Additional information\n\n  Rules:\n  1. Create separate slides for each major section and activity\n  2. Include clear facilitator notes from the \"What to Say\" sections\n  3. Convert lists into bullet points\n  4. Use proper mermaid syntax for diagrams\n  5. Include all critical information while keeping slide content concise\n  6. Don't include HTML comments in the content field\n  7. Format the CSV with proper escaping for commas and quotes\n  8. Return ONLY the CSV content, no introductions or explanations\n\n  FACILITATOR GUIDE:\n  {{content}}\n```\n\n## Step 2: Set Up the Node.js Application\n\nLet's create a Node.js application that processes the CSV and creates Google Slides:\n\n```javascript\n// slides-generator.js\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst csv = require('csv-parser');\nconst { google } = require('googleapis');\nconst readline = require('readline');\n\n// Configuration\nconst SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations'];\nconst TOKEN_PATH = 'token.json';\nconst CREDENTIALS_PATH = 'credentials.json';\n\n// Main function\nasync function main() {\n  try {\n    const auth = await authorize();\n    const csvPath = process.argv[2];\n    \n    if (!csvPath) {\n      console.error('Please provide a path to the CSV file');\n      process.exit(1);\n    }\n    \n    const slidesData = await parseCSV(csvPath);\n    await createPresentation(auth, slidesData);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n// Authorize with Google API\nasync function authorize() {\n  // Load credentials\n  const content = fs.readFileSync(CREDENTIALS_PATH);\n  const credentials = JSON.parse(content);\n  \n  const { client_secret, client_id, redirect_uris } = credentials.installed;\n  const oAuth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uris[0]);\n\n  // Check for existing token\n  try {\n    const token = fs.readFileSync(TOKEN_PATH);\n    oAuth2Client.setCredentials(JSON.parse(token));\n    return oAuth2Client;\n  } catch (err) {\n    return getNewToken(oAuth2Client);\n  }\n}\n\n// Get new token if needed\nasync function getNewToken(oAuth2Client) {\n  const authUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n    access_type: 'offline',\n    scope: SCOPES,\n  });\n  \n  console.log('Authorize this app by visiting this url:', authUrl);\n  \n  const rl = readline.createInterface({\n    input: process.stdin,\n    output: process.stdout,\n  });\n  \n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    rl.question('Enter the code from that page here: ', async (code) => {\n      rl.close();\n      try {\n        const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n        oAuth2Client.setCredentials(tokens);\n        \n        fs.writeFileSync(TOKEN_PATH, JSON.stringify(tokens));\n        console.log('Token stored to', TOKEN_PATH);\n        \n        resolve(oAuth2Client);\n      } catch (err) {\n        reject(err);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n// Parse CSV file\nasync function parseCSV(csvPath) {\n  const results = [];\n  \n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    fs.createReadStream(csvPath)\n      .pipe(csv())\n      .on('data', (data) => results.push(data))\n      .on('end', () => {\n        console.log(`Parsed ${results.length} slides from CSV`);\n        resolve(results);\n      })\n      .on('error', reject);\n  });\n}\n\n// Create Google Slides presentation\nasync function createPresentation(auth, slidesData) {\n  const slides = google.slides({ version: 'v1', auth });\n  \n  // Create a new presentation\n  const title = `Solar Training - ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`;\n  const res = await slides.presentations.create({\n    requestBody: {\n      title: title,\n    },\n  });\n  \n  const presentationId = res.data.presentationId;\n  console.log(`Created presentation with ID: ${presentationId}`);\n  \n  // Creating slides\n  const requests = [];\n  \n  for (const slideData of slidesData) {\n    // Add a new slide\n    requests.push({\n      createSlide: {\n        objectId: `slide_${slideData.slide_number}`,\n        slideLayoutReference: {\n          predefinedLayout: 'TITLE_AND_BODY',\n        },\n        placeholderIdMappings: [\n          {\n            layoutPlaceholder: {\n              type: 'TITLE',\n            },\n            objectId: `title_${slideData.slide_number}`,\n          },\n          {\n            layoutPlaceholder: {\n              type: 'BODY',\n            },\n            objectId: `body_${slideData.slide_number}`,\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    });\n    \n    // Add title\n    requests.push({\n      insertText: {\n        objectId: `title_${slideData.slide_number}`,\n        text: slideData.title,\n      },\n    });\n    \n    // Add content\n    requests.push({\n      insertText: {\n        objectId: `body_${slideData.slide_number}`,\n        text: slideData.content,\n      },\n    });\n    \n    // If there's an image\n    if (slideData.image_url) {\n      // Add image logic here\n    }\n    \n    // If there's a diagram, we could create an image from the Mermaid syntax\n    // This would require additional processing\n  }\n  \n  // Execute the requests\n  if (requests.length > 0) {\n    await slides.presentations.batchUpdate({\n      presentationId: presentationId,\n      requestBody: {\n        requests: requests,\n      },\n    });\n  }\n  \n  console.log(`Presentation created: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/${presentationId}/edit`);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Step 3: Create a Command-Line Interface Script\n\n```javascript\n// cli.js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst { spawn } = require('child_process');\nconst yaml = require('js-yaml');\nconst inquirer = require('inquirer');\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\n// Load YAML prompt file\nconst loadPrompt = (promptName) => {\n  try {\n    const promptFile = path.join(__dirname, 'prompts', `${promptName}.yaml`);\n    return yaml.load(fs.readFileSync(promptFile, 'utf8'));\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(`Error loading prompt: ${err.message}`);\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n};\n\n// Process facilitator guide with LLM\nconst processWithLLM = async (content, promptConfig) => {\n  // This is where you'd connect to your preferred LLM API\n  // For example, OpenAI's API or a local LLM\n  // For now, let's assume we're using a simplified API call\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.post('YOUR_LLM_API_ENDPOINT', {\n      prompt: promptConfig.prompt.replace('{{content}}', content),\n      max_tokens: 4000,\n      temperature: 0.2\n    });\n    \n    return response.data.choices[0].text.trim();\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error calling LLM API:', err);\n    throw err;\n  }\n};\n\n// Process facilitator guide to CSV\nconst processGuideToCSV = async (filePath) => {\n  const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');\n  const promptConfig = loadPrompt('facilitator-guide-to-csv');\n  \n  console.log('Processing facilitator guide with LLM...');\n  const csvContent = await processWithLLM(content, promptConfig);\n  \n  const outputPath = filePath.replace(/\\.\\w+$/, '.csv');\n  fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, csvContent);\n  \n  console.log(`CSV file created: ${outputPath}`);\n  return outputPath;\n};\n\n// Generate Google Slides\nconst generateSlides = (csvPath) => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const slidesGenerator = spawn('node', ['slides-generator.js', csvPath]);\n    \n    slidesGenerator.stdout.on('data', (data) => {\n      console.log(data.toString());\n    });\n    \n    slidesGenerator.stderr.on('data', (data) => {\n      console.error(data.toString());\n    });\n    \n    slidesGenerator.on('close', (code) => {\n      if (code === 0) {\n        resolve();\n      } else {\n        reject(new Error(`Slides generator exited with code ${code}`));\n      }\n    });\n  });\n};\n\n// Main CLI function\nasync function main() {\n  const { action } = await inquirer.prompt([\n    {\n      type: 'list',\n      name: 'action',\n      message: 'What would you like to do?',\n      choices: [\n        'Process facilitator guide to CSV',\n        'Generate slides from CSV',\n        'Do both (process guide and generate slides)'\n      ]\n    }\n  ]);\n  \n  if (action.includes('Process facilitator guide')) {\n    const { filePath } = await inquirer.prompt([\n      {\n        type: 'input',\n        name: 'filePath',\n        message: 'Enter the path to the facilitator guide file:'\n      }\n    ]);\n    \n    const csvPath = await processGuideToCSV(filePath);\n    \n    if (action.includes('Do both')) {\n      await generateSlides(csvPath);\n    }\n  } else if (action === 'Generate slides from CSV') {\n    const { csvPath } = await inquirer.prompt([\n      {\n        type: 'input',\n        name: 'csvPath',\n        message: 'Enter the path to the CSV file:'\n      }\n    ]);\n    \n    await generateSlides(csvPath);\n  }\n}\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n## Step 4: Set Up Google API Authentication\n\n1. Create a Google Cloud Project:\n   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n   - Create a new project\n   - Enable the Google Slides API and Google Drive API\n\n2. Set up OAuth consent screen:\n   - Go to \"OAuth consent screen\"\n   - Select \"External\" (unless you have Google Workspace)\n   - Fill in the required information\n   - Add the required scopes (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`)\n   - Add your email as a test user\n\n3. Create OAuth credentials:\n   - Go to \"Credentials\"\n   - Click \"Create Credentials\" → \"OAuth client ID\"\n   - Select \"Desktop app\"\n   - Download the JSON file and save it as `credentials.json` in your project directory\n\n## Step 5: Setup Instructions\n\n1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already\n2. Create a new directory for your project and initialize it:\n\n```bash\nmkdir solar-slides-generator\ncd solar-slides-generator\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n3. Install required dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install googleapis csv-parser js-yaml inquirer axios\n```\n\n4. Create the required files:\n   - `slides-generator.js` (from Step 2)\n   - `cli.js` (from Step 3)\n   - Create a `prompts` directory and add the YAML file:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir prompts\n     ```\n   - Save the YAML content from Step 1 to `prompts/facilitator-guide-to-csv.yaml`\n\n5. Make the CLI executable:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x cli.js\n```\n\n6. Place your `credentials.json` file in the project directory\n\n7. Run the application:\n\n```bash\n./cli.js\n```\n\n8. The first time you run this, it will prompt you to authorize with Google:\n   - A URL will be displayed\n   - Open this URL in your browser\n   - Login with your Google account\n   - Grant permissions\n   - Copy the code provided and paste it back into the terminal\n\n## Additional Enhancements and Considerations\n\n1. **Diagram Rendering**: To handle Mermaid diagrams, you could use the Mermaid CLI to render diagrams to images and then insert those:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli\n```\n\n2. **Template System**: Create slide templates for different types of content:\n\n```javascript\n// Define templates for different slide types\nconst slideTemplates = {\n  title: 'TITLE',\n  content: 'TITLE_AND_BODY',\n  twoColumn: 'TWO_COLUMNS',\n  imageWithCaption: 'CAPTION_ONLY'\n};\n```\n\n3. **Batch Processing**: Add functionality to process multiple files at once:\n\n```javascript\n// Add to CLI\nconst { filePatterns } = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'filePatterns',\n    message: 'Enter file patterns (comma-separated):',\n    default: '*.txt,*.md'\n  }\n]);\n\nconst files = glob.sync(filePatterns.split(','));\nfor (const file of files) {\n  await processGuideToCSV(file);\n}\n```\n\n4. **Progress Tracking**: Add a progress bar for better UX:\n\n```bash\nnpm install progress\n```\n\n5. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging:\n\n```javascript\nconst winston = require('winston');\nconst logger = winston.createLogger({\n  level: 'info',\n  format: winston.format.json(),\n  defaultMeta: { service: 'slides-generator' },\n  transports: [\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),\n    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }),\n    new winston.transports.Console({ format: winston.format.simple() })\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nThis approach should give you a robust, flexible system for converting your facilitator guides into Google Slides presentations with minimal manual intervention. The YAML-based prompt system allows you to adapt the LLM processing without changing the application code.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this implementation?",
