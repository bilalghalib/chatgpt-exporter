      "content": "Alright, I need to analyze the solar-training-slides.md file in the context and update it based on the interview insights from Hussam and Muayad, incorporating appropriate visualizations using mermaid.js where relevant.\n\nFirst, let me review the recommendations and key points from the interviews:\n\nKey recommendations from Hussam and Muayad:\n1. Add a \"tool-familiarization lab\" (Day 0 or start of Day 1) to help trainees get hands-on with tools\n2. Include a Foundations mini-lecture (terminology, system types, losses)\n3. Add field interviews for market research\n4. Include financial quick-wins (diesel vs. solar cost comparison)\n5. Incorporate live safety demonstrations (AC vs. DC, counterfeit components)\n6. Use rotation through 4 workstations for hands-on practice\n7. Add wind-load and frame structural integrity content\n8. Rename Day 5 to include maintenance and cleaning\n9. Add design software demonstrations\n10. Incorporate dual certification plan\n\nNow, I need to examine the existing slides.md file and think about where to integrate mermaid.js diagrams. Good candidates for mermaid diagrams include:\n\n1. System types comparison (flow diagrams)\n2. Sizing calculation workflow\n3. Component selection decision trees\n4. Financial analysis flowchart\n5. Safety procedure flowcharts\n\nI'll now update the markdown file, incorporating these improvements and adding mermaid.js diagrams where appropriate. I'll ensure the images referenced are relevant and appropriate.\n\nThe python script provided will:\n1. Read the markdown file with mermaid code blocks\n2. Extract and save them as .mmd files\n3. Convert them to SVG images using the mmdc tool\n4. Replace the mermaid code blocks with image links\n5. Export the final presentation to PPTX\n\nThis means my job is to correctly integrate the mermaid code blocks in the markdown, and the script will handle the conversion.# Solar Training Slides Improvement Plan\n\nAfter reviewing the interviews with Hussam and Muayad along with the existing training materials, I've identified key areas for improvement in the slide deck. The updates will incorporate both experts' practical insights while enhancing visualization using mermaid.js diagrams.\n\n## Key Improvements to Implement\n\n1. **Tool Familiarization Visual Guide**: Add visual guides for hands-on tools (MC4 connectors, torque wrenches, watt meters)\n2. **System Types Flow Diagram**: Create mermaid.js flow diagram comparing off-grid, on-grid, and hybrid systems\n3. **Mosul-Specific Content**: Add local market prices, sunlight data, and dust management techniques\n4. **Financial Analysis Visualization**: Create ROI comparison charts between solar and diesel generators\n5. **Safety Demonstration Slides**: Add clear AC vs DC comparison visuals and counterfeit detection guides\n6. **Component Rotation Workflow**: Visualize the 4-station rotation system recommended by Muayad\n7. **Practical Assessment Methods**: Add Muayad's \"morning question\" technique and peer teaching opportunities\n8. **Real-World Examples**: Include more photos of actual installations in Mosul\n9. **Decision Trees**: Add component selection decision trees for different budget levels\n10. **Maintenance Schedule**: Add cleaning ROI visualization as mentioned by both experts\n\nBelow is the updated slide deck for Days 1-3 with these improvements integrated.\n\n---\n\n# Updated Solar Training Slides (Days 1-3)\n\n```markdown\n---\nmarp: true\ntheme:

5 kWh ÷ 5h × 1.25 = 1.25 kWp**\n\nFor 400W panels: **1,250W ÷ 400W = 3.125 → 4 panels**\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Updated loss factor to 25% based on Mosul conditions\n- Work through this calculation step by step on the whiteboard\n- Explain why we always round up (never install partial panels)\n- Discuss impact of different loss factors\n- Show how panel selection affects panel quantity\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Battery Sizing Calculation\n\nBasic formula:\n**Battery Capacity = Daily Load × Days of Autonomy ÷ DoD**\n\nExample:\n- Daily load: 5 kWh\n- Autonomy: 1 day\n- Battery type: Lithium (80% DoD)\n\n**Battery Size = 5 kWh × 1 ÷ 0.8 = 6.25 kWh**\n\nNOTE: Lead-acid batteries use 50% DoD\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Explain the concept of Depth of Discharge (DoD)\n- Discuss difference between lead-acid and lithium batteries\n- Explain why DoD matters for battery lifespan\n- Connect battery sizing to customer budget constraints\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Inverter Sizing\n\nBasic

Add a \"tool-familiarization lab\" (Day 0 or start of Day 1) to help trainees get hands-on with tools\n2. Include a Foundations mini-lecture (terminology, system types, losses)\n3. Add field interviews for market research\n4. Include financial quick-wins (diesel vs. solar cost comparison)\n5. Incorporate live safety demonstrations (AC vs. DC, counterfeit components)\n6. Use rotation through 4 workstations for hands-on practice\n7. Add wind-load and frame structural integrity content\n8. Rename Day 5 to include maintenance and cleaning\n9. Add design software demonstrations\n10. Incorporate dual certification plan\n\nNow, I need to examine the existing slides.md file and think about where to integrate mermaid.js diagrams. Good candidates for mermaid diagrams include:\n\n1. System types comparison (flow diagrams)\n2. Sizing calculation workflow\n3. Component selection decision trees\n4. Financial analysis flowchart\n5. Safety procedure flowcharts\n\nI'll now update the markdown file, incorporating these improvements and adding mermaid.js diagrams where appropriate. I'll ensure the images referenced are relevant and appropriate.\n\nThe python script provided will:\n1. Read the markdown file with mermaid code blocks\n2. Extract and save them as .mmd files\n3. Convert them to SVG images using the mmdc tool\n4. Replace the mermaid code blocks with image links\n5. Export the final presentation to PPTX\n\nThis means my job is to correctly integrate the mermaid code blocks in the markdown, and the script will handle the conversion.",

right:40% 80%](https://i.imgur.com/b7Aawam.jpg)\n\n- **Peak Sun Hours (PSH)**: 5-5.5 hours average for Mosul\n- **System Losses**: 20-25% (higher than global average)\n- **Temperature Derating**: Critical in Mosul's 45°C+ summers\n- **Dust/Soiling Losses**: 5-10% in Mosul's dusty conditions\n- **Future Expansion**: Add 10-15% capacity for growth\n- **Days of Autonomy**: Typically 1-2 days for residential\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Updated with Mosul-specific values from both experts\n- Image shows local climate conditions affecting solar\n- Explain each factor in detail with Mosul-specific values\n- Discuss seasonal variations in PSH\n- Emphasize temperature losses in 45°C+ summer conditions\n- Discuss dust accumulation patterns specific to Iraq\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Array Sizing Calculation\n\nBasic formula: \n**Array Size (Wp) = Daily Energy Need ÷ PSH × Loss Factor**\n\nExample:\n- Daily need: 5 kWh\n- Mosul PSH: 5 hours\n- System losses: 25% (1.25 factor)\n\n**Array Size = 5 kWh ÷ 5h × 1.25 = 1.25 kWp**\n\nFor 400W panels: **1,250W ÷ 400W = 3.125 → 4 panels**\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Updated loss factor to 25% based on Mosul conditions\n- Work through this calculation step by step on the whiteboard\n- Explain why we always round up (never install partial panels)\n- Discuss impact of different loss factors\n- Show how panel selection affects panel quantity\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Battery Sizing Calculation\n\nBasic formula:\n**Battery Capacity = Daily Load × Days of Autonomy ÷ DoD**\n\nExample:\n- Daily load: 5 kWh\n- Autonomy: 1 day\n- Battery type: Lithium (80% DoD)\n\n**Battery Size = 5 kWh × 1 ÷ 0.8 = 6.25 kWh**\n\nNOTE: Lead-acid batteries use 50% DoD\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Explain the concept of Depth of Discharge (DoD)\n- Discuss difference between lead-acid and lithium batteries\n- Explain why DoD matters for battery lifespan\n- Connect battery sizing to customer budget constraints\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Inverter Sizing\n\nBasic formula:\n**Inverter Size = Maximum Simultaneous Load × 1.25**\n\nConsiderations:\n- Must handle surge requirements (2-3x for motors)\n- Should match battery bank voltage\n- Consider future expansion\n- Choose pure sine wave for sensitive electronics\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Explain difference between continuous and surge ratings\n- Discuss why inverter sizing is about peak load, not daily energy\n- Mention importance of selecting DC voltage (12V, 24V, 48V)\n- Discuss compatibility with battery type\n-->\n\n---\n\n# System Voltage Decision Tree\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[System
