Building Design\nClimate Overview:\nHot, Arid Summers: Temperatures often exceed 40°C (104°F) during the day.\nMild to Cool Winters: Temperatures can drop significantly at night.\nLow Annual Rainfall: Limited to about 375 mm (15 inches) per year, mostly between November and April.\nPrevailing Winds: Northerly winds in summer can be harnessed for cooling.\nAdditional Considerations: Lighting and Indoor Environment\nNatural Lighting\nTraditional Approach:\nUse of small windows, light wells, and courtyards to bring in daylight while minimizing heat gain.\nModern Application:\nSkylights and Light Tubes:\nInstall skylights with heat-reflective glazing.\nUse light tubes to channel daylight into interior spaces.\nReflective Surfaces:\nEmploy light-colored interior finishes to enhance daylight distribution.\nIndoor Air Quality\nTraditional Materials:\nUse of natural, breathable materials like mud brick and lime plaster, which emit no harmful chemicals.\nModern Application:\nLow-Emitting Materials:\nSelect paints, adhesives, sealants, and finishes with low or zero volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\nAir Purification:\nIncorporate plants known for air-purifying qualities.\nUse air filtration systems if necessary.\nBenefits:\nEnhances health and comfort.\nReduces risks associated with indoor pollutants.\n\nExplanation of Key Terms for Non-Experts\nThermal Mass\nDefinition:\nThe ability of a material to absorb, store, and release heat energy.\nHow It Works:\nMaterials like stone, concrete, and brick absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night.\nBenefit:\nHelps to regulate indoor temperatures, reducing the need for heating and cooling systems.\nStack Effect (in Solar Chimneys)\nDefinition:\nA natural ventilation process where warm air rises and exits at the top of a building, pulling in cooler air from below.\nHow It Works:\nAs air inside the building warms up, it becomes less dense and rises.\nThe rising warm air creates a slight vacuum that draws in cooler air through lower openings.\nBenefit:\nEnhances natural airflow without mechanical systems, improving ventilation and cooling.\nPassive Solar Design\nDefinition:\nDesigning buildings to collect, store, and distribute solar energy as heat in the winter and reject it in the summer.\nHow It Works:\nProper orientation, window placement, and use of materials with appropriate thermal properties.\nBenefit:\nReduces energy consumption by utilizing the sun's energy for heating and cooling.\nCool Roofs\nDefinition:\nRoofs designed with materials that reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.\nHow It Works:\nUse of reflective paints, coatings, or light-colored roofing materials.\nBenefit:\nKeeps buildings cooler, reducing the need for air conditioning.\n\n\n\nReferences\nLEED Certification Guides by the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\"Sustainability through Materials: A Review of Green Options in Construction\" by Tagamud Tazmeen and

This creates consistent airflow, lowering indoor temperatures without mechanical cooling. Solar chimneys are especially effective as they use solar heat to enhance airflow, increasing indoor air exchanges on hot days.\nThermodynamic Principle of Stack Effect: Warmer, less dense air rises, creating a natural convection current that promotes passive cooling. Studies in Middle Eastern climates show up to 30% savings in cooling costs due to reduced use of mechanical systems.\n2\nThermal Mass in Walls\nEnergy Bills: 15-25%\nCO₂ Emissions: 15-25%\nThick walls with high thermal mass (e.g., stone, adobe) absorb heat during the day and slowly release it at night, maintaining cooler indoor temperatures. This reduces peak indoor temperatures and stabilizes conditions, decreasing demand on HVAC. Adding insulation improves this effect by minimizing heat transfer. Thermal mass systems are common in hot climates for energy efficiency.\nThermal Mass Studies: Research shows that thermal mass can reduce indoor temperature swings by 5-10°C, stabilizing energy demands. Similar studies in Saudi Arabia estimate up to 25% cooling savings.\n3\nShading Devices (Mashrabiya, Adjustable Louvers)\nEnergy Bills: 10-15%\nCO₂ Emissions: Up to 10%\nShading devices prevent direct sunlight from entering indoor spaces, reducing solar heat gain by up to 50% depending on angle and coverage. Adjustable louvers can block peak sun exposure while allowing ventilation, enhancing comfort. These devices lower indoor temperatures, particularly during the hottest hours, and reduce HVAC demand.\nEmpirical Data on Shading: Shading reduces indoor cooling loads by blocking up to 50% of solar heat. Studies in similar climates, such as in the UAE, show that shading can save 10-15% on cooling.\n4\nCool Roofs (Reflective Coatings)\nEnergy Bills: 10-20%\nCO₂ Emissions: 10-15%\nCool roofs reflect 50-90% of sunlight, significantly reducing roof temperatures and minimizing heat absorption into the building. Reflective surfaces decrease indoor cooling load by maintaining lower roof temperatures, which can lower HVAC usage, particularly in peak hours. The savings vary based on roof area, local sunlight exposure, and building insulation.\nHeat Reflectance Studies: Cool roofs can lower roof surface temperature by 20-40°C, with up to 20% reductions in cooling energy demand, based on simulations for climates with intense solar exposure.\n5\nEvaporative Cooling (Courtyard Gardens/Water Features)\nEnergy Bills: 5-10%\nCO₂ Emissions: Up to 5%\nWater features in courtyards create evaporative cooling, which reduces surrounding air temperature by 2-4°C. This effect cools adjacent indoor spaces through windows and openings, decreasing the need for air conditioning. Courtyards also promote natural air circulation, enhancing the cooling effect.\nEvaporative Cooling Studies: Studies from Iran and Egypt on courtyard cooling show that air temperatures can be reduced by 2-4°C, resulting in 5-10% savings on cooling energy.\n6\nUse of Local and Sustainable Materials\nEmbodied CO₂ Emissions: Up to 15%\nUsing locally sourced materials reduces transportation emissions and lowers embodied energy. Traditional materials like stone, adobe, and clay have naturally low carbon footprints. Modern alternatives like stabilized earth blocks also offer reduced emissions compared to concrete and steel, as they require lower energy in production.\nEmbodied Energy Research: Studies on traditional materials show that local stone and adobe emit 20-30% less CO₂ compared to concrete, contributing to lower embodied emissions in the final structure.\n7\nDaylighting Strategies (Skylights, Efficient Lighting)\nEnergy Bills (Lighting): 10-15%\nCO₂ Emissions: Up to 10%\nStrategic use of skylights and reflective surfaces enhances natural light, reducing the need for artificial lighting by up to 60% in well-lit areas. LED lighting further lowers electricity consumption. This reduces energy use in lighting, leading to direct savings in electricity and indirect savings in cooling, as artificial lights generate heat.\nStudies on Daylighting: Research in schools and office spaces demonstrates up to 60% reductions in lighting demand from effective daylighting. In residential spaces, savings translate to 10-15% of lighting costs.\n8\nBasement for Cooling (Sirdab)\nEnergy Bills: Up to 15%\nCO₂ Emissions: Up to 15%\nBasements leverage the earth’s thermal stability, providing cooler indoor temperatures throughout the day. Sirdab (basement) spaces typically remain 5-8°C cooler than outdoor temperatures, reducing reliance on air conditioning, especially for lower floors. Well-ventilated basements improve comfort without needing mechanical cooling.\nEarth Temperature Studies: Research shows that basements can reduce indoor temperature peaks by up to 8°C, contributing to 10-15% reduction in cooling energy in hot climates.\n9\nOrientation and Passive Solar Design\nEnergy Bills: 20-30%\nCO₂ Emissions: 20-30%\nAligning buildings east-west with shaded windows to the south maximizes daylight while minimizing unwanted heat gain. Passive solar design uses sun angles to provide winter heating while blocking summer heat, reducing energy use by up to 30%. Good orientation improves thermal performance and reduces cooling/heating loads.\nOrientation Studies: Studies show that east-west alignment in hot climates reduces cooling costs by around 20-30%. The DOE Building Energy Modeling Guide supports this for passive solar savings.\n10\nGreen Courtyards and Atriums\nEnergy Bills: 15-25%\nCO₂ Emissions: Up to 20%\nCourtyards promote air circulation and create shaded areas, which cools adjacent spaces naturally. Green spaces add evaporative cooling, further reducing ambient temperatures by 3-5°C in hot climates. Shaded courtyards, combined with ventilation, can reduce cooling loads significantly, particularly in the hottest months.\nResearch on Courtyards: Studies from hot climates, particularly in Iran, show that courtyards can reduce surrounding temperatures by 3-5°C, resulting in 15-25% energy savings in cooling.\n11\nDomes and Vaulted Ceilings\nEnergy Bills: Up to 10%\nCO₂ Emissions: Up to 10%\nDomes and vaulted ceilings increase vertical airflow, distributing heat upwards and away from occupants. This design reduces heat build-up in living areas, allowing better air circulation and cooling. Vaulted ceilings also reduce solar heat gain compared to flat roofs, lowering indoor temperatures.\nStudies on Vaulted Ceilings: Simulations show that domed structures reduce indoor temperatures by improving airflow, saving up to 10% on cooling energy in hot climates.\n12\nEco-Friendly Building Materials\nEmbodied CO₂ Emissions: Up to 20%\nUsing low-embodied-energy materials, like recycled content, bamboo, or low-impact concrete, significantly reduces emissions. Bamboo and stabilized earth blocks have 30-50% lower emissions compared to traditional concrete and steel, as they require less energy for production and transport.\nEmbodied Carbon Studies: Research on bamboo and earth blocks shows embodied CO₂ reductions of up to 50%, translating to 20% reductions in total building emissions.\n13\nHigh-Efficiency Windows and Light Shelves\nEnergy Bills (Lighting): 15-20%\nCO₂ Emissions: Up to 15%\nDouble-glazed, low-emissivity windows reduce heat transfer, minimizing unwanted heat gain or loss. Light shelves direct sunlight into deep spaces, reducing artificial lighting needs. Combined, these features improve energy efficiency in both cooling and lighting, resulting in up to 20% energy savings.\nWindow Efficiency Studies: DOE studies show that efficient windows can reduce heat transfer by 50%, saving up to 20% in cooling and lighting. Light shelves add an additional 5-10% savings.\n\n",
