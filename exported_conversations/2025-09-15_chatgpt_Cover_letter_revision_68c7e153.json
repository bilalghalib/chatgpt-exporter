I’m excited to apply for the Epic Facilitator role, as I believe in the power of connecting personal and professional growth, and I’d love to be a part of the movement towards meaning alignment and changing the culture and impact of our workspaces. \nBusinesses have one of the most considerable impacts on the world. I’ve often been in change-maker circles where the objective has been to start new organizations, and I believe that working from the inside out, for the individual and our workspaces, is one of the most beautiful ways to create positive change, transforming systems through transforming people within systems.\nI began facilitating in 2008–2009 by helping launch Ann Arbor’s first makerspace (All Hands Active) and since then I’ve been honing my convening and facilitation skills through cooperative movements, hackerspaces, building social entrepreneurship ecosystems around the world. I love bringing people together and creating environments where we all benefit from the collective intelligence in the room.\nIn 2016 I co-founded Bloom, a venture-development platform that has supported 1,000+ enterprises across 16 countries. Initially I led the pedagogy, facilitation, and early technical builds, and personally ran roughly a third of our 100 accelerator cycles. We built and leveraged tools for conducting personal and professional assessments for indiviauls and teams and creating custom programs with our software and library. Materials and processes I’d be happy to share with Epic.\nOur programs are grounded in an Ubuntu ethos: individual success grows from community success. In practice, this involves designing rituals of peer support and establishing clear feedback loops. One of my favorite programs was the Safir ToT where we worked to create a learning community of other accelerators and trained other facilitators and accelerators to adopt and adapt these containers.\nOne lens I find particularly unique to my work is the recognition and integration of difficult experiences. Working in Lebanon and Iraq, where participants carry personal and collective trauma, I’ve been exploring training and support for resilience and growth in the face of difficulty.\nMy graduate research focused on post-traumatic growth: how to craft facilitation containers that support learning, meaning-making, and agency during uncertainty. I’ve applied those methods in programs at Bloom and in live-conflict settings through School Without Borders in Gaza.\nI facilitate in English and Arabic, both in-person and online. Although I’m based in France, I regularly travel for engagements and am comfortable working across time zones. Also, I’m great at Zoom, I keep groups engaged through virtual liberating structure practices, small-groups, and clear artifacts so it’s clear what to do on the call, and to have a place to return to after.\nWhat I could bring to Epic is a balance of structure and humanity: simple frames, strong containers, and the ability to facilitate genuine conversations.\nI’ve attached my résumé and would welcome a conversation about how this approach can serve your clients and mission.\nWarm regards,\nBilal Ghalib",
