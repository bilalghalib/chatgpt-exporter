The track aims to enhance the organizational capacity and competitiveness of the participating social enterprises through a structured mentorship journey. Here's an overview of the objectives, participants onboarding, splitting into teams, and activities within the mentorship track:\n\n### Objectives\n\n1.

This approach allows for a more focused and effective assistance program, enabling the social enterprises to thrive and achieve their goals.\n\n### Type of Activities during the Mentorship Track\n\n**Orientation Session:** Conduct an orientation session to introduce the mentorship track, its objectives, and the roles and responsibilities of both mentors and social enterprises.\n\n**Goal Setting:** Facilitate a goal-setting session where social enterprises define their specific objectives and targets for the mentorship period.\n\n**Mentor-Mentee Pairing:** Organize a mentor-mentee pairing session, where social enterprises are introduced to their assigned mentors and establish initial communication channels.\n\n**Monthly Mentorship Sessions:** Schedule regular monthly mentorship sessions where mentors and social enterprises discuss progress, challenges, and strategies for growth.\n\n**Expert Workshops:** Arrange expert-led workshops on relevant topics, such as marketing, finance, or social impact measurement, to provide additional learning opportunities for the social enterprises.\n\n**Peer Learning Events:** Facilitate virtual peer learning events where social enterprises share their experiences, learnings, and best practices with each other.\n\n**Progress Review:** Conduct periodic progress reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of the mentorship track and make any necessary adjustments.\n\n**Closure Session:** Organize a closure session to reflect on the mentorship journey, celebrate achievements, and provide guidance on the next steps for the social enterprises.\n\nThese activities are designed to create a structured and supportive mentorship environment that fosters learning, growth, and collaboration among the social enterprises. By splitting the teams and facilitating targeted activities, we aim to maximize the impact of the mentorship track and provide tailored support to each participating social enterprise.\n\nMentors Engagement Plan for the Program\n---------------------------------------\n\n### Outreach Plan for Corporate Mentors \n\nDrifting away from Entrepreneurs & Social Entrepreneurs Mentorship Selection\n\nTo select the mentors, the same selection criteria could be applied, but with a focus on their experience and expertise in sustainability and CSR. The program managers could also seek out mentors who have a background in corporate sustainability and have experience working with startups or have shown an interest in mentoring startups.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to ensure that these mentors share the values of the accelerator program and are genuinely interested in supporting the startups. The program managers could interview them and have them fill out a questionnaire that assesses their motivation, commitment, and goals as a mentor.\n\nWhen designing the outreach plan for managers with sustainable goals, it is crucial to highlight the potential benefits of mentorship to both the startup and the mentor. For instance, mentors can share their experience and expertise while also learning from the startups about new and innovative sustainability practices that they can bring back to their companies.\n\nThe outreach plan could include targeted messaging and communication through professional networks, industry associations, and corporate social responsibility platforms. Social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter can also be used to identify potential mentors and initiate conversations about mentorship opportunities.\n\nUltimately, selecting the right mentors for a startup accelerator program is a critical process that requires careful consideration and assessment of their experience, expertise, motivation, and values. By incorporating managers with sustainable goals, startups can benefit from their experience and knowledge while also contributing to a more sustainable and responsible business ecosystem.\n\n### Selecting and Onboarding Mentors\n\n1.  **Define selection criteria:** The first step is to clearly define the selection criteria that will be used to evaluate mentor candidates. This could include factors like industry experience, domain knowledge, entrepreneurial experience, leadership skills, communication skills, and willingness to commit time and effort to the program.\n    \n2.  **Solicit applications**: Mentor candidates could be solicited through a variety of channels, such as referrals from program alumni, recommendations from current mentors, or open applications on the program website. The application process should include questions that help to identify whether the candidate meets the selection criteria.\n    \n\n3.  **Conduct interviews**: Once a pool of potential mentors has been identified, program managers can conduct interviews to learn more about their backgrounds, skills, and motivations. The interview could include questions related to the selection criteria, as well as situational questions that assess the candidate's ability to mentor startups effectively.\n    \n\n4.  **Check references**: Program managers should also check references for potential mentors to verify their credentials and ensure that they have a good reputation in the industry. This could include reaching out to previous mentees, colleagues, or other contacts who can vouch for the candidate's abilities.\n    \n\n5.  **Evaluate fit:** Finally, program managers should evaluate whether the mentor candidate is a good fit for the program culture and values. This could involve considering factors like personality, communication style, and willingness to collaborate with other mentors and program staff.\n    \n\nBy following a rigorous selection process like this, program managers can ensure that only the most qualified and motivated mentors are onboarded to the program. The success of the mentorship program can be measured through feedback from mentees, as well as metrics like startup success rates, revenue growth, and job creation.\n\n### Ideas for engaging and motivating mentors during the EON program\n\n1.  **Gamify the mentorship experience:** Create a gamified experience for mentors to keep them motivated and engaged throughout the program. For example, set up a point system where mentors earn points for every meeting attended, providing valuable advice and insights, and for helping their mentee reach specific milestones. \n    \n\n_(Points can be redeemed for recognition, Mentor of the Month )_\n\n2.  **Host virtual mentor mixers:** Set up virtual mentor mixers where mentors can network and share their experiences with other mentors in the program. This can be a great way for mentors to build relationships, exchange ideas, and learn from each other.\n    \n\n_(Suggesting a 3 day event that will be hosted across 3 month, once for each)_\n\n3.  **Create mentorship success stories:** Showcase success stories of past mentors and mentees in the program. This can be done through blog posts, videos, or social media. This will not only motivate current mentors but also attract new mentors to the program.\n    \n\n_(Showcase maybe mentor of the month? According to hours of mentoring vs. Startups feedback)_\n\n4.  **Host mentor-led workshops:** Encourage mentors to host workshops for mentees on topics related to their expertise. This can be a great way for mentors to share their knowledge and provide valuable insights to startups in the program.\n    \n\n_(This can easily be done through the cohort meeting)_\n\n5.  **Recognize and celebrate mentors:** Show appreciation for mentors by recognizing their contributions through awards, certificates, or **public recognition**. This can motivate mentors to continue their involvement in the program and encourage them to go above and beyond for their mentees.\n    \n\n_(The previous version of bloom's website had outdated Mentors, why don't we bring them back with new mentors?_\n\n6.  **Offer mentor perks:** Provide exclusive perks for mentors, such as free access to events, training, or resources related to entrepreneurship. This can be a great way to keep mentors engaged and show them that their contributions are valued.\n    \n\n_(I’ve seen our resources, Investment Readiness sounds good for some beginner mentors/entrepreneurs only)_\n\n7.  **Use mentor feedback to improve the program:** Regularly ask for feedback from mentors on the program and use this feedback to make improvements. This will show mentors that their opinions are valued and that the program is dedicated to their success.\n    \n\n_(Checklist Ready)_\n\n8.  **Offer mentor matching training:** Provide training for mentors on effective mentor matching. This can help mentors build stronger relationships with their mentees and provide more valuable guidance throughout the program.\n    \n\n9.  **Encourage mentor participation in program events:** Invite mentors to participate in program events, such as pitch competitions or demo days. This can be a great way for mentors to see the progress of their mentees and build relationships with other mentors and startups in the program. _(Mentors Retaining)_\n    \n\n10.  **Connect mentors with relevant resources:** Provide mentors with access to relevant resources, such as market reports, industry insights, or funding opportunities. This can help mentors provide more valuable guidance to their mentees and stay up-to-date on the latest trends and developments in their industry.\n    \n\n_Interested in the Diaspora Mentors mentioned by Bilal previously_\n\n### Hosting a Mentor Mixer \n\n#### Day 1:\n\n*   **Welcome and introductions:** Start the session with a brief introduction to the mentor mixer and welcome remarks. Introduce Bloom and the goals of the mentorship program.\n    \n*   **Speed Networking:** Utilize a virtual platform that facilitates speed networking to allow mentors to meet and interact with each other. The platform can randomly match mentors with each other in a timed interval, allowing them to quickly introduce themselves and their expertise.\n    \n*   **Fireside Chat:** Host a virtual fireside chat with an accomplished entrepreneur or business leader as a keynote speaker. This session should be focused on sharing their insights, experiences, and advice to the participating mentors.\n    \n\n##### Outcomes:\n\n*   Mentors will have a better understanding of the goals and objectives of the mentor mixer.\n    \n*   Mentors will have made initial connections with each other.\n    \n*   Mentors will have gained insights and inspiration from the keynote speaker.\n    \n\n#### Day 2:\n\n*   **Mentor Panel:** Host a virtual panel discussion with a group of experienced mentors to share their experiences and insights. The panel can focus on topics such as the most effective mentoring techniques, how to overcome common mentoring challenges, and best practices for building strong mentor-mentee relationships.\n    \n*   **Virtual Office Hours:** Host virtual office hours, where participating mentors can book individual virtual meetings with Bloom staff and get to know more about the program, ask questions, and provide feedback.\n    \n*   **Group Mentoring:** Host group mentoring sessions where small groups of mentors can meet with Bloom staff to discuss specific topics or issues related to the mentorship program.\n    \n\n##### Outcomes:\n\n*   Mentors will have gained insights and strategies from the mentor panel on effective mentoring techniques.\n    \n*   Mentors will have had the opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback to Bloom staff.\n    \n*   Mentors will have had the chance to discuss specific issues and challenges related to the mentorship program.\n    \n\n#### Day 3:\n\n*   **Pitch Competition:** Host a virtual pitch competition where startups from the Bloom program will present their ideas to the mentors. The mentors will provide feedback, insights, and suggestions to the startups.\n    \n*   **Mentor Pairing:** Utilize the feedback and insights gathered from the mentor mixer to match participating mentors with the startups from the Bloom program. This matching process can be facilitated through an online platform or through direct communication with Bloom staff.\n    \n*   **Closing Remarks:** End the mentor mixer with a brief closing ceremony, thanking the mentors for their participation and sharing the next steps.\n    \n\n##### Outcomes:\n\n*   Startups will have received valuable feedback, insights, and suggestions from the participating mentors.\n    \n*   Mentors will have been paired with startups that align with their expertise and interests.\n    \n*   Bloom staff will have a better understanding of the mentors' strengths and areas of expertise, allowing for more effective mentor matching in the future.\n    \n\n### Measuring success:\n\n*   Number of mentors who attended the mentor mixer.\n    \n*   Number of connections made between mentors.\n    \n*   Quality of feedback and insights provided by the mentors to the startups during the pitch competition.\n    \n*   Number of mentor-mentee matches made after the mentor mixer.\n    \n*   Feedback survey from participating mentors to gauge their satisfaction with the mentor mixer and the program as a whole.\n    \n\n_Availability of mentors through official virtual office hours is essential since a lot of startup needs differ after their first meeting with the assigned mentor and they’d be more engaged with mentors if they had a full on accessibility. However, this could be an overworked hassle for mentors (Can be limited with a certain number of hours only)_\n\nTimeline for the Program Design > \n==================================\n\nEON Mentorship Program Checklist - Salem Edits\n\nEON Mentorship Program Planning - Salem Edits\n\n### Designing\n\n*   2 weeks: Develop mentor selection criteria\n    \n*   1 week: Develop outreach plan\n    \n*   1 week: Develop mentor onboarding process\n    \n*   1 week: Develop mentorship funnel plan\n    \n*   1 week: Develop accelerator funnel plan\n    \n\n_(Before May 10, 2023)_\n\n### Preparing Material\n\n*   2 weeks: Develop mentorship training material\n    \n*   1 week: Develop mentorship agreement template\n    \n*   1 week: Develop mentorship evaluation form\n    \n\n_(Before May 10 2023)_\n\n### Outreach\n\n*   4 weeks: Launch outreach plan to attract mentors\n    \n*   2 weeks: Shortlist mentor candidates\n    \n*   2 weeks: Schedule and conduct mentor interviews\n    \n\n_Initiate in the first week of May?_\n\n### Selecting\n\n*   1 week: Review interview feedback and finalize mentor selections\n    \n*   1 week: Notify selected mentors and send mentorship agreement to be signed\n    \n\n_3rd week of May?_\n\n### Onboarding\n\n*   2 weeks: Provide mentorship training to selected mentors\n    \n*   1 week: Review and finalize mentorship agreement with mentors\n    \n*   1 week: Provide mentors with relevant information about startups in the accelerator\n    \n\n_Beginning of June?_\n\n### Mentorship Funnel\n\n*   12 weeks: Regular mentor check-ins with startups (once per month)\n    \n*   1 week: Provide mid-term evaluation form to startups and mentors\n    \n*   1 week: Evaluate mentorship progress and provide feedback to mentors\n    \n\n_Beginning of June_ \n\n### Accelerator Funnel\n\n*   12 weeks: Weekly accelerator events and workshops for startups\n    \n*   1 week: Provide mid-term evaluation form to startups and mentors\n    \n*   1 week: Evaluate accelerator progress and provide feedback to startups\n    \n\n_Begining of June_\n\n### Project End\n\n*   2 weeks: Conduct final evaluation of mentorship and accelerator programs\n    \n*   1 week: Provide final mentorship evaluation form to startups and mentors\n    \n*   1 week: Generate final mentorship and accelerator reports\n    \n\n_October ?_\n\nDocuments/Reports\n-----------------\n\n*   Mentor Selection Criteria\n    \n*   Outreach Plan\n    \n*   Shortlisted Mentor Candidates\n    \n*   Mentor Interview Feedback\n    \n*   Mentorship Agreement Template\n    \n*   Mentorship Evaluation Form\n    \n*   Mentorship Training Material\n    \n*   Mid-term Mentorship Evaluation Form\n    \n*   Final Mentorship Evaluation Form\n    \n*   Accelerator Funnel Plan\n    \n*   Mid-term Accelerator Evaluation Form\n    \n*   Final Accelerator Evaluation Form\n    \n*   Final Mentorship and Accelerator Reports",

This approach allows for a more focused and effective assistance program, enabling the social enterprises to thrive and achieve their goals.\n\n### Type of Activities during the Mentorship Track\n\n**Orientation Session:** Conduct an orientation session to introduce the mentorship track, its objectives, and the roles and responsibilities of both mentors and social enterprises.\n\n**Goal Setting:** Facilitate a goal-setting session where social enterprises define their specific objectives and targets for the mentorship period.\n\n**Mentor-Mentee Pairing:** Organize a mentor-mentee pairing session, where social enterprises are introduced to their assigned mentors and establish initial communication channels.\n\n**Monthly Mentorship Sessions:** Schedule regular monthly mentorship sessions where mentors and social enterprises discuss progress, challenges, and strategies for growth.\n\n**Expert Workshops:** Arrange expert-led workshops on relevant topics, such as marketing, finance, or social impact measurement, to provide additional learning opportunities for the social enterprises.\n\n**Peer Learning Events:** Facilitate virtual peer learning events where social enterprises share their experiences, learnings, and best practices with each other.\n\n**Progress Review:** Conduct periodic progress reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of the mentorship track and make any necessary adjustments.\n\n**Closure Session:** Organize a closure session to reflect on the mentorship journey, celebrate achievements, and provide guidance on the next steps for the social enterprises.\n\nThese activities are designed to create a structured and supportive mentorship environment that fosters learning, growth, and collaboration among the social enterprises. By splitting the teams and facilitating targeted activities, we aim to maximize the impact of the mentorship track and provide tailored support to each participating social enterprise.\n\nMentors Engagement Plan for the Program\n---------------------------------------\n\n### Outreach Plan for Corporate Mentors \n\nDrifting away from Entrepreneurs & Social Entrepreneurs Mentorship Selection\n\nTo select the mentors, the same selection criteria could be applied, but with a focus on their experience and expertise in sustainability and CSR. The program managers could also seek out mentors who have a background in corporate sustainability and have experience working with startups or have shown an interest in mentoring startups.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to ensure that these mentors share the values of the accelerator program and are genuinely interested in supporting the startups. The program managers could interview them and have them fill out a questionnaire that assesses their motivation, commitment, and goals as a mentor.\n\nWhen designing the outreach plan for managers with sustainable goals, it is crucial to highlight the potential benefits of mentorship to both the startup and the mentor. For instance, mentors can share their experience and expertise while also learning from the startups about new and innovative sustainability practices that they can bring back to their companies.\n\nThe outreach plan could include targeted messaging and communication through professional networks, industry associations, and corporate social responsibility platforms. Social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter can also be used to identify potential mentors and initiate conversations about mentorship opportunities.\n\nUltimately, selecting the right mentors for a startup accelerator program is a critical process that requires careful consideration and assessment of their experience, expertise, motivation, and values. By incorporating managers with sustainable goals, startups can benefit from their experience and knowledge while also contributing to a more sustainable and responsible business ecosystem.\n\n### Selecting and Onboarding Mentors\n\n1.  **Define selection criteria:** The first step is to clearly define the selection criteria that will be used to evaluate mentor candidates. This could include factors like industry experience, domain knowledge, entrepreneurial experience, leadership skills, communication skills, and willingness to commit time and effort to the program.\n    \n2.  **Solicit applications**: Mentor candidates could be solicited through a variety of channels, such as referrals from program alumni, recommendations from current mentors, or open applications on the program website. The application process should include questions that help to identify whether the candidate meets the selection criteria.\n    \n\n3.  **Conduct interviews**: Once a pool of potential mentors has been identified, program managers can conduct interviews to learn more about their backgrounds, skills, and motivations. The interview could include questions related to the selection criteria, as well as situational questions that assess the candidate's ability to mentor startups effectively.\n    \n\n4.  **Check references**: Program managers should also check references for potential mentors to verify their credentials and ensure that they have a good reputation in the industry. This could include reaching out to previous mentees, colleagues, or other contacts who can vouch for the candidate's abilities.\n    \n\n5.  **Evaluate fit:** Finally, program managers should evaluate whether the mentor candidate is a good fit for the program culture and values. This could involve considering factors like personality, communication style, and willingness to collaborate with other mentors and program staff.\n    \n\nBy following a rigorous selection process like this, program managers can ensure that only the most qualified and motivated mentors are onboarded to the program. The success of the mentorship program can be measured through feedback from mentees, as well as metrics like startup success rates, revenue growth, and job creation.\n\n### Ideas for engaging and motivating mentors during the EON program\n\n1.  **Gamify the mentorship experience:** Create a gamified experience for mentors to keep them motivated and engaged throughout the program.
