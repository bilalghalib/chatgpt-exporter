Personas are important for map shifting as is the intuition about vector spaces for embeddings and how you can grab steve jobs phone and start typing your business proposal idea and then hit the first autocomplete word that pops up repeatedly to get his perspective. You can put on new minds (new turn of phrase) and then take them off and put on a countering perspective - we do this to develop our OWN minds - and that's the goal of all this. Through starting with a goal and developing learning you can change your goal through self knowledge of your own thoughts to grow both more in capacity as well in confidence about the rigor, depth, and rightness of this goal for you. And you can know who you might need in terms of skills, imagine being a new social entrepreneur and not knowing you might need someone who can work on operations or risk management because it wasn't a part of your business framework as someone who is more focused on building technology for instance. how can you know who you need to hire if you don't know how to ask those questions? This is why the framework of frameworks, the MOE, the map of everything is important. You plop yourself down inside of it with your initial assumed objective and it will pull it apart and nudge you as you learn what you don't yet know you need to learn to achieve it. We have many techniques and prompt suggestions and approaches, yet hte most important thing to develop is a knowledge about how the LLM works, a bit about how learning works and librarian studies (how knowledge is managed and discovered), and the way of approaching things. Following the techniques will give you a gut feeling about the right way to do things, also remember to always ask what the AI is thinking and to move step by step and ask it to think step by step and explain it's reasoning as it proceedes to summarize expand contract critique and ask you questions. Goal, summarize expand contract critique ask me questions to help me achieve or modify my goal. what do i need to know what I don't know (except you have to ask it tangentially, what would an opponent think, play devils advocate, etc). \n\nHere is the previous content in quotations\n\n\"\"\"emselves that... well... i can answer things in my life, in my understanding, the new insight I just had that I didn't read or think of from anywhere else. like some musicians will \n\\stop listening to any other music to not influence their music. we can go to a space and see what is three to be said and then realize after a long discussion exploring the empty spaces on the map  that perhaps we do have something to say that's new here. We can call that a \"MicroPHD\" or something like that - what do you think about this, summarize why this might be enough and critique it with 5 pros and 5 cons \n\nFor instance, today I think microPHD is a new thought that I thought that I'm not sure anyone else has ever thought. and can qualify as new knowledge for a new question that only I can answer. The question might be: how will education evolve in the future and how can we validate new knowledge, or something else like that \n\n2 / 2\n\n\n\nChatGPT\nThe concept of a \"MicroPHD,\" centered around the guiding question \"What is a question only you can answer?\" is intriguing. It encourages learners to delve into their unique perspectives and experiences to contribute original insights. Here's a summary along with a critique:\n\nSummary: MicroPHD Framework\nCore Idea: Encourages learners to explore and articulate unique insights based on their personal experiences and knowledge.\nGuiding Question: \"What is a question only you can answer?\" This prompts learners to identify and express original thoughts or solutions, drawing on their individual understanding and creativity.\nApplication: It's a method for learners to recognize and value their unique contributions in any field of study, potentially leading to new and original ideas or perspectives.\nRelation to Education: Aligns with the future of education emphasizing individual thought, creativity, and the recognition of personal insights as valuable knowledge.\n. we can talk about it being a Map Of Everything where we can navigate with our words. Each word has an address that takes us places and two words have two different addresses and so there's a lof of unknown space between them - once we go to two places, there's a third space. The space between those two words or phrases or ideas. And we can ask chatGPT to look at the map and describe it. We can't see the map by itself. The map must be traversed to be read so we need to pick points we already know to have the MOE read everything in between those places to trigger new thoughts and new ideas to explore \n2. I asked to create a diverse panel of pedagalogical experts who disagree with eachother to critique my idea of a framework and respond to my questions - it helped me think more clearly\n3. it's a framework they're encouraged to use with chatGPT with example prompts. we'll make a chatbased version on whatsapp so they can just talk to it about their interests and see where it goes\n\n\nChatGPT\nThank you for the additional details. Based on your input, here's a summary that can be developed into a one-pager for high school students:\n\nExploring the Map of Everything with AI: A Guide for Curious Minds\n\nWhat is the Map of Everything (MOE)?\nImagine every word or concept as a destination on a vast map.\nThis map is interconnected: between any two points (words or ideas) lies a whole unexplored territory filled with new knowledge and perspectives.\nYou navigate this map with your words, asking AI to reveal the connections and spaces between known ideas, leading to new discoveries.\nDialogue-Driven Exploration:\nJust like a GPS guides you through unknown roads, AI (like chatGPT) guides you through this knowledge map.\nYour conversation with AI is key: your questions and topics act as coordinates.\nAn example: By creating a virtual panel of diverse pedagogical experts (as if they were points on the map), you can explore different educational theories and perspectives, deepening your understanding.\nApplying the Framework:\nThis approach is not just theoretical; you can practice it using chatGPT or similar AI platforms.\nAn upcoming chat-based version on WhatsApp will make this even more accessible.\nStart with your interests or school subjects, ask chatGPT to explore related ideas, and see where the conversation leads.\nThe goal is to expand your thinking, discover new connections, and develop your unique perspective.\nCreative Contribution:\nAs you explore, you're not just a traveler but also a map-maker, adding your insights to the MOE.\nEach new idea or connection you make is like adding a new coordinate to the map, enriching it for others.\nEncouraging Curiosity and Critical Thinking:\nThis method is all about asking the right questions, not just looking for straightforward answers.\nIt encourages you to think critically, make connections, and approach learning as an exciting journey of discovery.\nExample Prompts to Get You Started:\n\n\"What is the connection between climate change and economic policies?\"\n\"Explore the differing views on digital privacy in various cultures.\"\n\"What would a debate between historical figures about modern technology look like?\"\nRemember, the journey of knowledge is endless, and with the Map of Everything, you have the power to explore it in ways never before possible.

Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.\n\n\nSummarize them both in a paragraph with a bulleted list of their unique points and contributions and ask me 5 questions to help guide me to my end goal. I want to have a single simple framework that has ONLY the most FUNDAMENTAL components that are most unique and unintuitive in our framework that will have outsized results and to make it easy to remember and apply. Ask me 5 questions that will help you as a framework and learning designer make this framework one pager achieve the goals \n\n\nChatGPT\nThe MicroPHD Injections in the Map Of Everything, and the SCRIBER framework for both youth and adults, offer unique approaches to learning and knowledge exploration using AI tools like chatGPT. Here's a summary of their key points and contributions:\n\nMicroPHD Injections in the Map Of Everything:\n\nEncourages personal insight and unique contribution by asking \"What is a question only you can answer?\"\nUtilizes a metaphorical 'Map Of Everything' where words and concepts are interconnected.\nPromotes exploration of uncharted knowledge territories between known ideas.\nFocuses on individual thought, creativity, and the recognition of personal insights as valuable knowledge.\nAids in developing original ideas and perspectives based on personal experiences.\nSCRIBE Framework (Youth & Adults):\n\nYouth Version:\nSimplified and adventure-themed approach to knowledge exploration.\nEncourages curiosity and basic understanding of asking questions and reflecting on answers.\nUses playful and imaginative scenarios to guide young learners in their inquiry.\nAdult Version:\nDesigned for practical application in professional and personal learning.\nEncourages deep engagement with AI, seeking gaps in knowledge, and critical reflection.\nFocuses on using AI as a tool for thought and self-directed learning.\nTo create a single, simplified framework that integrates the most fundamental and impactful elements of these approaches, I will ask you five guiding questions:\n\nWhat are the core principles from each framework that you find most effective for fostering original thought and creativity?\nHow do you envision this simplified framework being applied in practical scenarios, both for education and professional development?\nWhat aspects of AI interaction (e.g., question-asking, exploration, critical thinking) do you think are essential to include in this unified framework?\nConsidering the diverse age groups and learning environments, how can this framework be made adaptable yet consistently effective?\nWhat is the simplest way to articulate the essence of these frameworks, ensuring they are easy to understand and apply for a wide range of users?\nYour answers to these questions will provide essential insights for designing a one-pager that encapsulates the most powerful elements of these learning frameworks.\nUser\nI really like the navigating points between two points you know. I like the MOE and dewey decimle system analogies i think it helps although i think maybe people wont get why it's interesting to navigate the LLMs embedding vector space with these concepts. it might be too abstract, not sure \n2. I first want people to get a sense of how their prompts can be wrong. I'd love to make a grammarly for prompting which can be a plugin and edit their prompts according to the principles.\n3. asking the ai to ask you questions. give the AI it's coordinates or location in the dewey decimle system by telling it the 'books you know' and then asking it to read out the titles between them\n4. i want to focus on highschool to college age students and beyond\n5. I think one way to describe it is finding Steve Job's iPhone and writing the start of the question you have and then starting to click autocomplete button. you'll get Steve Job's like information out relevant to the thing you began. That's amazing. although that's linear. The more interesting stuff comes between two points or more, for instance making a panel of orthogonal experts, or asking it to ask me 5 unique and different questions to help it help me do such and such a goal - just like we are now. do you see how that's interesting?\n\nHelp me understand what you think about me and my idea by describing in as much detail as you can the concept space we have navigated to, what are 10 themes and concepts you can find in all of the content I have shared so far?. \n\nChatGPT\nYour idea reflects a sophisticated and innovative approach to using AI for learning and exploration, particularly in the realm of knowledge navigation and self-directed inquiry. Here are ten themes and concepts that stand out from the content you've shared:\n\nKnowledge Navigation: The central theme of your concept is navigating through a vast space of information, akin to a 'Map of Everything', using AI as a guide. This involves traversing between known points (concepts) to discover new knowledge.\nPersonalized Learning: Emphasizing the creation of unique learning paths based on individual knowledge, experiences, and interests, particularly for high school to college-aged students.\nPrompt Efficacy: The idea of understanding and improving the quality of prompts given to AI, akin to a 'Grammarly for prompting', highlights the importance of effective communication in extracting valuable insights from AI.\nInteractive Learning: Using AI to engage learners in a two-way conversation, where the AI not only answers questions but also poses questions back to the learner, enhancing their understanding and critical thinking.\nConceptual Mapping: The comparison to the Dewey Decimal System suggests a structured yet expansive approach to categorizing and accessing information, which is crucial in a vast, interconnected knowledge space.\nAI as a Tool for Thought: Your concept positions AI not just as a provider of information, but as a catalyst for thought, encouraging users to think deeply and critically about the information presented.\nExploratory Learning: Encouraging learners to explore unknown territories in the knowledge map, which fosters curiosity, discovery, and the development of original insights.\nIntegration of Multiple Perspectives: The idea of creating panels of orthogonal experts using AI, to explore diverse viewpoints and broaden understanding.\nAutocomplete Analogy: Relating AI interactions to using an autocomplete feature in a search engine, but with a focus on exploring the nonlinear, creative paths between different concepts.\nFramework Adaptability: The emphasis on making the learning framework adaptable for different age groups and learning environments, ensuring its broad applicability and effectiveness.\nYour concept challenges traditional learning models by offering a dynamic, AI-enhanced approach to exploring knowledge. It values the uniqueness of each learner's journey and promotes a deep, interactive, and exploratory relationship with information.\nUser\nSummarize what we have as if you're writing a concept note working on preparing this one pager and reference  and 5 related theories and 5 that are aligned to what we are working and then write your proposal for next steps including 3 unique potential question vectors we can travers. A question vector is a list of 3 questions that gradually take us towards our goal filling in knowledge and prerequisites as we go. One question may modify/alter the second question\n\nChatGPT\nConcept Note for One-Pager Development\nProject Overview:\nWe are conceptualizing a novel learning framework that leverages AI to facilitate a dynamic and exploratory approach to education. This framework aims to assist learners, especially those in high school to college age, in navigating the vast landscape of knowledge using AI as an interactive tool.\n\nKey Components:\n\nKnowledge Navigation: Utilizing AI to traverse an expansive 'Map of Everything', akin to exploring a large, interconnected library.\nInteractive Learning: Fostering a dialogic learning process where AI not only responds to but also generates pertinent questions.\nPrompt Improvement Tool: Conceptualizing a 'Grammarly for prompts' to enhance the effectiveness of user interactions with AI.\nMulti-Perspective Exploration: Using AI to simulate panels of diverse experts, providing varied viewpoints on a topic.\nAutocomplete Analogy for Learning: Enabling users to start with a basic idea and explore various extensions and connections, akin to an autocomplete feature.\nTheoretical Foundations:\n\nConstructivist Learning Theory: Emphasizes the learner's active role in constructing knowledge based on experience and interaction.\nConnectivism: Focuses on learning as a network creation process, particularly relevant in the digital age.\nZone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky): Highlights the importance of scaffolded learning, where guidance is tailored to the learner's current capabilities.\nBloom's Taxonomy: Underlines the need for higher-order thinking skills, from basic recall to creative application.\nExperiential Learning (Kolb): Stresses learning through experience, reflective observation, and conceptualization.\nAligned Theories/Concepts:\n\nHeutagogy (Self-Determined Learning): Complements our framework’s emphasis on self-directed exploration.\nDialogic Learning: Echoes our focus on dialogue and question-posing as central to learning.\nInformation Literacy: Aligns with navigating and making sense of vast information landscapes.\nCritical Pedagogy: Encourages learners to question and challenge rather than passively accept information.\nMetacognition: Reflects our emphasis on learners thinking about their own thought processes.\nProposal for Next Steps:\n\nDevelop a Prototype of the 'Grammarly for Prompts' Tool: This tool will assist learners in formulating effective prompts for AI interaction, enhancing the learning experience.\nPilot Study with Target Demographic: Conduct a pilot study in a high school or college setting to gather feedback and assess the practical application of the framework.\nIterative Refinement Based on Feedback: Use insights from the pilot study to refine the framework, focusing on usability and effectiveness in diverse learning environments.\nPotential Question Vectors:\n\nVector 1: Understanding AI’s Role in Learning\n\nHow does AI currently assist in educational contexts?\nIn what ways can AI's role evolve to facilitate more personalized and exploratory learning?\nGiven this evolution, how might AI be integrated into curricula to enhance critical thinking and creativity?\nVector 2: Effective Prompt Design\n\nWhat are common challenges learners face when interacting with AI?\nHow can a prompt improvement tool mitigate these challenges?\nConsidering the tool’s potential impact, what are best practices for designing AI prompts in educational settings?\nVector 3: Integrating Diverse Perspectives\n\nWhy is it important to include multiple perspectives in the learning process?\nHow can AI be used to simulate a panel of experts with orthogonal viewpoints?\nBuilding on this simulation, how can learners be guided to synthesize these diverse perspectives into a cohesive understanding?\nUser\nmy goal is to write a one pager with a framework with a catchy memorable name that helps people remember the main concept easily and that people can take with them when they go into a chatGPT session to learn things they didn't know they needed to learn to do things they didn't know they had to do to achieve their learning and life objectives - you got it wrong, review how you got it wrong and think step by step about where you took the wrong turn.

With these two knowledge points you can imagine that there's a space in a coordinate space where you can place them and between them is a lot of things you don't know anything about - specifically what kind of books do people study in the school where teachers learn to be teachers. you don't know the word pedagogy, yet you'll discover it there. this is how you can use the points in the coordinate space of things you understand to ifnd the things you don't. the technique to uncover it is to then use language and conversation to \"talk things into existence into the light\" by asking the ai to ask you the things that a person who goes to school to learn to be a teacher might need to know - or to ask it to go to that space and find 10 diverse thinkers in that field who might disagree with each other, to expand into the vector space and then offer the person the ability to see/think/select from that space based on curiosity and current understanding. So both talking and selection based on curiosity helps narrow, the AI's job is to elucidate the unseen and help guide further out into dark areas the users job is to narrow and specifiy and select what's useful and to take things out of the system when they're done. it should feel like a gym, like a brain workout. And then they should make NEW knowledge that's the third step. Go into dark with AI between two points, bring into light by selection or answering questions, and then making thinking tools like journal entrees or workplans or workbooks to fill in and make NEW knowledge not in the map. Think of our initial framework, how does what I just described align and how does it expand or bring thigns afresh. review this text in this prompt compared to the scriber framework and find the 5 things that are similar and the 5 things that are unique. List them  and make a table of similarities and differences \n\nVersion 1: Simplified SCRIBER (S-SCRIBER)\n\nStructure: Streamline the original framework into four key steps: Explore, Reflect, Apply, and Review (ERAR).\nFocus: Maintain the core elements but in a more user-friendly format.\nUse: Ideal for younger audiences or introductory courses in AI-assisted learning.\n\nand \nMicroPHD Injections in the Map Of Everything\nI have been thinking that perhaps the one guiding question for people to use this framework and prompting technique best is \"what is a question only you can answer\" directed towards the learner. so they ask themselves that... well... i can answer things in my life, in my understanding, the new insight I just had that I didn't read or think of from anywhere else. like some musicians will \n\\stop listening to any other music to not influence their music. we can go to a space and see what is three to be said and then realize after a long discussion exploring the empty spaces on the map  that perhaps we do have something to say that's new here. We can call that a \"MicroPHD\" or something like that - what do you think about this, summarize why this might be enough and critique it with 5 pros and 5 cons \n\nFor instance, today I think microPHD is a new thought that I thought that I'm not sure anyone else has ever thought. and can qualify as new knowledge for a new question that only I can answer. The question might be: how will education evolve in the future and how can we validate new knowledge, or something else like that \n\n2 / 2\n\n\n\nChatGPT\nThe concept of a \"MicroPHD,\" centered around the guiding question \"What is a question only you can answer?\" is intriguing. It encourages learners to delve into their unique perspectives and experiences to contribute original insights. Here's a summary along with a critique:\n\nSummary: MicroPHD Framework\nCore Idea: Encourages learners to explore and articulate unique insights based on their personal experiences and knowledge.\nGuiding Question: \"What is a question only you can answer?\" This prompts learners to identify and express original thoughts or solutions, drawing on their individual understanding and creativity.\nApplication: It's a method for learners to recognize and value their unique contributions in any field of study, potentially leading to new and original ideas or perspectives.\nRelation to Education: Aligns with the future of education emphasizing individual thought, creativity, and the recognition of personal insights as valuable knowledge.\n. we can talk about it being a Map Of Everything where we can navigate with our words. Each word has an address that takes us places and two words have two different addresses and so there's a lof of unknown space between them - once we go to two places, there's a third space. The space between those two words or phrases or ideas. And we can ask chatGPT to look at the map and describe it. We can't see the map by itself. The map must be traversed to be read so we need to pick points we already know to have the MOE read everything in between those places to trigger new thoughts and new ideas to explore \n2. I asked to create a diverse panel of pedagalogical experts who disagree with eachother to critique my idea of a framework and respond to my questions - it helped me think more clearly\n3. it's a framework they're encouraged to use with chatGPT with example prompts. we'll make a chatbased version on whatsapp so they can just talk to it about their interests and see where it goes\n\n\nChatGPT\nThank you for the additional details. Based on your input, here's a summary that can be developed into a one-pager for high school students:\n\nExploring the Map of Everything with AI: A Guide for Curious Minds\n\nWhat is the Map of Everything (MOE)?\nImagine every word or concept as a destination on a vast map.\nThis map is interconnected: between any two points (words or ideas) lies a whole unexplored territory filled with new knowledge and perspectives.\nYou navigate this map with your words, asking AI to reveal the connections and spaces between known ideas, leading to new discoveries.\nDialogue-Driven Exploration:\nJust like a GPS guides you through unknown roads, AI (like chatGPT) guides you through this knowledge map.\nYour conversation with AI is key: your questions and topics act as coordinates.\nAn example: By creating a virtual panel of diverse pedagogical experts (as if they were points on the map), you can explore different educational theories and perspectives, deepening your understanding.\nApplying the Framework:\nThis approach is not just theoretical; you can practice it using chatGPT or similar AI platforms.\nAn upcoming chat-based version on WhatsApp will make this even more accessible.\nStart with your interests or school subjects, ask chatGPT to explore related ideas, and see where the conversation leads.\nThe goal is to expand your thinking, discover new connections, and develop your unique perspective.\nCreative Contribution:\nAs you explore, you're not just a traveler but also a map-maker, adding your insights to the MOE.\nEach new idea or connection you make is like adding a new coordinate to the map, enriching it for others.\nEncouraging Curiosity and Critical Thinking:\nThis method is all about asking the right questions, not just looking for straightforward answers.\nIt encourages you to think critically, make connections, and approach learning as an exciting journey of discovery.\nExample Prompts to Get You Started:\n\n\"What is the connection between climate change and economic policies?\"\n\"Explore the differing views on digital privacy in various cultures.\"\n\"What would a debate between historical figures about modern technology look like?\"\nRemember, the journey of knowledge is endless, and with the Map of Everything, you have the power to explore it in ways never before possible. Let your curiosity be your compass!\nHypobadges being the smallest unit of knowledge (one paragraphish?)\"\"\"\n\nHow can you answer the question vectors above with this content between the quotation marks\n\n2 / 2\n\n\nChatGPT\nUsing the content provided, let's answer the question vectors:\n\nVector 1: Crafting Effective Prompts\nCommon Characteristics of Insightful AI Responses:\nSpecificity: Like the S.C.R.I.B.E.R. framework's \"Seek\" principle, effective prompts are specific and directed, such as asking about the role of a particular job in answering a question.\nOpen-Endedness: Encouraging exploration and critical thinking, as seen in the Map Of Everything (MOE) approach, where open-ended prompts lead to a broader range of ideas and insights.\nConstructiveness: Aligns with the “Critique” principle, where prompts seek constructive feedback or opposing viewpoints to enhance understanding.\nModifying Basic Prompts:\nIntegrate specific roles or personas, as suggested in S.C.R.I.B.E.R., to target the prompt more effectively.\nIncorporate exploratory elements from MOE, asking the AI to navigate between two known concepts to discover unknown connections.\nGauging Prompt Effectiveness:\nObserve if the AI’s response expands your understanding, similar to \"Reflect\" in S.C.R.I.B.E.R.\nCheck if the response introduces new concepts or connections, as would be expected in exploring the MOE.\nVector 2: Engaging in Exploratory Dialogue\nStarting an Exploratory Conversation:\nBegin with a question that connects two known ideas or fields, mirroring the MOE approach of exploring the space between known points.\nSteering the Conversation Deeper:\nFollow up with more specific inquiries based on the initial response, using the \"Inquire\" and \"Broaden/Contract\" principles of S.C.R.I.B.E.R.\nEnsuring Comprehensive Understanding:\nPose questions that invite critique and alternative viewpoints, resonating with the “Critique” aspect of S.C.R.I.B.E.R.\nAsk the AI to summarize or explain the connections made, akin to the “Explain” principle.\nVector 3: Reflecting and Learning\nReflecting on AI Information:\nAssess relevance and accuracy by comparing AI responses with external sources, as suggested in the \"Verify\" step.\nReflect on how the response relates to your existing knowledge, in line with the \"Reflect\" principle.\nRelating AI Information to Goals:\nIdentify connections between AI-generated insights and personal/professional objectives, inspired by the MOE approach.\nUtilize AI responses to generate action plans or new learning paths, akin to \"Experiment\" and \"Transform.\"\nApplying New Knowledge:\nImplement insights in real-world scenarios, guided by the MOE concept of adding new coordinates to your knowledge map.\nUse AI-driven discoveries to inform decision-making, projects, or further research.\nThese responses leverage the principles of S.C.R.I.B.E.R and the concepts of MOE to address the question vectors, emphasizing the importance of targeted, exploratory, and reflective interactions with AI for effective learning.\nUser\nGauging prompt effectiveness can be done by seeing how large and diverse the concept maps gets or how granular. Once we don't see much of change (derivative of distance between embedded vectors between prompts) we know that the grammarly for prompts can step in.\nOther common characteristics is that it becomes self reflectivive asking what an \"opponent\" or \"outsider\" would think\nOther important characteristics is to have defined personas so we know some \"meta data\" about where the conversation is at and what flavor it will have. - the persona is a scrunched and colorized version of the map. Color is not so important yet scrunched is because you will land in very different places because their coordinate space is distorted to their unique perspectives\n\nhaving a goal is important to the engaging in exploratory dialogue because then you can create question vectors based on that to help guide you. Rather than just giving concepts or two points you can start somewhere and then ask it to \"throw you around the map\" \nAsk it to ask you questions to help you select personas and then ask those personas to ask you questions to help you define sets of questions vectors (expand and contract) ask for orthogonal question vectors, they should all have the objective and goal at the end of them yet take a different path to help you see new ways to your objectives \n\nYou can think of this like an adaptive guided journal of the socratic method. You will come to learn what you already know.\n\nuse the LLM to help you find frameworks or a list of questions to answer for a guided journal that will help you act on your knowledge. \n\nImportant yet missing from here, ask it for blindspots. \n\nTake this information and combine it with your answers to your questions and then ask me 3 questions to help identify what the best format to package this content in. I'm not sure if it should be a one pager or something else? What are the different elements in this conversation, what's our goal, how can I make sure I don't miss any important insights or ideas? how can we take this longramble and make it useful. Our goal is to share a framework to help people use LLMs better to learn the things they don't even know they need to learn to do the things they don't know how to do to achieve and likely modify and achieve their life and work goals\n\nChatGPT\nBased on the comprehensive information provided and the goal of designing a framework to enhance learning with LLMs, I'll propose three questions to help clarify the best format for packaging this content:\n\nWhat Learning Experience Do You Want to Foster?\nConsidering the dynamic nature of this framework, which involves exploratory dialogue, persona-based questioning, and self-reflective learning, would a one-pager sufficiently encapsulate the process's fluidity and adaptability? Or would a more interactive, digital tool, like a web application or an AI-assisted guided journal, provide a better platform for users to engage with these concepts in real-time?\nHow Can We Best Represent the Conceptual Complexity?\nGiven the framework's focus on navigational learning, persona perspectives, and question vectors, is there a need for visual elements, such as maps or flowcharts, that could illustrate these concepts more clearly? Would a static format like a one-pager allow for the inclusion of such visuals, or would a dynamic, interactive format be more suitable?\nHow Can We Ensure Accessibility and Comprehensibility for the Target Audience?\nWho is the primary audience for this framework (e.g., educators, students, professionals)? How can the format be tailored to their needs, considering factors like ease of use, the complexity of content, and the balance between theoretical explanation and practical application? Would they benefit more from a concise, digestible one-pager or a more detailed, guided, and interactive format?\nPotential Elements to Include in the Framework:\nExploratory Dialogue Techniques: Guidelines on how to initiate and navigate conversations with LLMs.\nPersona-Based Inquiry: Instructions for creating and using personas to shape the direction of the learning journey.\nQuestion Vectors: Examples of question sequences that expand and contract ideas, with different pathways leading to the same objective.\nVisual Concept Maps: Dynamic or static maps illustrating the relationships between concepts, questions, and personas.\nSocratic Method for Self-Discovery: Strategies for using the LLM as a tool for self-reflection and uncovering blind spots.\nGuided Journaling Template: A framework or list of questions to facilitate a journaling process that aids in applying newfound knowledge.\nFeedback and Adaptation Guidelines: Tips for adjusting the learning process based on responses and progress.\nGoal Clarification:\nThe primary goal is to enable users to use LLMs effectively to uncover unknown knowledge crucial for their personal and professional development.\nThe secondary goal is to make this process engaging, adaptable, and tailored to individual learning styles and objectives.\nConsidering these factors, the format (whether a one-pager, digital tool, or interactive guide) should be selected based on its ability to clearly convey these complex concepts while remaining user-friendly and adaptable to different learning preferences and goals.\nUser\n1. I think having a one or six pager with some catchy language to help people see the unique ideas that are here. although i'm also not sure what the most unique and most fundamental ideas are. there are a lot - help me figure out which ones are foundational and lead to improved results in prompting for learning \n2. yeah, it might be a good idea to have a flowchart - it could help for the \"grammarly for prompting\" as well as for people to undrestand and use it themselves before we build the grammarly for prompting \n3. the audience is new grad college student entrepreneurs working on becoming social entrepreneurs who need to grow personally and professionally yet might not have a lot of experience and so the tool's ability to expose them to new search terms is essential (new search terms, come to the ai looking for questions not answers, these i think are part of the core way i like to talk about things)\nI like these elements you described:\nExploratory Dialogue Techniques: Guidelines on how to initiate and navigate conversations with LLMs.\nPersona-Based Inquiry: Instructions for creating and using personas to shape the direction of the learning journey.\nOrthogonality towards goal. Move like a jelly fish, puff up and puff out and through that process you can move: one method/technique is question Vectors: Examples of question sequences that expand and contract ideas, with different pathways leading to the same objective.\nVisual Concept Maps: Dynamic or static maps illustrating the relationships between concepts, questions, and personas.\nTechniques list: Guided Journaling Template, Socratic Method for Self-Discovery, asking for blind spots, asking for a panel of diverse experts after asking for the concepts and themes to grill you, taking things step by step and asking the llm to explain it's thinking and to make a model of it's state so you can adjust it, \n\n\n3 / 3\n\n\nChatGPT\nTo create an effective one or six-pager for college graduate entrepreneurs focusing on social entrepreneurship, we need to distill the most foundational and impactful ideas from our discussion. Here's a breakdown of the core concepts, along with suggestions for the flowchart and format:\n\nFundamental Concepts:\nExploratory Dialogue Techniques: Teaching users how to effectively initiate and steer conversations with LLMs. This is crucial for uncovering new knowledge and perspectives.\nPersona-Based Inquiry: This approach allows users to explore different viewpoints and understandings, vital for developing a well-rounded perspective in social entrepreneurship.\nOrthogonality and Question Vectors: Emphasizing non-linear, multi-dimensional exploration. The jellyfish metaphor (expanding and contracting ideas) can be a unique aspect of the framework, guiding users to explore various paths toward their goals.\nDynamic Concept Maps: Visualizing the connections between concepts, questions, and personas. This can be instrumental in understanding the breadth and depth of a topic.\nTechniques for Deeper Understanding:\nGuided Journaling Template: Encourages reflection and application of new insights.\nSocratic Method for Self-Discovery: Helps in unearthing underlying assumptions and biases.\nIdentifying Blind Spots: Essential for comprehensive understanding and informed decision-making.\nPanel of Diverse Experts Simulation: Encourages consideration of multiple perspectives on a topic.\nStep-by-Step Explanation and Model Adjustment: Enhances understanding of AI responses and fosters critical thinking.\nFlowchart and Format:\nA flowchart can be an excellent visual aid, outlining the steps in the learning process using the LLM. It can show the journey from initiating a dialogue with AI, through exploring different personas, to applying the insights gained.\nFor the one-pager:\nFocus on succinctly presenting the core concepts.\nUse catchy, memorable language to engage the audience.\nInclude a miniature version of the flowchart for a quick overview.\nFor the six-pager:\nDelve into each concept with more detail.\nProvide examples or case studies specific to social entrepreneurship.\nInclude a larger, more detailed flowchart.\nConsiderations for College Graduate Entrepreneurs:\nSince the target audience is new to both personal and professional growth, the language should be accessible yet inspiring.\nEmphasize the utility of the framework in discovering new search terms and questions – critical for those beginning their journey in a rapidly evolving field like social entrepreneurship.\nQuestions to Guide Further Development:\nWhat specific challenges in social entrepreneurship could this framework address?\nThis will help tailor the content to the audience's immediate needs.\nHow can we integrate success stories or testimonials to illustrate the framework's effectiveness?\nReal-world examples can provide inspiration and context.\nWhat are the key learning outcomes you envision for the users of this framework?\nUnderstanding this will ensure the content is aligned with users' goals.\nThe aim is to create a tool that not only informs but also empowers and inspires these new entrepreneurs to explore, learn, and grow effectively using LLMs.\nUser\n1. the fact that people don't have mentors who are experts in all the domains they need available 24/7\n2. we can do a demo of previous teams who have used it to make progress on their logo by figuring out there was such thing as a style guide and building that before asking the Ai to make their logo. \n3. that people are independantly learning and making progress towards their goals. So measuring goal momentum \n\nThink step by step about where we are in the conversation and how we got here. Write out the summary, a list of concepts, a list of goals and, 3 current questions you have about how to achieve them\n\n\nChatGPT\nReflecting on our conversation, we've traversed a path of understanding and conceptualizing a learning framework using LLMs. Here's a structured breakdown of our discussion:\n\nConversation Summary:\nWe started with the concept of using AI for exploratory learning and knowledge navigation, focusing on crafting effective prompts and engaging in dialogue with AI.\nThe idea evolved into developing a practical tool/framework, tailored specifically for social entrepreneurs and new graduates, to enhance their learning experience and decision-making capabilities.\nEmphasis was placed on overcoming the lack of 24/7 expert mentors through AI, utilizing AI to discover new concepts, and focusing on personalized learning paths.\nThe framework's development led us to consider a one or six-pager format, integrating fundamental concepts such as exploratory dialogue, persona-based inquiry, and dynamic concept maps.\nWe acknowledged the importance of demonstrating real-life applications and measuring progress towards goals.\nList of Key Concepts:\nExploratory Dialogue Techniques\nPersona-Based Inquiry\nOrthogonality in Learning (Jellyfish Metaphor)\nQuestion Vectors\nDynamic Concept Maps\nGuided Journaling and Socratic Methods\nBlind Spot Identification\nExpert Panel Simulation\nGoal Momentum Measurement\nList of Goals:\nDevelop a Framework: Create an easy-to-use, engaging tool for learning through LLMs, particularly for social entrepreneurs.\nAccessibility and Usability: Ensure the framework is accessible to graduates without extensive experience, focusing on discovery and exploration.\nReal-World Application Demonstration: Showcase how previous teams have successfully used this framework to achieve tangible results.\nGoal Progress Measurement: Incorporate methods to track and measure users' progress towards their personal and professional objectives.\nCurrent Questions to Achieve Goals:\nHow can we best illustrate the framework's usability and benefits in a one or six-pager format?\nConsidering the complex concepts, what design and presentation strategies can be employed to make the framework both informative and engaging?\nIn what ways can we integrate real-life applications and success stories into the framework?\nHow can we showcase examples like the logo development process to demonstrate practical application and inspire users?\nWhat tools or methods can be incorporated into the framework for users to measure their goal momentum?\nHow can we facilitate users in tracking their learning journey and progress towards their objectives using this framework?\nBy answering these questions, we can refine the framework to ensure it effectively meets the needs of our target audience, providing them with a valuable tool for their entrepreneurial and personal growth journeys.\"\"\"\n\nThink step by step about your goal to make  a counterintuitive and eye opening yet simple and surprisingly meaningful and true sounding and feeling framework that is easy for social entrepreneurs to use to learn the things they don't know the need to learn to do the things they don't yet know how to do to acheive the goals they are evolving towards through the process of learning, introspecting and doing with the AI. six pager, make a plan for how to use the content above effectively.

This can visually communicate how different approaches or perspectives intersect yet remain independent.\n    - **Persona-Based Inquiry**: Create avatars or personas, each representing a different stakeholder or target audience. Place these avatars in scenarios or dialogues that demonstrate how varying viewpoints can be integrated into decision-making and strategy.\n\n3. **Balancing Theoretical Information and Practical Application**:\n    - **Content Structure**: Aim for a 30-40% theoretical and 60-70% practical application ratio. Start with fundamental concepts (the 'why' and 'what') and transition into practical applications (the 'how').\n    - **Case Studies and Examples**: Incorporate real-world scenarios or case studies that illustrate the application of theoretical concepts. For example, show how a real social enterprise applied orthogonality in their strategy.\n    - **Actionable Steps and Tools**: Provide tools, checklists, or frameworks that readers can directly apply to their projects.
