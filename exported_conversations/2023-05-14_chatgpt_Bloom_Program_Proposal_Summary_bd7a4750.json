According to Gallup, disengaged employees cost their company the equivalent of 18% of their annual salary. Other sources calculate losses at up to 34% of a disengaged employee's annual salary. On an individual level, the average business loses a minimum of $2,246 for every disengaged employee.20 Apr 2023\nProposal for Bloom Pilot Program Partnership with Wise Systems\nMay 2023\nIntroduction\nAt Bloom PM, we understand the importance of a healthy hybrid work culture. We are excited to present a pilot program to support and improve your employees' personal and professional growth, leveraging our extensive experience as a social enterprise accelerator.\nSince 2015 we have been developing our values-based personal and professional growth methodology for entrepreneurship education, fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. Through our programs, we've impacted thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, many of which have launched, grown, and mobilized millions in funding.\nGallup's validated Q12 engagement survey indicates that only 20% of the world's workers are engaged and since the pandemic in 2020 it has been on the decline resulting in lower performance. We believe in the power of remote/hybrid organizations and that it’s possible to take advantage of going remote/hybrid.\nRemote work, when leveraged correctly, allows companies to save money, boost employee productivity, and improve retention. Using our tried and tested models and concepts in The Bloom Method, we help individuals and organizations outline a working model for productivity and engagement. We identify and implement coaching solutions to propel learning, organizational effectiveness, and personal and professional development.\nWhat We Can Do For Wise Systems\nIn 2023, offices worldwide struggle to balance rising employee demand for more remote flexibility, less meeting time, and work-life balance with a need to keep employees engaged, productive, and motivated. \nAt Bloom, we transitioned in 2018 to operating our organization and delivering customer services in fully remote or hybrid environments. Using cutting-edge tools, positive reinforcement strategies, and strengths-based development, we have grown our company to 4 continents and 12 hours of time difference while remaining on the leading edge of business acceleration programs in the MENA region. \nWith this program, you can expect the following:\nIncreased Employee Engagement: The tailored activities and personalized growth plans will help ignite each employee's passion and motivation to contribute meaningfully to the organization.\nHealthier Remote Work Culture: Our program focuses on creating a supportive remote work environment, addressing remote employees' challenges, and promoting a sense of belonging and connectedness with the team.\nEnhanced Organizational Performance: With improved engagement levels, your employees will be better equipped to collaborate, innovate, and drive growth, leading to positive impacts on Wise Systems' performance.\nAssessing Impact \nTo evaluate the impact of our pilot program on remote work engagement and effectiveness, we propose working with Wise Systems to assess the following KPIs to monitor progress and ensure our solution aligns with your organization's goals:\nRemote work capacity: Assessed across the organization.\nEmployee engagement: Assessed by team members\nProductivity: Assessed during the program we will monitor/report team member accomplishments, streaks, and post-program monitoring of selected KPIs.\n“Disengaged employees cost the world $7.8 trillion a year in lost productivity.”\n-State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report \nProgram Overview\nBloom PM's pilot program aims to catalyze positive change in your remote work culture and improve overall team health, productivity, and performance. Our program will be tailored to suit the unique needs of Wise Systems, and we have a few options for engaging with our training ranging from light touch to training one of your team members - such as an HR representative or team lead - on our methodology so that it may become a repeatable process ingrained in your organizational culture. In addition, they will receive weekly coaching to successfully implement our combined personal and professional growth method within your organization.\nThe Bloom Method\nOur methodology  helps people and teams identify their shared purpose and build towards enhanced shared success. We use reflective practices, personal and professional development assessments, and a library of activities designed to help your employees thrive at work holistically. \nWe focus on fostering self-awareness and identification of purpose at work, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid word environments. These tools, including recent integrations with AI,  will allow your trained team member to facilitate and support your employees' ongoing growth and development.\nThree key principles of a successful Bloom program are:\nOur values and strengths power our performance: We help participants identify their sources of meaning at work that unlocks energy and capacity for committed learning and development in their “missions.”\nAction-based learning loops: Participants are guided to design a “mission” every two weeks. A mission is a performance objective they want to achieve each cycle, including reflecting on past learnings and planning next best steps.\nLearning by doing together: Promote collaboration and mutual support, especially online, since usually two heads are better than one.\n“[Taking the assessments] did open up my eyes to a lot of things. For example, although I knew I had these problems when I wrote them down and shared them with the team and heard their feedback, I completely understood that those are things I should be taking seriously and solving ASAP.”\t\n- Le Joyau d’Olive (Accelerator Participant 2021)\nSuggested Approaches \nTier 1, The Basics\nEngagement: 3 weeks\nTier 2, The Standard\nEngagement: 5 weeks\nTier 3, Deep Learning\nEngagement: 10 weeks\n• Intro info by email \n\n• Pre-workshop assessments \n\n• 2 hour participatory online workshop reviewing challenges, priorities, goals, and setting action plans … and direct focused adaptive learning during the workshop  \n\n• Two weeks of self-guided implementation \n\n• Follow-on 2 hour participatory online workshop, reviewing progress, and setting next-stage action plans   \nBasics program, plus: \n\n1 additional group session 2 weeks later\n\n~~ plus ~~\n\nA 40-minute 1-on-1 coaching session for up to 5 people on your team. \n\nor\n\nA 2-hour intro train-the-trainer workshop to improve facilitation/online facilitation skills on your team plus help people from your team continue supporting your team using Bloom’s assessments and library.\nPlus observe TOT trainees deliver a workshop or session, and provide them with written feedback post-session.  \n\n\n\nStandard program, plus: \n\n3 month program, 6 group sessions total \n\n~~ plus ~~\n\n2 x 40-minute 1-on-1 coaching sessions for up to 5 people on your team. \n\nor\n\n2 x 2-hour train-the-trainer workshops to improve facilitation/online facilitation skills on your team plus help people from your team continue supporting your team using Bloom’s assessments and library.\nIncludes 2 TOT facilitation observation sessions, facilitator certificates, and guidance in follow-on program design.

An engaged employee is one who is connected to their workplace, committed to their job, and invested in the growth of the organization. When employees are engaged, they feel: More aligned with their company\\u2019s purpose More connected to their peers Greater motivation while completing tasks and projects Higher morale and worth at work Employers reap the following benefits of an engaged workforce: Increased employee retention Increased employee productivity and efficiency Higher profitability Better customer service provided by employees Greater interest and recruiting ability for job candidates Overall, employee engagement and job satisfaction result in higher business performance. Both employees and employers benefit from promoting and practicing engagement, making it a top priority for any organization. However, the majority of workers are not engaged in their jobs, resulting in often overlooked consequences for companies. To understand the importance of employee engagement and how to improve it, let\\u2019s explore the following nine crucial employee engagement statistics: 1. 85% of employees are not engaged at work According to Gallup\\u2019s recent State of the Workplace report, a significant proportion of employees are not fully engaged in their work. Specifically, 85% of employees are either unengaged or actively disengaged. Unengaged employees, who make up 67% of this group, are indifferent to the success of their company and do the bare minimum required of them. They are often referred to as \\u201c quiet quitters ,\\u201d as they may not overtly express their dissatisfaction but are unlikely to go above and beyond in their work. On the other hand, actively disengaged employees are not just indifferent, but actively resentful of their current work environment and may act out their unhappiness, potentially harming their colleagues\\u2019 work in the process. In June 2020, employee engagement fell to a record low at 31%. This sudden decrease could be partially explained by the COVID-19 pandemic, political and social turmoil, or high unemployment rates. Even post-pandemic, however, employee engagement continues to decline. The consequences of a disengaged workforce can be damaging for any organization, resulting in lower productivity, higher turnover rates, and increased absenteeism. 2. Highly engaged employees are 87% less likely to leave their employer More than a third of US employees plan to leave their jobs in 2023, and nearly three-quarters reported that they would consider quitting if the right opportunity arose, even if they weren\\u2019t looking for a new job at the moment. Switching jobs boils down to more than salary; in fact, 71% of Gen Zers would accept a pay cut in order to do more meaningful work. Employees are 87% less likely to quit a job if they are engaged in the workplace, and an integral factor of engagement is company purpose . Unfortunately, 22% of employees feel completely disconnected from their company\\u2019s purpose. There is a clear opportunity for employers to create a work environment where workers feel valued, and their duties have meaning. With US employers spending $2.9 million per day looking for replacement workers, it is in companies\\u2019 best interest to invest in employee engagement in order to save money and increase retention. 3. Disengaged employees cost an additional $3,400 for every $10,000 in salary Disengaged employees are lower-performing than their engaged peers on multiple levels. They have an 18% lower productivity rate, 15% lower profitability rate, and higher absenteeism rate, with a 37% increased likelihood of taking time off work. On average, a disengaged employee costs a company 34% of their annual salary, or $3,400 for every $10,000 the employee makes. Other than connecting employees\\u2019 jobs to an organizational mission, The Conference Board suggests that companies encourage personal agency, giving employees the opportunity to take ownership over their tasks and responsibilities. This will allow them to reach their full potential while becoming increasingly invested in their work. With self-agency comes a heightened sense of responsibility and pride in one\\u2019s accomplishments, leading to improved job satisfaction and performance. 4. Companies with the highest rates of employee engagement are 21% more profitable When it comes to business profitability, employee engagement is a fundamental factor. Companies with a highly engaged workforce are 21% more profitable and 17% more productive than those with disengaged staff. Engaged employees outperform their peers because they tend to be more innovative, efficient, and have higher customer retention rates. Strong employee engagement is an undeniable advantage to employers who are more likely to achieve a successful and profitable business. Gong, a revenue operations and intelligence company, serves as a prime example of how investing in employee experience and engagement can lead to better company performance. An impressive 92% of Gong employees rated the company as a great place to work, compared to the industry average of just 59%. This positive culture has not gone unnoticed by industry experts, as Gong was recognized by Forrester in 2022 as a clear leader in its market, receiving the highest possible scores in 13 different evaluation criteria. Additionally, on G2, an enterprise software review site, Gong is ranked as the top solution in three out of the four categories it is listed in. These accolades demonstrate the tangible business benefits that can result from a positive and supportive work environment for employees. 5. 69% of employees report that they would work harder if they felt more appreciated at work Employee recognition matters for employees\\u2019 overall job satisfaction and employers\\u2019 ability to retain high-performing and engaged workers. Research shows that when employees are frequently recognized for their efforts, they are more likely to stay with the company and perform their best because they feel motivated and valued. Showing employees appreciation is key to retaining top talent. Recognition goes beyond notable achievements; it can be as simple as thanking an employee for having a positive attitude, acknowledging their work ethic, or identifying ways they have improved. Expressing gratitude towards employees does not have to be public, either. In fact, 43% prefer to receive recognition one-on-one with their manager. Regular check-ins with employees in which employers ask for feedback and praise their employees will boost workers\\u2019 morale and encourage them to work harder. 6. 89% of Human Resources professionals claim that providing ongoing feedback and clear expectations are optimal for increasing employee engagement Ongoing feedback is incredibly valuable for increasing employee engagement. This can be done through consistent co-worker feedback and regular check-ins between employees and managers. Setting clear expectations is another essential recommendation for employees to perform optimally and remain engaged. When setting expectations, employers should be as specific as possible with clear job descriptions and deadlines for tasks or projects. Additionally, employers should ensure employees are provided with resources such as access to training and development materials and support from team members. Providing transparent standards reduces confusion, builds trust in the workplace, and increases efficiency. Encouraging work-life boundaries is essential to setting expectations, especially considering the backlash towards hustle culture . This includes avoiding making \\u201cfun\\u201d activities mandatory , offering breaks when needed, and ensuring workers leave the office on time. Employers can model behavior that reflects work-life balance, setting the tone for employees to maximize their productivity during work hours while maintaining separation from home and personal life. This will improve working performance and minimize burnout . 7. Strong company culture increases revenue 4x In a long-term study conducted over 11 years, companies with thriving corporate cultures grew 682% in revenue, while those that lacked good company culture grew only 166% in revenue. They found that a strong corporate culture highly\\u00a0values employees, customers, and owners while also fostering leadership from everyone in the organization. Developing strong organizational culture means creating an environment that is both challenging and supportive for employees. Successful companies experience greater profitability, retention, and increased engagement from workers. Employees who feel a strong sense of belonging and purpose are more likely to be proactive in problem-solving, express their ideas and opinions, and seek out opportunities for collaboration. Thus, emphasizing a positive company culture should be a priority for employers. 8. 89% of employees working for companies with wellness programs are engaged and happy with their job The overwhelming majority of US employees who work for a company with a wellness program report being happy with their job and would recommend it to a friend. Only 17% of employees would recommend a company that is not committed to improving the well-being of its workforce. Employers that want to attract top talent should implement a holistic wellness program that supports all dimensions of well-being. Sixty-seven percent of employees are not thriving in their overall well-being at work, so job seekers today are looking for companies prioritizing various aspects of employee health and offering meaningful benefits. A comprehensive wellness program can help employers stand out from the competition, making them more attractive to potential jobseekers. 9. Only 29% of employees are pleased with career advancement opportunities One report revealed that while 41% of employees consider career advancement opportunities extremely important to overall job satisfaction, only 29% are \\u201cvery satisfied\\u201d with the current opportunities at their company. Providing professional development resources and training is essential for positive employee engagement. Employers should consider providing roadmaps to new employees who are aiming to work their way up the organization\\u2019s ladder. This is especially important for younger generations, including millennials, who perceive career development opportunities to be very important. Access to mentors and experts who can provide insight and promote their professional growth will encourage employees to sharpen the skills needed to succeed. Takeaway A lack of employee engagement is detrimental to companies and could be the root cause of a failing business. The greatest companies maintain a workforce who have an emotional connection to the organization\\u2019s success. The workplace engagement statistics outlined above highlight the repercussions of employee disengagement and the rewards of actively promoting and pursuing engagement. The advantages are evident in employees\\u2019 performance, productivity, profitability, and job satisfaction. With these considerations, employers can save themselves from detrimental outcomes and promote business success by focusing on employee engagement.

While engaged employees are personally invested in their company\\u2019s success, disengaged workers are simply trying to get through the day. Employee disengagement is when staff limit their participation and contribution in the workplace. Frequent absenteeism, poor customer service, and lack of involvement in team collaboration are just a few of the telltale signs of a disengaged employee. Impact of Disengaged Employees on an Organization The impacts of employee disengagement extend to just about every aspect of your business operations. Think of it as a domino effect. Disengaged employees become less motivated in their jobs, which leads to less involvement in the workplace. Absenteeism increases and productivity plunges. There\\u2019s also less participation in team events and collaborative processes. Not to mention, disengaged employees often give poor reviews of their company and tend to discourage others from using brand products and services. In effect, the impacts of employee disengagement can be summarized as: Less productivity Higher turnover Lower rate of innovation Decline in customer satisfaction Less profitability Challenges finding new talent Needless to say, employee disengagement can have far-reaching negative effects on business performance. But before you begin putting the blame on employees, it\\u2019s important to remember that the workplace environment has the biggest impact on employee engagement. For these reasons, it\\u2019s important to identify the signs of employee disengagement and start implementing strategies to tackle them head-on.

Employee Disengagement Statistics to Understand As the great resignation continues, employee disengagement statistics remain staggering.

Gallup research shows that disengaged employees have a 37% higher absenteeism rate. This results in 18% lower productivity and 15% lower profitability. The average cost According to Gallup , disengaged employees cost their company the equivalent of 18% of their annual salary. Other sources calculate losses at up to 34% of a disengaged employee\\u2019s annual salary . On an individual level, the average business loses a minimum of $2,246 for every disengaged employee. Lost productivity alone resulting from employee disengagement costs businesses between $3,400 and $10,000. Disengaged employees also have a direct impact on customer complaints and client disengagement . This can have additional costs in the long run. Benefits of Employee Engagement While employee disengagement can impart a hefty blow to your bottom line, employee engagement can help re-balance the scales.

How to Calculate the Cost of Employee Disengagement in 4 Steps While you may already be seeing the toll of employee disengagement first-hand, proving it with data will help you make a stronger case. This is especially important if you\\u2019re trying to build a business case for internal communications software , employee engagement apps , and other tools to drive engagement. The importance of internal communication goes beyond informing employees about team absences and software upgrades. Employee communications are designed to drive employee engagement. Here are a few key steps for demonstrating the cost of employee disengagement on business. 1. Determine and highlight the average employee disengagement rate The first step to calculating the cost of disengagement is estimating the number of disengaged workers across your organization. There are a few ways to do this. You can research the most up-to-date average employee disengagement rate for your region and use this as a basis for your calculations. For instance, as of 2022, Gallup reports that 16% of U.S. workers are actively disengaged. For a more tailored analysis, you can conduct an Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) survey. This will determine the approximate disengagement rate in your specific organization. With ContactMonkey, you can embed eNPS surveys directly into your employee emails. Employee engagement rates are then calculated based on a single focused question, which employees evaluate on a scale from 1-10: 2. Multiply the total number of employees by the average disengagement rate Once you have a rough estimate of the employee disengagement rate in your organization, the next step is to calculate the total amount of disengaged workers at your company. You can do this by multiplying the average rate of employee disengagement (which you\\u2019ve gathered in step one), by the total amount of employees in your company. Your calculation will look something like this: 3,000 total employees X 16% disengagement rate = 480 disengaged workers 3. Multiply the average percentage cost of disengagement by your median salary Now that you have an estimate for the number of disengaged workers, it\\u2019s time to look at the expenses. For more accurate results, you\\u2019ll first need to calculate the median salary in your organization. Once you have this number, you\\u2019ll need to multiply it by the average cost of employee disengagement. According to Gallup, the most recent number stands at 18%. So your calculation should look like this: 100,000 median salary X 18% = $18,000 4. Multiply average cost per disengaged employee by total number of employees Now that you\\u2019ve gathered all of your key data points, it\\u2019s time to add up the numbers. To get the total annual cost of employee disengagement, you\\u2019ll need to multiply the number of disengaged employees in your organization (step 2) by the average cost of a single disengaged employee (step 4). If you\\u2019ve been following along with our example, your final equation should look a lot like this: $18,000 (average cost per disengaged employee) X 480 (total estimate of disengaged employees in your organization) = $8,640 000 How to Motivate an Employee Who is Disengaged When you begin noticing the first signs of employee disengagement, it\\u2019s important to act fast. The quicker you can begin tackling the issue at hand, the less it will cost your company in the long run. Here are a few employee engagement best practices to set you on the right track: Conduct regular surveys: If you\\u2019re not exactly sure how to engage a disengaged employee, who better to ask than your staff themselves? ContactMonkey\\u2019s pulse surveys let you gather anonymous feedback and ask open-ended employee engagement questions straight from your internal newsletter. Opposed to asynchronous communications , employee surveys can be conducted on a recurring basis to elicit comparable results. Prioritize work/life balance: Stress and exhaustion are some of the leading causes of employee disengagement. By offering more wellness resources and opportunities, such as unlimited vacation days, you can help employees fend off burnout and disengagement. Amp up your employee recognition ideas : Everyone wants to be appreciated for their hard work. When employees feel valued by their company, it motivates them to keep up the effort and envision a future at the organization. Offer more professional development opportunities: Feeling like your job is a dead end would lead even the most optimistic employee to disengage. By offering more employee coaching and professional development opportunities, you can help staff see their full potential at your company.

We're excited to offer a pilot program designed to support and enhance your employees' personal and professional growth. \n\nSince 2015, we've been developing our values-based personal and professional growth methodology for entrepreneurship education, fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. Our programs have impacted thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, many of which have launched, grown, and mobilized millions in funding.\n\n## The Problem\n\nAccording to Gallup, only 20% of the world's workers are engaged, and this number has been on the decline since the pandemic in 2020, resulting in lower performance. Disengaged employees cost their companies the equivalent of 18% to 34% of their annual salary. On an individual level, the average business loses a minimum of $2,246 for every disengaged employee. This amounts to a staggering $7.8 trillion a year in lost productivity globally.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nAt Bloom, we believe in the power of remote/hybrid organizations. We know that when leveraged correctly, remote work allows companies to save money, boost employee productivity, and improve retention.
