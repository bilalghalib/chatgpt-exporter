Here are my suggestions:\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n#### 1. **Help Participants Recall a Meaningful Moment**\n- **Add specific prompts** to make it easier for participants to reflect, such as:  \n  - \"Think of a moment when you felt really alive or happy. What were you doing?\"  \n  - \"Was there a time this year you felt deeply connected to someone or something? What was happening?\"  \n  - \"Did you have a moment where you felt truly proud, peaceful, or inspired?\"\n\n#### 2. **Make the \"What I Want to Feel\" Section More Accessible**\n- Provide a **list of emotions or values** as a reference, such as:  \n  - Examples: joyful, peaceful, creative, connected, brave, curious, inspired, grounded.  \n\n#### 3. **Expand the \"What I Want to Pay Attention To\" Section**\n- Add a question to guide deeper thinking:  \n  - \"What was the most important part of that moment? What made it meaningful?\"  \n  - \"What do you want to notice or focus on more in your daily life?\"\n\n#### 4. **Encourage Brainstorming for Actions**\n- Add prompts to make the \"Things that help me live this way\" section more robust:  \n  - \"What small habits or rituals could help you feel this way?\"  \n  - \"Who or what could support you in bringing this value alive?\"  \n  - \"What is one easy action you can do this week to start?\"\n\n#### 5. **Enhance the Visual Layout**\n- Use **icons or images** for each section to make it feel more engaging and approachable.\n- Include **more white space** between the steps to avoid overwhelming participants.\n- Highlight examples in a visually distinct box to make them easy to find.\n\n#### 6. **Include a Reflection for Bringing It to Life**\n- Add a reflection question at the end, such as:  \n  - \"How would your life feel different if you focused on these values more next year?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Example Updated Content**\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Recall a Meaningful Moment**  \n- Think of a moment this year that felt deeply meaningful to you.  \n- **What happened?**  \n  *Example:* \"I had a picnic in the park with my friends. We laughed, shared stories, and felt connected.\"  \n\n**Step 2: Identify What You Want to Feel**  \n- **What feeling or value did this moment reflect?**  \n  *Example:* \"I want to feel connected and joyful.\"  \n\n**Step 3: List Small Actions to Support It**  \n- **What simple things help you feel this way?**  \n  *Example:* \"Scheduling regular meetups with friends, calling someone weekly, and putting my phone away during conversations.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Worksheet Table**\n\n| **I want to feel...**   | **What I want to pay attention to...**     | **Things that help me live this way...**               |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| *Example:* Connected    | *Example:* Time with loved ones           | *Example:* Scheduling regular game nights.           |\n| *Example:* Creative     | *Example:* Opportunities to create freely | *Example:* Keeping art supplies within reach.        |\n| *Example:* Grounded     | *Example:* Simple, quiet moments          | *Example:* Meditating or walking in nature daily.    |\n\n---\n\nThis revised structure and added guidance would help participants dive deeper into their reflections and turn their insights into meaningful, actionable steps for the year ahead.",
