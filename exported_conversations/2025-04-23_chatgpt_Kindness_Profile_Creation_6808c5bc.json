Identify 1-3 ways of living that create a sense of meaning and aliveness for me\n2. For each source, create 2-4 \"attention_policies\" that capture what specifically I find meaningful to pay attention to\n3. Format each policy starting with a plural noun phrase in CAPS (e.g., \"MOMENTS\", \"CONNECTIONS\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\") followed by a specific qualifier\n4. Make these precise and actionable - what exactly would I find meaningful to notice or attend to?\n\nFor the \"active_tensions\" section:\n1. Identify situations where I might experience conflict between what I find meaningful and what I feel obligated to do\n2. Note emotional signals that might indicate these tensions (frustration, guilt, etc.)\n3. Suggest how these tensions might be addressed through acts of kindness\n\nFor each field, include only information you're reasonably confident about based on our conversations. Leave fields blank if uncertain.\n\nAfter generating the JSON profile, please add a brief paragraph explaining which 2-3 types of kindness activities would likely be most energizing for me based on this profile, and why.",

You thrive on narrative shifts and witnessing others' growth.\n\n2. **Kindness through Conceptual Tools** – Sharing prompts, small frameworks, or playful thought experiments that help others connect to their values. You enjoy building things that catalyze insight—like designing a “Kindness Profile Generator” for others.\n\n3. **Anonymous or Playful Insight Gifting** – Writing postcards, leaving audio notes, or creating digital “gift tools” (like tiny personal GPTs) where you share wisdom or encouragement without needing attribution. These allow you to give freely, avoid pressure, and feed your own sense of meaning.\n\nWant to test out an activity now based on this profile? I can suggest one and walk you through it.",
