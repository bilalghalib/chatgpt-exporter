      "content": "If you're the cofounder and most senior person with 15 years of experience, you would likely be seen as a key leader or executive with significant authority and responsibility within your organization. Your status could be defined by your leadership role, deep experience, and strategic vision. People would likely turn to you for major decisions, guidance, and setting the overall direction of the organization, especially given your extended tenure. Depending on the organization, you might hold titles like Co-Founder & CEO, Co-Founder & Executive Director, or something that reflects your seniority and decision-making capacity.\n\nFor the second part of your question, based on your previous information, you have worked in Lebanon (through Bloom.pm) and other countries in the Middle East. However, you haven’t provided a complete list of developing countries where you've worked or the years of assignment. From your background, we know you've worked with entrepreneurial ecosystems, including Lebanon and likely other Middle Eastern countries, though specifics about other countries or years weren't mentioned directly.\n\nIf you'd like, I can assist in generating a more specific list with the exact countries and years if you provide additional details!",

      "content": "Given that you're the cofounder of a nonprofit in Lebanon and are an American living in France, here’s what **ASG** and **USG** typically refer to:\n\n- **USG (U.S. Government)**: This usually refers to positions or roles within U.S. government agencies or organizations directly affiliated with the U.S. government, such as the Department of State, USAID, etc. If you have any involvement with U.S. government grants or projects, this could be relevant, but it’s generally more tied to governmental roles.\n\n- **ASG (Alternative Service Group)**: This is a less commonly used designation, but in some cases, it might refer to an alternative service or a specific category within organizations such as nonprofits or international bodies. It might also represent an independent or non-governmental approach.\n\nSince your nonprofit is in Lebanon, and you're based in France, **ASG** is likely the more appropriate choice because it’s a broader, more inclusive label that could apply to senior management in international nonprofits, including your nonprofit organization in Lebanon. \n\nDoes that distinction make sense for your situation?",

You likely have ultimate decision-making authority, strategic oversight, and high-level responsibility for guiding the organization’s direction.\n\n- **Senior Management**: If your role is more directly involved in day-to-day management but still at a senior level, this could also be a good fit, particularly if you are overseeing a broad set of operations.\n\n- **Management - D-1 or D-2**: These titles are typically seen in international or UN-like structures. If you're working in an international capacity, or if your organization operates on that level, these could apply, though they often refer to roles like country or regional management.\n\nGiven your description as a cofounder in a nonprofit based in Lebanon, I’d lean toward **Senior Executive**, as it reflects your leadership role well. Would you like to explore more specific details about your responsibilities or clarify your daily functions to see if another level fits better?",
