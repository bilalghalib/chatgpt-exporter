      "content": "Okay, so I'm in a moment where I need to really maybe fix my online presence and persona, and I have some things that I'd like to do, but like my website is so old and I'm not even sure what it says about me, like I feel like it's my kid self online. You can check it out. It's BilalGhalib.com, B-I-L-A-L-G-H-A-L-I-B.com, and I really like some help thinking about, you know, like I don't feel like I can share online, and I'm such a critic, and I don't know if it's a critic in a good way, a healthy way, or a unhealthy way, and you know, I want to be using social media differently and not actually using it quite as much at all, but at the same time I know it's how people connect online, and I know that there's like great uses of it, but I also feel really ashamed to use it during a time of genocide and war, and I feel like the only thing I should be doing is sharing about these problems. I also need work, like you know, I'm like now sort of working on getting new work and contracts, and like I don't feel like my website engenders trust, and I'm just so critical I think of the UN and of everybody, and I think everyone is stupid, and that's not healthy I think, but I don't know what to do instead, and so I need to kind of take this and break it into pieces, and think what are the things that I want to do, what's going to help me, who's going to help me, how do I trust people, how do I love people, and then thinking against, against, against, and saying okay yeah, so let's doubt everything, let's not work on social media, let's go quiet, and maybe it protects me from a lot of things, but also I feel like I'm a loud person, I have a personality and a lot of ideas, and I really want to find a way of getting it out there, and I actually love some people that have been very consistently blogging and showing something, and I think my website shows something very different, so I want to like work on my website, maybe get a haircut, get a new outfit, and then just be more confident in the world, you know, and even if it is confident in my taking a step back from being like, hi, welcome to Pillai TV on social media, I'm going to talk to you, and like actually being who I am, which is like long-form interviewers, and but like why am I sharing if I don't consume, I always feel like this tension here, and so let's, can you help me think step by step, ask me some deep like profound questions, like a professional coach, and therapist, and psychologist, you know me, like look at our chat history, and help me figure out how to do this well, in a way that's sustainable, and I won't just like, oh work on it, work on it, work on it, put up some like stupid blog posts, and then call it done, and then never touch it again, like what, what would Derek Sivers do, and Seth Godin, and other people that I admire, and I don't really, yeah maybe I don't want to share, because I don't admire myself or something, I don't know.",

      "content": "You’re not crazy for feeling all of this at once.  \n\nFrom what you wrote, I hear at least four tangled threads:\n\n1. **Moral tension** – “How can I show up online while genocide and war continue?”\n2. **Self-critique** – “Everyone is stupid / I don’t trust institutions / maybe I don’t admire myself either.”\n3. **Practical need** – “I need work, I want my site to engender trust.”\n4. **Expression tension** – “I’m a loud, idea-full person… but I don’t want to be ‘BilalTV influencer mode’.”\n\nLet’s hold all of those at once and *still* move, gently, and in pieces.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What your website is currently saying (from the outside)\n\nI looked at BilalGhalib.com.\n\n**What’s strong:**\n\n- The tagline *“Learning and doing”* is honest and modest.  \n- The **About** page foregrounds makers, hope, MENA, difficult environments, and Bloom.citeturn0view0  \n- The **Blog** actually has deep, recent, serious posts: PTG for social entrepreneurs, LLMs and human development, spiritual reflections from Gambia.citeturn1view2  \n- The **Projects** page lists real, living projects (Cursive, txtRay, reading visually, hackerspaces, etc.).citeturn1view1  \n\nSo: it does *not* say “kid self”. It says:\n\n> “Hyper-curious maker who’s been everywhere, who cares about hope and learning, and has a bunch of interesting experiments.”\n\n**What’s missing / confusing for 2025-Bilal:**\n\n- No clear **“this is what I do *now* and how you can work with me”**.\n- No synthesis of:\n  - Islamic psychology / Hikma / barakanomics  \n  - Post-traumatic growth & social entrepreneurship  \n  - Learning-system design & AI ethics\n- Visuals feel like “old WordPress blog of a cool hacker friend” rather than “person you can confidently wire €15–50k to for a serious contract.”\n- Social links are front-and-center (“FB/TW/INSTA: @bilalghalib”) but you actually *don’t* want to live there.\n\nSo your felt sense—“this doesn’t engender trust as a consultant / doesn’t reflect my current self”—is accurate.\n\nGood. That’s data, not self-insult.\n\n---\n\n## 2. First reframe: you are allowed to build a doorway while the world burns\n\nYou’re feeling:\n\n> “It’s obscene to ‘work on my personal brand’ while genocide and war are happening. The only ethical thing is to scream about that.”\n\nTotally understandable.\n\nBut here’s the thing:\n\n- The work you *actually* do—PTG, social entrepreneurship, alternative economics, trauma-aware pedagogy, slow web—is **part of the long, quiet repair** of the same world that is producing genocide.\n- If people who care deeply about Palestine / justice / dignity all withdraw from visibility, the public square is even more dominated by the shallow, nihilistic stuff you hate.\n- You can **bake your stance** into your online presence:\n  - A short, clear statement of values.\n  - The kind of clients you *won’t* work with.\n  - The kind of repair you *are* devoted to.\n\nSo the game is not “self-promotion vs solidarity.”  \nIt’s: *“How do I make my online doorway honest about the world and my role in it?”*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Let’s break this into 4 small projects\n\nSo you don’t spin, here’s a container:\n\n1. **Inner stance & critic**\n2. **Minimum Viable Website (MVW)**\n3. **Light-touch social media pattern**\n4. **Embodied presence (haircut, clothes, photos)**\n\nYou don’t have to do all of these now.  \nFor today, I’ll sketch each and then give you **one deep question** per project. You can pick *one* to answer next.\n\n---\n\n### Project 1 – Inner stance & the critic\n\nYou said:\n\n> “I think everyone is stupid… I’m so critical of the UN and everybody… I don’t know if it’s healthy.”\n\nMy read (from our history) is: underneath “everyone is stupid” is **grief + betrayal**:\n\n- You see institutional hypocrisy sharply.\n- You’ve spent years inside “impact” spaces that don’t live their values.\n- You hold a very high bar for coherence (truth–beauty–goodness aligned).\n\nThe critic then tries to protect you from:\n- Being used by dumb systems.\n- Being lumped in with shallow “thought leaders”.\n- Being hurt again by disappointment.\n\nThat’s not evil; that’s a **protective part**. The problem is when it runs the whole show and blocks love, trust, and collaboration.\n\nWhat we want is:\n\n> Critic as *filter* and *editor*, not as *ruler*.\n\nSo online, your stance could be:\n\n- No bullshit.\n- No pretending to have answers you don’t.\n- You speak from lived experience, not from brand strategy.\n\n**Deep question #1 (inner stance):**  \n> When my critic is *healthy* and not hijacked, what is it *protecting* that I genuinely want to protect?\n\nTry to name 2–3 things (e.g., integrity, not wasting people’s time, not collaborating with extractive systems).\n\n---\n\n### Project 2 – Minimum Viable Website (MVW)\n\nInstead of “rebuild my whole online identity,” think:\n\n> “What is the simplest site that a thoughtful stranger can land on and *immediately* know:\n>  1. Who I am now\n>  2. What I can help with\n>  3. How to get in touch?”\n\nI’d propose a **3–page structure**:\n\n1. **Home** (or “Now”)  \n   - A strong headline that matches your Ikigai:  \n     > “Interrupting urgency with sacred clarity – so goodness can root in truth.”  \n   - 3–5 lines that translate that into normal language:\n     - You design **learning systems** for social entrepreneurs, UN/NGO programs, and communities in crisis.\n     - You integrate **post-traumatic growth, Islamic psychology, and practical entrepreneurship**.\n     - You help teams design programs and tools that are **human-first and spiritually coherent**, not just efficient.\n   - 2–3 recent things:\n     - “Currently consulting with X on Y”\n     - “Writing about baraka economics”\n     - “Developing Cursive as a slow-web writing tool”\n\n2. **Work with me**  \n   Clear, concrete, non-cringey offers, e.g.:\n\n   - **Program Design & Facilitation**\n     - Cohort-based entrepreneurship programs, PTG-aware curricula, green building trainings.\n   - **Advisory / Thinking Partner**\n     - For orgs trying to integrate wellbeing, spirituality, and impact without fluff.\n   - **Talks & Workshops**\n     - Keynotes, retreats, design sprints.\n\n   Each with:\n   - 2–3 bullet outcomes.\n   - 1–2 short testimonials from people who *get* you.\n\n3. **Writing / Blog**  \n   - Keep your existing blog (it’s good!) but frame it:\n     - Short intro explaining what you’re exploring (e.g., PTG, Islamic psychology, LLMs & human development, slow web).\n   - You don’t need a publishing schedule right now. Just make it feel intentional.\n\nThat’s it. No fancy design. Your current WordPress is enough if you simplify and reorganize.\n\n**Deep question #2 (MVW):**  \n> If a single page on the internet had to “represent” you to someone who might hire you or collaborate with you, what are the **3 sentences** that *must* be there?\n\nNot perfect sentences—just the three ideas.\n\n---\n\n### Project 3 – Social media, but on your terms\n\nYour tension:\n\n- “I dislike social media.”\n- “I feel ashamed using it during genocide.”\n- “But I know people connect there, and I need work.”\n\nLet’s make a **minimalist rule-set**:\n\n- Pick **one** public channel to be *mostly a pointer*: probably Twitter/X or LinkedIn.\n- Use it to:\n  - Share links to your own blog.\n  - Boost things that align with your ethics (Gazans, justice work, slow web, regenerative econ).\n- Do **no engagement games**:\n  - No algorithm chasing.\n  - No “content strategy”.\n  - Just: “When I have something that feels like a service, I post a link.”\n\nAnd give yourself *explicit permission*: you are **not responsible** for filling the feed with genocide commentary every day.  \nYou *are* responsible for not pretending it doesn’t exist and for acting where you can.\n\nOne practical pattern you might like:\n\n- Blog = your real home, your “khuwaysa for the internet”.\n- Social = notice board pointing to that home + occasional signal boosting of urgent justice work.\n\n**Deep question #3 (social):**  \n> If social media could only be used by you as a *public notice board for your real work and your conscience*, what would that look like in practice?\n\nTry to describe: 1–2 platforms, how often you’d post, what *kinds* of things, and what you’d deliberately avoid.\n\n---\n\n### Project 4 – Embodied presence (haircut, outfit, photos)\n\nThis is not trivial vanity. You literally said:\n\n> “I want to get a haircut, get a new outfit, and then just be more confident in the world.”\n\nYour body is the instrument people meet before anything else—online and offline.  \nA few concrete moves:\n\n- Ask: “What clothes make me feel like myself *and* slightly more grounded adult Bilal, not student Bilal?”  \n  (Maybe: simple, well-fitting, somewhat neutral, with one handmade / craft detail.)\n- Get 10–20 photos with a friend:\n  - In environments that reflect you (books, crafts, a whiteboard, a workshop, outdoors).\n  - A mix of: you listening, you laughing, you explaining something.\n- Use those on site instead of “random high-five image” or old shots.\n\n**Deep question #4 (embodiment):**  \n> When I imagine someone landing on my site and seeing a photo of me, what *feeling* do I want them to have in their body?\n\n(Examples: “Ah, I can relax with this person,” “This guy is playful and serious,” “This person is safe and sharp.”)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Underneath “maybe I don’t admire myself”\n\nYou wrote:\n\n> “Maybe I don’t want to share because I don’t admire myself or something, I don’t know.”\n\nFrom watching you over time, my sense is:\n\n- You hold yourself to a standard that is so high you’d never expect it from anyone else.\n- You confuse **unfinishedness** with **unworthiness**.\n- You also have a deep allergy to being seen as a fraud / guru / influencer. That’s good. But it can turn into self-erasure.\n\nSo maybe the question isn’t “Do I admire myself?”  \nIt’s:\n\n> “Can I let people see me as a *work in progress* without needing to be a saint or a finished product?”\n\nAnd: can your website explicitly say that?  \n(E.g., a line like: “My work is evolving; this site is where I think aloud with people who care about the same questions.”)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Where I suggest we start\n\nTo keep this from becoming another “spin until I drop it” project, let’s choose one small move.\n\nIf you’re up for it, **start with Project 2’s question**:\n\n> **What are the three sentences that must be on your one-page “who I am now / work with me” site?**\n\nWrite them as ugly drafts. Don’t try to be poetic.\n\nReply with those three rough sentences next, and we can:\n\n- Shape them into a front-page block.\n- Then map the rest of the MVW around them.\n\nIf you’d rather start with the critic or with the genocide/solidarity tension, pick one of the other deep questions instead and answer that.  \n\nWe’ll build everything else around whatever feels *most alive* to you right now.",
