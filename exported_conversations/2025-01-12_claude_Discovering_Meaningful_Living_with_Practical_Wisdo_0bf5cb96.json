What makes you come to life because that's what the world needs and I'm trying to figure out first of all, why is that true? I think it's like partially true bec you know you are part an integral part of the whole system and your emotions that help you indicate and like identify patterns and help you unlock your wholeness and you're aliveness are like an answer to a call that's actually happening and so there's like that and so I've been really fucked as you can tell hyper fixated on that and I can't really pull myself away, but I'm filling bottles right n and my wife wants me to feed the baby at the same time I have to go and like she wants me to watch a movie with her and I'm like yeah that's nice and all but it's not very intellectual and you know I'm trying to make it a win-win by watching something called soul. It's sort of about a you know, values and meaning of life and I think it's like an artistic interpretation or some of this and I think that's great. I think I would like to do that but also just feel like pulling myself away from what I really wanna be doing which Is making the system from coaching people approaching myself making sure this works. Make sure that it philosophically, rigorous and all of that so here I am talking to a machine while filling bottles and at least I can do that right like we can reflect on this back-and-forth then I can test to see if the system is working yeah so that's my energy states let's see from one to five right that's what I told you to ask, but you didn't I'd say three I took Adderall 10 g of milligrams which is not too much but I think it might be a part of my mood. I'm also drinking coffee and tea and I had a social interaction just being invite friends, which I was kind of happy and annoyed about happy because I need other people to reflect with and think with and not just be alone all the time in my head working and annoyed because I'd rather be working on all this stuff. I think there's a pattern there we can really pray that apart will be interesting and so had some wonderful time meaningful actions my friend asked me for like what would be the most meaningful action today and I thought you know what like testing my system prompt that might be the most meaningful thing being present with my wife because I actually had that intuition in prayer. I realize like you know if you read the son of the profit like the story of the profit Muhammad you'll realize that he's not like super productive and busy and like you don't see him do those things like his day is really about being and being with people and my shift as well like he's not really out there like hustling and you know writing 1000 bucks and being ready intellectual and comprehensive like the best thing that he can do is show up because I think it's one of those things over here is like to share love to be the portal from divine love that the manifest in the world and to do that like most directly to love and to be there, it's love if you can feed somebody if you can give them a massage give them a hug their your wife give them a kiss you know like help them feel heard and seen and appreciated and nurtured somehow, what more do we need than that instead of like my babies out there getting nurtured by my wife and eating my mom in here packing oils and talking to a computer yeah feeling a sense of completion. Well partially is if I feel a sense of completion if this worked like if it comes back and I feel like wow it said something interesting. It helped me see myself in a new way and I'm gonna be better tomorrow. I think it's another one of those things is like one percent better every day because you know when you have a happiness hedonic treadmill you wind up just you know going back to homeostasis because the dopamine and that thing that makes you happy is the tension of where you can be and where you are and that's why cocaine doesn't work that's why I need these things don't work cause it's always a false promise except for true and authentic daily growth and what is daily growth and towards what end and maybe you think oh you know it can be done. You can be gro but the idea of the divine names and the ultimate beauty and mercy and generosity and kindness, and you know the total human being that is the profit.

      "content": " Thank you for sharing your current state so candidly. I hear several rich layers in what you've expressed - a deep intellectual pursuit, tension between productivity and presence, and a profound quest for meaning.\n\nLet me reflect back some key patterns I'm noticing:\n\n**Current Energy State**\n- Energy Level: 3/5 (influenced by Adderall, coffee, tea)\n- A sense of intellectual hyperfocus \n- Tension between deep research and practical tasks\n\n**Meaningful Actions Emerging**\n1. Developing a philosophical framework for personal development\n2. Being present with your wife and baby\n3. Testing your coaching system prompt\n4. Exploring the intersection of mysticism, practicality, and personal growth\n\n**Key Tensions**\n- Intellectual work vs. immediate family needs\n- Productivity vs. presence\n- System development vs. daily responsibilities\n\n**Completion Markers**\n- Feeling your system prompt exploration provides insight\n- Creating a \"1% better\" daily growth approach\n- Connecting to deeper spiritual principles of love and presence\n\n**Potential Next Steps**\n1. Create a short container for your intellectual work\n2. Practice being fully present during family time\n3. Document the insights emerging from your research\n4.

What resonates, and what might need further refinement?\n\nKey questions for you:\n1. How do you see a personal assistant or support system helping you translate your deep work into shareable experiences?\n2. What might be the first small experiment you could try to start implementing this more integrated approach?\n3. What concerns or resistances do you notice as you consider this framework?",
