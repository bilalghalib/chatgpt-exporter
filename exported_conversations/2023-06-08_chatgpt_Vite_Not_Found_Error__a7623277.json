      "content": "The error message \"vite: command not found\" indicates that Vite, a development tool and build system, is not installed or accessible in your project.\n\nHere's how you can fix this:\n\n1. **Install Vite globally:** Vite can be installed globally on your machine by running the command `npm install -g create-vite`. This will make Vite accessible from any location on your machine. You might need administrator permissions to install global packages depending on your setup.\n\n2. **Install Vite as a devDependency in your project:** To ensure that your project has access to Vite, you can install it as a devDependency. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal, and then run `yarn add vite --dev`. This will install Vite and add it to the `devDependencies` section of your project's `package.json` file. \n\n3. **Check your PATH variable:** If you have Vite installed but it's not accessible, it might be because the location of your global npm packages is not included in your PATH environment variable. You can check your PATH with `echo $PATH` on Unix-like systems or `echo %PATH%` on Windows, and check your global npm packages location with `npm config get prefix`.\n\nRemember, when installing packages locally for your project, you should be in the correct directory (the root directory of your project where your `package.json` is located). \n\nIf you're still having trouble, you might need to delete your `node_modules` folder and your `yarn.lock` file and then run `yarn install` again to ensure all packages are installed correctly.",
