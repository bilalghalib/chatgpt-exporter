Usually, that is the job of a trainer or mentor, someone with experience who can map a space for them and show them how to get from what they know now to where they need to go next. Helping teams understand how genAI’s embeddings work and the implications offers them the ability to “mentor themselves” - while learning in a community with others is fun, being stuck waiting for limited mentor time is not. We are making learning a collective adventure. We believe GenAI can help learners find and surf their growth edge, sustain flow states, and learn what they need to impact their social enterprises positively.\n\n\n\nDescribe your business case/theory of change \n90/150 words\nGenAI will transform education along the same vector previous technologies have -> more democratic, more personalized, with increased human connection. In the Middle Ages, a prince may have had a tutor, in the Industrial Era the printing press made books accessible to those with disposable income, later cultural innovations like the Public Library increased access to knowledge and brought people together in learning spaces, the internet brought Wikipedia and edEx and learning communities to our fingertips, and we genAII has the potential bring us back to each \"prince\" having their own \"tutor”. We believe that chat groups with learner models defined and managed by LLMs can help guide group conversations toward individual and collective learning. I call them parliaments where people can enter rooms and talk to each other, LLMs, and Mentors - depending on the need and context of the current conversation. \n\n\nDescribe your funding sources and financial sustainability plans for the project post-accelerator\n*\nMax 150 words\n\nDescribe the specific solution you are looking to test using GenAi and WhatsApp. E.g. details about the implementation, timelines, key milestones, or any anticipated technical challenges.\nMax 150 words\nWe propose integrating GenAI into WhatsApp Business to enhance self-mentorship within our accelerator program. GenAI will guide participants toward self-discovery and mastery development through customized prompts and interactions. The implementation involves collaborating with GenAI's team to customize responses and ensure seamless integration with WhatsApp. Key milestones include developing and testing the chatbot, piloting with a small group, and scaling up across all cohorts. Challenges include ensuring contextually relevant responses and managing scalability. By leveraging GenAI and WhatsApp, we aim to provide participants personalized guidance, fostering a supportive community where individuals uplift each other.\n\n\nAdditional content for updating/modifying the above\nBloom is working on developing a framework to support self-mentorship and is interested in building tooling around it to help participants in the accelerator have access to a \"24-hour mentor\". Our programs are cohort-based and highly interactive, teams have access to each other, mentors, and Bloom trainers. Coordinating those conversations is done through the principle of the upside-down pyramid, where each learner is encouraged to first ask themselves, then ask their cohort, then ask their mentors before reaching out to a trainer. This allows Bloom to be highly scalable while having participants develop confidence and community. GenAI integrated into WhatsApp will allow us programmatically nudge participants towards the self-authorship and mastery developing part of the pyramid (self, community) by helping teams know the questions they didn't know they needed to ask. GenAI allows participants, through careful prompting, to learn how to \"see in the dark\" by navigating to an embedding vector space and asking the AI to \"look around\" and describe what's there they didn't know to look for. Building this process into WhatsApp business will allow Bloom’s programs to support participants to support each other in the community. \n\n\n\n\n\nScoring table:\nCriterion\nImpact Score (1-10)\nAlignment with Target Sectors\n\n\nInnovative Use of AI\n\n\nScalability and Impact\n\n\nSafety, Privacy, and Ethics\n\n\nSustainability and Long-Term Vision\n\n\nTechnical and Organizational Readiness\n\n\nTeam Experience and Commitment\n\n\n\n\n",

And so what we'd like to do is utilize the context of the new LLMs, the large language models that are out there to help people self-mentor and to do that in cohorts so that we preserve the excitement and the energy of an entrepreneurship program where people are able to Google the things that they didn't even know they had to Google. And to be able to do that, we need to come up with a couple of things. So the problem statement, flow state on their growth edge and that's what our goal is. The way that we're going to do it is we're going to create a progressive summarization of all of the content that Bloom has prepared over the years as a social enterprise accelerator. We have frameworks for mentors and teams and assessments that teams can take to map out their personal learning, their professional learning, their organizational status and structure, all of that content. We used to have to ask people one by one and to fill out assessments and to have mentors verify and look through all of that content and guide them and tell them, okay, given all of the context that you have given me, here's where you can go. And that bottleneck we can remove now with AI where rather than spending so much upfront time filling in all of this information, the artificial intelligence large language model can create a model of the entire backend of Bloom, all of the frameworks that we use, all of the assessments, all of the activities that we use, and then stay extremely curious about the places where it has the most amount of doubt. So the AI starts with a hundred percent doubt about being able to support this team, and then it starts asking questions and updating the model, the backend, the doubt variable, and the risks variable, and have the person that they're working with guided all along the way. So the solution is to stay in cohorts without mentors, without trainers, and be able to train and mentor yourself based on an AI that is very curious about the teams. So it's the program of you, the program of us. That's the Bloom program that we're pitching.",

The main issues are the scarcity of mentors, the limited time available from these mentors, and the complex coordination required to connect them with entrepreneurial teams at critical moments. Additionally, there's a challenge in accurately gauging where teams are in their development and understanding their specific needs. This often leads to missed opportunities for vital mentorship interactions that can greatly impact their growth trajectory.

AI LLMs can help people get to their growth edge, and also find the current \"edge\" of what's posisble to help people think the next thing possible to a challenge that only they can think and see. long term impact will see a more prosperous MENA with stronger leaders caring for themselves and their communities - also probably will totally change how school is done. we need to adapt to always use whatever available technology is made to move more towards the agency of the human. Help the person find and learn what they need by askign questions and being curious and getting answers that suite them - and to always do it in comunity \n\nWe plan to build a chatbot for 1-1 interactions that will help them \"google the things that they didn't even know they had to Google\" by guiding them in questions. IT will also connect them to Bloom resources in the library, fill out their assessments, and request them to post and connect on our community platform. While it's a program for YOU, it's also a program for us - we need each other as we're doing this growth. And to be able to do that, we need to come up with a couple of things. So the problem statement, flow state on their growth edge and that's what our goal is. The way that we're going to do it is we're going to create a progressive summarization of all of the content that Bloom has prepared over the years as a social enterprise accelerator. We have frameworks for mentors and teams and assessments that teams can take to map out their personal learning, their professional learning, their organizational status and structure, all of that content. We used to have to ask people one by one and to fill out assessments and to have mentors verify and look through all of that content and guide them and tell them, okay, given all of the context that you have given me, here's where you can go.

So it's the program of you, the program of us. That's the Bloom program that we're pitching.\n\nFirst is to build the langchain codebase that can help us convert our SCRIBER framework into a conversational agent. Using this agent we can \"grammarly\" the persons conversation in a proactive way and create a risk minimizing and uncertianty minimizing agent which is modeling risk and uncertainty for the things of priority across all of blooms frameworks for how to run a great social enterprise program, including assessments and library activities to recomment. So the \"progressive summarization\" will include sub agents that talk in a \"family constelation\" system where they each defend reducing risk and uncertianity for priority things and that will define the next question. We have an upside down pyramid framework where the first person to ask is you, then google, then your cohort, and then mentors and trainers, the ai agent will constantly be pushing your questions down the chain and helping the person find and fill the most important things - once they have enough content to fill an entire assessment with high confidence the user can then go and see - wow, i filled this whole assessment, and wow, this activity is actually the perfect one for me on the https://bloom.pm app\n\nFirst model, and create the framework for the guessing engine curiosity mentor flock of agents\nSecond langchain\nThird integrationwith whatsapp and test iwth people\nthen build onboarding 33 at a time and see if we can scale a \"Program of Us\"\n\nChallenges is being th eonly coder and haven't used whatsapp business with agents before ",

Let's incorporate your vision into a cohesive narrative.\n\n---\n\n### Theory of Change\n\nOur program is rooted in the belief that empowering social entrepreneurs to learn autonomously and think innovatively leads to unique, contextually relevant solutions. By utilizing AI Large Language Models (LLMs), we aim to guide participants to their 'growth edge,' exploring the frontier of what's possible in their unique contexts. This fosters novel problem-solving approaches, essential for addressing localized challenges in the MENA region.\n\nThe long-term impact envisaged is a transformation in how education and personal development are perceived and delivered. Our vision includes a MENA region enriched with resilient, self-reliant leaders nurturing their communities, potentially revolutionizing traditional schooling systems. Our adaptability lies in leveraging the latest technology to continually shift towards enhancing human agency, prioritizing individual learning needs within a supportive community.\n\n### Specific Solution with GenAi and WhatsApp\n\n**Implementation Strategy**\n\nWe intend to develop a chatbot integrated with WhatsApp Business for personalized interaction with participants. This AI-driven chatbot will guide participants in framing questions they hadn't realized they needed to ask, connecting them to Bloom's extensive resource library. The bot will facilitate filling out assessments and encourage community engagement on our platform, emphasizing the blend of individual learning journeys with the strength of community support.\n\n**Development Phases**\n\n1. **Initial Development**: Build the LangChain codebase to transform our SCRIBER framework into a conversational agent. This agent will engage users in meaningful dialogue, fostering a curious and risk-aware learning environment.\n   \n2. **Integration and Testing**: Integrate this system with WhatsApp Business, followed by rigorous testing with selected users to ensure smooth operation and relevance.\n\n3. **Onboarding and Scaling**: Implement an onboarding process, gradually scaling up to accommodate more participants, while monitoring and refining the AI's interaction quality.\n\n**Anticipated Challenges**\n\nThe primary challenge is being the sole coder and lacking prior experience with WhatsApp Business's agent integration. This may require additional learning and potential collaboration for technical expertise. Managing the complexity of the AI's guessing engine, ensuring it remains aligned with the participants' learning priorities, and maintaining a balance between technology-driven guidance and human interaction will also be critical.\n\n---\n\nBy focusing on these refined sections, your application will present a clear, comprehensive vision of your objectives and methodologies.",

This way, people can learn to think for themselves and become leaders. Many people in the developing world only learn by memorizing, but our project will help them think better.\n\nWe also want people to understand themselves, the world, and share their values. This will help everyone reach their full potential. Our project can be used by many people, not just for business but also for other things.\n\nWe will make a tool that helps people learn quickly and easily. We want to see if people feel more confident and can solve problems after using our project. Our goal is for people to not need help from WhatsApp in the future, but instead use what they learned from our project.\n\nIn the end, we want our project to teach people how to think and learn better using new technology.\n\n-------\n\nOriginal Transcript\n\n\nOkay, so the core impact of our project is that we will be increasing access and scale through both WhatsApp AI and fundamentally also creating the context where we can now verify a new Socratic method. So the Socratic method used to be hypothetical, it's like a wishful thinking that, ah, all of the knowledge is within you and you could ask it. But an LLM Socrates that helps you ask and Google and find the right information, helps you think for yourself, is really a huge impact and really supports leadership. Most of the developing world has been brought up with rote learning, memorization, and this process will allow people that have been suppressed in their exposure to be exposed and suppressed in terms of their ability to think, to be able to think. And with those two things combined, along with a focus on understanding oneself and understanding the world and speaking publicly about our values, I believe that we will see a unlocking of real human potential. Speaking of sustainability, as long as the model is out there in a way where not only the current WhatsApp business model can use it, but other people can use it, I believe that this conversational AI can be adapted to other use cases and not just entrepreneurship. Anything that we can work with to define the frameworks underpinning the pedagogy and the curriculum can be built in into the single page summarization curiosity engine. I want to measure people's self-confidence before and after. I want to measure people's ability to figure it out and we can ask them these questions before and after, because really I don't want to give them the solutions. I want them to be solutionizing. I want to have a course with them where they leave more empowered, where they actually embody the principles of appropriate GPT usage or appropriate language usage so that they don't even need the WhatsApp business crutch. So the WhatsApp business trains them on using a Scriber framework that creates the Socratic method that comes from within when they use the LLMs in the future. And that's the long term vision, is a backend \"Socratic Grammarly\" langchain process that anyone can install as an accompaniment into their pedagogies which will help people self determine their ideal course through their learning journies in an adaptive way where the choice is with them at all times and the inspiration comes from doing it together in community where peopel can high five each other. Using the single page summarization to include evidence and the kinds of badges that people can have access to if/when they do x/y/z things can add an element of motivation and public visibility - increasing awareness and scale of the Socratic LLM Engine and whatsapp access point",

And this is how we can also make it relevant for other approaches. It's like, it's just a way of thinking with a couple of different elements around this flock of AIs that has the ability to say, OK, what are you interested in measuring while the person's interested in doing the thing that they want to be doing anyway?

And we already have resources in terms of allocating dev time to this project that would be already paid for and would be a source of funding that is kind of in parallel. And that the post-process accelerator sustainability plan is that it would actually be a way to support Bloom from becoming a non-profit accelerator into a non-profit accelerator that provides value where we incorporate the cost of GPT use cases into the type of applications for the grants that we're getting. And then afterwards, teams can continue to use them. I also believe that in developing this technology, it will make the Bloom pool and the Bloom goal-based learning and flock-of-agents Socratic method to help someone learn while achieving the goal the things that they need to learn but they don't know how to ask to learn. It would be helpful for a general learning platform, and we could actually create an API around it and allow people to use it through an API.",

      "content": "So Bloom has been working to take what would normally be a common curriculum, and to make everyone do the same lesson in sequence from lesson 1 to lesson 10, and create a method so that people can do the lesson that they need to do right now, rather than do the thing that is the easiest for the teacher to do, because you only have one teacher. This, a lot alike, is why schools are the way they are, where custom education is really difficult. Now, usually people try to resolve that by having smaller classroom sizes. We believe that it's possible for a teacher with good frameworks to be able to switch into each and every individual student by taking an assessment, having a view of the knowledge of the student, articulated both by the student in qualitative and quantitative terms by taking an assessment, and then using that assessment map with a database to tag elements in an existing library to create learning experiences by doing that. This is our current system. As you can see, we are still hitting the bottleneck in terms of mentorship and training hours. We do not have a completely autonomous system. When you come into Bloom, nothing happens. Nothing happens until a facilitator asks you a question. Now, with large language models, we can ask questions, and we can turn on the question asking by having a flock of seagulls, a flock of AI agents approach, where each agent has a curiosity variable, a risk variable, and a priority variable. Now, what will someone do when they come onto this engine? Well, it really depends on their goal. So for us, the goals of people that apply to our programs, they're social entrepreneurs. They want to have a successful social enterprise, and often the goal needs to be clarified, and the goal needs to be focused on something that they can do during the time period that they are with us, their resources, and their capacities. And so all of that figuring out usually happens with a mentor and a trainer, and with our system that I'm proposing here is a lot of that could happen through our AI agents, and our AI agents could use the emotions-to-values process to figure out what people care about so that we can create a true goal. And then from that true goal, as someone strives towards it, they usually have to learn stuff. So if you want an apple, you need to figure out how to get into the tree and pick the apple. If you want to scratch your nose and you're a baby, you have to figure that out. If you have gas and pressure, you have to learn to fart. So these have a goal, and sometimes they're externally motivated, sometimes internally motivated, emotionally motivated, and once you have a goal, then you can start learning. And learning happens through these different frameworks. We want to make sure that we have a framework that's robust enough, that contains enough elements inside of it that are holistic to kind of represent the domain that a person is working within, but also allow them to explore. And so it will have these guesses for all of the domains, and their assumed starting point is always zero. I have no idea what the person's skill is or the level of competence is for this level. But because of that, we can use this WhatsApp business AI chat structure so that when somebody comes on the Zoom, they don't just come and nothing happens. They can actually come onto the Zoom, and people will start talking to them. They can send them direct links, because we can store all of that in what I'm calling kind of the participant context window, or the participant frame. And that participant frame has a bunch of different elements in it that Blue has already structured with our processes. So we have the personal and the professional frameworks, and we have the assessments for all of them. And then what we can do is from those assessments, we can then fill in those questions while they talk. And of course, it will be a conversation. We can take in all of the implications of their questions about their family or their backgrounds, even some private and personal information. We can make educated guesses about that are justified. And so this context window not only will have the guess and the confidence measure, it will then have the evidence. And the evidence is going to be a bunch of direct quotes from the participants. And this context window will then have agents for each of the elements. Both the assessments are going to have an agent. An activity is going to have an agent. An individual question will have an agent. And those agents will be second-guessing themselves all the time, and then they'll be talking with each other and trying to coordinate who's going to ask the next best question. And so in this kind of tree-based structure going all the way down to the most granular, everyone's going to be defending their standpoint until we have it percolate all the way up, and then the AI agent will speak to the individual and be able to address that current gap. Now, the AI agent shouldn't be asking all the time. For instance, our mentors, we direct them through an upside-down pyramid process. You have to ask people first what they think, and then you ask them, did they do their homework and research online? And then did you ask your other fellows in the course? And then you can ask the mentor, and then if the mentor wants, they can ask the trainer after that. And so we always, even in our courses, are trying to push people down the upside-down pyramid to be asking themselves first, personally, because that is where their agency is. That's where they're going to develop leadership. That's where we're going to be able to learn how to learn. And if you don't push the arrow down that way, then you just get a bunch of people asking for outside answers, which is not what we want. And then we can even have assessments that frame the impact measures that we're looking for. These are going to be also there defending their right to remove their doubt. And once they have removed their doubt about the different variables and defended with evidence why they think this person is thinking for themselves, then perhaps we don't necessarily need to do it. And the additional element on top of all of this is the Scriber framework, which is a sort of grammarly-like approach to help people prompt. So when they're talking back to the AI, not only will the AI have to ask them the right questions, the AI needs to guide them to respond with the right response. And if they do it naturally, then it's great. But it's sort of like someone holding your pencil and making sure you know how to trace the letters of the alphabet before you do it on your own. Instead of having them ask for answers or write very short sentences that have no real meaning, the AI can not let them send that message or respond, I'm sorry, but that doesn't actually qualify as a good prompt. Please respond again. You violated the X principle of the Scriber framework. Or it could even suggest when it talks back and asks a question, it could suggest one of the elements in the Scriber framework that would be helpful. So for instance, the Scriber framework has a C in the Scribers for converge and diverge. And that is to create a bunch of questions and then ask the AI to help you pick one. And so this way, they will actually use the Scriber framework inside of WhatsApp chat to be able to fill out all of the sub elements that are in the Bloom platform. And this is what we're building.",

      "content": "Integrating this extensive explanation into your application provides a comprehensive view of Bloom's approach to personalized education, mentorship, and learning autonomy. Your methodology, leveraging AI to enhance individual learning paths, is both innovative and practical. Let's encapsulate this narrative into a cohesive segment for your application:\n\n---\n\n### Application Segment: AI Integration in Learning and Mentorship\n\n#### Introduction to Bloom's Methodology\nAt Bloom, we've evolved beyond conventional curricula that constrain learners to a fixed sequence of lessons. Our aim is to provide education tailored to individual needs, allowing learners to engage with lessons pertinent to their immediate requirements. This personalized approach confronts the traditional limitations of education, where custom learning solutions are typically hampered by logistical challenges.\n\n#### AI-Driven Personalized Mentorship\nOur solution harnesses AI technology within WhatsApp to initiate a dynamic, responsive learning environment. Here's how it works:\n- **Goal-Oriented Learning:** Learners define their objectives, whether it's launching a successful social enterprise or achieving specific personal milestones. AI agents use these goals to tailor the learning experience.\n- **Flock of AI Agents:** We employ a multitude of AI agents, each with distinct roles—questioning, risk assessment, prioritizing. These agents work collectively to facilitate learning, constantly recalibrating their approach based on learner interaction and progress.\n- **The Participant Frame:** Each learner's journey is captured in a unique participant frame, a comprehensive digital profile enriched with assessments, personal narratives, and direct quotes. This frame is the basis for AI agents to formulate targeted queries and learning activities.\n- **Continuous Interaction:** Interaction isn’t passive. Our AI agents guide learners to inquire within themselves first, fostering a sense of agency and leadership. This aligns with Bloom’s upside-down pyramid approach, which emphasizes self-inquiry as a precursor to external assistance.\n- **Scriber Framework Integration:** The AI not only poses questions but also mentors learners on crafting effective responses, embedding the Scriber framework’s principles into the conversation. This promotes deeper, more meaningful engagement and learning.\n\n#### Anticipated Impact and Long-Term Vision\nOur envisioned impact is twofold: firstly, we aim to significantly increase the efficiency and relevance of mentor-mentee matches. Secondly, we strive to cultivate a culture of self-driven learning, where learners are empowered to explore, question, and understand autonomously. Ultimately, our goal is to reshape the landscape of social entrepreneurship education, making it more adaptive, personalized, and impactful.\n\n#### Sustainability and Future Developments\nFinancial sustainability will be achieved through ongoing project-related funding and integrating AI usage costs into grant applications. Furthermore, the potential API development for our unique learning platform promises broader applications beyond our immediate scope, creating new revenue streams and collaboration opportunities.\n\n---\n\nThis segment reflects the innovation, technical prowess, and educational philosophy at the heart of Bloom's approach. It effectively communicates your unique value proposition, aligning with the criteria of the Gen AI Accelerator.",

Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the psychological frameworks that scriber can be related to?",

      "content": "The SCRIBER framework you've provided, focusing on critical thinking, reflection, inquiry, and recursive learning, can be mapped to several established psychological and educational frameworks. Here are a few that align closely with the principles of SCRIBER:\n\n1. **Bloom's Taxonomy:** This educational framework emphasizes different levels of cognitive skills, from basic recall of facts (knowledge) to higher-order thinking skills like analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. SCRIBER's emphasis on inquiry, critique, and recursion aligns with these higher-order thinking skills.\n\n2. **Reflective Practice (Schön):** Donald Schön's concept of reflective practice, particularly \"reflection-in-action\" and \"reflection-on-action,\" correlates with SCRIBER's emphasis on reflection and inquiry. This practice involves critically analyzing one's actions and experiences to improve future performance and understanding.\n\n3. **Metacognition Theory (Flavell):** This theory involves thinking about one’s thinking. It's closely related to SCRIBER’s principles of reflection and self-inquiry. Metacognition is about being aware of and understanding one's cognitive processes, especially in how one learns, understands, and remembers information.\n\n4. **Self-Regulated Learning (Zimmerman):** This theory involves actively participating in one’s learning process, setting goals, monitoring progress, and self-assessing. It aligns with SCRIBER's focus on seeking knowledge, critiquing, and continuously iterating the learning process.\n\n5. **Vygotsky’s Social Development Theory:** This theory emphasizes the fundamental role of social interaction in the development of cognition. Vygotsky believed that community plays a central role in the process of making meaning, which resonates with SCRIBER's communal aspects of learning.\n\n6. **Critical Pedagogy (Freire):** Paulo Freire's educational approach encourages students to critique and analyze reality. SCRIBER’s critique, reflection, and inquisition aspects parallel this, encouraging learners to question and understand the world around them.\n\n7. **Constructivist Learning Theory:** This theory posits that learners construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. SCRIBER’s approach of exploration, inquiry, and reflection is consistent with this theory.\n\nBy understanding these frameworks, you can more effectively articulate how SCRIBER aligns with established educational and psychological principles, enhancing the credibility and impact of your application.",

      "content": "The SCRIBER framework, with its emphasis on inquiry, reflection, and recursive learning, aligns well with modern educational paradigms that focus on active learning, critical thinking, and metacognition. However, there are some educational paradigms and frameworks that may either be missing from or potentially conflict with the principles of SCRIBER:\n\n1. **Behaviorism:** This paradigm focuses on observable behaviors and external stimuli as key drivers of learning. It often uses reinforcement and punishment to shape behavior and learning. SCRIBER, with its emphasis on internal reflection, critical thinking, and self-directed inquiry, may not fully incorporate the behaviorist focus on external conditioning and rote learning.\n\n2. **Traditional Direct Instruction:** This approach is teacher-centered, where learning is often more passive, based on lectures and direct teaching. It emphasizes the transmission of knowledge from teacher to student, which contrasts with SCRIBER's learner-centered, exploratory, and inquiry-based approach.\n\n3. **Competency-Based Education (CBE):** While not entirely against SCRIBER principles, CBE emphasizes the demonstration of competencies in specific skill areas and may underplay the broader, more holistic aspects of learning such as critical thinking and personal reflection, which are central to SCRIBER.\n\n4. **Mastery Learning:** This model focuses on ensuring that students achieve a high level of understanding (mastery) of a subject before moving on to the next. While it can incorporate aspects of self-paced learning, its structured approach to mastery might contrast with SCRIBER's more fluid, exploration-based learning journey.\n\n5. **Transmission Model of Learning:** This model is about the transfer of knowledge from teacher to student, often in a one-way communication method. It is more about memorizing and less about critically engaging with content, unlike the iterative and reflective nature of learning in SCRIBER.\n\n6. **Banking Concept of Education (Freire):** Paulo Freire criticized this traditional model of education where teachers \"deposit\" information into students' minds, treating them as passive receptacles. SCRIBER, promoting active inquiry and critical thinking, stands in opposition to this model.\n\n7. **Standardized Testing and Assessment:** Traditional forms of standardized testing may not capture the depth of reflective and critical thinking skills emphasized in SCRIBER. These tests often focus on specific, measurable outcomes rather than process-oriented, reflective, and metacognitive skills.\n\n8. **Authoritarian Pedagogy:** This model involves a strict teacher-led approach where the power dynamics heavily favor the teacher, possibly stifling the student-driven inquiry and exploration central to SCRIBER.\n\nIn summary, SCRIBER’s principles are more aligned with contemporary, constructivist, and student-centered learning theories, and may not fully integrate or align with traditional, teacher-centered, behaviorist, or standardized assessment-focused educational paradigms.",

Here's an attempt at crafting an acronym and table that not only aligns with the SCRIBER philosophy but also incorporates aspects for impact measurement and potential assessments. Let's use the acronym \"INSPIRE\":\n\n**I** - Inquiry-Based Learning  \n**N** - Narrative & Reflective Learning  \n**S** - Self-Directed Learning  \n**P** - Problem-Based Learning  \n**I** - Interactive & Collaborative Learning  \n**R** - Resilience & Grit  \n**E** - Experiential Learning\n\n| Framework Element | Description | Impact Measurement | Potential Assessment |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Inquiry-Based Learning** | Learners actively ask questions, investigate, and research. | Measure the depth and complexity of questions posed by learners. | Use rubrics to evaluate the quality and scope of inquiry questions. |\n| **Narrative & Reflective Learning** | Emphasizes storytelling and personal reflection to deepen understanding. | Assess the ability to connect personal experiences with learning objectives. | Reflective journals or portfolios documenting personal learning journeys. |\n| **Self-Directed Learning** | Learners set their own goals and direct their own learning. | Gauge progress in achieving self-set learning goals. | Self-assessment checklists and goal-setting sheets. |\n| **Problem-Based Learning** | Learning occurs through tackling real-world problems. | Evaluate problem-solving skills and application of knowledge. | Case studies and project-based assessments. |\n| **Interactive & Collaborative Learning** | Emphasizes learning through interaction and collaboration with others. | Measure collaborative skills and the quality of interactions. | Peer assessment, group projects, and discussion participation. |\n| **Resilience & Grit** | Focuses on developing persistence and resilience in learning. | Assess perseverance in overcoming learning challenges. | Surveys or questionnaires measuring grit and resilience levels. |\n| **Experiential Learning** | Learning through experience and hands-on activities. | Evaluate the application of theoretical knowledge in practical settings. | Observations and performance in practical tasks or simulations. |\n\nThis table offers a structured way to align the INSPIRE framework with specific impact measurements and suggests relevant assessments for each element. This approach could enhance the effectiveness of educational programs by providing a comprehensive and holistic view of learner development.",

Additionally, we'll integrate the concept of self-efficacy, particularly entrepreneurial self-efficacy, into the framework.\n\n1. **Inquiry-Based Learning**\n   - **Paradigm/Theory:** Developed from John Dewey’s ideas about education.\n   - **Assessment:** Use inquiry rubrics that assess the complexity and relevance of questions posed, and the depth of the investigative process.\n\n2. **Narrative & Reflective Learning**\n   - **Paradigm/Theory:** Donald Schön's reflective practice theory.\n   - **Assessment:** Reflective journals or portfolios assessed against a rubric detailing depth of reflection, ability to connect personal experiences with broader concepts, and growth over time.\n\n3. **Self-Directed Learning**\n   - **Paradigm/Theory:** Malcolm Knowles’ theory of andragogy.\n   - **Assessment:** Self-assessment tools to track progress against personal learning goals, learner autonomy, and ability to seek and utilize resources.\n\n4. **Problem-Based Learning**\n   - **Paradigm/Theory:** Rooted in the work of Howard Barrows and others.\n   - **Assessment:** Real-world problem-solving projects assessed on solution effectiveness, application of knowledge, and critical thinking skills.\n\n5. **Interactive & Collaborative Learning**\n   - **Paradigm/Theory:** Lev Vygotsky’s social development theory.\n   - **Assessment:** Peer assessments, collaborative project outcomes, and participation in discussions or group activities.\n\n6. **Resilience & Grit**\n   - **Paradigm/Theory:** Angela Duckworth's research on grit.\n   - **Assessment:** Grit scales or resilience questionnaires, observational assessments of persistence in challenging tasks.\n\n7. **Experiential Learning**\n   - **Paradigm/Theory:** David Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory.\n   - **Assessment:** Performance in practical tasks or simulations, reflective essays on experiences, or project evaluations.\n\n8. **Self-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy**\n   - **Paradigm/Theory:** Albert Bandura’s self-efficacy theory, with a focus on entrepreneurial contexts by authors like Martin, McNally, and Kay.\n   - **Assessment:** Self-efficacy scales tailored for entrepreneurship, assessment of challenge completion, and tracking of entrepreneurial milestones.\n\nEach of these frameworks can be assessed through various methods, including both qualitative and quantitative tools. The assessments can be tailored to specific learning contexts and objectives, providing educators and program designers with valuable insights into learners' progress and areas for improvement.",

      "content": "align these on a new column and don't forget metacognition grit and / self efficacy\nBloom's Taxonomy: This educational framework emphasizes different levels of cognitive skills, from basic recall of facts (knowledge) to higher-order thinking skills like analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. SCRIBER's emphasis on inquiry, critique, and recursion aligns with these higher-order thinking skills.\nReflective Practice (Schön): Donald Schön's concept of reflective practice, particularly \"reflection-in-action\" and \"reflection-on-action,\" correlates with SCRIBER's emphasis on reflection and inquiry. This practice involves critically analyzing one's actions and experiences to improve future performance and understanding.\nMetacognition Theory (Flavell): This theory involves thinking about one’s thinking. It's closely related to SCRIBER’s principles of reflection and self-inquiry. Metacognition is about being aware of and understanding one's cognitive processes, especially in how one learns, understands, and remembers information.\nSelf-Regulated Learning (Zimmerman): This theory involves actively participating in one’s learning process, setting goals, monitoring progress, and self-assessing. It aligns with SCRIBER's focus on seeking knowledge, critiquing, and continuously iterating the learning process.\nVygotsky’s Social Development Theory: This theory emphasizes the fundamental role of social interaction in the development of cognition. Vygotsky believed that community plays a central role in the process of making meaning, which resonates with SCRIBER's communal aspects of learning.\nCritical Pedagogy (Freire): Paulo Freire's educational approach encourages students to critique and analyze reality. SCRIBER’s critique, reflection, and inquisition aspects parallel this, encouraging learners to question and understand the world around them.\nConstructivist Learning Theory: This theory posits that learners construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. SCRIBER’s approach of exploration, inquiry, and reflection is consistent with this theory.\n",

Turn.io can assist with onboarding if needed.\nApplicants for the programme should have an existing digital service (not necessarily AI-powered).\nDoes our program need to be at a specific scale?\nWe prefer organizations with a live WhatsApp Business Account and are ready or have the ability to scale via WhatsApp.\nThe Chat for Impact Accelerator exclusively targets the development of services for the WhatsApp Business Platform (API).\nDo we need to have it all figured out yet?\nNo, but we need to be confident that you have a committed and agile team with a suitable starting point and the tenacity and ability to iterate and learn.\nYou will receive input during the 8-week accelerator to help you grow and achieve your goals.\nWe are interested in why you are the right team to support and invest in.\nDo we need to be operating in specific countries?\nNo, but we prefer organizations with the most significant impact and that operate in countries where WhatsApp is socially well-adopted and actively used.\nDo we need to have multilingual or single-language programs?\nIt does not matter how many languages you operate in, but it matters that your program has a clear roadmap on who it is serving and why you are doing it in specific languages.\nDo we need to be tech-savvy to be considered?\nNo, both small and big, tech-savvy or new-to-digital organizations can use WhatsApp successfully.\nYou must have a strong business case/theory of change for using digital messaging such as WhatsApp.\nHowever, applicants for the programme should have an existing digital service (not necessarily AI-powered).\nWhat are we committing to?\nThe 8-week Accelerator Program will require two dedicated team members to attend all weekly sessions (60-90 mins per session).\nThese will be group sessions hosted online on dates made available in advance.\nAttend weekly Office hours with expert team members. (30 -60 min per session)\nComplete all pre-work assignments before each session. It should take 1-2 hours to complete.\nComplete all homework assignments during the Accelerator period.\nThe end goal of the Accelerator is to demo your WhatsApp use case to a selected audience and complete a case study to share learnings.\nPreparing for this will require time outside of the Accelerator hours. Therefore, plan to design and build your demo at least 1-2 hours daily.\nWho in our team should attend?\nThe ideal combination is a business lead (i.e., a team member with a strategic focus and decision-making ability) and a technical lead (i.e., an operational, hands-on team member responsible for implementing your service).\nCan more than two team members attend?\nYes, organizations are encouraged to have a core team of at least two members for consistent attendance, but you can invite additional team members to specific sessions as needed.\nWhat are the attendance requirements?\nApart from the time commitment explained above, you will require a computer with internet access and sufficient data to attend all virtual sessions on a conference tool such as Zoom. Ideally, your connection and data will allow you to attend the sessions with your video on.\nIs signing up for a WhatsApp Business API account compulsory after the Accelerator?\nIt is a selection criteria to have a live WABA account. So please note that your application will only be selected if you have an existing WABA. If a WhatsApp service is not a strategic objective for your organization for 2024, then there will be other opportunities to apply for another accelerator when your organization is ready.\nCan we apply if we are using or planning to use the WhatsApp Business App (not the API)?\nThe Chat for Impact Accelerator exclusively targets the development of services for the WhatsApp Business Platform (API).\nWhat is a Business Service Provider (BSP)?\nBusiness Service Providers (BSPs) are third-party solution providers with expertise in the WhatsApp Business API. BSPs, like Turn.io, can help you communicate with your customers on WhatsApp for the approved use cases of customer support and time-sensitive, personalized notifications.\nDo we need to use Turn.io as a BSP?\nTurn.io is hosting the Chat for GenAI Accelerator, and you will receive a Turn License for the duration of the Accelerator. All hands-on sessions and the building of your chatbot will be on the Turn.io platform. For this purpose, you must use Turn.io as your Business Solution Provider (BSP) after the Accelerator.\nWhat is the WhatsApp Business API, and why select it as the means of communication?\nThe WhatsApp Business API powers communication with users worldwide so that you can connect with them on WhatsApp in a simple, secure, and reliable way.\nThe WhatsApp Business API is a paid product. However, as part of the Accelerator, you will be granted a subsidized license for up to 6 months; further use of the API may result in monthly fees and/or messaging fees.\nWhat type of messaging is allowed on the WhatsApp Business API?\nWhatsApp is designed for simple, secure and reliable messaging. This includes one-on-one communication and chatbots with a clear escalation path to a human. Please refer to the WhatsApp Commerce Policy and WhatsApp Business Policy to familiarise yourself with the types of messages that are and are not allowed on the WhatsApp Business API.\nWill another Chat for Impact Accelerators be hosted?\nWe may or may not do this in the future again. Follow us on LinkedIn to stay up to date with Accelerator news.\nWe were part of a previous Accelerator cohort. Can we apply?\nUnfortunately if you are an Accelerator Alumni, your application will not be considered.\nWe are already a Turn.io client; can we apply?\nYes, you are welcome to apply.\nWhat are the key factors that will be considered for selection?\nIdeal applicants are social impact organizations working in health, education, and economic mobility with a well-defined theory of change or business case. They should be committed to leveraging AI to support a secure, private, personalized WhatsApp chat service. Candidates should demonstrate a strong commitment to building real-world chat applications and possess the organizational capacity to participate in the accelerator programme and sustain the chat service long-term. Applicants for the program should have an existing digital service (not necessarily AI-powered).\nWhy was our application not successful?\nThere is no straightforward answer to this question as there are various factors, and the program is highly competitive, e.g., if you didn’t answer all the questions or did not follow the application guidelines.\nWe were unsuccessful, can we still get started on WhatsApp?\nNothing stops you from applying for a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) through any Business Service Provider (BSP), including Turn.io, or from starting to use the WhatsApp Business App. Furthermore, if we host another Chat for Impact Accelerator and Summit, you are welcome to apply again.\nDo you give feedback on application results?\nYou will receive email communication from us on whether you were successful or not. However, we will not provide detailed feedback on why your application was successful or unsuccessful.\nWhen do applications close?\nAll applications received by midnight on the 31st of March 2024 will be considered.",

It should take 1-2 hours to complete.\nComplete all homework assignments during the Accelerator period.\nThe end goal of the Accelerator is to demo your WhatsApp use case to a selected audience and complete a case study to share learnings.\nPreparing for this will require time outside of the Accelerator hours. Therefore, plan to design and build your demo at least 1-2 hours daily.\nWho in our team should attend?\nThe ideal combination is a business lead (i.e., a team member with a strategic focus and decision-making ability) and a technical lead (i.e., an operational, hands-on team member responsible for implementing your service).\nCan more than two team members attend?\nYes, organizations are encouraged to have a core team of at least two members for consistent attendance, but you can invite additional team members to specific sessions as needed.\nWhat are the attendance requirements?\nApart from the time commitment explained above, you will require a computer with internet access and sufficient data to attend all virtual sessions on a conference tool such as Zoom. Ideally, your connection and data will allow you to attend the sessions with your video on.\nIs signing up for a WhatsApp Business API account compulsory after the Accelerator?\nIt is a selection criteria to have a live WABA account. So please note that your application will only be selected if you have an existing WABA. If a WhatsApp service is not a strategic objective for your organization for 2024, then there will be other opportunities to apply for another accelerator when your organization is ready.\nCan we apply if we are using or planning to use the WhatsApp Business App (not the API)?\nThe Chat for Impact Accelerator exclusively targets the development of services for the WhatsApp Business Platform (API).\nWhat is a Business Service Provider (BSP)?\nBusiness Service Providers (BSPs) are third-party solution providers with expertise in the WhatsApp Business API. BSPs, like Turn.io, can help you communicate with your customers on WhatsApp for the approved use cases of customer support and time-sensitive, personalized notifications.\nDo we need to use Turn.io as a BSP?\nTurn.io is hosting the Chat for GenAI Accelerator, and you will receive a Turn License for the duration of the Accelerator. All hands-on sessions and the building of your chatbot will be on the Turn.io platform. For this purpose, you must use Turn.io as your Business Solution Provider (BSP) after the Accelerator.\nWhat is the WhatsApp Business API, and why select it as the means of communication?\nThe WhatsApp Business API powers communication with users worldwide so that you can connect with them on WhatsApp in a simple, secure, and reliable way.\nThe WhatsApp Business API is a paid product. However, as part of the Accelerator, you will be granted a subsidized license for up to 6 months; further use of the API may result in monthly fees and/or messaging fees.\nWhat type of messaging is allowed on the WhatsApp Business API?\nWhatsApp is designed for simple, secure and reliable messaging. This includes one-on-one communication and chatbots with a clear escalation path to a human. Please refer to the WhatsApp Commerce Policy and WhatsApp Business Policy to familiarise yourself with the types of messages that are and are not allowed on the WhatsApp Business API.\nWill another Chat for Impact Accelerators be hosted?\nWe may or may not do this in the future again.

Can we apply?\nUnfortunately if you are an Accelerator Alumni, your application will not be considered.\nWe are already a Turn.io client; can we apply?\nYes, you are welcome to apply.\nWhat are the key factors that will be considered for selection?\nIdeal applicants are social impact organizations working in health, education, and economic mobility with a well-defined theory of change or business case. They should be committed to leveraging AI to support a secure, private, personalized WhatsApp chat service. Candidates should demonstrate a strong commitment to building real-world chat applications and possess the organizational capacity to participate in the accelerator programme and sustain the chat service long-term. Applicants for the program should have an existing digital service (not necessarily AI-powered).\nWhy was our application not successful?\nThere is no straightforward answer to this question as there are various factors, and the program is highly competitive, e.g., if you didn’t answer all the questions or did not follow the application guidelines.\nWe were unsuccessful, can we still get started on WhatsApp?\nNothing stops you from applying for a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) through any Business Service Provider (BSP), including Turn.io, or from starting to use the WhatsApp Business App. Furthermore, if we host another Chat for Impact Accelerator and Summit, you are welcome to apply again.\nDo you give feedback on application results?\nYou will receive email communication from us on whether you were successful or not.

      "content": "Ensuring data privacy and ethical use of AI is crucial, especially for projects like yours that handle sensitive information and rely on AI for key functions. Here are some strategies and best practices:\n\n### Data Privacy Strategies\n\n1. **Data Anonymization and Encryption**: Before any data analysis, ensure all personal identifiers are removed or anonymized. Use strong encryption methods to protect data during transit and storage.\n\n2. **Minimal Data Retention**: Only collect and store data that is absolutely necessary for your service. Implement strict data retention policies to regularly purge unnecessary or outdated information.\n\n3. **Consent and Transparency**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and use. Be transparent about how data is used, stored, and shared.\n\n4. **Data Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls and permission levels to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. Regular audits and access logs can help monitor and prevent unauthorized access.\n\n5. **Regular Privacy Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with privacy laws (like GDPR or CCPA) and identify potential vulnerabilities.\n\n### Ethical AI Use Practices\n\n1. **Bias Mitigation**: Regularly test AI models for biases and take steps to mitigate them. Diverse training data and continuous monitoring are key.\n\n2. **Explainability and Transparency**: AI decisions should be explainable. Users should understand how and why an AI model makes certain recommendations or decisions.\n\n3. **User Control and Feedback**: Allow users to provide feedback on AI decisions and offer mechanisms to challenge or override AI recommendations where appropriate.\n\n4. **Ethical AI Framework**: Develop a framework based on ethical principles to guide AI development and deployment. This could include principles like fairness, accountability, and respect for user autonomy.\n\n5. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation**: AI models should be adaptable and continuously updated to reflect new data, societal changes, and ethical considerations.\n\n6. **Collaboration with Ethical Bodies**: Engage with ethical boards or committees, both internally and externally, to regularly review AI practices.\n\n7. **Training and Awareness**: Ensure your team is well-trained and aware of ethical considerations in AI use. Regular workshops and updates on ethical AI are beneficial.\n\nIncorporating these strategies into your application can greatly strengthen the appeal to grant committees, especially those focused on technology and social impact.",

We create positive contexts where young people form communities, discuss challenges, and encourage each other to succeed. We grow best when we grow together and recognize perspectives\nVisualize growth: Support coaches by giving them a quantitative approach to identifying growth edges. \nDon’t reinvent the wheel. We provide coaches and teams with a library of activities tagged to their assessment categories to help each team find their next best growth step.\nKeep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat \\/-Upside down pyramid\n\nYouth in the driver’s seat\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the youth in our programs to help them do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous, nonaligned activities. It’s essential to keep the participants in the driver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment. \nThis is why we’ve developed our 4 pillar assessment model and library of related activities. This library provides a “learning by doing” catalog of activities that coaches can use to support young people’s development that spans 21st Century Skills, character strengths, and wellbeing focus, alongside the development of practical skills needed for running an enterprise. \n\nTransformation vs. Information. \nWe help make available knowledge actionable by designing library items around a specific action. In our Library of activities, we provide all the necessary worksheets, templates, and supporting videos to enable young people to take immediate action  (Library content) \nLet's not reinvent the wheel. More information is available at a click of a button than before. It’s not information that people need. Instead, what people need is an activation that leads to transformation. \nWe can help create an enabling environment for picking data.\nThe question we start with is: What if we could offer young people a compass to help guide them from where they are to where we want to be? \n\nPersonal and professional assessments\nOur coaches are encouraged to help young people find their compass and identify their needs.\nWe help coaches integrate personal development and well-being into professional development in a seamless way:\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessment)\nWe have dissected various developmental frameworks and identified the essential overlapping elements to support holistic, personal, and professional growth. \nWhy integrate personal growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team limits the effectiveness of an organization. Likewise, the effectiveness of a team is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal development and well-being are also at an end, we ensure that the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor attitude. Indeed, success comes at every step, even when that step is a failure.\nWe provide assessments to help identify where individuals and teams stand along these dimensions and have a library of activities for the program managers, the program mentors, and the team to select their subsequent best growth and learning opportunities.\nOur coaches are encouraged to see themselves along with the rest of the coaches, mentors, and other participants in the program as a part of a broader enabling environment.\nCreate an enabling environment for a proactive participation\nThe community element of building cohort-based programs is vital to help entrepreneurs flourish. They feel seen and supported in a community of like-minded learners and builders who support each other with constructive feedback and helpful resources. We win when we win together. \nBloom’s Tools to Support Application of the Pedagogy\nBloom Open Community\n\nWe aim to create a healthy community for young people. Being part of an engaging community gives them a sense of belonging. It enables them to share personal relatedness and support the social and emotional Learning of each other.\nTo achieve that we leverage the Open Community forum on our platform to create networking ripples beyond the timeline of any running program. People from current and previous programs can randomly communicate, engage and support each other.\nBeing part of this telecollaboration enables young people to support other members. Supporting others will help them feel good and better about themselves while strengthening overseas relationships. \nA number of metrics are tracked to be able to understand the level of engagement to help program managers intervene to boost and catalyze further connections.\nHere are a  few screenshots of our Open Community:\nHere is a screenshot of the main page of the Community Section on our platform including different sections that are relevant to the youth like available Opportunities, Resources, Conferences, etc… Each of these categories is an opportunity for young people to increase their contact hours.\nHere is a screenshot of the engagement dashboard that would help program managers understand how to better catalyze the community:\nParticipants get a simplified view:\n\nQuantified Assessments\nBloom’s Training Framework provides a simple, dynamic, and adaptive learning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a guided approach to project-based and cohort-based learning. \nThe Framework helps people and teams improve along 2 Core Pillars: \n1) The Individual: Universal Skills, Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH) and Character Strengths\n2) The Organization: Organization Development\nThe Framework helps individuals and teams assess core areas of strengths and weaknesses, and then prioritize specific areas for further learning and development. \nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement across both pillars, with an emphasis on supporting development in both pillars simultaneously, such as working on improving a specific individual skill through activities that are helping with a core organizational need. \nThe Bloom Training Framework can be used in different contexts: Inside companies or organizations, in project-based learning programs (youth, school, university, etc), in startup accelerators, for short events such as startup sprints or hackathons, or others. \nPillar 1: The Individual  \nIncludes: Universal Skills (skills relevant to all roles, and in both personal and professional contexts, others may call them soft skills and they have a significant overlap with 21st Century Skills), Wellbeing & Engagement, and Character Strengths (most commonly used to help people identify their Signature Strengths to leverage in their work and personal growth areas).\n\nUniversal Skills (Universal Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life): \nListening, Speaking, Problem Solving, Creativity, Staying Positive, Aiming High, Leadership, Teamwork\nWellbeing & Engagement at work and life (through PERMAH): \nPositive Emotion,  Engagement, Positive Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishments/Achievements, Vitality & Health\nCharacter Strengths (through VIA, Values in Action) \nWisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, judgment, love of learning, perspective\nCourage: bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest\nHumanity: love, kindness, social intelligence\nJustice: teamwork, fairness, leadership\nTemperance: forgiveness, humility, prudence, self-regulation\nTranscendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality\n\nUniversal Skills \nhelp people regardless of their sector or role within an organization. These represent the training component of the personal development framework. The Universal Skills help our teams develop skills that will support them no matter their personal or professional requirements. \nWe use the Universal Skills Framework from SkillsBuilder.org to help people build skills along four dimensions:\nCommunication: Listening, Speaking\nCreative Problem Solving: Problem Solving, Creativity\nSelf-Management: Staying Positive, Aiming High\nCollaboration: Leadership, Teamwork\n\nWellbeing and Engagement \nThis assessment comes from the school of positive psychology and is a measure of human flourishing. \nPositivity, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Achievement, and Health are all ends in themselves. \nScoring highly on one or many of these factors is one way to determine a life well-lived. \nWe use this measure to help focus our programs on the idea that the success of an organization can, and should, come hand in hand with personal success. \nOur Character Strengths \nOur Character Strengths can be great tools to guide us in developing skills and being effective at whatever we do. Leveraging them makes learning and doing new things easier and more fun.\nIn Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strength”. It is a strength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when it’s used rather than taking effort. \nUsing our Signature Strengths can unlock energy and promote wellbeing at work. \nThe assessment represents an analysis of virtues and values held by people around the world. Twenty-four Character Strengths are unequivocally known to be good. We can cluster these Strengths into seven virtues.\nHow to apply the Individual Development Framework\n\nRequest your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development assessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills, Wellbeing and Engagement, and Character Strengths.\nAfter the individuals take the assessments, you can request individuals and teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\nOnce they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to select a priority area within their Universal Skills results on the Bloom Learn tab.\nIn program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers can help participants identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from their personal knowledge, online resources, or from the Bloom Library of Activities. \nEnd of the program assessments helps participants and program managers see growth and chart paths for further improvement.\n\nPillar 2: The Organization \n\nIncludes: Organization Development system with specific assessments adapted to the needs of teams and programs. \n\nStrategy\nInnovation & Learning\nAdvocacy\nImpact Monitoring (M&E) or Corporate Social Responsibility\nPrograms and Projects or Products and Services\nCommunity Engagement & Communication\nInfrastructure\nTeam, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\nRevenues & Financial Sustainability\nFinancial Management\nLegal & Compliance\nRisk, Security & Resilience\n\nOrganization Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while anticipating and managing future changes and risks. \nWe’ve derived our organization capacity assessment from methodologies used by international consulting firms, and adapted it for enterprises and accelerators. \nBloom’s Organization Capacities assessment helps organizations identify blind spots, giving them a 360-degree perspective on where they stand as an organization and helping them pick the areas of organization development which will help them most. We have adapted versions of the assessment for enterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\n\nHow to apply the Organization Development Framework\n\nThe program manager invites teams and participants to take the relevant Organization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform (Enterprise Capacities or Accelerator Capacities). \nAfter participants take the assessment, they are invited to go over their results and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to identify their priority areas of development and the particular objectives they would like to achieve during the program. \nThe Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s template for the duration of the program and shared between the teams, the mentors, and the program manager. \nRegular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team, mentors, and program managers stay on track, adjust where needed, solve problems, and track progress.\nTeams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority development areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\n\nMore information can be found here: Bloom Framework v0.8 - Two Pillars (ready-approved)\n\nBloom Digital Library\n\nWe are putting forward a collection of reusable training materials and learning resources developed by experts to help young people develop their enterprises and personal and professional skills.\nThe Library of Activities is an element of the Bloom Platform where young people can take assessments, evaluate their enterprises and skills, and find specialized training resources with actionable worksheets.\nExample score results:\nProgram manager views showcasing a summary of youth activity onthe platform: \n\nYouth can identify their growth areas by selecting the category that’s a priority for them and by adding a growth goal as a description. This provides program managers and coaches a dashboard where they can see overall team needs, matchmake teams based on who has strengths to offer and who may need them, as well as offer suggested activities directly from library to the participants taskboards.\n\n\n\nUsing tasks to monitor activities is one way to support learning by doing. After taking an assessment we program managers have the ability to track the progress of the activities on a single dashboard for all the participants and are able to encourage those who haven’t yet done the activity by sending messages. \n\n\nBloom Digital Library:\nThe Bloom Library aims to provide the coaches and teams of our programs with free access to learning content to support their growth. The library is matched to our assessment framework, so each area a team and coach identify as a potential area for development has the resources at hand to support them. We have curated training modules from local and international expert trainers, which include video lessons and immediately applicable worksheets on all categories of our 360-degree enterprise assessment (ECAT). Our library also includes free access to digital books, audiobooks, and worksheets.\nLibrary members can borrow e-books and audiobooks on different subjects, including entrepreneurship, organizational development, skills development, social entrepreneurship, and wellbeing. \nhttps://www.bloom.pm/library/ \n\n\n\nWe hope the coaches benefit from our SOPs and digital services to provide high-quality tailored coaching to teams remotely and in person. \n\nCustomizing the Curriculum\nWe strive to adapt the curriculum to each new cohort of enterprises that best caters to their needs. We base this customization on inputs from\nThe assessment results of each enterprise: We look at the score trends in each category.\nThe Team's Organization Development Plans: We look at each objective and critical result and extract the categories related to the activities planned.\nA survey of the most common categories of training topics: We ask the entrepreneurs to tell us what topics they are most interested in learning.\n\nLearning by Doing\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than the act of “doing” and “testing” to understand the product, customers, and business model. At Bloom, we know how much theory we introduce to entrepreneurs versus how much time we give them to achieve results. Teaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to understand the context — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework or a tool that entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals. These tools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our program, we make an effort to revisit them during the program over and over again, in the best spirit of lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are helping the startups drive progress and results.\n\nModular Learning\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate entrepreneurs learning by themselves. Thus, modular learning is a form of distance learning that uses Self-Learning Modules based on the essential learning competencies developed by our team of trainers with the aid of curriculum developers.\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show them what they need to know. But Village Capital claims that “the more remote work we allow, the better.” For example, indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and exploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while working on their business plans and product. \nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that serve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. It is better to use the time to build relationships and get feedback. Online education with e-learning modules allows founders to spend more time building networks and products.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nCurriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities results, Organization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one interviews to identify the most present needs\nContent is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can learn at their own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates, and tools, and get feedback in sessions with the trainers.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Planning Template v2\nBloom Digital Library\n\nFacilitation Tools \nThe dashboard area on the Bloom platform will allow coaches to see the priority category the teams have chosen to develop, the assigned activities they selected together, and a summary of their work plan.\nWe also provide our coaches with a Program Dashboard template which helps them set Objectives and Key Results(OKRs) with their teams and provides a dashboard for them to use during their coaching sessions. \nWe include the OKR work plan template below for review. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise Stage Focus\n\nBloom has experience working with enterprises and impact initiatives at different stages of development. We use the staged assessment to help coaches identify where a team is at and what might be their next steps towards their next stage. We also use stage assessments for program impact purposes as one of the measures of team growth. \n\nStages\nSub-Stages\n0. LEARNING\t\n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1.

Lasting anywhere between 3-10 days, though they can be as short as one fun and intense day. \nIt’s loosely adapted what’s known as “The Design Sprint, “ a combination of Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile approach, based on a series of steps and techniques that help young people solve their product! In a nutshell, it’s a way for young people to spend a fixed amount of time on core venture development using today’s best practices in a coherent, integrated fashion. \n\nIn Bloom’s standard programs, the sprint has two main objectives: \nTo help young people learn new skills and progress in their projects. \nTo help us learn more about them during our selection process for the Accelerator. \n\nWe’ve found that we learn more about the people and projects through a short Sprint program than through an application process and interviews. We’ve also found that intense short Sprints are a very efficient approach to increase contact hours and increase the possibility of new relationships.\n\n\nThe Accelerator\n\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging, applying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that combines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their daily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board. \nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group rather than the negative ones. This approach builds the entrepreneur on their strengths, specifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions. Strengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent qualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of them or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired outcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort towards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement because they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when individuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud of themselves, and more engaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of resilience in achieving their goals. \nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to identify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of activities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise Capacity Assessment to measure the organizational capacity of enterprises. It allows us to have the whole picture of the strengths of both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing abilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. As a result, they tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). It is because they worry less about looking bright and put more energy into learning. \nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle. This system encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals into small, discrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each other and start building momentum, leading to more prominent and significant moves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day before. Start small and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to get impatient and start rushing forward and taking more significant leaps. Take it slow, steady, and consistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on getting 1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not seem like much, but those 1% improvements compound each other. \nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly power moves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort zone and push us forward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make many more steps. Power Moves take you right out of your regularly scheduled program. They are the key to real change. They’re the most critical task that will take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling something big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more approachable and doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks because we simply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can produce a reliable estimate. Each key objective should have a clearly defined task or set of tasks. Tasks should be between 8 and 80 person-hours of labor. It is a manageable amount.\nBloom Tools: We ask our teams to prepare an Organization Development Plan that includes at least one and up to three critical objectives tied into key results and broken down into significant activities or tasks. It allows us to understand what the enterprise intends to accomplish during the accelerator period. Additionally, we encourage enterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to record their daily tasks and keep track of their progress to accomplish what they’ve planned within their set deadlines. \nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense of belonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can make us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are invaluable in joining forces with our peers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with them:\nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members. Supporting others will help them feel good and better about themselves. \nThe mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable relationships and gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps us to reach our goals and brings a sense of security.\nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique resource, and through its use, it increases in value. \nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning and feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors, and then the module leaders give feedback. \nThe general architecture of a cycle\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies used at leading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator programs to help teams develop their startup while learning leading productivity techniques.\n\nConclusion\nThis provides an overview of our Curriculum and pedagogy. We have further documentation for training Program Managers on managing their programs which goes into further detail. We aim to continuously improve our methodology with each program we run and are open to feedback, feel free to email bilal@bloom.pm, habib@bloom.pm and dara@bloom.pm with your recommendations!\nchose from the 5 accelerator and allthe other principles in the document",

      "content": "bring this:\nOur Core Principles. The Accelerator\n\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging, applying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that combines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their daily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board. \nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group rather than the negative ones. This approach builds the entrepreneur on their strengths, specifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions. Strengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent qualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of them or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired outcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort towards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement because they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when individuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud of themselves, and more engaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of resilience in achieving their goals. \nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to identify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of activities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise Capacity Assessment to measure the organizational capacity of enterprises. It allows us to have the whole picture of the strengths of both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing abilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. As a result, they tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). It is because they worry less about looking bright and put more energy into learning. \nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle. This system encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals into small, discrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each other and start building momentum, leading to more prominent and significant moves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day before. Start small and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to get impatient and start rushing forward and taking more significant leaps. Take it slow, steady, and consistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on getting 1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not seem like much, but those 1% improvements compound each other. \nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly power moves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort zone and push us forward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make many more steps. Power Moves take you right out of your regularly scheduled program. They are the key to real change. They’re the most critical task that will take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling something big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more approachable and doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks because we simply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can produce a reliable estimate.

Additionally, we encourage enterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to record their daily tasks and keep track of their progress to accomplish what they’ve planned within their set deadlines. \nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense of belonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can make us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are invaluable in joining forces with our peers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with them:\nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members.

It helps us to reach our goals and brings a sense of security.\nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique resource, and through its use, it increases in value. \nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning and feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors, and then the module leaders give feedback. \nHelp young people to help themselves: Keep the young people in the driver's seat: Do not offer answers. \nHelp young people to help each other. We create positive contexts where young people form communities, discuss challenges, and encourage each other to succeed. We grow best when we grow together and recognize perspectives\nVisualize growth: Support coaches by giving them a quantitative approach to identifying growth edges. \nDon’t reinvent the wheel. We provide coaches and teams with a library of activities tagged to their assessment categories to help each team find their next best growth step.\nKeep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat \\/-Upside down pyramid\n\nYouth in the driver’s seat\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the youth in our programs to help them do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous, nonaligned activities. It’s essential to keep the participants in the driver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment. \nThis is why we’ve developed our 4 pillar assessment model and library of related activities. This library provides a “learning by doing” catalog of activities that coaches can use to support young people’s development that spans 21st Century Skills, character strengths, and wellbeing focus, alongside the development of practical skills needed for running an enterprise. \n\nTransformation vs. Information. \nWe help make available knowledge actionable by designing library items around a specific action. In our Library of activities, we provide all the necessary worksheets, templates, and supporting videos to enable young people to take immediate action  (Library content) \nLet's not reinvent the wheel. More information is available at a click of a button than before. It’s not information that people need. Instead, what people need is an activation that leads to transformation. \nWe can help create an enabling environment for picking data.\nThe question we start with is: What if we could offer young people a compass to help guide them from where they are to where we want to be? \n\nPersonal and professional assessments\nOur coaches are encouraged to help young people find their compass and identify their needs.\nWe help coaches integrate personal development and well-being into professional development in a seamless way:\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessment)\nWe have dissected various developmental frameworks and identified the essential overlapping elements to support holistic, personal, and professional growth. \nWhy integrate personal growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team limits the effectiveness of an organization. Likewise, the effectiveness of a team is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal development and well-being are also at an end, we ensure that the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor attitude. Indeed, success comes at every step, even when that step is a failure.\nWe provide assessments to help identify where individuals and teams stand along these dimensions and have a library of activities for the program managers, the program mentors, and the team to select their subsequent best growth and learning opportunities.\nOur coaches are encouraged to see themselves along with the rest of the coaches, mentors, and other participants in the program as a part of a broader enabling environment.\nCreate an enabling environment for a proactive participation\nThe community element of building cohort-based programs is vital to help entrepreneurs flourish. They feel seen and supported in a community of like-minded learners and builders who support each other with constructive feedback and helpful resources.

      "content": "The INSPIRE framework represents a comprehensive approach to learning, encompassing various educational paradigms. Each element of INSPIRE corresponds to specific learning strategies and methodologies. Here's a detailed description of each element with step-by-step examples:\n\n1. **Inquiry-Based Learning**\n   - **Description:** This approach focuses on stimulating learners' curiosity and encouraging them to ask questions, investigate, and explore topics in-depth.\n   - **Step-by-Step Example:** In a class on environmental science, students might be asked to choose a local environmental issue. They formulate questions, conduct research, and present their findings, thus actively engaging in the learning process.\n\n2. **Narrative & Reflective Learning**\n   - **Description:** This method uses storytelling and personal reflection to deepen understanding and create connections between the learner’s experiences and the subject matter.\n   - **Step-by-Step Example:** Students in a literature class write a personal narrative relating a piece of literature to their own experiences, followed by reflecting on how this connection enhances their understanding of the text.\n\n3. **Self-Directed Learning**\n   - **Description:** Learners take the initiative in setting their own learning goals, choosing the resources, and evaluating their progress.\n   - **Step-by-Step Example:** In a project on renewable energy, a student chooses to focus on solar power. They gather resources, plan their study, and periodically self-assess their understanding and progress.\n\n4. **Problem-Based Learning**\n   - **Description:** Learning occurs through solving real-world problems, encouraging application of knowledge in practical scenarios.\n   - **Step-by-Step Example:** Medical students are presented with a patient case study. They must diagnose the patient, propose treatment options, and discuss potential outcomes, applying their medical knowledge.\n\n5. **Interactive & Collaborative Learning**\n   - **Description:** This focuses on learning through interaction and teamwork, where learners work together and learn from each other.\n   - **Step-by-Step Example:** In a business class, students are divided into groups to develop a business plan. They collaborate, delegate tasks, and collectively solve problems, learning from each other’s skills and perspectives.\n\n6. **Resilience & Grit**\n   - **Description:** Developing persistence and resilience, focusing on overcoming challenges and learning from failures.\n   - **Step-by-Step Example:** Students participate in a challenging coding marathon, where they encounter and have to overcome multiple programming obstacles, thereby learning persistence and problem-solving resilience.\n\n7. **Experiential Learning**\n   - **Description:** Learning through direct experience, hands-on activities, and reflection, linking theory to real-world application.\n   - **Step-by-Step Example:** Students in a culinary course prepare dishes using various techniques. They reflect on the process and results, linking cooking methods to the scientific principles behind them.\n\n8. **Self-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy**\n   - **Description:** Developing confidence in one's ability to successfully navigate and complete specific tasks or challenges.\n   - **Step-by-Step Example:** Entrepreneurship students are tasked with creating and running a small business for a term. Successes and challenges in this real-world application build their confidence in entrepreneurial abilities.\n\nBy employing the INSPIRE framework, educational programs can ensure a holistic and effective learning experience that addresses various aspects of learning and development, preparing learners for real-world challenges and fostering a lifelong love of learning.",

I think it's really important to see this as an opportunity rather than as a challenge. The large language models have been trained on mostly Western data languages that have been present and available online for a long time. And it's not because of any bias, it's just how the Internet develops, where the resources for it utilize it, and how it grew over time. And even the Internet is developing its own culture. And so I think it's possible and interesting to add an element where we can have people suggest alongside curiosity and risk, or even maybe as a subcategory inside of risk, in the risk assessment prompt.",

Your idea of incorporating a feature where users can suggest content related to cultural relevance as part of the risk assessment is intriguing. This could help in diversifying the perspectives and data that the AI works with. \n\nHere are a few suggestions to enhance your approach:\n\n1. **Cultural Sensitivity Filters:** Implement filters in your AI model that identify and address culturally specific nuances. This might include adapting the language or examples the AI uses based on the user's cultural background.\n\n2. **User Feedback Mechanism:** Create a system where users can provide feedback on AI responses. This data can be used to continuously improve the cultural relevance and sensitivity of the AI.\n\n3. **Diverse Data Sources:** To combat the Western-centric nature of most LLMs, actively seek out and incorporate datasets from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.\n\n4. **Ethical Advisory Board:** Consider establishing an advisory board with experts in cultural studies, ethics, and AI to guide the development and implementation of culturally sensitive AI models.\n\n5. **Localized Testing and Adaptation:** Conduct pilot tests in various cultural settings to understand how well the AI performs and make necessary adaptations.\n\nRemember, while technology like LLMs can be powerful, they also reflect the data they are trained on. Actively working to make your AI more culturally sensitive is a significant step towards creating a more inclusive and effective tool.",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **SaaS Model:** Leveraging the free credits as a starting point to build a robust set of case studies and user experiences is a strong strategy. It can showcase the effectiveness of your AI tool, attracting future paying customers. The subscription model provides steady revenue and can be attractive to users who prefer predictable costs. A pay-per-credit system might appeal to users with variable usage needs.\n\n2. **Unique Data Utilization:** Exploring the edge of large language models, especially in cross-cultural contexts, can be a strong selling point. By structurally capturing and organizing unique, hyper-local information through AI chat, you create a valuable dataset. However, ensure this aligns with data privacy and ethical guidelines.\n\n3. **Data Set Monetization:** Selling a well-organized, rich data set can be lucrative. However, it's crucial to design this aspect to be secure and respectful of user privacy. The 'type-n secure' design should be clearly explained in your proposal, emphasizing how it maintains privacy and ethical standards.\n\nIn your proposal, elaborating on these points can strengthen the scalability section. Explain how each model works, the potential market, and how you'll address any challenges, especially around data privacy and ethics. This clarity can make your application more compelling to the grant committee.",
