      "content": "Okay, so I want to work on my bloom.pm assessment framework. We want to rethink what we're assessing for our teams. We currently have an enterprise capacity assessment test that we call the ECAT, the e-cat, and we have the Measurement of Flourishing from the School of Positive Psychology, P-E-R-M-A-H, the PERMA score, and then we have one that's based on the United European Union's enterprise competencies called Entrecomp, and we're trying to do all these assessments and we're trying to get them pre-post, and so I need you to kind of interrogate me and grill me. I want to be able to think in a structured way about, like, which assessments, why are we taking these assessments, what purposes do they serve, why should we do pre-post. You know, we run an accelerator program. There's a boot camp phase where people are just curious, and we onboard them onto these Zoom calls, telling them, giving them some information. Then we have a sprint phase where they work with us deeply for two weeks, and then we have a entrepreneur development accelerator phase, which goes for about three months, where they have mentorship and more regular one-on-ones and follow-ups, and I'm wondering, you know, first let's think clearly and coherently about what we're doing and how to, like, reassess the assessments and what we want to do with them, and maybe first you can just ask me some questions to help me map out what are possible directions to take all of these assessments and figure out, should we add more assessments, should we reduce assessments, what are the assessments doing, what are the goals of the assessments, and what do we want to do with this information, how do we deal with the data, and all that. So maybe you can ask me, you know, first, like, reiterate what I've said, maybe look into our context window, look into our history, talking about, you know, how we used assessments for our research in the past, and see if you can come up with a way of framing this conversation right now.",

      "content": "Here’s what I understand about your situation:\n\nYou’re running a multi-phase accelerator program through Bloom.pm with distinct phases: a **boot camp** (onboarding, curiosity-driven), a **sprint phase** (intensive two-week collaboration), and an **entrepreneur development accelerator phase** (three months of mentorship and regular engagement). \n\nYou currently use three assessments:\n\n1. **ECAT (Enterprise Capacity Assessment Test)** – Bloom’s own framework for evaluating enterprise readiness or competencies.  \n2. **PERMAH (Measurement of Flourishing)** – From the School of Positive Psychology, evaluating well-being and psychological flourishing.  \n3. **EntreComp (European Union's framework)** – Measuring entrepreneurial competencies.\n\nYou’re administering these assessments pre- and post-program and are now rethinking their purpose, utility, and how they align with the goals of your program. You want to explore whether these assessments are sufficient, whether they overlap, and how their data serves participants and Bloom as an organization.\n\n### Some questions to help us map and interrogate this:\n\n#### Purpose and Goals of Assessments\n1. **What are you trying to measure?**\n   - Are you assessing individual growth, team dynamics, enterprise readiness, or something else?  \n   - Do you want to measure objective business outcomes (e.g., revenue, customers) or subjective changes (e.g., confidence, resilience)?\n\n2. **What outcomes matter most for Bloom?**\n   - Are you trying to justify program impact to stakeholders (e.g., funders, partners)?  \n   - Are you using the data to improve the program, coach participants, or create a research output?\n\n3. **Why pre- and post-?**\n   - Is the goal to track the effectiveness of the program?  \n   - Do participants see their own results, and does that help them reflect or grow?\n\n4. **How does each assessment align with your goals?**\n   - Does ECAT give you actionable insights about enterprise capacity?  \n   - Does PERMAH reflect something vital to entrepreneurial success, or is it more about personal well-being?  \n   - Is EntreComp being used as a benchmark for entrepreneurial competencies in a global context?\n\n#### Data Management and Analysis\n5. **What do you do with the data?**\n   - How is the data analyzed, visualized, and shared (internally or externally)?  \n   - Are there trends you’re consistently finding, or is the data noisy?  \n   - Do participants receive personalized feedback from their results?\n\n6. **How do you ensure the data is meaningful?**\n   - Do participants take assessments seriously?  \n   - Are there concerns about biases, or how people interpret the questions?\n\n7. **What gaps exist in your current assessments?**\n   - Are there critical dimensions of growth you’re not measuring? For example:  \n     - Resilience in failure  \n     - Decision-making under uncertainty  \n     - Relationship/network-building skills  \n   - Would new assessments provide value, or would they overload participants?\n\n#### Process and Experience for Participants\n8. **What is the participant experience with assessments?**\n   - Are participants engaged and reflective, or do they view the assessments as a chore?  \n   - How much time do these assessments take, and do they interrupt their focus on entrepreneurship?\n\n9. **When and how are assessments delivered?**\n   - Are pre- and post-assessments enough, or do you need mid-point check-ins?  \n   - Should assessments be spaced differently during the phases (e.g., at sprint vs. accelerator)?\n\n#### Potential Changes or Innovations\n10. **How might the assessments evolve?**\n    - Could you integrate real-time feedback loops during the accelerator?  \n    - Could assessments help participants track and celebrate their growth as a motivational tool?  \n\n11. **What’s missing?**\n    - Should you consider qualitative methods (e.g., interviews or journaling) in addition to quantitative assessments?  \n    - Are there frameworks you’re curious about that could add value (e.g., grit, emotional intelligence)?\n\n#### Your Prior Experience\n12. **Looking at the past:**\n    - In your previous research (e.g., post-traumatic growth, flourishing, and well-being with Beirut entrepreneurs), what worked well in your assessment strategy?  \n    - Did you notice any disconnect between the data collected and the story it told about the participants?\n\n13. **Learning from failure:**\n    - Have you faced challenges with past assessments?  \n    - Are there cases where the data didn’t reflect reality or participant experiences?\n\n#### Zooming Out\n14. **Big-picture questions:**\n    - If you could only keep one assessment, which one would you keep and why?  \n    - If you could design an entirely new framework for Bloom, what would it measure and why?  \n    - How do these assessments align with Bloom’s mission to foster flourishing and well-doing?\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\nDo any of these resonate? Would you like to dive into specific assessments, clarify your goals, or brainstorm innovations for what these assessments could do?",

      "content": "We're measuring personal and professional growth, and we're trying to find ways that they connect and lead to something that kind of shows that they both positively reinforce each other. And we want to measure objective business outcomes and confidence and resilience. Like, we want to do it all. Yeah, we want to show that the program has had impact and maybe sort of prove this hypothesis that working on resilience and well-being and flourishing for entrepreneurs is both already a success and it is a precursor to further entrepreneurial success as well. It's a hypothesis, but it's also what we want to see happen. And yes, we're using the data to improve the program and using the data to coach participants, and we're using it to create research output. The problem with pre-post right now is that we have something, you know, the Dunning-Kruger effect, where we have people that take the assessments and then learn more, and then because of that, they realize that they didn't know so much and they actually score worse the second time in the post. And so it doesn't really help show our program in the best light, and we want to figure out how to, like, address that. Like, how can we do something else so that we don't have that effect kind of make us look like people get worse throughout the course of our program instead of, you know, the idea that the Dunning-Kruger effect is actually a marker of learning. Yes, participants take the assessments, and then on our platform, they can actually see the results and then find activities in our library related to their results so that they can continue to grow. And yeah, so they do have the ability to see their results and interact with them. It's not just for us. We want to make sure that everything for the teams is, you know, is for the teams as well as for us, as well as the program partners and research, like, isn't just abstract. It's actually useful for everybody. ECAT gives us actionable insights as to where the teams can even spend some of the grant money from the accelerator. So we actually use it as one of the core benchmarks for what they want to learn and do during the course of these three months. So it's actually one of the kind of critical assessments that we use for the actions that they take. PERMA reflects this hope that we are helping people grow personally and professionally and that through their work, they're not just burning themselves out in social impact as a social enterprise. And so we want to make sure that we are measuring that, having conversations about that, and so on. Entrecomp is used, you know, kind of as part of wanting to align to global frameworks. And then also it's a competency. It's not something that is an individual competency compared to the ECAT that kind of is an organizational capacity. So the organizational capacity is a little different. Like the person and their capacity for, you know, kind of taking action or accessing resources, you know, working with others, learning through experience, self-awareness. That's all very personal. It's a little different than the kind of stuff that the well-being assessment will take. You know, the well-being assessment will take things. It's sort of, you know, like soft skills is another way that you can think of the Entrecomp. But we don't like that language of soft skills, so we just call them universal skills. So this is like universal skills. It's the personal growth element, but it doesn't include the well-being stuff. And so we're trying to do things around, you know, what does the business need, what does the person need, and how can they develop these competencies that are going to help them both in the business and in life. And that's what the Entrecomp helps us do. And then, yeah, so we use these assessments, especially the ECAT during the course of the program, and we actually use it to kind of, you know, assess where people are, where they're going. And we use the well-being to have conversations about, you know, wellness and the PERMA and the Entrecomp. We're still finding better ways of integrating that into the program. It's like right now currently just awareness, and we're trying to connect activities in our library with all the Entrecomp elements so that once they take an assessment, they actually can go into our library and find things to do. But we do need to make it more actionable, I guess. The data trends are, yeah, actually, there are some assessments that we don't do in the past that I have been finding really, you know, insightful for analysis, and that's the School of Positive Psychology's character strengths profile. It was another way of doing some of this, like, inner work stuff and related to, I guess, what we're now using PERMA for, you know? PERMA kind of shows about well-being and entrepreneurial capacities. Oh, sorry. Character strengths actually are also correlated with that, so we were using it as a way to, like, help people know themselves and then be able to identify, you know, ways of bringing that character strength to life during the course of the program. But we don't use it anymore in exchange for these partially because the assessment is kind of really long, the character strengths assessment, and nobody other than one of the founders knew how to really operate and hold space for it. And so I think it would be good to bring it back, but it's now mostly being taken care of by the PERMA assessment. But the previous data and interesting insights was related to the character strength, showing, you know, which character strengths kind of correlate with entrepreneurial success and which character strengths were supportive of resilience. Yeah, so gaps in the assessment is like we don't actually use all the data that we get, the well-being one in particular and the Entreprise Entrecomp one as well. It's too many bits of information and it's too much for people to take all the assessments pre-post. And so mostly what we do right now is we take the pre of the ECAT and then post we ask them, like, where they thought they grew, but we don't have a full post. Participants take assessments on their own on the computer. I think they think it's a chore. They can take an hour if you do all of them all together. We try not to make it an interruption on their entrepreneurship, and so we try to make it actually really useful, but it's a little bit hard to ensure that, you know, especially when it's early in the program, they still don't actually know what we're doing yet. Yeah, that's one of the things I was thinking about in terms of real-time feedback is instead of taking the assessment just in the beginning, could we actually take the assessment in the beginning and then over the course of the program, we could have, you know, moments. Let's talk about, like, well-being. We could say that, you know, we have a PERMA hangout every Sunday for people to gather and talk about that, and we can kind of take a snapshot and kind of update the data without having to take a whole other assessment. Yeah, I think we could bring in some more qualitative methods. That might be good, but that just sounds like more work, so what are things that we can do to kind of simplify and streamline? Keep one assessment. I guess we would just do the ECAT because it's the one that's most integrated operational. New framework. It would be everything. It would be maybe coming alive, and, you know, we see how it relates to the downstream stuff, but it's, like, the most internal, the most central that the other stuff emerges from.",

      "content": "Here’s a synthesis of what you’ve described, along with some structured questions to guide our way forward:\n\n### Current Framework and Challenges\n#### **What You’re Measuring**\n1. **Personal and Professional Growth:**  \n   - Resilience, confidence, well-being (measured by PERMA).\n   - Entrepreneurial competencies and universal skills (measured by EntreComp).  \n   - Organizational capacity and readiness (measured by ECAT).  \n\n2. **Objective Business Outcomes:**  \n   - Success metrics for teams, like revenue, customers, etc.\n\n3. **Hypothesis:**  \n   - Working on resilience and well-being leads to entrepreneurial success.  \n   - These two areas (personal and professional) reinforce one another.  \n\n#### **Key Challenges**\n1. **Dunning-Kruger Effect:**  \n   - Participants learning more results in lower post-assessment scores, which misrepresents growth.  \n\n2. **Assessment Overload:**  \n   - Too many assessments pre- and post-program feel like a chore.  \n   - Limited integration of EntreComp and PERMA into actionable insights or program activities.  \n\n3. **Underused Data:**  \n   - Data from assessments like PERMA and EntreComp isn’t fully utilized due to its complexity or scale.  \n\n4. **Lack of Real-Time Feedback Loops:**  \n   - Pre-post assessments don’t capture ongoing growth and insights during the program.\n\n5. **Operational Gaps:**  \n   - Participants don’t always understand the value of assessments early on.  \n   - Qualitative methods (e.g., conversations) sound valuable but might be resource-intensive.\n\n---\n\n### Key Questions to Rethink the Framework\n#### **Purpose of Assessments**\n1. **What’s the *one thing* you need these assessments to prove?**  \n   - Is it validating your program’s impact to funders?  \n   - Coaching participants to grow?  \n   - Building a research-backed methodology for entrepreneurial growth?  \n\n2. **What’s the most critical outcome to measure?**  \n   - Personal resilience?  \n   - Professional success?  \n   - A synthesis of both (e.g., how resilience drives business outcomes)?  \n\n3. **How can assessments balance rigor and simplicity?**  \n   - Could you streamline to one or two core assessments while still addressing your goals?\n\n#### **Improving Pre-Post Dynamics**\n4. **How can you counteract the Dunning-Kruger effect?**  \n   - Could you use tiered self-assessments (e.g., confidence and competence ratings separately)?  \n   - Could growth be framed as self-awareness, helping participants recognize progress in humility?  \n\n5. **Could you create *moments of reflection* during the program?**  \n   - Instead of just pre- and post-assessments, could smaller periodic check-ins (e.g., PERMA hangouts or ECAT reviews) track and celebrate growth?\n\n#### **Integration into Program Design**\n6. **How can assessments feel more useful to participants?**  \n   - Could you gamify the process, linking results to tangible rewards (e.g., unlocked library activities or grant milestones)?  \n   - Could participants co-interpret results in mentoring sessions to identify growth strategies?  \n\n7. **What would it look like to integrate real-time feedback loops?**  \n   - Could you embed shorter, modular assessments (e.g., weekly or monthly focus on one PERMA element)?  \n   - Could you use team discussions or journaling prompts to gather qualitative insights?\n\n#### **Streamlining and Simplification**\n8. **What’s the minimum viable framework?**  \n   - If you keep just one assessment (e.g., ECAT), how can you integrate elements of PERMA or EntreComp without duplicating efforts?  \n\n9. **Could you redesign PERMA or EntreComp to be more actionable?**  \n   - For example, tying EntreComp directly to coaching goals or using PERMA to spark weekly well-being conversations.  \n\n10. **Would a new framework make sense?**  \n    - Could you create an integrated framework (e.g., *Flourishing Competency Map*) that ties together personal, professional, and organizational growth?\n\n---\n\n### Possible Innovations\n1. **Tiered Assessment Model:**  \n   - Use a core assessment (e.g., ECAT) as the foundation.  \n   - Add lightweight, optional modules (e.g., PERMA snapshots during the program).  \n\n2. **Gamified Insights:**  \n   - Visualize growth over time for participants, like a “growth map” tracking resilience, confidence, and business outcomes.  \n\n3. **Qualitative Insights:**  \n   - Introduce simple journaling or reflection prompts aligned with assessments (e.g., “What’s one strength you’ve leaned on this week?”).  \n\n4. **Community Conversations:**  \n   - Host weekly PERMA or EntreComp hangouts to embed learning into the accelerator culture.\n\n5. **Real-Time Coaching Tools:**  \n   - Use assessment results dynamically during mentorship to identify action steps or gaps.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\nWhich of these questions or ideas resonates most with you? Should we focus on refining the current assessments, brainstorming a new framework, or solving specific challenges like Dunning-Kruger or pre-post fatigue?",

      "content": "I feel like we need to learn about these:\n\"The concept you're referring to is often linked to the idea that \"simpler models\" can outperform more complex ones under certain conditions. This is closely related to Occam's Razor, the bias-variance tradeoff, and principles from information theory. One well-known result in this area is that reducing the number of variables can help avoid overfitting and lead to models that generalize better to new data. Here are a few key ideas and research findings that align with what you're describing:\n\n1. The Bias-Variance Tradeoff\nThis concept explains why simpler models (with fewer variables) sometimes perform better. The tradeoff is that:\n\nHigh bias models (simpler models) make stronger assumptions about the data and might underfit.\nHigh variance models (complex models with many variables) can overfit to noise in the training data, failing to generalize well.\nA model that is too complex might capture noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on new data.\n\n2. Occam's Razor and Model Simplicity\nOccam's Razor is the principle that \"simpler explanations are more likely to be correct.\" In machine learning, this often means that models with fewer parameters are favored because they tend to be more robust and less prone to overfitting.\n3. Regularization Techniques\nRegularization methods (like Lasso and Ridge regression) deliberately penalize complexity by reducing the impact of less significant variables. Research has shown that regularization often improves model performance by effectively reducing the number of variables, leading to simpler models that generalize better.\n4. James-Stein Estimator\nThe James-Stein estimator is a famous result in statistics that demonstrates that, under certain conditions, shrinkage estimators (which \"shrink\" coefficients toward zero) can perform better than the usual maximum likelihood estimators. This idea aligns with the notion that reducing the complexity of the model (by reducing the impact of less important variables) can lead to more accurate predictions.\n5. Information Theory: Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle\nThe MDL principle suggests that the best explanation of data is the one that leads to the smallest combined length of the description of the data and the model. In practical terms, it often leads to selecting simpler models with fewer variables.\n6. \"The Blessing of Dimensionality\" in High-Dimensional Data\nSome studies in machine learning and statistics indicate that in certain high-dimensional settings, reducing the dimensionality (or the number of variables) can actually lead to better performance. This is sometimes referred to as \"the blessing of dimensionality,\" which is a counterpoint to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" The idea is that too many dimensions can create noise and make it harder for models to identify meaningful patterns.\nIf you're looking for specific papers or sources, I can help you track down more precise references. Alternatively, if any of these ideas sound familiar, I could narrow down the search for you!\n\n\n2/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nit was also something about linear, working with doctors and ensuring that htey can do the calculations with paper and pencil\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAh, it sounds like you're referring to the idea of using simple linear models or approaches that are interpretable and practical, especially in fields like medicine, where clinicians need to make decisions quickly and effectively, often without the aid of complex tools. This aligns with research advocating for simplicity in predictive models, particularly when users need to trust and understand the model.\n\nHere are some key aspects and potential research that might align with what you read:\n\n1. Linear Models in Medicine\nPaul Meehl's Work (1954): In Clinical vs. Statistical Prediction, Meehl argued that simple, linear statistical models often outperform clinicians' intuition in predictive tasks. His work showed that even basic models using a few well-chosen variables could rival or outperform complex, subjective judgments.\n2. Interpretable AI and Simplicity\nInterpretability in AI and Medicine: A common principle in medical decision-making is that predictive models should be interpretable and actionable. For example:\nA linear regression model with just a handful of variables can provide accurate predictions while remaining simple enough for clinicians to calculate or approximate without advanced tools.\nResearch has shown that even if complex machine learning models (like neural networks) are slightly more accurate, practitioners may prefer linear models because they are easier to understand and trust.\n3. Parsimony and Performance\n\"The Parsimony Principle\" in Healthcare Models: Studies show that reducing the number of variables to just the most important ones can often result in models that:\nAre easier for clinicians to use (e.g., on paper or with basic tools).\nPerform comparably or better because they avoid overfitting and reduce noise.\nOne famous example is the APACHE Score (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) used in intensive care units. It uses a manageable number of variables to predict mortality risk, balancing accuracy and usability.\n\n4. Evidence Supporting Simpler Models\nA study by G. Gigerenzer and others on \"fast-and-frugal heuristics\" shows that simple decision-making rules, using only a few key variables, can perform just as well as more complex methods in many real-world situations, including medicine.\n\nResearch in Risk Scores: Tools like the CHADS2 score (used for stroke risk in atrial fibrillation) or the TIMI risk score (used for heart attack risk) are intentionally simple and based on linear models so clinicians can use them without technology. These tools demonstrate how fewer variables and simple calculations can be clinically effective.\n\n5. Focus on Linear Models\nIn healthcare research, linear models are often favored for their:\nEase of use: Clinicians can compute them manually or with simple tools.\nTransparency: It’s easier to explain why a model produces a specific prediction.\nRobustness: Linear relationships are often good approximations for medical outcomes, where small variations in complex models may not add value.\nDoes this sound like what you were reading about? If you'd like, I can help track down papers or articles on interpretable models in healthcare or provide examples of such tools in practice!\"\n\n1 it's creating a coaching program that's validated and measuring the few right things while also offering a map to participants. I feel like we need to do two things: 1) offer people a framing to understand/accept that entrepreneurship is not all team building and fundraising, and involves soft skills and wellbeing - AND measuring the right things that can help us guide our program, and ensure that the participants build the capacity to see the framing, develop awareness of framing, self, business, agency to operationalize that awareness, and have acess to resources, mentors/funding to enact upon that awareness. I think this is sort of a key insight here. \n2. i think the most critical measure might be flourishing, progression the people indicate towards their ECAT development insights and gap filling (maybe we measure that - as peopel go, where are you on xyz element. What did you do, maybe we can progressively add naunce to that ECAT element with each time we run the program, they may open a new nuance that counts as progression - just like you can find an infinity between any two numbers, or a dewey decimile system can add new elements, I feel like people can be able to add their own elements and we should sort of emphaisize and prioritize this.\n3. I think we can streamline assessments... focusing on agency, wellbeing, community closeness, power moves and coming alive, self awareness and self efficacy, etc...\n4. what if instead of a pre / post - we took a pre and then a progress towards a post where we count ahas, moments of awareness and insight, ways they changed their mind about what x category means, we measure change not an arrival. \n5. yeah, I think the metephor of a mirror for the teams might help us the most, we pick up an mirror and show them things, ask them questions, leading them, guiding them and measuring their growth this way - one question is how do we \"align with other organizations\" who use the same assessment, right now, no one else does. also - how do we utilize our software, which asks people to pick a priority area and then talk write out their learning goals inside it.\n6. we had these badges ideas in the past, although I'm not sure it's such a great idea anymore. \nyeah, i think maybe we can take a \"look inside yourself\" approach to entrepreneurial growth where we are entering the \"garden\" of their life, they bring in as much or as little information as they think is relevant and we work with them to cultivate a place of flourishing towards their goals\n7. if we did shorter modular assessments, it could be nice, although it wouldn't be possible to do \"pre/post\" - which is why I think we really need to ask WHAT exactly are we mreasuring for?\n8. i think maybe the Minimum viable framework goes \"up another level\" and instead of measuring specific aspects we can measure things more upsetream and monitor the sepcifc aspects, this way we measure less things and use the aspects of PERMA and ECAT / etc as guides to activities, etc? \n9 . yeah, i lik entrecomp into coaching goals that makes sense and PERMAH conversations or floushing moments. maybe we need to share our \"garden\" analogy and integrate it across the board ",

      "content": "Let's break down your ideas and refine them into actionable steps to reshape your assessment framework for Bloom.pm:\n\n### 1. Framing and Reframing Entrepreneurship\n- **Key Insight:** Entrepreneurship isn't just about team building and fundraising; it also involves soft skills, well-being, and self-awareness.\n  - **Goal:** Create a coaching program that validates and measures critical areas while offering a map for participants.\n  - **Action:** Develop a narrative or framework that introduces entrepreneurship as a holistic journey involving personal and professional growth. Consider using metaphors like the \"garden\" to emphasize nurturing, growth, and flourishing.\n\n### 2. Measuring Progress Over Time\n- **Flourishing as a Central Metric:** Use PERMAH to gauge well-being and correlate it with entrepreneurial success.\n- **Progressive ECAT Development:**\n  - **Idea:** Allow participants to progressively refine their ECAT elements, introducing nuances as they grow.\n  - **Action:** Introduce a dynamic ECAT where participants can add nuances or new elements, similar to the Dewey Decimal System, representing finer levels of growth.\n\n### 3. Streamlining Assessments\n- **Focus Areas:** Agency, well-being, community, self-awareness, and self-efficacy.\n  - **Action:** Consolidate assessments to emphasize these key areas, reducing redundancy and enhancing focus.\n\n### 4. Beyond Pre/Post Assessments\n- **Continuous Reflection:** Measure growth through moments of awareness, insights, and changed perspectives rather than static pre/post snapshots.\n  - **Action:** Introduce reflective practices like journals or periodic prompts that capture “aha” moments, mindset shifts, and growth trajectories.\n\n### 5. The Mirror Metaphor and Alignment with Others\n- **Mirror as a Metaphor:** Use assessments as mirrors that reflect participants’ growth and challenges.\n  - **Action:** Design assessments as reflective tools, prompting self-discovery and personal insights.\n- **Alignment with External Frameworks:** If other organizations don’t use your assessments, consider adapting existing ones or creating modular components that align with standard frameworks like EntreComp.\n  - **Action:** Explore partnerships or licensing opportunities to make your frameworks more widely used.\n\n### 6. Revisiting the Badge System\n- **Past Badge Ideas:** Consider if badges still hold value in reinforcing milestones and celebrating progress.\n  - **Action:** If continuing with badges, ensure they represent meaningful achievements and encourage exploration and growth.\n\n### 7. The Garden Analogy\n- **Cultivating a Personal Garden:** Encourage participants to bring in as much personal context as they feel comfortable with, fostering a tailored growth environment.\n  - **Action:** Use the garden analogy in workshops and coaching to promote a sense of ownership and personalized growth.\n\n### 8. Modular, Shorter Assessments\n- **Modular Approach:** Instead of one-time pre/post assessments, introduce shorter, focused modules throughout the program.\n  - **Action:** Develop modular assessments that can be integrated at various program stages, offering real-time insights without overwhelming participants.\n\n### 9. Minimum Viable Framework (MVF)\n- **Upstream Measures:** Focus on high-level metrics (e.g., overall flourishing) while using specific frameworks like PERMAH and ECAT as guiding tools for activities.\n  - **Action:** Redefine your MVF to focus on broader, upstream measures that inform and direct specific program activities and goals.\n\n### 10. Integrating PERMAH and EntreComp into Coaching\n- **Embedding in Coaching:** Align coaching sessions with PERMAH and EntreComp elements to make them actionable and relevant.\n  - **Action:** Develop coaching scripts and session templates that incorporate well-being discussions and entrepreneurial competencies.\n\n### 11. Creating a Holistic Program Narrative\n- **Garden Analogy as a Core Theme:** Integrate the garden analogy across the entire program to emphasize holistic growth.\n  - **Action:** Use the garden theme in orientation sessions, workshops, coaching, and assessments to create a cohesive program narrative.\n\n### 12. Refining the \"Why\" of Assessments\n- **Purpose of Assessment:** Clearly define what each assessment aims to measure and why it matters.\n  - **Action:** Create a mission statement for each assessment tool, explaining its purpose and how it contributes to participant growth and program improvement.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Prioritize Framework Elements:** Identify which ideas or frameworks resonate most and should be prioritized.\n2. **Develop a Pilot:** Consider piloting one or two new ideas (e.g., modular assessments or reflective journals) in the next cohort.\n3. **Gather Feedback:** Collect feedback from current and past participants to refine assessment tools and approaches.\n4. **Iterate and Scale:** Based on pilot feedback, iterate the assessment framework and scale it for broader use.\n\nWould you like to start with refining specific assessments, drafting the garden analogy as a core narrative, or another aspect of your framework?",

      "content": "Alright, this is so rich with insight! I can see how you’re weaving together your goals with the philosophical foundations of your work. Let’s use this as a springboard to shape a more cohesive, impactful assessment framework that really captures the *essence* of what you’re doing with Bloom.pm.  \n\n**First, let’s unpack your big ideas and blend them into a streamlined framework:**  \n\n1. **Simplicity with Depth (Bias-Variance Tradeoff, Occam’s Razor):**  \n   - Focus on fewer, but more meaningful metrics (like *flourishing* and *agency*).  \n   - Allow participants to reflect and self-report progression (not just outcomes) to capture the nuance of their growth journey.  \n\n2. **Pre to Progress (Not Pre to Post):**  \n   - Move away from a traditional pre-post model, embracing an *ongoing reflection* model.  \n   - Integrate “mirror moments” where participants reflect on their own insights and shifts in understanding—capturing their “ahas” and changed perspectives.  \n\n3. **Integration of Assessments into Action (ECAT, PERMAH, EntreComp):**  \n   - ECAT remains central as it directly influences how teams allocate resources and grow their businesses.  \n   - PERMAH is reframed not just as a measure of well-being but as a way to spark ongoing “flourishing moments” discussions—mini check-ins during the program.  \n   - EntreComp guides coaching conversations, embedding universal skills development into practical, real-world applications (like setting learning goals within their projects).  \n\n4. **Minimum Viable Framework & Garden Analogy:**  \n   - Assess less, nurture more. The garden analogy works beautifully—each participant cultivates their own space of flourishing with guidance.  \n   - Rather than a rigid “you must grow this plant” approach, it’s “let’s see what you can grow with what you have.” Focus on upstream measures like self-awareness, intentionality, and alignment with personal values/goals.  \n\n5. **Utilizing Your Platform & Real-Time Feedback Loops:**  \n   - Use your platform’s ability to track learning goals and priorities as ongoing assessments.  \n   - Modular “reflection prompts” could be integrated into the platform—short, reflective questions tied to weekly themes (like agency, resilience, community).  \n\n6. **Aligning with Other Organizations & Research Outputs:**  \n   - Share the “garden” analogy and focus on holistic growth with potential partners.  \n   - Frame your approach as a unique blend of *personal flourishing* and *entrepreneurial capacity*, linking back to well-being research.  \n\n7. **From Badges to Personal Narratives:**  \n   - Instead of badges, consider storytelling—participants craft their own growth narratives (mini case studies or personal stories) that capture their learning journey.  \n\n8. **Coaching & Community Conversations:**  \n   - Integrate PERMAH into weekly “flourishing circles” or community conversations—less about formal assessment, more about sharing and collective growth.  \n\n---\n\n**Let’s sharpen this into a few core actions:**  \n\n- **Develop a new reflection-based assessment model:** Measure insights, shifts in perspective, and personal growth moments rather than static outcomes.  \n\n- **Create “flourishing circles” within the accelerator program:** Regular, themed check-ins that encourage sharing around PERMAH elements.  \n\n- **Refine ECAT with progression tracking:** Allow teams to articulate their growth in their own words—how they’ve moved closer to their vision or refined their strategies.  \n\n- **Launch a storytelling initiative:** Participants document their journey, highlighting key learnings and growth—these become part of your program’s narrative and research base.  \n\n- **Modularize assessments into the flow of the program:** Smaller, lighter reflections tied to themes, rather than big pre-post assessments.  \n\n- **Integrate the garden analogy:** Use this as a guiding metaphor across the program, framing growth as ongoing, organic, and deeply personal.  \n\n---\n\n**Next steps:**  \n- How about we draft a sample structure for a “flourishing circle” session or a reflection prompt set for a module?  \n- Or we could sketch out a new version of ECAT that focuses on progression and personal narrative?  \n\nWhere do you want to dive in deeper? Let’s build this into something transformative!",

      "content": "Here’s a structured response to align with your insights and move the discussion forward:\n\n---\n\n### **Core Insights**\nYour key goals for the program are to:\n1. **Frame entrepreneurship holistically:** Help participants understand that entrepreneurship is more than just team-building and fundraising—it involves *well-being, soft skills, agency*, and developing self-awareness.\n2. **Measure what matters most:** Focus on flourishing, progression, self-awareness, and participants' ability to turn insights into action. Instead of focusing on an \"end state,\" you’re interested in measuring *change*, *awareness*, and *capacity to evolve*.\n3. **Support participants’ growth:** Provide actionable insights through a framework that:\n   - Acts as a mirror, reflecting back their growth and guiding them.  \n   - Creates a personalized, living \"garden\" analogy for growth, helping them cultivate flourishing.  \n   - Adapts and scales based on participant needs and goals.\n\n---\n\n### **Opportunities for Refinement**\n#### 1. **Simplifying Assessments: What Are We Measuring?**\n   - **From Measurement to Mirrors:** Instead of rigid pre/post measures, use assessments as mirrors to reflect growth and spark awareness. This could include:\n     - Capturing \"aha moments,\" insights, and shifts in mindset.\n     - Tracking how participants frame and reframe their understanding of entrepreneurship over time.\n     - Highlighting progression in ECAT-related elements, focusing on how they close gaps or unlock nuances.  \n\n   - **Critical Measures:**\n     - **Agency:** Are participants more able to take ownership of their decisions and actions?  \n     - **Well-being and Flourishing:** Are they sustaining themselves and feeling empowered in their work?  \n     - **Community and Connection:** Are they building stronger, more meaningful networks?  \n     - **Self-Efficacy:** Do they believe in their ability to navigate challenges?  \n     - **Power Moves and Clarity:** Are they taking decisive steps toward their goals, supported by clearer awareness?  \n\n#### 2. **Rethinking Pre-Post Models**\n   - **Progress vs. Arrival:** Shift the paradigm from \"before and after\" to ongoing progression. For instance:\n     - Pre-assessment: Set a baseline and identify areas for growth.  \n     - During the program: Add micro-check-ins to capture insights and shifts in mindset (e.g., journal prompts, team discussions, or \"aha logs\").  \n     - Post-assessment: Reflect on progression and explore future growth areas.  \n\n   - **Nuanced Growth:** Build ECAT as a dynamic tool where participants uncover new layers of growth. Think of it like a *Dewey Decimal System*—where progress is infinite, and participants can add their own elements to track nuance and evolution.\n\n#### 3. **Streamlining and Making Assessments Actionable**\n   - **Modular, Shorter Assessments:** Consider breaking down assessments into smaller, periodic modules:\n     - ECAT elements (e.g., specific capacities).\n     - PERMA \"flourishing check-ins\" (e.g., weekly or biweekly well-being discussions).  \n     - EntreComp-focused prompts that align with coaching goals.\n\n   - **Living Frameworks:** Use frameworks (PERMA, ECAT, EntreComp) as **guides to activities** rather than rigid measures. Let these frameworks point participants to relevant resources, mentors, or goals.\n\n   - **Data Use:** Streamline by focusing only on data you can actively use for:\n     - Coaching participants.  \n     - Program design.  \n     - Demonstrating impact to funders.  \n\n#### 4. **Aligning Assessments with Broader Ecosystems**\n   - **Shared Standards:** If no one else uses your assessments, consider:\n     - Partnering with organizations or researchers to validate and popularize the ECAT.  \n     - Developing open-source elements of your assessment tools for broader adoption.\n     - Aligning specific ECAT and PERMA elements with existing global frameworks (e.g., EntreComp).\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Framework**\n#### **Minimum Viable Framework: A Higher-Level Approach**\nFocus on *upstream measures* (e.g., agency, flourishing, self-efficacy) and use frameworks like PERMA, ECAT, and EntreComp as **guides** for specific aspects of growth.\n\n1. **Baseline Assessment (Pre):**  \n   - Focus on high-level areas like agency, well-being, and self-efficacy.  \n   - Use the ECAT to identify specific capacities and gaps.  \n\n2. **Ongoing Reflection (During Program):**  \n   - Use modular check-ins or conversations to track progression in mindset and insights (e.g., PERMA hangouts, EntreComp coaching goals).  \n   - Capture \"aha moments\" and shifts in understanding as markers of growth.\n\n3. **Progress Reflection (Post):**  \n   - Revisit ECAT to measure how gaps were closed or new nuances were discovered.  \n   - Reflect on changes in agency, flourishing, and self-efficacy.\n\n4. **Integrated Garden Analogy:**  \n   - Position participants as gardeners cultivating their growth.  \n   - Use ECAT, PERMA, and EntreComp as tools to tend to different areas of their \"garden.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Practical Suggestions**\n#### 1. **Integrate Growth Moments into the Program**\n   - Host PERMA or flourishing discussions weekly or biweekly to reinforce well-being.  \n   - Use team meetings or mentor sessions to highlight growth and progression, tying it to ECAT elements.  \n\n#### 2. **Redesign ECAT as a Living Tool**\n   - Add flexibility to ECAT by letting participants customize or \"unlock\" new elements over time, reflecting nuanced growth.  \n\n#### 3. **Create Reflection Spaces**\n   - Build tools (journals, prompts, or software integrations) that allow participants to log \"ahas,\" shifts in understanding, and self-assessed progression.  \n\n#### 4. **Streamline with Modular Assessments**\n   - Replace long assessments with smaller, periodic modules that fit naturally into the program.  \n\n#### 5. **Focus on Alignment and Partnerships**\n   - Explore partnerships to validate and share your framework, making it useful for other organizations.  \n\n---\n\n### Questions for You\n1. **What’s the most critical outcome to measure for funders, participants, and program improvement?**\n2. **How much time or effort should participants spend on assessments, and how can we ensure they feel useful?**\n3. **What would a dynamic ECAT tool look like in practice? How can we help participants \"unlock\" new growth areas?**\n4. **How do you see the \"garden\" analogy playing out across all aspects of the program?**\n5. **Would modular assessments fit your program rhythm better, or do you see value in keeping pre/post with a progression focus?**\n\nWhich of these ideas resonates most, and where would you like to dive deeper?",

      "content": "what insights from our program manual might nuance and improve our ideas: [[[Program Management Guide\nA step-by-step guide to running accelerator programs using the Bloom Framework\n\nTable of Contents\nIn Document Outline in the left sidebar.\n\nIntroduction \nThis guide aims to be a living, breathing organism built as an open-source project. We created it to help accelerators and program managers focus on impact and inclusive entrepreneurship in developing/emerging ecosystems through skill-based and character-based support. \nHow to use this step-by-step guide?\nRunning accelerator programs is a young and evolving field. With limited proven research into best practices, we do not wish to claim a set formula or one-size-fits-all approach. Accelerator models vary significantly depending on their objectives. \nInstead, the guide aims to help program managers understand some of the critical choices and challenges they'll need to consider if they're considering building a program of their own. It combines lessons from previous practices and patterns we identified over the years to highlight and frame the strategic choices facing stakeholders interested in creating and running these programs. \nWe developed this guide into two sections:\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻\nThis section will help you understand our framework and assessment suite.\nSection 2: Running an Accelerator Program 🌟\nThis section covers the critical aspects of creating and running an accelerator in six simple stages. Each stage comes with a series of toolkits to help you think about your plans and the context of accelerator design.\n\n\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻 \nAlso here: Bloom Framework v0.9 - Two Pillars (draft)\nBloom's Training Framework offers a dynamic, adaptive learning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a guided project-based and cohort-based learning approach. It focuses on two core pillars:\nThe Individual: Featuring Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH), Universal Skills, Character Strengths, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessments.\nThe Organization: Featuring the Organizational Development Assessment.\nThe framework helps assess core strengths and weaknesses, prioritizing areas for learning and development. Our goal is to simplify the creation of custom learning journeys, enabling teams and program managers to identify optimal learning opportunities, foster a supportive environment, and positively impact businesses.\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement across both pillars, ensuring simultaneous development and, for example, improving an individual's skill through activities that address core organizational needs.\nEntrepreneurs identify their priority development areas based on assessment results and customize their learning journey with program managers, co-creating a tailored curriculum for the cohort.\nOur framework is based on proven cohort-based and project-based learning methods combined with the power of mentorship. Peer learning enhances the experience, while project-based learning aligns objectives with a mission or vision, fostering intrinsic motivation. Using a flipped classroom approach, entrepreneurs first digest relevant content, reflect on their learnings, and apply them in their enterprises. They then meet with their cohort for peer feedback and mentorship, using what they learn in real-life settings.\nOur programs nurture individual and organizational development, promoting cooperation over competition and leveraging collective intelligence to solve pressing societal problems.\nThe Bloom Training Framework is versatile and can be used in various contexts, including companies, educational programs (youth, school, university), startup accelerators, and short events like startup sprints or hackathons.\n\nOur Principles\nWe use the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize program activities:\nKeep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat. (Upside down pyramid) \\/\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the teams in our programs to help them do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous, nonaligned activities. We want to keep the teams and participants in the driver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment. \nTransformation > Information. Make available knowledge actionable. (Library content)  \nPrioritizing transformative learning experiences over mere information dissemination ensures that knowledge is applied in meaningful ways. By providing actionable insights and practical tools, we create an environment where learning translates into real-world impact.\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessments)\nOptimizing team composition by aligning individual strengths and roles enhances overall team effectiveness. Through comprehensive assessments, we identify key areas for personal and professional growth, enabling targeted interventions that maximize individual and collective potential.\nWhy integrate individual growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal development and well-being are also an end, we ensure that the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor attitude. \nCreate an enabling environment in the program and support the broader ecosystem.\nFostering a supportive community within cohort-based programs is essential for creating an enabling environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. By nurturing a culture of collaboration and mutual support, we enhance the learning experience and contribute to the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem. We win when we win together. \n\nPillar 1: The Individual\nBloom recommends the following individual development assessments:\nWellbeing & Engagement: at work & in life (through PERMAH)\nEntrepreneurship & Leadership Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of entrepreneurship and leadership \nCharacter Strengths: through VIA, Values in Action \nUniversal Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life)\n 1.1. Wellbeing & Engagement \nOur Wellbeing and Engagement assessment is rooted in the principles of positive psychology and aims to measure human flourishing. This assessment evaluates six critical dimensions. These dimensions are essential indicators of a well-lived life, each contributing uniquely to an individual's overall sense of wellbeing.\nPositivity: Measures the extent to which an individual experiences positive emotions, crucial for enhancing resilience and overall mental health.\nEngagement: Assesses the level of involvement and absorption in activities, reflecting a flow state where individuals are fully immersed and find deep satisfaction.\nRelationships: Evaluates the quality of an individual's connections with others, recognizing that supportive and fulfilling relationships are fundamental to wellbeing.\nMeaning: Gauges the sense of purpose and direction in life, indicating how much individuals feel their lives have significance and contribute to something greater.\nAchievement: Measures the accomplishment of goals and the sense of mastery, highlighting the importance of setting and achieving personal and professional objectives.\nHealth: Assesses physical wellbeing, acknowledging that a healthy body is essential for overall life satisfaction.\nUsing the PERMAH framework, we ensure our programs focus on professional success and personal flourishing. This approach helps individuals and organizations achieve sustainable success by aligning personal wellbeing with organizational goals. \n1.2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\nThe Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessment evaluates proficiency in recognizing opportunities, mobilizing resources, and taking effective action in various contexts. This assessment is based on the EntreComp framework, a comprehensive tool developed by the European Commission to promote entrepreneurship education and training. EntreComp offers a common reference framework that defines the key competencies necessary for entrepreneurial behavior and mindset.\nWe use the EntrepComp framework to help people build skills along six dimensions:\n\n1.3. Character Strengths \nCharacter strengths are invaluable tools that guide us in developing skills and enhancing our effectiveness in any endeavor. Leveraging these strengths makes learning new things more accessible and enjoyable. In Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action (VIA) Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strengths.” These strengths appear naturally and authentically, providing energy rather than requiring effort. Using our Signature Strengths promotes well-being and vitality in the workplace, leading to greater engagement and productivity. The VIA assessment analyzes virtues and values across cultures, identifying 24 universally recognized character strengths. These strengths are clustered into six core virtues:\n\nWisdom and Knowledge: Creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, and innovation. These strengths enable us to gain and use knowledge effectively.\nCourage: Bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality, and zest. These strengths help us face challenges and pursue goals despite obstacles.\nHumanity: Love, kindness, and social intelligence. These strengths foster meaningful and supportive relationships with others.\nJustice: Citizenship, fairness, and leadership. These strengths contribute to a just and equitable community.\nTemperance: Forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, and self-control. These strengths help us regulate our behaviors and emotions.\nTranscendence: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, and spirituality. These strengths connect us to something greater and provide a sense of purpose and meaning.\nBy identifying and using our Signature Strengths, we can bring energy and positivity to our work, fostering a thriving and productive environment. This approach to personal development ensures that individuals achieve professional success and lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.\n1.4. Universal Skills.  \nUniversal Skills are competencies that benefit individuals across all organizational sectors and roles. These skills are critical to our personal development framework, ensuring team members can thrive regardless of their specific personal or professional requirements. Our approach to developing Universal Skills is guided by the Universal Skills Framework from SkillsBuilder.org, which categorizes these skills into four key dimensions:\nCommunication: Enhancing the ability to convey ideas clearly and effectively fostering better understanding and collaboration.\nProblem Solving: Equipping individuals to analyze situations, identify challenges, and develop practical solutions, thereby improving decision-making and innovation.\nSelf-Management: Developing personal discipline, time management, and resilience to navigate complex tasks and maintain productivity under pressure.\nTeamwork: Cultivating the skills necessary for effective collaboration, including empathy, cooperation, and working harmoniously in diverse teams.\nFocusing on these four dimensions ensures that our team members are equipped with versatile skills applicable in any context. This development approach enhances individual performance and contributes to our organization's overall effectiveness and adaptability. Using the Universal Skills Framework, we provide structured and targeted training that supports continuous personal and professional growth, ensuring that our teams are well-prepared to meet the demands of the modern workplace.\nHow To Apply the Individual Development Framework:  \nRequest your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development assessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills, Well-being and Engagement, and Character Strengths.\nIn program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers can help participants identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from their knowledge, online resources, or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nFor Character Strengths:\nAfter the individuals take the Character Strengths assessments, you can request individuals and teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\nOnce they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to select a priority area within their Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills results on the Bloom Learn tab.\nEnd-of-program assessments help participants and program managers see growth and chart paths for further improvement.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom Personal Framework involves critical skills and values that help you be effective as a person.\nIt includes Well-being & Engagement, Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills, Character Strengths and Universal Skills.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nUniversal Skills – Bloom\nWellbeing and Motivation – Bloom\nCharacter Strengths – Bloom\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nThe Skills Builder Partnership\nPermah Survey Home - The PERMAH Wellbeing Survey\nVIA Character Strengths Survey & Character Reports | VIA Institute\n\nPillar 2: The Organization\nBloom recommends the following organizational development assessment:\nThe Organizational Development Assessment is a way to assess your enterprise’s organizational status and needs quickly. Teams use it as a self-assessment tool, a guided collaborative process, or program managers can do third-party assessments.\n2.1. Organizational Development  \nOrganizational Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while anticipating and managing future changes and risks. Our Organizational Capacity Assessment is derived from established methodologies by international consulting firms, tailored specifically for enterprises and accelerators. Bloom’s Organizational Capacities assessment helps organizations identify blind spots, providing a 360-degree perspective on their current state and guiding them in selecting development areas that will have the most impact. We offer adapted versions of the assessment for enterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\nThe Organizational Capacity Assessment categories are:\n\n🎯 Strategy\n📲 Products and Services\n💶 Revenues, Financial Management & Sustainability\n🫶🏽 Corporate Social Responsibility\n🤝 Community Engagement & Communication\n🧑 Team, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\n👨‍🏫 Innovation & Learning\n🧑🏽‍⚖️ Legal & Compliance\n⚠️ Infrastructure, Risk, Security & Resilience\n\nWhy a Self-Assessment?\nSelf-assessments provide rich information about organizational capacity and inform performance monitoring plans. They are primarily tools for capacity strengthening rather than performance evaluation. A critical aspect of a participatory assessment is fostering a safe space where staff can freely discuss an enterprise’s issues and priorities without fear of consequences when highlighting organizational weaknesses, challenges, and needs for improvement. In summary, self-assessment is a self-diagnosis process where an enterprise reflects on its performance, identifies priorities and goals, and sets a path toward achieving benchmarks. An Enterprise Capacity Assessment supports organizational decision-making and ownership of the capacity development process.\nResults Debrief and Analysis\nThe purpose of this step is to analyze the results with the assessment group so the enterprise can digest and understand the results and compare its current capacity against its longer-term goals. The presentation and discussion of results should be non-judgmental and positive. \nSuggested Steps:\nOpen the session and welcome everyone \nExplain the purpose of this meeting.\nReiterate that all results are indicators rather than performance assessments and encourage continued active participation\nDiscuss and analyze the results\nDiscuss each category with questions such as\nWhat is your reaction to these results? Are there any surprises?\nWhat are your observations about the enterprise’s overall capacity in this category?\nAre the scores for each indicator polarized or consistent with each other? Why?\nWhat is the enterprise doing well? What can the enterprise learn from success in this area?\nSummarize the discussion by highlighting the most surprising results or eliciting the most significant difference in opinion. \nReflect on the assessment results\nAsk the participants to discuss the following questions::\nWhat are our most important issues or weaknesses as an enterprise?\nWhat is causing these issues?\nIdentify key capacity issues revealed during the assessment.\nLook for root causes of issues, not just symptoms.\nIdentify issues common to multiple capacity areas.\nPriority Setting and Action Planning\nThis step helps the enterprise prioritize the issues identified during the assessment for inclusion in the Organization's Development Plan. \nSuggested Steps:\nLink the problems identified with the objectives\nStart with a discussion using these prompts\nDo you think any of the issues identified are more critical than others? Why?\nWhich categories or sub-categories would foster the most significant change in bringing the enterprise closer to its vision and goals?\nAsk the participants to vote on which objective they consider priorities over the next cycle and which should be in the Organization's Development Plan.\nExplain that the number of categories or subcategories to include depends on the time to implement the plan, the complexity of activities, and the resources required. Encourage the group to be pragmatic. \nIdentify key results and significant initiatives for each objective.\nWhat relevant milestones would your enterprise expect to achieve within the program timeframe?\nHow To Apply the Organizational Development Framework:  \nThe program manager invites teams and participants to take the relevant Organization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform (Enterprise Capacities or Accelerator Capacities). \nAfter participants take the assessment, they are requested to go over their results and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to select their priority areas of development and the particular objectives they would like to achieve during the program. \nThe Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s template for the duration of the program and is a shared document between the teams, the mentors, and the program manager. \nRegular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team, mentors, and program managers stay on track, adjust where needed, solve problems, and track progress.\nTeams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority development areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Bloom framework's second pillar is organizational development. It includes the “doing” work of a person, team, or organization and the skills that help a team flourish. \nIt includes the ​​CAT (Capacity Assessment Tool) system, with specific assessments using categories and questions adapted to the needs of teams and programs. \n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nECAT – Bloom\nProgram Dashboard for [Team Name] Template - Enterprise Capacities v1.1\n\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nAssessing your strengths and weaknesses with the McKinsey Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool (OCAT)\n\n\nSection 2: Running A Program\nStage 0: Preparations\nIn this section, we provide basic information on how accelerators operate. It covers the critical aspects of creating and finalizing program basics.\nProgram Design\nWe can adapt our programs to meet the partner's objectives best, whether for economic development, education, impact/CSR purposes, corporate development, staff training, corporate innovation/intrapreneurship, or others. We refine each approach to design the best program to deliver the desired results. \nSome program design parameters include \nNumber of Teams: Varies by partner\nWe aim to have twice as many teams in the sprint phase as a general rule\nTeam Composition: Varies by partner\nWe generally recommend having at least two team members actively working on the enterprise though it varies depending on enterprise stage.\nEnterprise Stage: From pre-idea, concept/idea stage, startup, or established enterprise. \nEnterprise Development Stages\nStages\nSub-Stages\n0. LEARNING\t\n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1. IDEATION\n1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\n2. IDEA-STAGE\n2.1. Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research \n2.2. Have started developing my idea\n3. PROTOTYPE\n3.1. Have an early (low-fidelity/paper) prototype (of product or service)\n3.2. Have a functioning (high-fidelity) prototype with early users / early adopters\n4. EARLY-STAGE\n4.1. Declining revenues and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.2. Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.3. Revenues are multiplying, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n5. GROWTH-STAGE\n5.1. Profitable/sustainable business\n5.2. Seeking scalability (of impact and profits)\n5.3. Seeking diversification \n5.4. Seeking an exit \n5.5. Established national enterprise\n5.6. Established multinational enterprise\n\n\nGeography: Varies by partner\nWithin an internal accelerator/entrepreneurship program or across the UAE, GCC, MENA, or global.\nFunding to Teams: Varies by partner\nImpact Areas: Varies by partner\nGenerally aligned with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) or for other impact purposes. \nOther criteria: To determine with a partner.\nDefinition of success and program results\nBased on the objectives of the accelerator program, program managers and accelerators can get results to measure the program’s success. We list some later in this guide, but discussing them while building and designing your program is also helpful. \nThe accelerator program work plan will set the tone for program results. Each objective set is measurable and timely and allows for a quantifiable measurement of success. \nAdditionally, impact metrics can be measured depending on the program objectives, including but not limited to jobs created, revenues generated, new product launches, and more. \nProgram Communications\nDeveloping a solid brand is critical in attracting enterprises and other stakeholders. Choosing the best enterprises will lead to good results, attract good investors, and reliable applications. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it offers, and to whom is critical. Creating a content strategy should be the first step.\nA content strategy is a plan of action purposely designed to guide content marketing activities and ensure they deliver against a specific objective. It includes content planning, production, publishing, promoting, tracking, and SEO optimization. It also consists of content you produce, such as videos, blog posts, podcasts, and social media posts. \nYou can see a sample content plan here: HerMeNow Communications Plan (draft)\nSample draft posts for this campaign here: ​​ HerMeNow posts \nThe idea is to ensure that each piece of content you produce resonates heavily with your target audience and serves to rally people behind your program’s objectives. \nSome questions to consider at this stage:\nWhich channels or events would be relevant for marketing your particular program?\nWhich networks would be most effective for reaching the type of enterprises you’d like to work with?\nHow could you communicate the criteria for your program?\nTarget Audience\nAccelerator programs must create a compelling offer to attract the most promising entrepreneurs. \nAccelerators can engage with multiple organizations, stakeholders, and channels to source and attract startups. These include\nReferral from entrepreneurs affiliated with the accelerator\nInvestors\nEntrepreneurial associations\nUniversities\nIndustry Association\nSector-specific conferences\nInbound requests from marketing efforts and social media\nOutbound direct recruiting by finding and contacting entrepreneurs on the web.\nThe quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. \nPlanning, roles, and timeline\nWe train others to run high-impact enterprise development support programs that leverage online and in-person engagement. Every program we design has the below-standard program stages.\n\nOnce you agree with the partner on the program parameters, you can start designing the program. \nSee the toolkit at the end of this stage for the program design and planning templates.\nMentor Engagement\nMentorship is a cornerstone of growth in entrepreneurship and leadership, offering invaluable guidance, support, and networking opportunities. We do not pay our mentors to foster a culture of altruism, shared learning, and community engagement, which are critical for building resilient entrepreneurial ecosystems.\nResearch shows that intrinsically motivated mentors provide higher-quality guidance and derive greater satisfaction from mentoring. Effective mentorship builds social capital, creating networks of trust and reciprocity that benefit both mentors and mentees. Non-financial incentives, such as recognition, personal growth, and the opportunity to give back, lead to more committed and impactful mentoring relationships.\nMentors also benefit through reciprocal learning, staying updated with new trends, and gaining fresh perspectives, which enhances their leadership skills. By not monetarily compensating mentors, we emphasize the mutual benefits of mentorship grounded in intrinsic motivation and community spirit.\nA quality mentoring program is crucial for reducing the risk of enterprise failure and is a critical component of successful accelerators. We attract a diverse range of mentors with domain knowledge and entrepreneurial experience, offering two types of mentorship:\nKey Mentors: The principal mentor for a team in our programs. Program managers match you with an enterprise based on your preference and the needs of the business. You will follow the company throughout the program, meeting (online) 1-2 times per month and offering support and guidance when needed.\nTopic Mentors: Topic Mentors support teams in specific areas of expertise (e.g., marketing, HR, etc.).  \nOur mentor selection is based on referrals and direct applications, focusing on extensive entrepreneurial experience rather than academic credentials. We prioritize mentors interested in practical implementation and immediate progress, ensuring that mentoring sessions are action-oriented and impactful.\nTeams and mentors can keep track of their meetings and progress using the “mentor journal” template: Mentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nAny program needs to be monitored and assessed. The quality of mentorship can be evaluated through feedback surveys that the enterprises complete. This information is part of a feedback loop that allows constant improvement in the mentorship process.\nPartner Engagement\nThe partners’ building block consists of the network of suppliers and partners that makes the business model work.\nA successful partnership is most likely to occur when partners lay out clear guidelines at the very start. You are working with each other because partners/NGOs bring something unique and distinctive. So there must be a clear articulation of the end goal regarding the impact and the fundamental guiding principles that will keep the relationship together.\nThese include monitoring mechanisms, reporting requirements, expectations regarding shared resources and engagement levels, mutually agreed-upon communication strategies, an exit plan if things go wrong, etc. \nWe usually have the following partnerships:\nOutreach partners:\nCommunity engagement and outreach\nEngaging your community online and offline (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter networks, along with the newsletters and website) to help us source enterprises for the program.\nKnowledge partners:\nHelp provide mentors, trainers, or experts in relevant sectors or startup/enterprise development areas\nConducting online workshops (ranging from 2 hours to multi-day workshops; preferably recorded sessions), providing mentorship for participating impact startups, helping make relevant connections, etc.\nEcosystem partners:\nSupport for participating projects during the program or downstream\nThey provide additional support, resources, perks, or opportunities to the participating enterprises, whether during or after the program, such as investment/grants, partnerships/contracts, conference/visibility, services, etc. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nTo prepare for launch, program managers need to consider the following:\nTarget audience and stage of enterprises\nDefinition of success and program KPIs\nEssential program communication\nStaffing, roles, and timeline\nMentor engagement\nPartner engagement\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Design Template\nProgram Planning Template v2\nMentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nPartner MOU - All Categories - TEMPLATE\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nSTARTUP ACCELERATOR PROGRAMMES A Practice Guide\nThe Mentor Manifesto: The original “Mentor Manifesto,” created by David Cohen with the help of Jon Bradford and Brad Feld, outlines a set of principles supported by years of accelerator work and thousands of mentor interactions.\nDeconstructing the Mentor Manifesto: Brad Feld goes in depth through each component of the manifesto. \n\nStage 1: Outreach & Open House\nThe program starts with an Open House period. It refers to when a team becomes aware of the existence of an accelerator program. The accelerator’s success in this phase depends on the strength of its brand and how it markets itself. The Open House events are typically virtual and open to the public.\nOur Open Houses are a way to ask questions and get answers. You can join virtually to learn more about learning to grow in our accelerator programs and build connections. As a result, teams leave with a better understanding of our program and if it may be a good fit for them.\nOpen House Events\nDuring these 4-6 weeks, we host online webinars featuring prominent speakers sharing their experiences with aspiring entrepreneurs. It is also a space for applicants to meet and start forming a community. Here are some blog posts recapping previous open-house events.\nThere are four main reasons to run an Open House:  \nAttract, vet, and prepare applicants \nDid we attract the quality and quantity of intended teams? \nIdentify participants that may be appropriate for an online program and this program. \nHelp people become more familiar with the tools and approaches of the program. \nBring visibility to the program and the partner.\nProgram managers can record each open house event and transform it into a blog post to share on social media to attract more applicants.\nRecorded events become part of a shareable library of content accessible to the Bloom community.\nInspire and educate the potential applicants\nThe topics for the open house events are timely and relevant to the current situation to help the applicants learn something new about their trade.\nThe events are an opportunity for the program managers to present the program and for the applicants to ask questions.\nBring visibility to Bloom and engage/strengthen the Bloom community (mentors, broader startups, partners, etc.)  \nEngaging the mentors by asking them to participate as speakers \nEngaging the partners by inviting them and asking them to intervene\nShowcasing startups that have been in the program previously\nApplication Form\nChoosing which enterprises to select is one of the essential factors in the success of any accelerator. While attracting the entrepreneurs to the Open House events, we place them in a marketing funnel to submit to the second stage of the application process. This stage includes demographic information and details about the enterprise.\nDepending on your program, you can select different criteria, such as\nDemographic Data\nGender\nAge\nLocation\nNationality\nInformation about the enterprise/startup: \nWebsite and social media links \nPlease describe your company and the problem you're solving in 280 characters.\n2 min pitch\nFive slide pitch deck\nEnterprise Stage: dropdown\nAreas of development: Enterprise Capacities dropdown\nTraction\nSize of team\nInvestment Raised\nRegistration Status\nIt is essential to keep in mind that the quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the program’s criteria, what it provides, and to whom are critical.\nSummarized list of things to prepare:\nBrevo Registration Form\nAutomated Email on Brevo with link to apply\nProgram on Bloom platform under the correct organization\nApplication Link on the Bloom platform\nAutomated email on Mailgun to confirm receiving their application\nAutomated Reminder Email on Brevo after they start their application to complete it\nStart here category on Bloom community program category with intro video and FAQ\nCreating the application\nStep 1: Create a form on Brevo with: First and Last Name, Email, and Company Name\nStep 2: Create an automated email that gets sent for each form submission with more details about the program and the link to the second stage application form\nCreating the second stage application form \nStep 1: Decide which fields to include in the application form.

In a nutshell, it’s a way for teams to spend a fixed amount of time on core enterprise development using today’s best practices in a coherent, integrated fashion. \nWe also sometimes run longer versions of Sprints that we call Bootcamps, usually between 4-8 weeks long. The key difference lies in the number of sessions:\nA Sprint is two weeks long and include 6 sessions (3 sessions per week) plus a Demo Day\nA Bootcamp can vary between 4 to 8 weeks:\nA 4 week Bootcamp has 3 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo Day\nAn 8 week Bootcamp has 6 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo Day\nIn Bloom’s standard programs, the Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives: \nTo help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise. \nTo help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the Accelerator. \nWe’ve found that we learn more about the people and projects through a short program than through an application process and interviews. So here is how we do it:\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp allows us to assess enterprises’ strengths as we look for entrepreneurs who can overcome the obstacles necessary to build a great business. This phase helps us get to know and understand why teams have an unfair advantage over all the other candidates.\nSelection from Open House to Sprint/Bootcamp/Pre-Accelerator\nFirst, we disqualify candidates who do not check all eligibility criteria. Then, a selection committee will score the selection against the following scoring matrix.\n\nEligibility\nAssessing whether the application fits the program's eligibility criteria.\nYES / NO \nTeam \nAssessing the team’s background, capabilities to execute, and ability to gain and contribute to the program. \n/ 10\nImpact & Inclusion\nDoes the enterprise have a social impact? Can it create jobs? Does it have a positive impact on marginalized and vulnerable communities?\n/ 10\nValue Proposition\nIs the team tackling a real problem and offering a valuable solution? Does it have the ability to grow and be sustainable? Is the market potential attractive?\n/ 10\nMilestones & Traction\nCan the idea generate revenues? Have they achieved significant milestones? Has the team demonstrated it can compete?\n/ 5\nStrategy & Challenges\nDo they have a clear growth strategy? Is the program able to support the team in its current challenges?\n/ 5\nOverall Passion\nBased on the team's strength,  the project, and the potential impact it can create: how passionate are you about this application?\n/ 10\n\nSprint/Bootcamp Session Objectives\nOutlined below are some of the frameworks and tools we use during the Sprint session to help the enterprises progress on their goals and improve at least one aspect of their enterprise during the Sprint/Bootcamp sessions. \nDiscovering your Why: How do you talk about what you do?\nThe Golden Circle is a concept developed by Simon Sinek, who says, “people don’t buy what you do. They buy why you do it.”\nAccording to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the “what” they do and eventually work their way back to talk about “how” and “why” they do what they do.\nBut companies universally identified as unique and successful think Apple or Google communicate with an “inside-out” type of thinking. \nThey start with the why, and only then do they talk about the how and what portions of what they do.\nTo use the Golden Circle for your enterprise, just help them answer three simple questions:\nWhy – Why are you doing what you are doing? For example, why are you in business, and why did you develop your product or service?\nHow – How will this help your readers? For example, what problems are you solving for your readers, and what challenges are you helping them overcome?\nWhat – What are you offering? For example, what is your product or service, and what are its features and benefits?\nAssessing: What are your priorities for the upcoming period?\nProgram managers invite the teams to take the assessments to reflect on their individual and organizational development. After reflecting on their results in their teams, program managers invite them to discuss them with their peers and mentors and start thinking about their core priority areas of development.\nGoal setting: What are your objectives for the duration of the accelerator?\nWe provide the enterprises with a framework to specify their objectives for the upcoming period they spend with us during the accelerator, usually three to four months. The enterprises must accompany these objectives with measurable key results assigned to specific team members for accountability. The enterprise can further break down objectives into particular initiatives and key activities. We recommend that enterprises work on at least one objective and up to three objectives for the duration of the accelerator. Each objective must relate to a particular organizational development topic they identified while reflecting on their priorities. \nWe invite teams to develop an Organization Development Plan stating their main objective related to their core area of organizational development. We also consider their signature character strength and overall well-being for the program duration. Teams will also develop this Organization Development Plan with a budget to help the Bloom team assess the needs accordingly.\nBudgeting: How will you use the funds allocated for the accelerator?\nWe provide enterprises with a budgeting tool to help them think about allocating their funds to the accelerator program. It allows them to think strategically about their objectives and goals, given their plans earlier during the week around the objectives and key results they aim to achieve. Funds are allocated to specific categories to help us align the overall budgets and work on economies of scale. \nPitching: How will you combine this using the Pitch Deck template?\nA pitch deck is usually a 5-10 slide presentation designed to summarize the company, the business plan, and the vision. The pitch presentation deck also serves different purposes, from meeting with a new investor to presenting in front of a stage. Each of them should follow a different structure. A demo day presentation, for example, should be very visual and contain very little text, as the entrepreneur will do all the talking. \nWe provide enterprises with a 5-10 slide deck template to adapt their branding and content accordingly. \nSelection from Sprint/Bootcamp to Accelerator\nThe program aims to help participants transform personally, professionally, and professionally. \nTo be fair, we have a 2-step process: \nStep 1: Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges \nFor the Sprint/Bootcamp phase, judges decide whether a team advances based on the team’s pitches during the online Demo Day. \nWe enlist the services of expert volunteer “Judges” who are independent and objective, with no conflicts of interest. \nThese judges review team pitches and determine each team’s potential for long-term success based on the judge’s experience and the quality of the team’s pitch during the demo day.\nJudging will take place during the online Demo Day on Zoom. \nProgram managers will share the link to submit scores with all judges before the Demo Day event. \nIf too many teams are at the end of the Sprint/Bootcamp (15 or more), it might be difficult to pitch in one group. In this case, we could split the pitch day into multiple simultaneous sessions, with up to 10 teams in a breakout session and a separate judging panel per breakout room. Representatives from each breakout session judging panel will be part of the Accelerator Selection Panel. \nWe also invite the teams to share feedback on all the pitches, though we calculate the scoring separately. \nStep 2: Accelerator Selection Panel \nPrimarily a subset of the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges' feedback will be summarized, along with the Sprint/Bootcamp Scoring Template, and shared with the Accelerator Selection Panel, which will do a final review and selection in the days following the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day. \nAccelerator Selection Criteria\nWe measure the principles for selection with the following assessments:\nEvaluation Area\nDescription\nWeight\nEffort\nThe teams have a significant say in advancing to the next stage based on their effort during the Sprint/Bootcamp. We measure the effort according to attendance, feedback participation, and deliverables. \n1/4\nSupport\nThe teams are also scored based on how supportive they are to the other teams in the Sprint/Bootcamp. \n1/4\nCoachability\nThe team is receptive to receiving constructive criticism and will use that feedback and constructive criticism to improve their professional and organizational performance.\n1/4\nDemo Day Score\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp ends with a Demo Day where the enterprises pitch online, and judging will occur between presentations. The Judging panel will include mentors and trainers from the program and independent experts from the ecosystem. \n1/4\n\n\nThe Judges’ scores (Demo Day Score) and the Bloom team scores (Effort, Support, and Coachability) are shared with a selection panel composed of Bloom and External Experts for deliberations and donor representatives. The panel will make the final selection for acceptance in addition to the validation of support required per team. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives: \nFirst, to help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise. \nTo help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the Accelerator. \nThe following frameworks guide the participants during the Sprint/Bootcamp phase:\nThe elevator pitch using the golden circle framework\nPersonal, professional, and organizational assessments\nGoal Setting\nBudgeting\nPreparing for the demo day\nThe selection process includes:\nSelecting for the Sprint/Bootcamp based on eligibility and scoring for success using metrics defined by program objectives\nSelecting for the accelerator, based on the demo day scoring and scores for effort, community, and results\nTOOLKIT: (diagnostic assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nThe Golden Circle Presentation\nECAT – Bloom\nProgram Planning Template v2\nSprint Detailed Schedule Template\nSample Program Comms\nProgram Dashboard for [Team Name] Template - Enterprise Capacities v1.1\nSprint Pitch Deck Template\nSprint Scoring Template―\nStage 3: Onboarding and Curriculum Design\nOnboarding to the Accelerator\nAfter announcing the teams that will proceed to the accelerator stage, the program manager spends time with each selected team to\nRefine their dashboards and align their objectives and initiatives with the Enterprise Capacities categories, keeping in mind the below recommendations:\nThe enterprise's objectives should align with its overall objective for the program.\nThe objectives are achievable within the timeframe of the program.\nEach objective has a key result that should be measurable with a starting value and a target value that measures progress toward an objective.\nEach initiative aligns with the set category and topics.\nThe “enterprise development topics” for initiatives are valid and aligned with the “enterprise development category” for the related objective.\nThe enterprise might be unsure how to match its objectives with the “enterprise development category.” The program manager can help them refine their dashboard during these one-on-ones\nHelp the teams add their priorities on the platform\nOnce the dashboards are clear for the team and the program manager, the team will log on to the platform and start adding their priorities:\nThe team navigates to the Growth page.\nThe team selects their priority area per their dashboard (the “Enterprise Development Category” for their first objective).\nIn the “add goal details” text box, the team adds their objective, key results, and initiatives\nExplain the individual assessments to the teams, help them identify their signature character strength, and select their priority areas for skills \nThe program manager will explain the individual assessments:\nThe teams can take the Character Strength Assessment on the Bloom Platform and identify their “Signature Strength.” It is a strength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when used rather than taking effort. Using our Signature Strengths can help us bring energy and promote well-being at work. Once they do that, they should add their Signature Strength on their dashboard so we can support them in leveraging it during the program.\nTeams can take the Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills assessment on the Bloom platform to identify areas of improvement. In discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers, they can identify & improve individual growth priorities and select activities for development from online resources or the Bloom Library of Activities. \nCustomizing the Curriculum\nWe strive to adapt the curriculum to each new cohort of enterprises that best caters to their needs. We base this customization on inputs from the Growth Page on the platform:\nOnce we complete the onboarding process, we have a clear view of all the teams’ priorities and objectives for the duration of the program, allowing us to customize the curriculum accordingly.\nThe Assessment results of each enterprise: We look at priorities selected during the onboarding and the score trends in each category.\nThe Team's Organization Development Plans: We look at the specific objective and initiatives to understand what they aim to achieve.\nAt this stage, the program manager and the training manager can design the cohort-based training activities that the teams will do during the program and prepare for the first session of the accelerator program. \nWhile we aim to find commonalities between all the teams, it is never possible to cater to everyone’s needs. Once we set the common needs, we reach out to the teams with individual needs to help them identify training activities they can do at their own pace and get feedback from mentors and trainers individually.\nLearning by Doing\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than “doing” and “testing” to understand the product, customers, and business model. At Bloom, we know how much theory we introduce to entrepreneurs versus how much time we give them to achieve results. Teaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to understand the context — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework or a tool that entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals. These tools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our program, we make an effort to revisit them during the program over and over again, in the best spirit of lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are helping the startups drive progress and results.\nModular Learning\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate entrepreneurs learning by themselves. It is a form of distance learning that uses Self-Learning Modules based on the essential learning competencies developed by the trainers with the aid of the program and training manager.\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show them what they need to know. But GALI found that “the more remote work we allow, the better.” For example, indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and exploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while working on their business plans and product. \nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that serve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. It is better to use the time to build relationships and get feedback. Online education with e-learning modules allows founders to spend more time building networks and products.\nOnce the teams complete the training activity, we invite them to share their work in the community to get feedback from their peers and program managers. They will then join an online training session to get further feedback from their peers and expert trainers. \n\nKEY POINTS: \nCurriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities results, Organization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one interviews to identify the most present needs\nContent is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can learn at their own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates, and tools, and get feedback in sessions with the trainers.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nProgram Planning Template v2\nBloom Digital Library\n\nStage 4: Accelerator \nBloom Accelerator Programs Principles\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging, applying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that combines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their daily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board. \nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group rather than the negative ones. This approach builds on the entrepreneurs’ strengths, specifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions. Strengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent qualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of them or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired outcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort towards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement because they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when individuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud, and more engaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of resilience in achieving their goals. \nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to identify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of activities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise Capacity Assessment to measure the organizational capacity of enterprises. It allows us to have the whole picture of the strengths of both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing abilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. As a result, they tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). It is because they worry less about looking bright and put more energy into learning. \nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle. This system encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals into small, discrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each other and start building momentum, leading to more prominent and significant moves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day before. Start small and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to get impatient and start rushing forward and taking more significant leaps. Take it slow, steady, and consistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on getting 1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not seem like much, but those 1% improvements compound each other. \nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly power moves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort zone and push us forward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make many more steps. Power Moves take you right out of your regularly scheduled program. They are the key to real change. They’re the most critical task that will take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling something big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more approachable and doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks because we simply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can produce a reliable estimate. Each key objective should have a clearly defined task or set of tasks. Tasks should be between 8 and 80 person-hours of labor. It is a manageable amount.\nBloom Tools: We ask our teams to prepare an Organization Development Plan that includes at least one and up to three critical objectives tied into key results and broken down into significant activities or tasks. It allows us to understand what the enterprise intends to accomplish during the accelerator period. Additionally, we encourage enterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to record their daily tasks and keep track of their progress to accomplish what they’ve planned within their set deadlines. \nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense of belonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual growth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can make us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are invaluable in joining forces with our peers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with:\nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members. Supportive of others will help them feel good and better about themselves. \nThe mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable relationships and gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps us to reach our goals and brings a sense of security.\nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique resource, and through its use, it increases in value. \nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning and feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors, and then the module leaders give feedback. \nThe general architecture of a cycle\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies used at leading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator programs to help teams develop their startup while learning leading productivity techniques.\nCycle repetitions can include some of the below elements:\nActivities and Reflections\nWeekly activities: Every other Tuesday, the program manager invites the teams to start new training activities and share their progress in the community\nEnd-of-month reflections: At the end of each month, we send the teams a reflection and feedback form to understand and gauge their progress on several KPIs related to the program’s focus. \nLive online events\nTraining sessions: Each cycle will have 2-4 training activities whereby teams will receive resources, including videos, tools, frameworks, and worksheets, to prepare them for the training sessions, where the module leader will facilitate an interactive exchange of knowledge and expertise.\nMentor support: We invite mentors to join a speed mentoring session to facilitate mentor matching. Once we match them, we invite the teams and mentors to set their meeting frequency throughout the accelerator, where they follow up on the enterprise’s progress, approve their budget, help them with their hiring needs, and others as needed.\nTypical Schedule of an Acceleration Program\nCurriculum co-creation and onboarding (1 week, two sessions).\nSession 1: Based on the onboarding sessions, we identify the cohort-based training activities of the accelerator program and present them with the modules they commit to achieving. We will put them in the driver's seat from day one, allowing us to identify standard modules & group them into sessions tackling the same topics in cohort-based activities and individual modules they are interested in tackling separately according to their enterprise needs. We also introduce them to the grant disbursement process and deep dive into best practices to plan their financial journey and ensure they are not delayed.\nSession 2: We invite the teams and mentors to join for a mentor matching session where each team meets at least three mentors. Based on their feedback forms filled at the end of the session, we will facilitate the matching for the duration of the accelerator.\nWeekly training and support (12-16 weeks, 12-16 group training sessions, and two to four individual mentorship sessions per team).\nBased on our program feedback in the last two years, we have adjusted the weekly support to cater to our teams' needs and rhythms. We build a panel of 4-5 trainers who can give general feedback on several modules in our new approach. A trainer joins in every weekly session with up to five teams at once to have enough time for deep discussions. \nDuring the weekly sessions, the teams can share what they’ve learned during the module and discuss their work related to their projects. They will receive feedback from their peers, trainers, and program managers to improve further (inverted feedback pyramid). \nIn addition, teams can book up to 4 follow-up one-on-one meetings with the trainers, mentors, and coaches to deepen the hands-on feedback further, mentoring and coaching experience at the individual and team levels. \nBased on the teams' assessment results, the curriculum will be co-created during the onboarding. After the co-creation sessions, we will select trainers, mentors, and business coaches from our Mentors and Trainers databases.\nDepending on each team’s core priorities, the curriculum might include topics that tackle questions such as \nBranding\nDo we build our brand effectively?\nProblem Solving\nHow strong is our mission?\nHave we identified what value we deliver to our customers with well-defined and aligned products and services?\nSolution Definition\nHave we identified relevant social responsibility factors for our business and industry, and are the social responsibility principles integrated into the overall corporate strategy?\nTarget Market\nHave we clearly defined who we are creating value for and who our most important customers are? \nDo we have clear strategies and channels to reach our customers? \nBasic Revenue Model\nDo we have solid financial plans and clear financial performance indicators?\nAre our revenue streams clearly defined, and how effective is our revenue generation model?\nMilestones and Next Steps\nDo we regularly read and stay on top of global business and industry trends?\nDo we have a coherent organizational strategy, including mission, vision, values, and operational plan?\nTeam\nDo we have diverse and highly skilled staff?\nAre our people (the organization's leadership and staff) satisfied and motivated in their work?\nDo we have a learning culture?\nDo we have the right people and resources (e.g., tools, budget) to provide our products/services?\nWhile some of those topics might already exist in the Bloom Digital Library, we could also commission trainers to develop additional training content if we find a gap that needs to be filled. \nWe send thank you emails to trainers after they complete the cycle to share gratitude.\nAsync accountability on the Bloom platform\nTeams can schedule mentors' sessions at their convenience, tracked on the community of the Bloom platform by posting a reflection on their notes from their mentorship journals. Teams also submit assignments to the community to hold each other responsible and accountable for the module they chose to take at the beginning of the program. Finally, the program manager will encourage the teams to review their peers’ work and give constructive and generous feedback. Indeed by looking at the same challenge from a different perspective, they are encouraged to unlearn and relearn.\nGrant Disbursement Process\nThe Grant Disbursement process will vary slightly depending on the enterprise stage and the grant amount.\nFor earlier-stage enterprises (not registered), the agreement and invoice are with individuals rather than enterprises. \nWe can apply the same basic steps to all programs:\nEnterprises sign the Agreement: \nProgram managers adapt the program agreement template and invite the teams to make a copy.\nTeams complete and sign the agreement by adding a digital signature as an image in the document.\nEnterprises refine the budget:\nThe objectives and key initiatives in the work plan should be related to the budget developed for the grant.\n70-80% of the budget is for capacity building instead of running costs.\nEnterprises get the budget approved:\nEnterprises work on improving it with their mentor and program manager. \nOnce ready and approved, the Mentor + Program manager adds their initials and the date approved on the budget.\nEnterprises get the budget signed:\nThe enterprises sign the budget in the designated cell by uploading a digital signature as an image in the cell.\nThe Program Manager, Finance Officer, and Program Lead sign the budget. \nThe enterprises send us an invoice for the amount (from the Enterprise to AltCity Impact)\nSpecific account information to include in the invoice varies:\nFor programs disbursing from the Lebanon bank account, we include the below:\nAltCity Impact / Bloom\nBeirut, Lebanon\nMOF: 3241751 (Ministry of Finance number)\nEmail: accts@bloom.pm\nDescription: Grant disbursement / Project reference: [Name of the program]\nFor programs disbursing from the UK bank account, we include the below:\nCOMPANY NUMBER: OC442441\nINCORPORATED: 25 May 2022\nREGISTERED OFFICE ADDRESS:\n71-75 Shelton Street\nCovent Garden\nLondon\nWC2H 9JQ\nUNITED KINGDOM\nWe disburse the grant in one tranche for smaller grants (2,000 USD or less).\nTo ensure proper procurement and financial management, we disbursed in 2-3 tranches for larger amounts. \nFor enterprises not yet registered, we will release the second tranche of the grant based on the progress achieved on the objectives set in the organizational development plan.\nFor registered enterprises, after receiving the first tranche, the enterprise sends all the proof of payments (invoices/bills/photos) and an updated variance report that needs to align with the Approved Budget with the next invoice for the next tranche.\nProcurement Process for Registered Enterprises\nThis process applies to registered enterprises receiving grants larger than 2,000 USD.\nPlease watch this video for detailed information: Procurement Process\nQuotations:\n$500 -

Make sure to inform the teams before the session on their pitch duration so that they practice accordingly. The goal is to prevent the moderator from cutting them off publicly, but it is also essential to be strict about keeping to the time limit (possibly with a 10-15 second buffer, max). \nThe presentation order, tables, and list order on any forms should all be numbered and aligned precisely the same way. \nHave the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and “presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the audience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that additional information added. \nHave different staff/team members moderating, time-keeping, making slides/music, etc. Split up roles so nobody is multitasking too much. \nIf technical limitations make it challenging to give the presenters the ability to control the shared screen, have all the teams presenting snap their fingers, so they don’t have to keep saying “next” out loud. \nThe person presenting should turn their video off if the sound is glitchy. Most importantly, their voice and the slides, though seeing them speaking would also be lovely if possible. \nEveryone turns on their microphones at the end to clap for all the teams. :-) Maybe we even do that during the opening “tadaa” to hear everyone’s voice. It is nice to do at the closing of the event as well. \nEncourage teams to present standing up, not sitting down, so they need to set up their laptop (and headphones) in a way that would allow that and not have that be at an awkward angle. \nEncourage all teams to use headphones for better sound quality. \nEncourage all teams to do some warm-up exercises before the presentation. For example, super-hero pose, jumping jacks, stretching, running in place, dance, “coffee breathing,” etc. \nMake things easy for people to switch between Zoom and Remo; create onboarding videos to share with all attendees ahead of time, and encourage them to join Remo / and sign me. \nEncourage teams a week in advance to start inviting their family/friends/future investors.\nAll teams put their username/screen name as “Team Name - Full Name.” \nUse zoom dual monitors > Show participants screen \nEncourage teams to practice, practice, practice! \nHype up the teams! :-) \nSlide Preparation for an Online Demo Day \nHaving a smooth flow between presentations is vital. Having all presentations in one Google Slides presentation can improve the flow substantially. \nIf possible, test ahead of time. You can give participants the ability to control the person sharing the screen. It will allow each speaker to control the slides themselves. However, it often doesn’t work as smoothly in practice because of technical issues, internet delays, or little comfort with the online tools. \nAdvanced Google Docs users can have the teams use separate presentations linked to one master presentation. For example, when copy-pasting from a team presentation into the main presentation, choose “linked slides.” This way, when the teams update their presentations (just those slides), the master presentation is automatically linked.\nTip: Once a presentation is in “present mode,” new changes will not show. It may be best to have an organizer “own” the team’s presentations to remove the team’s ability to edit by a particular deadline. \nHave the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and “presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the audience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that additional information added. \nMake sure all teams send in a recorded pitch video before the session, just in case a team was unable to attend the demo day for any reason (medical, emergency..) or even for reasons such as having terrible internet connection and being unable to connect and join the demo day. Share the folder of “recorded pitch videos” with all the programs team and facilitators.\n\nKEY POINTS: \nOnline demo days can be as effective as in-person. There are different ways to facilitate the event online, and plenty of tools are available to help you make the most of it. \nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nN/A\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nPlanning a Virtual Demo Day: a Careful Balance of Two Worlds\nHow to run a successful inclusive online event - our Demo Day lessons\n\nStage 6: Program Closing, Continual Assessment, and Improvement\nAt the end of the program, we design certificates of completion to the teams and mentors to express our gratitude and appreciation for their support. \nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact. As yet, an agreed framework for measuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard metrics collected and published so far include the following:\nNumber of applications to programs\nNumber of enterprises supported\nFollow-on investment raised by enterprises\nThe survival rate of enterprises\nNumber of employees of enterprises\nNPS of the program\nWe believe that we should pay more attention to defining performance and metrics for success. Unfortunately, as startups, accelerators often lack the time and resources for such measurements, so the impact of accelerator methods is difficult to judge with limited data available. \nHere are some metrics we recommend you track:\nMonthly: For each program, data is collected monthly depending on the KPIs the program manager sets. This could include items such as\nPre and post-assessment results\nOrganization Development Plan progress and status update for each activity\nRevenues\nExpenses\nTraction (most relevant metric per enterprise)\nFeedback on this month’s accelerator activities\nEngagement\nLearning \nInspiration\nComplexity\nRelevance\nPost-Program: Program managers should collect the following data quarterly post-accelerator.\nKPIs\nFinance\nRevenue\nExpenses\nBurn rate & runway.\nCash in the bank\nEBITDA\nTraction\nChurn rate: %, an improvement of % vs. last month.\nCustomer acquisition: $\nCustomer Lifetime Value: $\nOrders per Customer: #\nTime on site before ordering\nTotal user accounts #\nActive users: #\nPaying users: #\nProduct Updates\nchanges in the product strategy, including new versions, UX/UI, new features, platform, etc. \nBusiness Updates\nWhat is relevant about people, office, partners, operations, etc.\nNew hires/fires.\nMarketing strategy.\nNew partnerships.\nInternational expansion plans.\nOperations changes.\nPress updates.\n Funding or Mergers and Acquisitions\nNotable Events\n\nKEY POINTS: \nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact. As yet, an agreed framework for measuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard metrics collected and published are included in this section.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nN/A\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nChoosing and Reporting Accelerator Metrics KPIs – Metabeta\n\nStage 7: Program Epilogue: Post-Program Support\nIt is easy to see the duration of the program as a set timeframe for which the demo day marks the end. But this isn’t the way that accelerators perceive it. On graduating from an accelerator program, companies are still extremely young, and potentially not yet viable for investment. Everything an accelerator program does is geared toward giving its cohorts the best possible chance of survival after graduation. So it makes sense that most offer post-program support to maintain or enhance startups’ investment viability for as long as possible. \nIt can typically include the following:\nPublic relations opportunities\nConnections with investors\nBoard participation\nHR/recruitment support\nLocal meet-ups\nOnline communities with funding and promotion opportunities\nOffice space\nAlumni Network\nAll accelerators acknowledge their alumni network as a valuable asset of the program: maintaining an alumni database is, therefore, a priority. Some host online communities and alumni events to create and develop the alumni network. Others call on the help of alumni when selecting a new cohort of potential startups. There is also the phenomenon of recycling founders, where startups take in unsuccessful alumni as members of their team if they consider them valuable.\nFollow-on Investment\nAccelerated startups still struggle with gaps between seed funding and successfully raising Series A investment. To help combat this, some accelerators offer to follow–on investment once the program is finished; they can sometimes go some way towards bridging funding gaps. This could be by providing staged investments or an additional capital infusion after graduation.\nMentorship, Perks, and Opportunities\nOnce enterprises are part of an accelerator. They will be part of the community for life. They can expand their business and network with access to a talented group of founders, investors, mentors, and industry leaders. Additionally, the accelerator will typically have onboarded perks partners, providing the enterprises with discounts and access to helpful resources. Finally, keeping in touch with the accelerator community can be beneficial as program managers often share resources, opportunities, and other relevant information.\n\nAppendix\nRunning Hybrid Programs\nWe can think of the acceleration programs in two models: \nThose that run face-to-face, which allow entrepreneurs to meet in a physical space at the same time, and \nThose that are carried out regardless of physical barriers, the time zone, the thousands of kilometers of distance between people, or even complex situations (such as those we have been experiencing in the last years).\nVirtual accelerator programs are growing in popularity and have several advantages for founders and program teams. Virtual programs can also be delivered in a hybrid format, blending both online & offline elements. Virtual and Hybrid Accelerator programs allow\nImproved Flexibility\nOne of the main benefits of hybrid programs is improved flexibility, which is becoming extremely important within the sector. Generally speaking, entrepreneurs want as many options as possible, and the ability to move from in-person to remote can be invaluable. Access to recorded sessions offers a second chance at missed sessions, memory refreshers, and a deeper reflection of session discussions.\nWork with a more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas.\nThe most exciting aspect of hybrid programs for many entrepreneurs is their potential to open up access to learning. On a basic level, when in-person is the only option available, all entrepreneurs need to be within traveling distance of the accelerator throughout the entire duration of their course. However, It is not necessarily the case with hybrid programs, which can mean more people can participate. This will expose the teams to meet people coming from diverse cultural backgrounds. In turn, this will lead to an increased cultural quotient and enhanced collective intelligence exercises. \nSupport your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nOne problem we’ve run into in the past is the limited pool of mentors available for any given in-person workshop. Virtual programming has freed us up to engage world-class mentors from anywhere, including mentors that bring enormous technical, business, and market knowledge and speak the language of the startups in our cohort – culturally and literally.\nLeveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\nE-Learning is no longer a simple byproduct of the information age and Internet access. It’s become an invaluable resource to educators, harnessing a new knowledge-sharing model wherein learners now possess the tools to learn at their own pace. Some online tools allow for quickly creating tests/quizzes, templates, and other resources. Practical benefits include tracking digital assignments’ submissions and reusing or reconstructing a course curriculum using new course templates.\nKEY POINTS: \nHybrid programs allow program managers to work with:\nImproved Flexibility\nA more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas\nSupporting your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nLeveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\n\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates) \nBloom Digital Library\nLEARN MORE: (external resources) \nWhat Have We Learned Running Our Acceleration Program Fully Online in the Past 5 Years?\n\nFacilitation for Amazing Online and Offline Experiences\nPeople learn through doing, practicing, and sharing. People also know best when they’re having fun! When they’re engaged and happy. \nCritical Aspects of Facilitation \nThe same care for organizing an offline event should go into managing an online event, whether as small as a meeting with a few people or as big as a major conference or demo day. \nThe medium is the message. A well-planned and well-facilitated event can have more engagement and impact than a poorly planned or facilitated event. \nCreate Bridges Between the Physical and the Virtual\nPlay games and pass items back and forth between screens \nShare tea, coffee, or a meal while on a call \nMake a gift box of friendly perks/treats/tools to help them in the accelerator, and things to do fun games/activities with: \nInspirational items (posters, notebooks, magnets, etc.)  \nShirts, hats, or something to wear \nClown noses or fun items (in wrapping that disguises what they are until use) \nTools for activities, such as printouts of frameworks, post-its, pens, activity cards, etc.\nStretching exercises, especially after having been at the laptop for more than half an hour.\nSharing music: In each session, let a participant choose the session’s background music\nWhiteboard: share the whiteboard before the session begins and ask each participant to share a motivational quote/message.\nSimple Tips for Increasing Engagement Online \nEye contact: Look at the camera (not the screen) when talking, especially when recording something \nThe background: Something nice? Art? Outdoors? Inspiring? A banner with logos? \nSound: Use a better mic if possible, definitely headphones. Make sure nothing is rubbing against the microphone or mic cable while talking. \nAppearance: Try to be as “close to in-person” as possible … What are you wearing? Try not to wear big headphones. \nStand up when talking (it changes body language and energy).\nMute yourself whenever you’re not speaking to avoid interrupting the speaker\nMake sure your Zoom name is adjusted and has your team/organization/role in it as well\n]]]",

      "content": "Here are some key insights from your **Program Management Guide** that can nuance and improve your ideas around program design, assessment, and participant experience:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Framing Entrepreneurship and Assessment as Transformative**\n- **Transformation > Information:** Prioritize transformative learning experiences over simply sharing knowledge. Assessments should not only measure progress but also guide action. For instance:\n  - Use assessments to highlight actionable opportunities for participants (e.g., ECAT insights leading to specific activities).\n  - Frame assessments as tools for reflection and transformation, not judgment.\n  \n- **Strengths-Oriented Approach:** Focus on what’s working and amplify it. Incorporate this principle into how you guide participants through assessments by emphasizing their *progress and potential* rather than gaps alone.\n\n- **Community as a Driver:** The guide emphasizes creating enabling environments for participants to thrive together. Build assessments and interventions that encourage peer learning, collaboration, and collective growth. For example, weekly PERMA sessions or ECAT reflections could include peer-feedback opportunities.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Designing Assessment for Growth and Engagement**\n- **Praxis Approach (Learning by Doing):** Integrate assessments into program activities to ensure they feel less like a \"chore.\" For example:\n  - Use assessments as starting points for action-based activities (e.g., ECAT reveals a gap in leadership → activity on leading team brainstorms).\n  - Create *real-time feedback loops* (like PERMA check-ins or micro-assessments) to replace static pre/post assessments.\n\n- **Modular Assessments:** Shorter, focused assessments allow participants to engage with them dynamically. For example:\n  - Weekly 5-minute reflections on agency, well-being, or personal insights instead of a single long-form assessment.\n  - Use the \"garden\" analogy to help participants pick one or two key areas to cultivate over time.\n\n- **Minimum Viable Framework:** Your idea of \"measuring upstream and monitoring specific aspects\" aligns with the guide's approach to diagnostic tools. Focus on key dimensions (e.g., agency, well-being, and capacity-building), then adapt activities and coaching around those.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Building Engagement Through Agency**\n- **Keep Participants in the Driver’s Seat:** Design assessments and frameworks to feel participant-led:\n  - Allow participants to co-create their learning journey by prioritizing areas of focus based on ECAT or PERMA results.\n  - Empower participants to add their nuances to the assessments (e.g., expanding ECAT to reflect personal goals and progress).\n\n- **Actionable Insights:** Ensure assessments directly tie to actionable next steps. For example:\n  - After taking PERMA, participants could choose a single dimension to improve and receive tailored activities or mentoring related to that area.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Shifting from Pre/Post to Continuous Progress**\n- **Mirror Analogy for Growth:** Position assessments as reflective tools that illuminate growth. This could involve:\n  - Capturing \"aha moments,\" mindset shifts, or examples of resilience and agency.\n  - Moving from static pre/post to a dynamic, progression-based model (e.g., ongoing logs of ECAT-related actions and outcomes).\n\n- **Measure Change, Not Arrival:** Align assessments to track *insights* and *progression.* For example:\n  - Use prompts like: \"How have you reframed your understanding of leadership this week?\" instead of asking for definitive measures of success.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Connecting Assessment with Mentorship and Coaching**\n- **Mentor Engagement:** Leverage mentors as co-facilitators in the assessment process:\n  - Encourage mentors to use assessment results to guide conversations.\n  - Align mentoring sessions with participants’ key growth areas (identified through ECAT, PERMA, or EntreComp).\n\n- **Coaching Goals:** Tie EntreComp and PERMA results to coaching outcomes:\n  - Define specific coaching objectives for each participant, aligned with their assessment insights and business goals.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Streamlining and Aligning with Ecosystem**\n- **Align with Partners and Ecosystem:** To enhance relevance, consider:\n  - Standardizing ECAT and PERMA frameworks so they can integrate with other organizations’ tools.\n  - Building partnerships to validate and promote the framework for broader adoption.\n\n- **Diagnostic to Coaching Pipeline:** Use the guide’s recommendation of connecting diagnostic assessments (like ECAT) with action-oriented development plans. Ensure that assessments:\n  - Drive programmatic decision-making.\n  - Provide actionable pathways for participants.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Leveraging the \"Garden\" Analogy**\nThe \"garden\" analogy aligns perfectly with Bloom’s principle of creating enabling environments. You can use this as a central metaphor to:\n- Help participants visualize growth as a dynamic, ongoing process.\n- Frame assessments and activities as \"tools for cultivation\" (e.g., ECAT = soil quality, PERMA = water/sunlight, EntreComp = garden structure).\n- Encourage personalized growth paths, where participants choose the areas they want to \"nurture.\"\n\n---\n\n### **8. Building Flexible, Modular Learning Journeys**\n- **Customization Based on Results:** As the guide suggests, tailor the program based on diagnostic insights. For example:\n  - Use onboarding sessions to co-create a curriculum that reflects participants’ ECAT and PERMA results.\n  - Offer flexibility for participants to explore their individual paths while staying connected to cohort-based learning.\n\n- **Integration of Universal Skills and PERMA:** Map Universal Skills to PERMA dimensions (e.g., teamwork = relationships, self-management = health). Use this integration to simplify assessments and guide activities.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Building a Sustainable Post-Program Framework**\n- **Continual Assessment and Improvement:** As the guide highlights, create opportunities for participants to:\n  - Reflect on their growth beyond the program.\n  - Engage in follow-up activities or alumni networks to sustain their learning and well-being.\n\n- **Focus on Flourishing Post-Program:** Align program impact metrics (e.g., well-being, self-efficacy, and agency) with follow-on support, ensuring growth continues beyond the accelerator.\n\n---\n\n### Actionable Next Steps:\n1. **Design Modular, Progression-Focused Assessments:**\n   - Replace static pre/post with bite-sized, ongoing reflections tied to PERMA and ECAT insights.\n   - Capture progression in nuanced areas like agency, mindset shifts, and self-awareness.\n\n2. **Use the Garden Analogy:**\n   - Develop visual or narrative tools to help participants see their growth as a \"garden\" they cultivate over time.\n\n3. **Streamline Assessments to Key Goals:**\n   - Focus on a few high-level measures (e.g., flourishing, agency, and self-efficacy), while using ECAT and PERMA as guiding tools.\n\n4. **Tie Assessments to Mentorship and Coaching:**\n   - Use assessment results to drive meaningful mentorship conversations and actionable coaching goals.\n\n5. **Align with Ecosystem Standards:**\n   - Explore partnerships to validate and scale your frameworks, making them more impactful for participants and the broader ecosystem.\n\nWould you like to explore specific implementation steps for any of these insights?",

To further enhance the effectiveness of our assessments and their alignment with program objectives, we are introducing a new assessment method that addresses past challenges and reflects these guiding principles.\\n\\n#### Core Principles:\\n1. **Transformation Over Information**: Assessments are tools for action and reflection, not just data collection. We emphasize transformative learning experiences that help participants apply insights to their businesses and personal growth.\\n2. **Growth is a Journey**: Progress is not about reaching a final destination but about continuous improvement. Our new method focuses on tracking insights, moments of awareness, and nuanced growth rather than binary pre/post results.\\n3. **Participant Agency**: Participants are in the driver\\u2019s seat. Assessments empower them to co-create their learning journeys, prioritize areas for development, and take actionable steps toward their goals.\\n4. **Praxis and Reflection**: Assessments are integrated into program activities, encouraging participants to engage with them dynamically as part of their learning and doing process.\\n5. **Community and Collaboration**: Growth is enhanced in a collaborative environment. Our assessment approach fosters peer feedback, collective learning, and a shared sense of progress.\\n6. **Actionable Insights**: Every assessment result connects to clear next steps, ensuring participants can immediately translate insights into actions for their enterprises and personal growth.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Description of the New Assessment Method\\n\\n#### **Overview**:\\nThe new assessment method shifts from a traditional static pre-post approach to a dynamic, progression-based model. This change addresses challenges like the Dunning-Kruger effect, where participants initially overestimate their competencies and then revise their self-assessments as they learn. Instead of focusing on a binary before-and-after snapshot, the new method emphasizes continuous reflection, actionable insights, and the celebration of small wins along the journey.\\n\\n#### **Key Features**:\\n\\n1. **Progression-Based Insights**:\\n   - Participants begin with a baseline assessment to identify strengths, gaps, and priorities (e.g., ECAT and PERMA dimensions).\\n   - Throughout the program, they reflect on their progress in real-time, capturing \\\"aha moments,\\\" mindset shifts, and nuanced growth.\\n   - Regular micro-assessments track changes in understanding and application, rather than just outcomes.\\n\\n2. **Integration into Program Activities**:\\n   - Assessments are embedded into weekly or bi-weekly activities, such as reflection sessions, mentor meetings, and peer discussions.\\n   - For example, PERMA dimensions are discussed during \\\"well-being hangouts,\\\" where participants share progress and insights.\\n\\n3. **Personalized Growth Paths**:\\n   - Participants co-create their growth journeys by selecting focus areas from their baseline results.\\n   - As they progress, they can add new nuances or priorities, aligning with the metaphor of \\\"cultivating a garden.\\\"\\n\\n4. **Continuous Feedback Loops**:\\n   - Feedback is gathered not only from the participants but also from mentors, peers, and program managers.\\n   - This multi-directional feedback ensures a holistic understanding of growth and areas for improvement.\\n\\n5. **Shift from Achievement to Awareness**:\\n   - The new method measures progression through self-reported shifts in awareness, confidence, and clarity rather than solely focusing on end outcomes.\\n   - Questions like \\\"How has your understanding of leadership evolved?\\\" or \\\"What new insights have you gained about team building?\\\" replace static pre/post metrics.\\n\\n#### **Comparison to Past Methods**:\\n\\n| **Aspect**               | **Past Method**                                | **New Method**                                     |\\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\\n| **Focus**                | Binary pre/post results                       | Continuous progression and nuanced growth         |\\n| **Timeframe**            | Static assessments at program start and end  | Ongoing reflections throughout the program        |\\n| **Participant Engagement**| Limited, one-time data entry                  | Integrated into activities, fostering deeper engagement |\\n| **Insights**              | Broad, outcome-focused                       | Nuanced, insight-driven                           |\\n| **Feedback**              | Single-direction (participant to program)     | Multi-directional (participant, peers, mentors)   |\\n| **Actionability**         | Minimal connection to activities              | Directly tied to actionable next steps            |\\n\\n#### **Implementation in the Program**:\\n1. **Baseline Assessment**:\\n   - Participants complete ECAT and PERMA assessments to establish their starting points.\\n   - Results are discussed with mentors and program managers to set initial priorities.\\n\\n2. **Progression Snapshots**:\\n   - Regular snapshots capture reflections, insights, and \\\"aha moments.\\\"\\n   - These snapshots are shorter, focusing on key questions like \\\"What did you learn this week?\\\" and \\\"What actions did you take based on your learning?\\\"\\n\\n3. **Reflection Sessions**:\\n   - Weekly or bi-weekly sessions facilitate group discussions on progress, challenges, and shared learning.\\n   - Participants use their assessment results to guide their reflections and discussions.\\n\\n4. **Post-Program Review**:\\n   - A final review focuses on overall growth, emphasizing key insights and changes in mindset.\\n   - Participants celebrate their progress and identify areas for continued development.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Benefits of the New Method\\n- **Addresses Dunning-Kruger Effect**: Captures learning and shifts in self-awareness instead of penalizing participants for re-evaluating their competencies.\\n- **Enhances Participant Engagement**: Embedding assessments into program activities makes them feel meaningful and relevant.\\n- **Fosters Holistic Growth**: Combines individual, team, and organizational development in a cohesive framework.\\n- **Provides Actionable Insights**: Results directly inform coaching, mentoring, and activities.\\n- **Promotes a Culture of Reflection**: Encourages participants to continuously reflect, adapt, and grow.\\n\\nThis new assessment method ensures that growth is measured as a journey, fostering a culture of learning, collaboration, and continuous improvement.\"}",

      "content": "ok, that'snot bad, how do we learn from evolve and adapt based on insights from this framework I'm building: Below is a comprehensive final document that:\n\nIntroduces the overall system and its purpose.\nProvides an Onboarding Manual for the Program Manager, showing how to hold the space, gather information, and produce the context file.\nOffers a detailed Onboarding Guide (questions, approach, watch-outs).\nOutlines the Context File Structure we ultimately want to populate.\nPresents the 4-Part System Prompt, with each part building on the other.\nConcludes with an Assessment of what is great about this system and how it can be improved.\n1. INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW\nWhat is This System?\nThis system is called the Aliveness Advisor, a framework that helps individuals align their daily tasks (“to-dos”) with deeper motivations (“to-becomes”). It identifies tensions, fosters insight, and supports small, meaningful actions—transforming simple tasks into pathways toward a more alive and meaningful life.\n\nKey Conceptual Pillars\nInstrumental Actions (IAPs): Tasks done for something else (e.g., “I have to finish this report for work”).\nConstitutive Actions (CAPs): Actions that are intrinsically meaningful in the doing (e.g., “Share a relaxed morning call with Mom because that’s deeply connecting”).\nTensions: Points of conflict (e.g., rest vs. connection) that reveal what we really value.\nSources of Meaning: Underlying “ways of being” that animate us; identified via reflection, story, and felt sense of alignment.\nAttention Policies (APs): Specific, concrete things a person notices when living a source of meaning (e.g., “MOMENTS when presence flows naturally,” “SPACES where hearts open without effort”).\nWhy an Onboarding Process?\nRather than launching into an automated chat, we first gather the user’s background, values, style preferences, and supportive contexts manually, ensuring the LLM conversation starts with rich, personalized data. This sets the stage for a more meaningful, tailored experience.\n\n2. ONBOARDING MANUAL FOR THE PROGRAM MANAGER\nBelow is the step-by-step approach a Program Manager (PM) can use to onboard a new participant. The aim is to produce the context file that the LLM (Aliveness Advisor) will use during daily interactions, plus clarify the user’s communication preferences and values.\n\nA. Holding the Space\nSet a Warm, Safe Tone\n\nBegin with light conversation, check user’s comfort level.\nEmphasize confidentiality and genuine curiosity.\nAffirm that the user’s experiences and feelings are valid.\nIntroduce the Concept\n\nExplain that to-dos mirror who we are becoming.\nMention that we’ll collect stories of what matters, moments of tension, and personal preferences so the Aliveness Advisor can meet them where they are.\nFrame it as a supportive mirror, not a judge or lecturer.\nLook Out For…\n\nSigns of Distress: Slow down, offer gentle questions, or shorter sessions.\nExcessive Politeness or Evasion: Gently probe with story-based questions that feel natural rather than formulaic.\nConfusion or Overwhelm: Summarize frequently, clarify the purpose.\nB. How to Operate the Onboarding\nStart with a Check-In\n\nAsk how they are feeling (energy level 1–5, emotional tone, anything pressing).\nInquire about current to-dos and which single action would make the day feel complete.\nInvite Story Sharing\n\nUse story triangulation sets (see Onboarding Guide below) to uncover user’s preferences, learning style, tension points, moments of aliveness, support systems, etc.\nExample: “Tell me about a time a teacher or mentor truly helped you grow. What was that like?”\nDistill Values & Style\n\nFrom the stories, note repeated “meaning signals” (e.g., “I love it when I can integrate rest and friendship,” or “Mornings are best for me to connect”).\nIdentify potential “sources of meaning” and “attention policies.”\nAsk about language or style needs: do they prefer spiritual references, or do they want to avoid certain terms? Are they comfortable with direct challenges, or do they prefer gentle prompts?\nPopulate the Context File\n\nRecord the user’s tasks (both instrumental and meaningful), tension patterns, emergent values, key stories, style preferences, and any significant “attention policies” discovered.\nThis file becomes the foundation for the Aliveness Advisor.\nConclude & Transition\n\nSummarize: “Here’s what I heard you say matters most…”\nConfirm: “Does this feel accurate? Anything missing?”\nExplain next step: The user can now interact with the Aliveness Advisor daily, informed by the context we’ve gathered.\n3. DETAILED ONBOARDING GUIDE (KEY QUESTIONS & FLOW)\nA. Basic Check-In Format\nEnergy & State\n\n“On a scale of 1–5, how’s your energy right now?”\n“What emotions or body sensations are you noticing?”\nToday’s To-Dos\n\n“What’s on your plate today, both big and small?”\n“Of these, which feel like ‘must do’ vs. ‘want to do’?”\nCompletion Anchor\n\n“If by bedtime you felt truly satisfied, what single thing would have happened?”\nB. Story Triangulation Sets\n(Use 1–2 sets that resonate most; do not overuse to avoid overwhelming.)\n\nDecision-Making Style\n\nBig Decision Story: “Tell me about a choice you made that felt really right…”\nRegret Story: “A time you wish you’d chosen differently…”\nQuick Choice Story: “A rapid decision that worked out unexpectedly well…”\nEnergy Management Style\n\nBest Day Story: “A day that flowed perfectly—what made it special?”\nRecovery Story: “A time you bounced back from depletion—how?”\nEnergy Shift Story: “When your energy turned around dramatically—why?”\nSupport Utilization Style\n\nBreakthrough Story: “A stuck point someone helped you move through—what made their support work?”\nIndependence Story: “A time you solved things alone—why was that better?”\nTeam Success Story: “A group effort that worked beautifully—what was your part?”\nGrowth & Challenge Style\n\nLearning Edge: “A time you pushed past your comfort zone—what helped you risk it?”\nFeedback Integration: “Feedback that truly landed and changed something for you.”\nNatural Growth: “Something you mastered almost without trying—what were conditions?”\nC. Style & Language Preferences\nPreferred Tone: Gentle? Direct? Playful? Serious?\nLanguage: Words to avoid, spiritual references, phrasing they like.\nChallenge Comfort: Do they enjoy “pokey” challenges or prefer a mild invitation?\nLevel of Reflection vs Action: Are they quick to act or do they prefer thorough exploration?\nD. Merging Data into Context\nFrom each story, identify:\n\nPotential Tensions (e.g., “I want rest and connection.”)\nSources of Meaning (“Deep Connection,” “Creative Expression,” etc.)\nAttention Policies (“MOMENTS when presence flows naturally,” etc.)\nInstrumental/Meaningful Tasks (the user’s everyday list).\nE. Example Flow in Practice\nCheck-In: “Energy 3/5, scattered.”\nStory: User shares time they overcame a major block with a friend’s help.\nExtraction: Notice “friend connection,” “support style,” “morning energy preference.”\nConfirmation: “Does it sound right that you find it easier to reflect in the mornings and that direct, short feedback works best for you?”\nPopulate context file: tasks, tensions, values, style.\n4. CONTEXT FILE STRUCTURE\nHere is a proposed YAML (no comments) capturing what we glean:\n\nyaml\nCopy\nEdit\ncontext:\n  todos:\n    instrumental:\n      - task: \"Finish project report\"\n        status: \"active\"\n    meaningful:\n      - task: \"Morning call with Mom\"\n        connected_value: \"Deep Connection\"\n        status: \"active\"\n  \n  sources_of_meaning:\n    - name: \"Deep Connection\"\n      attention_policies:\n        - \"MOMENTS when presence flows naturally\"\n        - \"SPACES where hearts open without effort\"\n      evidence:\n        stories:\n          - \"Time user felt real intimacy talking in the morning\"\n          - \"Breakthrough story with a friend\"\n        key_moments:\n          - \"Energy lift discussing early calls\"\n    \n    - name: \"Creative Expression\"\n      attention_policies:\n        - \"MOMENTS when imagination feels playful\"\n        - \"TIMES when user can freely explore ideas\"\n      evidence:\n        stories:\n          - \"Best day flow story about drawing/music\"\n        key_moments:\n          - \"User’s sense of losing track of time when creating\"\n  \n  tensions:\n    current:\n      - description: \"Rest vs Social Connection\"\n        competing_values:\n          - \"Creative Expression\"\n          - \"Deep Connection\"\n        evidence: \"User said 'I need a rest day, but friend invited me to hammam'\"\n    resolved:\n      - description: \"Nighttime calls to morning calls\"\n        learning: \"Timing shift transformed obligation to joy\"\n        evidence: \"User overcame guilt by scheduling calls in the morning\"\n  \n  development:\n    current_focus: \"Maintaining personal energy while nurturing key connections\"\n    next_steps:\n      - \"Continue morning calls\"\n      - \"Experiment with quiet hammam time\"\n    style_preferences:\n      challenge_level: \"medium\"\n      tone: \"warm but direct\"\n      language_to_avoid: [\"God references\"] # example\n      user_notes: \"User likes short reflective questions\"\n5. THE 4-PART SYSTEM PROMPT\nBelow is a condensed final version, which you can paste into the LLM’s “system” or developer settings. Once the context is also loaded, the user can interact daily with these guidelines.\n\nPART 1: FOUNDATION & PHILOSOPHY\nCore Understanding\n\nTodo lists mirror who we are becoming (IAPs vs CAPs).\nTensions reveal deeper values.\nEmotions are signals pointing to alignment or blockage.\nKey Definitions\n\nIAP: Instrumental Action, done for external results.\nCAP: Constitutive Action, intrinsically meaningful.\nSources of Meaning: Ways of living that bring genuine aliveness.\nAttention Policies: Specific, observable focuses that define a source of meaning.\nAdvisory Style\n\nWarm, personal, succinct.\nMirror user’s words, reflect tensions, offer small next steps.\nMinimal jargon, natural flow.\nPART 2: DAILY OPERATIONAL FLOW\nMorning Check-In (Single Block)\n“Hey! How’s your energy (1–5)? What’s on your plate, and if by bedtime you felt fully satisfied, what would have happened?”\n\nMirror & Reflect\n\nBriefly echo key points: “I hear you’re feeling… and thinking about…”\nName tension in everyday language: “Sounds like you want X but also Y.”\nOffer One Insight (Optional)\n\n“Sometimes that guilt points to needing new timing…”\n“What you might not see is that your excitement might show a hidden priority…”\nSingle Next Step\n\nEnd with one question or micro-invitation: “What tiny move might help right now?”\nPART 3: VALUES & MEANING DISCOVERY\nZooming in from Feelings\n\nNegative feelings reveal blocked values; positive feelings reveal present values.\nGently ask what deeper desire or care is behind each feeling.\nZooming in from Norms/Goals\n\n“If this was about living how you truly want, rather than a ‘should,’ what might it look like?”\nAsk for role models or stories of alignment.\nWriting Source of Meaning\n\nUse attention policies in plural noun phrases + qualifiers.\nExample: “MOMENTS when I feel an unforced ease in conversation.”\nPART 4: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION\nContext Maintenance\n\nKeep an internal file with user’s tasks, tensions, sources of meaning, style preferences.\nUpdate each session based on new insights.\nExport Format\n\nProvide user with a context.yaml snapshot upon request, summarizing tasks, values, tensions, and next steps.\nSubtle Continuity\n\nReference previous insights only if relevant.\nLet user drive the depth; if they prefer minimal reflection, keep it short.\nIf they want more challenge, intensify directness or “blind spot” prompts.\n6. ASSESSMENT: WHAT’S GREAT & HOW TO IMPROVE\nWhat’s Great\nHolistic Yet Practical\n\nWe unify deep meaning (CAPs, tensions, attention policies) with day-to-day tasks.\nAlways ask for a small next step, ensuring reflection turns into action.\nNatural, Story-Based Approach\n\nGather real-life narratives to uncover personal truths, rather than forced questionnaires.\nTriangulation sets reveal subtle preferences and style needs in a conversational way.\nStructured Yet Flexible\n\nThe daily check-in is consistent (energy + tasks + potential satisfaction).\nThe system can adapt in tone, challenge level, and content based on user preference and evolving context.\nUser Empowerment\n\nEmphasizes user’s own “why,” letting them see tasks not as chores but as part of who they are becoming.\nEncourages each user to refine the system to their liking (spiritual references, directness, etc.).\nPotential Improvements\nRefinement of Tension/Pattern Distinction\n\nSometimes we just see a tension once; other times it’s a recurring pattern. We might refine how or when we label something a “pattern” vs. a one-time tension.\nBetter Blind Spot Detection\n\nWe can expand “blind spot prompts” for folks who rarely articulate hidden resistances. Possibly store typical triggers or common illusions to watch for.\nMore Examples of Quick Action\n\nSome users might want simpler or faster next steps. We can show more real-life micro-actions (e.g., “Text a friend right now,” “Write a single line in your notebook now”).\nEnhanced Onboarding Depth\n\nThe story-based approach can be lengthy. We might create a “fast-track” version for busy folks, capturing essentials in under 30 minutes but still gleaning a few stories.\nFinal Note\nThis Onboarding & System Prompt design is meant to invite genuine discovery rather than impose rules. By gathering user context, clarifying style preferences, and focusing on small, meaningful steps, the Aliveness Advisor can effectively help people turn their to-dos into to-becomes.\n\nFeel free to prune or expand as your program requires, always keeping the heart of it: a warm mirror that resonates with each person’s unique energies and deeper motivations. May it bring more aliveness to everyday life.\n\n10:46\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you take your suggestions of improvement and develop them, flesh them out and ensure they're comprehensive and elegant\n10:48\nChatGPT\n\nThought for a few seconds\nBelow is a more comprehensive and elegant treatment of the four improvement areas identified, with each suggestion expanded into practical next steps and rationale.\n\n1. Refinement of Tension vs. Pattern Distinction\nWhy It Matters\n\nA single, isolated clash (e.g., wanting coffee now vs. needing to write a paper) is often a momentary tension.\nA pattern, in contrast, is a recurring or habitual tension (e.g., repeatedly postponing important work in favor of minor tasks).\nTreating every tension as a pattern can overcomplicate; ignoring recurrent tensions misses deeper growth opportunities.\nWhat to Improve\n\nDefine Clear Criteria\n\nOne-off Tension: Emerges from current circumstances; if resolved, it doesn’t typically reappear in the same form.\nRecurring Pattern: Reappears under similar conditions (e.g., “always feel guilty about mom calls,” “habitually avoid bold moves,” etc.).\nAdd a Brief “Tension or Pattern?” Check\n\nAfter noticing a tension, the system (or the onboarding facilitator) asks: “Has this come up before in a similar form?”\nIf yes, likely a pattern—the user or LLM can store it in a “recurring pattern” list.\nIf no, treat it as a one-time tension: address and move on.\nAdapt Language & Support\n\nFor one-off tensions: Provide a small immediate step or reframe, then verify if it’s resolved.\nFor recurring patterns: Offer more robust exploration—e.g., deeper questions, story gathering, or repeated practice.\nConcrete Steps\n\nSystem Prompt Update: After naming a tension, automatically ask: “Has this or something similar shown up before?”\nContext File: Maintain a patterns section for recurrent tensions. Move “one-off” issues to a “resolved or ephemeral” log.\n2. Enhanced Blind Spot Detection\nWhy It Matters\n\nUsers don’t always articulate hidden resistances, social conditioning, or limiting beliefs.\nGently revealing these “unseen corners” can spark major breakthroughs.\nWhat to Improve\n\nBlind-Spot Prompts\n\nHave a ready set of short, direct lines: “What you might not see is…,” “Sometimes frustration means…,” “What if your anxiety is telling you that…?”\nUse them sparingly—once or twice per session, maximum.\nPattern-Focused Blind Spots\n\nIf the system notes the user repeatedly hitting the same conflict (e.g., constantly wanting to buy new notebooks instead of using the old ones), it can point out the possibility of “tool acquisition as avoidance.”\nAdditional “Soft” Checks\n\n“Is there anything you find yourself resisting sharing here?”\n“Sometimes we hide behind ‘practical tasks’—could that be happening now?”\nSystem Self-Reflect\n\nKeep a hidden library of typical illusions (e.g., “I can’t do X unless Y,” “I have no choice,” “I need more tools”), and gently test for these illusions when relevant patterns appear.\nConcrete Steps\n\nSystem Prompt Update: Insert a small “Blind Spot Challenge” slot in the daily flow if the conversation suggests repeated tension or hidden assumptions.\nContext File: Maintain a “common illusions” or “red-flag beliefs” list that can be cross-referenced during repeated tensions.\n3. More Examples of Quick Action\nWhy It Matters\n\nMany users get stuck in overthinking. They need immediate, tangible steps to break inertia.\nOffering short, real-life “micro-actions” helps them experience momentum right away.\nWhat to Improve\n\nMicro-Action Library\n\nCreate a short set of 1–2 minute tasks: “Text a friend a gratitude note,” “Jot down one line in your notebook,” “Do a 30-second stretch,” “Send that email draft, even if imperfect.”\nTag each micro-action with contexts where it applies (e.g., social connection, creative block, time management).\nImmediate “In-Conversation” Prompts\n\nAs soon as the user expresses stuckness, the LLM can offer 1–2 micro-actions that they can do right now.\nExample: “You mentioned you keep avoiding that message. How about writing two bullet points right this minute?”\nBias Toward Action\n\nEncourage the user to do it before the conversation ends. This fosters a sense of “I can see real change happening now.”\nPost-Action Reflection\n\nAfter they try the quick step, ask: “What shifted? Even if it was small, how did it feel?” This helps reinforce success.\nConcrete Steps\n\nSystem Prompt Update: Add a “micro-action suggestion slot” whenever user shows or states frustration, procrastination, or mild anxiety.\nContext File: Possibly store “successful quick actions” that worked for them, so the system can reuse or adapt them.\n4. Enhanced Onboarding Depth\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe more thorough and personal the onboarding, the richer the LLM can tailor its responses.\nHowever, some users have limited time or capacity—so we need different “depth settings.”\nWhat to Improve\n\nTwo-Tier Onboarding\n\nEssential Fast-Track (30 min): Quick check-in, 1–2 story sets, style preferences, immediate tensions, and 1–2 significant tasks.\nDeep-Dive (1–2 hours): All story triangulation sets, detailed style preferences, multiple tension explorations, thorough value mapping.\nStory-Focused Approach\n\nEncourage 2–3 personal stories that reveal values, tension, and supportive patterns.\nSummarize each story in the context file with direct user quotes. Link them to identified “sources of meaning.”\nStructured Yet Organic\n\nLet conversation flow, but keep an internal mental checklist of “minimum data” (family context, big stressors, main emotional hotspots, style do/don’t, etc.).\nIf user runs short on time, confirm the essentials first (preferences, biggest tensions, 1–2 meaningful tasks).\nContext File Richness\n\nInclude possible “role models” or “pivotal life events.”\nTag user’s stated illusions or “I have no choice” language if it appears.\nRecord their sense of “how they best learn” and “how they prefer you address them” (like “buddy,” “friend,” or by name).\nConcrete Steps\n\nOnboarding Protocol:\nFast-Track Tier: 5–6 bullet questions.\nDeep-Dive Tier: Up to 10–12 story-based questions, more reflection.\nSystem Prompt Upgrade: After onboarding, display a short summary of key insights to the user for validation: “Here’s what I heard—anything off or missing?”\nBringing It All Together\nImplementing these improvements will sharpen the system to be:\n\nMore discerning between fleeting tensions and long-term patterns.\nMore skilled at gently surfacing blind spots.\nMore action-oriented, offering quick steps that build momentum.\nMore flexible in how onboarding data is gathered, either swiftly or deeply, ensuring the user feels seen and understood.\nNext Steps might include creating small “templates” or “modules” in the system prompt that handle each improvement area—for example, a “Blind Spot Prompt Module,” a “Quick Action Library,” or an “Onboarding Tiered Script.” Integrating these seamlessly into the existing approach keeps the conversation natural and user-driven, while ensuring real transformation and not just reflection.\n\nBy pursuing these improvements, the Aliveness Advisor becomes increasingly effective, humane, and growth-focused—offering a unique blend of personal warmth and structured insight that helps users truly come alive in their daily tasks and beyond.",

INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW\nWhat is This System?\nThis system is called the Aliveness Advisor, a framework that helps individuals align their daily tasks (“to-dos”) with deeper motivations (“to-becomes”). It identifies tensions, fosters insight, and supports small, meaningful actions—transforming simple tasks into pathways toward a more alive and meaningful life.\n\nKey Conceptual Pillars\nInstrumental Actions (IAPs): Tasks done for something else (e.g., “I have to finish this report for work”).\nConstitutive Actions (CAPs): Actions that are intrinsically meaningful in the doing (e.g., “Share a relaxed morning call with Mom because that’s deeply connecting”).\nTensions: Points of conflict (e.g., rest vs. connection) that reveal what we really value.\nSources of Meaning: Underlying “ways of being” that animate us; identified via reflection, story, and felt sense of alignment.\nAttention Policies (APs): Specific, concrete things a person notices when living a source of meaning (e.g., “MOMENTS when presence flows naturally,” “SPACES where hearts open without effort”).\nWhy an Onboarding Process?\nRather than launching into an automated chat, we first gather the user’s background, values, style preferences, and supportive contexts manually, ensuring the LLM conversation starts with rich, personalized data. This sets the stage for a more meaningful, tailored experience.\n\n2. ONBOARDING MANUAL FOR THE PROGRAM MANAGER\nBelow is the step-by-step approach a Program Manager (PM) can use to onboard a new participant. The aim is to produce the context file that the LLM (Aliveness Advisor) will use during daily interactions, plus clarify the user’s communication preferences and values.\n\nA. Holding the Space\nSet a Warm, Safe Tone\n\nBegin with light conversation, check user’s comfort level.\nEmphasize confidentiality and genuine curiosity.\nAffirm that the user’s experiences and feelings are valid.\nIntroduce the Concept\n\nExplain that to-dos mirror who we are becoming.\nMention that we’ll collect stories of what matters, moments of tension, and personal preferences so the Aliveness Advisor can meet them where they are.\nFrame it as a supportive mirror, not a judge or lecturer.\nLook Out For…\n\nSigns of Distress: Slow down, offer gentle questions, or shorter sessions.\nExcessive Politeness or Evasion: Gently probe with story-based questions that feel natural rather than formulaic.\nConfusion or Overwhelm: Summarize frequently, clarify the purpose.\nB. How to Operate the Onboarding\nStart with a Check-In\n\nAsk how they are feeling (energy level 1–5, emotional tone, anything pressing).\nInquire about current to-dos and which single action would make the day feel complete.\nInvite Story Sharing\n\nUse story triangulation sets (see Onboarding Guide below) to uncover user’s preferences, learning style, tension points, moments of aliveness, support systems, etc.\nExample: “Tell me about a time a teacher or mentor truly helped you grow. What was that like?”\nDistill Values & Style\n\nFrom the stories, note repeated “meaning signals” (e.g., “I love it when I can integrate rest and friendship,” or “Mornings are best for me to connect”).\nIdentify potential “sources of meaning” and “attention policies.”\nAsk about language or style needs: do they prefer spiritual references, or do they want to avoid certain terms? Are they comfortable with direct challenges, or do they prefer gentle prompts?\nPopulate the Context File\n\nRecord the user’s tasks (both instrumental and meaningful), tension patterns, emergent values, key stories, style preferences, and any significant “attention policies” discovered.\nThis file becomes the foundation for the Aliveness Advisor.\nConclude & Transition\n\nSummarize: “Here’s what I heard you say matters most…”\nConfirm: “Does this feel accurate? Anything missing?”\nExplain next step: The user can now interact with the Aliveness Advisor daily, informed by the context we’ve gathered.\n3. DETAILED ONBOARDING GUIDE (KEY QUESTIONS & FLOW)\nA. Basic Check-In Format\nEnergy & State\n\n“On a scale of 1–5, how’s your energy right now?”\n“What emotions or body sensations are you noticing?”\nToday’s To-Dos\n\n“What’s on your plate today, both big and small?”\n“Of these, which feel like ‘must do’ vs. ‘want to do’?”\nCompletion Anchor\n\n“If by bedtime you felt truly satisfied, what single thing would have happened?”\nB. Story Triangulation Sets\n(Use 1–2 sets that resonate most; do not overuse to avoid overwhelming.)\n\nDecision-Making Style\n\nBig Decision Story: “Tell me about a choice you made that felt really right…”\nRegret Story: “A time you wish you’d chosen differently…”\nQuick Choice Story: “A rapid decision that worked out unexpectedly well…”\nEnergy Management Style\n\nBest Day Story: “A day that flowed perfectly—what made it special?”\nRecovery Story: “A time you bounced back from depletion—how?”\nEnergy Shift Story: “When your energy turned around dramatically—why?”\nSupport Utilization Style\n\nBreakthrough Story: “A stuck point someone helped you move through—what made their support work?”\nIndependence Story: “A time you solved things alone—why was that better?”\nTeam Success Story: “A group effort that worked beautifully—what was your part?”\nGrowth & Challenge Style\n\nLearning Edge: “A time you pushed past your comfort zone—what helped you risk it?”\nFeedback Integration: “Feedback that truly landed and changed something for you.”\nNatural Growth: “Something you mastered almost without trying—what were conditions?”\nC. Style & Language Preferences\nPreferred Tone: Gentle? Direct? Playful? Serious?\nLanguage: Words to avoid, spiritual references, phrasing they like.\nChallenge Comfort: Do they enjoy “pokey” challenges or prefer a mild invitation?\nLevel of Reflection vs Action: Are they quick to act or do they prefer thorough exploration?\nD. Merging Data into Context\nFrom each story, identify:\n\nPotential Tensions (e.g., “I want rest and connection.”)\nSources of Meaning (“Deep Connection,” “Creative Expression,” etc.)\nAttention Policies (“MOMENTS when presence flows naturally,” etc.)\nInstrumental/Meaningful Tasks (the user’s everyday list).\nE. Example Flow in Practice\nCheck-In: “Energy 3/5, scattered.”\nStory: User shares time they overcame a major block with a friend’s help.\nExtraction: Notice “friend connection,” “support style,” “morning energy preference.”\nConfirmation: “Does it sound right that you find it easier to reflect in the mornings and that direct, short feedback works best for you?”\nPopulate context file: tasks, tensions, values, style.\n4. CONTEXT FILE STRUCTURE\nHere is a proposed YAML (no comments) capturing what we glean:\n\nyaml\nCopy\nEdit\ncontext:\n  todos:\n    instrumental:\n      - task: \"Finish project report\"\n        status: \"active\"\n    meaningful:\n      - task: \"Morning call with Mom\"\n        connected_value: \"Deep Connection\"\n        status: \"active\"\n  \n  sources_of_meaning:\n    - name: \"Deep Connection\"\n      attention_policies:\n        - \"MOMENTS when presence flows naturally\"\n        - \"SPACES where hearts open without effort\"\n      evidence:\n        stories:\n          - \"Time user felt real intimacy talking in the morning\"\n          - \"Breakthrough story with a friend\"\n        key_moments:\n          - \"Energy lift discussing early calls\"\n    \n    - name: \"Creative Expression\"\n      attention_policies:\n        - \"MOMENTS when imagination feels playful\"\n        - \"TIMES when user can freely explore ideas\"\n      evidence:\n        stories:\n          - \"Best day flow story about drawing/music\"\n        key_moments:\n          - \"User’s sense of losing track of time when creating\"\n  \n  tensions:\n    current:\n      - description: \"Rest vs Social Connection\"\n        competing_values:\n          - \"Creative Expression\"\n          - \"Deep Connection\"\n        evidence: \"User said 'I need a rest day, but friend invited me to hammam'\"\n    resolved:\n      - description: \"Nighttime calls to morning calls\"\n        learning: \"Timing shift transformed obligation to joy\"\n        evidence: \"User overcame guilt by scheduling calls in the morning\"\n  \n  development:\n    current_focus: \"Maintaining personal energy while nurturing key connections\"\n    next_steps:\n      - \"Continue morning calls\"\n      - \"Experiment with quiet hammam time\"\n    style_preferences:\n      challenge_level: \"medium\"\n      tone: \"warm but direct\"\n      language_to_avoid: [\"God references\"] # example\n      user_notes: \"User likes short reflective questions\"\n5. THE 4-PART SYSTEM PROMPT\nBelow is a condensed final version, which you can paste into the LLM’s “system” or developer settings. Once the context is also loaded, the user can interact daily with these guidelines.\n\nPART 1: FOUNDATION & PHILOSOPHY\nCore Understanding\n\nTodo lists mirror who we are becoming (IAPs vs CAPs).\nTensions reveal deeper values.\nEmotions are signals pointing to alignment or blockage.\nKey Definitions\n\nIAP: Instrumental Action, done for external results.\nCAP: Constitutive Action, intrinsically meaningful.\nSources of Meaning: Ways of living that bring genuine aliveness.\nAttention Policies: Specific, observable focuses that define a source of meaning.\nAdvisory Style\n\nWarm, personal, succinct.\nMirror user’s words, reflect tensions, offer small next steps.\nMinimal jargon, natural flow.\nPART 2: DAILY OPERATIONAL FLOW\nMorning Check-In (Single Block)\n“Hey! How’s your energy (1–5)? What’s on your plate, and if by bedtime you felt fully satisfied, what would have happened?”\n\nMirror & Reflect\n\nBriefly echo key points: “I hear you’re feeling… and thinking about…”\nName tension in everyday language: “Sounds like you want X but also Y.”\nOffer One Insight (Optional)\n\n“Sometimes that guilt points to needing new timing…”\n“What you might not see is that your excitement might show a hidden priority…”\nSingle Next Step\n\nEnd with one question or micro-invitation: “What tiny move might help right now?”\nPART 3: VALUES & MEANING DISCOVERY\nZooming in from Feelings\n\nNegative feelings reveal blocked values; positive feelings reveal present values.\nGently ask what deeper desire or care is behind each feeling.\nZooming in from Norms/Goals\n\n“If this was about living how you truly want, rather than a ‘should,’ what might it look like?”\nAsk for role models or stories of alignment.\nWriting Source of Meaning\n\nUse attention policies in plural noun phrases + qualifiers.\nExample: “MOMENTS when I feel an unforced ease in conversation.”\nPART 4: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION\nContext Maintenance\n\nKeep an internal file with user’s tasks, tensions, sources of meaning, style preferences.\nUpdate each session based on new insights.\nExport Format\n\nProvide user with a context.yaml snapshot upon request, summarizing tasks, values, tensions, and next steps.\nSubtle Continuity\n\nReference previous insights only if relevant.\nLet user drive the depth; if they prefer minimal reflection, keep it short.\nIf they want more challenge, intensify directness or “blind spot” prompts.\n6. ASSESSMENT: WHAT’S GREAT & HOW TO IMPROVE\nWhat’s Great\nHolistic Yet Practical\n\nWe unify deep meaning (CAPs, tensions, attention policies) with day-to-day tasks.\nAlways ask for a small next step, ensuring reflection turns into action.\nNatural, Story-Based Approach\n\nGather real-life narratives to uncover personal truths, rather than forced questionnaires.\nTriangulation sets reveal subtle preferences and style needs in a conversational way.\nStructured Yet Flexible\n\nThe daily check-in is consistent (energy + tasks + potential satisfaction).\nThe system can adapt in tone, challenge level, and content based on user preference and evolving context.\nUser Empowerment\n\nEmphasizes user’s own “why,” letting them see tasks not as chores but as part of who they are becoming.\nEncourages each user to refine the system to their liking (spiritual references, directness, etc.).\nPotential Improvements\nRefinement of Tension/Pattern Distinction\n\nSometimes we just see a tension once; other times it’s a recurring pattern. We might refine how or when we label something a “pattern” vs. a one-time tension.\nBetter Blind Spot Detection\n\nWe can expand “blind spot prompts” for folks who rarely articulate hidden resistances. Possibly store typical triggers or common illusions to watch for.\nMore Examples of Quick Action\n\nSome users might want simpler or faster next steps. We can show more real-life micro-actions (e.g., “Text a friend right now,” “Write a single line in your notebook now”).\nEnhanced Onboarding Depth\n\nThe story-based approach can be lengthy. We might create a “fast-track” version for busy folks, capturing essentials in under 30 minutes but still gleaning a few stories.\nFinal Note\nThis Onboarding & System Prompt design is meant to invite genuine discovery rather than impose rules. By gathering user context, clarifying style preferences, and focusing on small, meaningful steps, the Aliveness Advisor can effectively help people turn their to-dos into to-becomes.\n\nFeel free to prune or expand as your program requires, always keeping the heart of it: a warm mirror that resonates with each person’s unique energies and deeper motivations. May it bring more aliveness to everyday life.\n\n10:46\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you take your suggestions of improvement and develop them, flesh them out and ensure they're comprehensive and elegant\n10:48\nChatGPT\n\nThought for a few seconds\nBelow is a more comprehensive and elegant treatment of the four improvement areas identified, with each suggestion expanded into practical next steps and rationale.\n\n1. Refinement of Tension vs. Pattern Distinction\nWhy It Matters\n\nA single, isolated clash (e.g., wanting coffee now vs. needing to write a paper) is often a momentary tension.\nA pattern, in contrast, is a recurring or habitual tension (e.g., repeatedly postponing important work in favor of minor tasks).\nTreating every tension as a pattern can overcomplicate; ignoring recurrent tensions misses deeper growth opportunities.\nWhat to Improve\n\nDefine Clear Criteria\n\nOne-off Tension: Emerges from current circumstances; if resolved, it doesn’t typically reappear in the same form.\nRecurring Pattern: Reappears under similar conditions (e.g., “always feel guilty about mom calls,” “habitually avoid bold moves,” etc.).\nAdd a Brief “Tension or Pattern?” Check\n\nAfter noticing a tension, the system (or the onboarding facilitator) asks: “Has this come up before in a similar form?”\nIf yes, likely a pattern—the user or LLM can store it in a “recurring pattern” list.\nIf no, treat it as a one-time tension: address and move on.\nAdapt Language & Support\n\nFor one-off tensions: Provide a small immediate step or reframe, then verify if it’s resolved.\nFor recurring patterns: Offer more robust exploration—e.g., deeper questions, story gathering, or repeated practice.\nConcrete Steps\n\nSystem Prompt Update: After naming a tension, automatically ask: “Has this or something similar shown up before?”\nContext File: Maintain a patterns section for recurrent tensions. Move “one-off” issues to a “resolved or ephemeral” log.\n2. Enhanced Blind Spot Detection\nWhy It Matters\n\nUsers don’t always articulate hidden resistances, social conditioning, or limiting beliefs.\nGently revealing these “unseen corners” can spark major breakthroughs.\nWhat to Improve\n\nBlind-Spot Prompts\n\nHave a ready set of short, direct lines: “What you might not see is…,” “Sometimes frustration means…,” “What if your anxiety is telling you that…?”\nUse them sparingly—once or twice per session, maximum.\nPattern-Focused Blind Spots\n\nIf the system notes the user repeatedly hitting the same conflict (e.g., constantly wanting to buy new notebooks instead of using the old ones), it can point out the possibility of “tool acquisition as avoidance.”\nAdditional “Soft” Checks\n\n“Is there anything you find yourself resisting sharing here?”\n“Sometimes we hide behind ‘practical tasks’—could that be happening now?”\nSystem Self-Reflect\n\nKeep a hidden library of typical illusions (e.g., “I can’t do X unless Y,” “I have no choice,” “I need more tools”), and gently test for these illusions when relevant patterns appear.\nConcrete Steps\n\nSystem Prompt Update: Insert a small “Blind Spot Challenge” slot in the daily flow if the conversation suggests repeated tension or hidden assumptions.\nContext File: Maintain a “common illusions” or “red-flag beliefs” list that can be cross-referenced during repeated tensions.\n3. More Examples of Quick Action\nWhy It Matters\n\nMany users get stuck in overthinking. They need immediate, tangible steps to break inertia.\nOffering short, real-life “micro-actions” helps them experience momentum right away.\nWhat to Improve\n\nMicro-Action Library\n\nCreate a short set of 1–2 minute tasks: “Text a friend a gratitude note,” “Jot down one line in your notebook,” “Do a 30-second stretch,” “Send that email draft, even if imperfect.”\nTag each micro-action with contexts where it applies (e.g., social connection, creative block, time management).\nImmediate “In-Conversation” Prompts\n\nAs soon as the user expresses stuckness, the LLM can offer 1–2 micro-actions that they can do right now.\nExample: “You mentioned you keep avoiding that message. How about writing two bullet points right this minute?”\nBias Toward Action\n\nEncourage the user to do it before the conversation ends. This fosters a sense of “I can see real change happening now.”\nPost-Action Reflection\n\nAfter they try the quick step, ask: “What shifted? Even if it was small, how did it feel?” This helps reinforce success.\nConcrete Steps\n\nSystem Prompt Update: Add a “micro-action suggestion slot” whenever user shows or states frustration, procrastination, or mild anxiety.\nContext File: Possibly store “successful quick actions” that worked for them, so the system can reuse or adapt them.]]]",

      "content": "To integrate insights from the Aliveness Advisor framework into the pre/post assessment adaptation, I’ve developed a summary of how its principles could nuance and evolve the assessment process. These principles can inform the creation of a meta-level assessment approach that aligns with deeper motivations and fosters richer insights. Below is a structured summary of key updates, followed by an updated version of the two-pager incorporating these changes.\n\n---\n\n### Key Changes and Principles Derived from the Aliveness Advisor Framework\n#### 1. **From Tasks to Transformations**\n   - **Current Limitation**: Existing assessments often focus on tasks completed or skills gained without deeply examining how these align with intrinsic motivations or meaningful growth.\n   - **Updated Principle**: Distinguish between **Instrumental Actions (IAPs)** (actions for external results) and **Constitutive Actions (CAPs)** (intrinsically meaningful actions). Assess shifts in the balance and integration of IAPs and CAPs over time.\n   - **Application**: Use pre/post assessments to explore how participants’ daily actions and decisions align with their deeper motivations (e.g., “What actions felt most alive and meaningful?”).\n\n#### 2. **Highlighting Patterns and Tensions**\n   - **Current Limitation**: Assessments often fail to identify recurring tensions (e.g., work vs. rest) that signal deeper values or unresolved priorities.\n   - **Updated Principle**: Introduce a layer in the assessment to track recurring patterns and tensions, distinguishing one-off challenges from deeper systemic issues.\n   - **Application**: Add questions in pre/post assessments to uncover tensions participants navigate throughout the program (e.g., “What recurring challenges did you notice? What values do they reveal?”).\n\n#### 3. **Attention Policies and Sources of Meaning**\n   - **Current Limitation**: Limited focus on how participants notice and interpret meaningful moments or success during the program.\n   - **Updated Principle**: Introduce **Attention Policies (APs)** to guide reflection on specific, observable moments of meaning and success (e.g., “spaces where creativity flows”).\n   - **Application**: Assess participants’ ability to articulate and observe attention policies over time, fostering a metacognitive lens on their progress.\n\n#### 4. **Incorporating Story-Based Reflection**\n   - **Current Limitation**: Rigid, quantitative approaches can miss the richness of individual experiences and their impact.\n   - **Updated Principle**: Use **story triangulation sets** to gather reflective insights about growth, challenges, and breakthroughs. This approach emphasizes learning through lived narratives.\n   - **Application**: Add story-based questions to assessments (e.g., “Share a moment where you felt most aligned with your purpose during the program”).\n\n#### 5. **Personalized Actionability**\n   - **Current Limitation**: Assessments often highlight areas of improvement without actionable steps or tailored follow-ups.\n   - **Updated Principle**: Use assessment insights to co-create personalized action plans or micro-action suggestions for the next phase.\n   - **Application**: Incorporate a section in the post-assessment for creating a next-steps plan based on insights gained.\n\n---\n\n### Updates to the Two-Pager: Integrating the Aliveness Advisor Framework\n#### **Principles for the New Assessment Method**\n1. **Integrating Instrumental and Constitutive Actions**: Evaluate both practical skills (IAPs) and shifts in intrinsic alignment (CAPs). Track how participants’ actions balance external goals with deeper fulfillment.\n2. **Tension and Pattern Awareness**: Assess recurring tensions (e.g., autonomy vs. collaboration) to uncover underlying values and growth opportunities.\n3. **Metacognitive Awareness Through Attention Policies**: Introduce a reflective layer for participants to observe and articulate meaningful moments, spaces, or interactions that enhanced their growth.\n4. **Narrative-Driven Insight**: Use open-ended story-based prompts to allow participants to share meaningful breakthroughs, challenges, and personal growth stories.\n5. **Action-Oriented Reflection**: Design assessments to transition seamlessly into action plans, ensuring insights lead to measurable and meaningful next steps.\n\n#### **Description of the New Pre/Post Assessment Approach**\nThe new pre/post assessment goes beyond traditional skill and knowledge evaluation to encompass participants’ alignment with their values, recurring patterns, and moments of meaning. By integrating insights from the Aliveness Advisor, the method captures:\n- **Dynamic Growth**: How participants shift from purely external motivations (IAPs) to intrinsic engagement (CAPs).\n- **Tensions and Patterns**: Participants identify recurring challenges and reflect on how they navigated these within the program.\n- **Sources of Meaning and Attention Policies**: Participants track and articulate moments that defined their sense of purpose and flow.\n- **Story-Based Reflection**: Lived narratives are prioritized to ensure insights are grounded in participants' experiences.\n- **Personalized Action Planning**: Post-assessments guide participants toward actionable next steps based on their unique growth journey.\n\n---\n\nWould you like the revised two-pager document to include these changes?

      "content": "Got it. Let’s aim for a minimal yet meaningful update that incorporates a key insight from the **Aliveness Advisor** framework while keeping most of the structure intact. The goal is to introduce an additional layer of measurement that provides actionable insights and creates downstream benefits, without overhauling the system.\n\n---\n\n### **Minimal Changes to the Pre/Post Assessment**\n#### 1. **Introduce Key Insight: Agency, Awareness, and Meaning**\n   - Inspired by the **Aliveness Advisor**, add **Agency** (sense of control and self-efficacy), **Self-Awareness** (clarity about motivations and values), and **Business Awareness** (understanding opportunities, challenges, and decision-making processes) as dimensions to assess growth.\n   - These three areas focus on measurable, transformative effects of the program without requiring a complete shift in methodology.\n\n#### 2. **Measurement Approach**\n   - **Agency**: Use reflection-based prompts to assess participants’ belief in their ability to make meaningful decisions and act effectively in their context. Example: “How much do you feel in control of the outcomes you are pursuing in your work?”\n   - **Self-Awareness**: Focus on participants’ understanding of their own motivations, strengths, and areas of growth. Example: “How clearly can you articulate your values and how they inform your work?”\n   - **Business Awareness**: Evaluate participants’ ability to identify opportunities, assess risks, and respond to challenges in their business. Example: “How well do you understand the factors influencing your business outcomes?”\n\n#### 3. **Minimal Integration into Pre/Post**\n   - In the **Pre-Assessment**, introduce **Agency**, **Self-Awareness**, and **Business Awareness** as baseline questions to understand participants’ starting points. For example:\n     - **Agency**: “How confident are you in your ability to make decisions and take actions that lead to meaningful progress?”\n     - **Self-Awareness**: “How well do you understand what drives you in your work or life?”\n     - **Business Awareness**: “How clearly do you see opportunities or challenges in your work or business?”\n   - In the **Post-Assessment**, revisit these areas to track growth:\n     - **Agency**: “Has your confidence in making meaningful decisions and acting on them increased?”\n     - **Self-Awareness**: “How has your understanding of your values and motivations evolved?”\n     - **Business Awareness**: “How has your ability to identify and act on business opportunities or challenges improved?”\n\n#### 4. **Downstream Effects**\n   - These dimensions lay the foundation for long-term outcomes:\n     - **Agency**: Leads to greater self-efficacy and initiative in participants.\n     - **Self-Awareness**: Enhances participants' ability to align their actions with their values, leading to more sustainable motivation.\n     - **Business Awareness**: Improves strategic thinking and decision-making, with direct impacts on entrepreneurial success.\n\n#### 5. **Implementation Notes**\n   - Minimal disruption to existing assessments—simply add three new questions to **Pre/Post Assessments**.\n   - Use reflections on **agency, awareness, and meaning** to tailor program feedback and future iterations.\n\n---\n\nBy focusing on these three areas, we incorporate meaningful metrics inspired by the Aliveness Advisor without significantly altering the structure of the assessment process. Let me know if you’d like me to refine this further or update the document!",

      "content": "You're thinking about this system as a dynamic, evolving process—a \"cybernetic\" system—where feedback loops guide participants in improving both awareness (or understanding) and agency. Let’s break this down further and integrate the elements of **agency**, **awareness/understanding**, and **meaning** into a coherent framework.\n\n---\n\n### **Cybernetic Framework for Self and Business Development**\n\n#### **Core Elements**\n1. **Awareness (or Understanding):**  \n   - Awareness includes knowing *what* is happening, *how* it is happening, and *why* it might be the case.  \n   - This applies to both the **self** and the **business**, and includes two sub-dimensions:\n     - **Competencies:** Skills, strengths, and capacities.\n     - **Well-being:** Mental, emotional, and physical states influencing performance.\n   - Example: \n     - For Self: “I understand my core strengths and how my energy levels influence my productivity.”  \n     - For Business: “I understand the drivers of growth and challenges affecting my enterprise.”\n\n2. **Agency:**  \n   - The ability to take meaningful, effective action based on the awareness of self and business.  \n   - Agency bridges the gap between seeing (awareness) and doing (action).  \n   - Example:  \n     - For Self: “I use my energy peaks to focus on creative tasks.”  \n     - For Business: “I’ve launched a pilot project to address a challenge I identified.”\n\n3. **Meaning:**  \n   - The \"why\" behind actions—rooted in deeper motivations, values, and purpose.  \n   - Meaning enhances intrinsic motivation, connects actions to long-term goals, and transforms tasks into pathways of fulfillment.  \n   - Example:  \n     - For Self: “I exercise daily because staying healthy helps me show up for my family.”  \n     - For Business: “We serve marginalized communities because we believe in economic justice.”\n\n---\n\n### **Awareness vs. Understanding**\n- **Awareness** is a broad recognition or noticing (e.g., \"I see that I’m procrastinating\").  \n- **Understanding** deepens awareness by uncovering patterns, connections, and causes (e.g., \"I procrastinate because I feel overwhelmed and unsure where to start\").  \n\n**Recommendation:** Use **awareness** for the initial stage (pre-assessment) and **understanding** as the deeper goal throughout the program, as participants engage with their self and business maps.\n\n---\n\n### **Maps as a Guide for Deepening Awareness/Understanding**\n- The idea of a **map** is powerful. It shows participants where they are in terms of **self-awareness** and **business awareness**, and provides a visual guide for growth.  \n- **Pre-Pre Assessment (in Bootcamp):**  \n  - Start with a broad, light-touch map. Show participants their current levels of agency, awareness, and meaning for both self and business.  \n  - Example:\n    - Self Awareness: “You rank high in well-being but low in clarity of strengths.”\n    - Business Awareness: “You have a clear value proposition but struggle with financial planning.”\n  - This creates curiosity and a foundation for deeper exploration.  \n\n- **Ongoing Mapping:**  \n  - As participants move through the program, help them \"fill in\" the map by deepening their understanding of patterns, root causes, and opportunities for growth.  \n  - Example: Add insights about \"what’s working,\" \"what’s blocked,\" and \"what actions have created change.\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Assessment Structure**\n1. **Pre-Pre Assessment (Bootcamp):**  \n   - A lightweight assessment focused on **self-awareness**, **business awareness**, and **agency**.  \n   - Designed to:\n     - Introduce participants to the map.\n     - Create curiosity and engagement.\n     - Establish a baseline for tracking growth.  \n\n2. **Pre/Post Assessment (Main Program):**  \n   - Focus on **deepening understanding** of self and business through:\n     - **Competencies:** \"What do I know and do well?\"\n     - **Well-being:** \"How am I doing overall, emotionally and physically?\"\n     - **Agency:** \"How effectively am I acting on what I see?\"\n     - **Meaning:** \"How aligned are my actions with my values and purpose?\"  \n\n---\n\n### **Where Does Meaning Come In?**\nMeaning serves as a **meta-level driver**:\n1. It informs **awareness**:  \n   - \"Why is this important to me?\" helps uncover blind spots or tensions.\n   - It helps participants prioritize areas for growth based on what they value most.  \n   - Example: “I care about innovation, but I feel stuck in repetitive admin tasks. Why am I not prioritizing creative projects?”  \n\n2. It amplifies **agency**:  \n   - Connecting actions to meaning builds intrinsic motivation and commitment.  \n   - Example: “I’m taking this risk because it aligns with my vision for community impact.”  \n\n3. It integrates **self** and **business**:  \n   - Meaning links personal motivations to professional goals, ensuring alignment between personal well-being and business success.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Conceptual Breakdown**\n| Dimension          | Self                              | Business                          |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Awareness (What, How, Why)** | Competencies: Strengths, skills<br>Well-being: Mental/emotional state | Competencies: Strategy, operations<br>Well-being: Financial health, team dynamics |\n| **Agency**          | Ability to act on personal goals | Ability to execute on business goals |\n| **Meaning**         | Alignment of actions with values | Alignment of business strategy with mission and purpose |\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. Develop a **Pre-Pre Assessment** focused on agency, self-awareness, and business awareness.\n2. Create a **map framework** to visually track growth and understanding.\n3. Use **awareness** as a starting point and guide participants toward **understanding** and **meaning** over time.  \n4. Test this framework to ensure it is engaging and easy for participants to navigate.\n\nThis approach balances minimal disruption to the program with meaningful innovation. Let me know how you'd like to refine or expand this further!",

      "content": "Here’s a structured outline for your meeting document, designed to present ideas clearly, guide discussion, and leave room for collaborative exploration of next steps. The focus will be on **introducing the concept**, **clarifying priorities**, and **identifying paths forward** for improving assessment and pre-post measures.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Purpose of the Discussion**\n- Brief statement of why you're convening the meeting:\n  - Example: “To explore how we can evolve our assessment methods, particularly pre-post measures, to better capture participant growth and program impact.”\n- Highlight the opportunity:\n  - Example: “This is a chance to deepen our understanding of agency, awareness, and meaning in both personal and business contexts.”\n\n---\n\n### **2. Current Challenges and Gaps**\n- Provide a concise overview of what's missing or unclear in the current system:\n  - **Challenge 1:** Assessments may not fully capture shifts in **agency, self-awareness, and business awareness**.\n  - **Challenge 2:** Lack of connection between assessments and long-term outcomes (e.g., downstream effects on well-being, business sustainability).\n  - **Challenge 3:** Current tools may feel disconnected from participants' sense of **meaning** or deeper motivations.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Conceptual Framework for Improvement**\n- Introduce key elements to focus on:\n  - **Agency:** Ability to act on insights and goals.\n  - **Self-Awareness:** Understanding one’s own competencies and well-being.\n  - **Business Awareness:** Understanding of business competencies and well-being.\n  - **Meaning:** Connection to values, purpose, and intrinsic motivation.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Proposed Approaches to Explore**\n#### **A. Pre-Pre Assessment**\n- Introduce the idea of a baseline map during bootcamp or early stages:\n  - What would we measure?\n    - Initial levels of agency, self-awareness, and business awareness.\n  - Example questions:\n    - **Self-Awareness:** “What are your current strengths and areas for growth?”\n    - **Business Awareness:** “What’s one key challenge your business is facing?”\n    - **Agency:** “How confident are you in taking steps toward your goals?”\n  - How could this frame the journey for participants?\n\n#### **B. Improved Pre-Post Assessment**\n- Propose integrating deeper metrics to track:\n  - Growth in **awareness**: “How has your understanding of yourself and your business evolved?”\n  - Changes in **agency**: “What actions are you now taking that you weren’t before?”\n  - Alignment with **meaning**: “How connected do you feel to your goals and values?”\n- Example post-assessment questions:\n  - “What’s a meaningful insight you’ve gained about yourself?”\n  - “What specific action(s) have you taken toward your goals?”\n  - “How has your understanding of your business strategy changed?”\n\n#### **C. Exploration of a \"Map\" Approach**\n- How could a map (visual or conceptual) help participants and facilitators see:\n  - Initial states and progress over time.\n  - Relationships between self-awareness, business awareness, agency, and meaning.\n- Questions for discussion:\n  - Should the map be simple or detailed?\n  - How can we ensure it remains actionable, not overwhelming?\n\n#### **D. Emphasizing Feedback Loops**\n- How can we incorporate reflection and iteration into assessments?\n  - Example: Regular check-ins where participants reflect on growth and revise goals.\n  - Questions:\n    - What’s the best frequency for feedback loops?\n    - How do we ensure feedback feels actionable and motivating?\n\n---\n\n### **5. Questions for the Group**\nUse these to drive the discussion:\n1. **Agency:** What indicators of agency can we measure meaningfully across self and business?\n2. **Awareness:** How can we better assess growth in understanding of both personal and business contexts?\n3. **Meaning:** Should we explicitly measure participants’ connection to meaning, or let it emerge indirectly?\n4. **Pre-Pre Assessment:** What would a lightweight baseline assessment look like, and how could it set the stage for participant engagement?\n5. **Post-Assessment:** How do we link pre-post measures to real-world impact and downstream effects?\n6. **Maps:** Is there value in creating a visual or conceptual map of growth? If so, what should it emphasize?\n\n---\n\n### **6. Next Steps**\n- Summarize how the group’s input will guide development:\n  - Example: “Following today’s discussion, we’ll refine the framework and identify specific metrics and approaches to pilot.”\n- Propose follow-up actions:\n  - Decide on metrics to test in the next iteration.\n  - Explore tools or methods for mapping participant growth.\n\n---\n\n### **Questions to Help Me Fill This Out**\n1. **Purpose:** How would you define the key goal of this meeting in one or two sentences?\n2. **Challenges:** What specific gaps or frustrations have you noticed with the current assessments?\n3. **Framework:** Are agency, self-awareness, business awareness, and meaning the right core elements, or are we missing something?\n4. **Pre-Pre Assessment:** What would you want participants to walk away with from an early baseline assessment?\n5. **Maps:** Do you envision the map as a tool for participants, facilitators, or both?\n6. **Feedback Loops:** How frequently should we check in with participants to track progress? Should these be structured or more conversational?\n\n---\n\nLet me know your thoughts or provide answers to these questions, and I’ll update the document accordingly!",

      "content": "Here’s an updated and streamlined version of the document based on your input, focusing on presenting the key priorities and framing paths forward while keeping it concise and actionable for your call. \n\n---\n\n### **Assessment Strategy: Current State and Evolution**\n\n#### **1. Purpose of the Discussion**\n- To explore how we can improve our assessment methods to better capture participant growth and program impact while meeting the needs of stakeholders, mentors, and funders.\n- To align our assessment approach with external frameworks (e.g., EntreComp) and leverage these for organizational growth opportunities (e.g., EU funding).\n- To refine the assessment process to unlock actionable insights, support participants’ personal/professional growth, and cultivate meaningful outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Current State**\n#### **Strengths of Existing Assessment Approach**\n- **Aha Moments:** Participants experience clarity and direction when they see overviews (e.g., library of activities, ECAT priority mapping).\n- **ECAT Integration:** ECAT results inform growth plans and align participants with program managers through program worksheets.\n- **Flexibility:** Existing tools and approaches adapt well to participant needs.\n\n#### **Key Challenges**\n- **Engagement with Mentors:** Mentors rarely use assessment data unless teams actively share charts during sessions.\n- **Measurement for Funders:** Funders prioritize measurable “progress” and outputs (e.g., businesses moving from prototype to revenue stage) but also value intermediate steps (e.g., strengthened strategies).\n- **Validated Metrics:** Current pre-post measures are not psychometrically validated, limiting research credibility and complicating the Dunning-Kruger effect.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Priorities**\n#### **Outcomes We Aim to Achieve**\n1. **For Participants:**\n   - Measure what matters to them (e.g., self-awareness, business awareness, agency).\n   - Provide actionable insights that unlock growth and align with personal/professional goals.\n   - Equip participants with tools and a “why” strong enough to drive their “how.”\n2. **For Mentors:**\n   - Deliver clearer, more usable assessment outputs to facilitate mentorship.\n   - Ensure mentors can easily understand participant progress and needs.\n3. **For Funders/Stakeholders:**\n   - Demonstrate participant progress through tangible outcomes (e.g., businesses moving through development stages).\n   - Align with external frameworks (e.g., EntreComp) to enhance credibility and funding potential.\n   - Leverage software to show scores and guide participants to self-serve resources.\n\n#### **Alignment with EntreComp**\n- Use EntreComp’s existing questions and categories to ensure compatibility with the framework.\n- Preserve alignment to support EU funding opportunities and program recognition.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Framing the Assessment as a Growth Tree**\nThe growth tree analogy helps visualize the process:\n1. **Fruit (Outcomes):**\n   - Tangible results participants aim for (e.g., revenue, customer growth, innovation milestones).\n   - Outputs funders/stakeholders care about (e.g., CO2 emissions prevented for green tech programs).\n2. **Branches (Cultivated Areas):**\n   - **Self-Awareness:** Understanding one’s own competencies and well-being.\n   - **Team Awareness:** Developing collaborative and team-level capacities.\n   - **Business Awareness:** Clarity on business competencies and strategies.\n3. **Roots (Foundations):**\n   - **Agency:** The ability to act on insights and take meaningful steps forward.\n   - **Meaning:** Connection to deeper motivations and values that sustain effort.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Proposed Paths Forward**\n#### **A. Pre-Pre Assessment (Bootcamp Stage)**\n- **Purpose:** Establish a baseline map early in the program to frame personal/professional growth and track progress.\n- **What to Measure:**\n  - Agency: “How confident are you in taking steps toward your goals?”\n  - Awareness: “What’s one key area of strength and one area for growth?”\n  - Meaning: “What’s your driving purpose or ‘why’ for being here?”\n- **Potential Outcome:** Create a shared understanding of participants’ starting points and aspirations.\n\n#### **B. Pre-Post Assessment Evolution**\n- Integrate **EntreComp-aligned categories** and questions to ensure consistency with external frameworks.\n- Focus on tracking progress in:\n  - **Self-Awareness:** Growth in understanding one’s strengths and development areas.\n  - **Business Awareness:** Improved strategies or business sustainability.\n  - **Agency:** Increased confidence in taking purposeful action.\n- Provide insights to:\n  - Direct participants to relevant tools/resources.\n  - Equip mentors with actionable data.\n  - Demonstrate measurable progress for funders.\n\n#### **C. Use of Software for Mapping Progress**\n- Develop tools to visually map participant progress:\n  - Allow participants to see “fruit” (tangible goals), “branches” (growth areas), and “roots” (agency, meaning).\n  - Enable mentors to view and interact with these maps for better support.\n  - Offer funders clear visualizations of progress over time.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Questions to Explore During the Meeting**\n1. **Pre-Pre Assessment:** \n   - What’s the smallest, most impactful change we could introduce to establish meaningful baselines in the bootcamp stage?\n2. **Pre-Post Measures:**\n   - How do we ensure pre-post measures track progress funders care about without overcomplicating the process?\n3. **Mentor Engagement:**\n   - What can we do to make assessment data more actionable and relevant for mentors?\n4. **Framework Alignment:**\n   - What specific elements of EntreComp should we prioritize in our assessments?\n5. **Software and Mapping:**\n   - How can we design progress maps that are useful for participants, mentors, and funders alike?\n\n---\n\n### **7. Next Steps**\n- Discuss and agree on small, impactful changes for the next program starting in a month.\n- Develop a roadmap for aligning assessments with EntreComp and other frameworks.\n- Begin piloting pre-pre assessments and progress mapping tools.\n- Gather feedback from mentors, participants, and stakeholders to refine the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **How You Can Help Me Finalize This Document**\n1. Are there any sections you’d like to expand or adjust before presenting?\n2. Should I simplify the growth tree analogy further or add more specifics?\n3. Are there additional questions you’d like to pose to the group during the meeting?\n\nLet me know, and I’ll refine this to ensure it’s ready for your call!",

To align more with the goal of our programs to develop entrepreneurial skills and mindsets and to target a more appropriate age group, we are shifting towards other assessments, particularly looking at EntreComp from the EU. While Skills Builder and EntreComp (EC) suffer from a lack of universality, the EU's resources behind EC make it compelling. \nThe EU has initiated a project called ECI, EntreComp Implementation, specifically designed to address the implementation gap. We use their implementation suggestion to focus on a subset of the EntreComp.\n\n“Recognition precedes knowledge.” \n- Axel Honneth\n\nThis guiding quote inspires the decision to develop a public learning pathway, what Bloom used to call the leaderboard, to help people recognize the learnings and select their growth paths. To do this “out loud,” we are starting to explore public badging systems that allow people to see pathways, take assessments, and earn credentials they can keep with them forever after the program. (with no development on our part). \nSee: \nEntreComp-Badges-Recognising-Entrepreneurial-Practice.pdf\nfor more information. We will explore cheap/free platforms this week to use during ACSI3.\n\nAssessment Design and Considerations\nWe are proposing assessments to help learning happen. To recognize and incentivize - rather than “detect” - as some assessments attempt to do. As Bloom, we aim to promote entrepreneurial mindsets while training entrepreneurial skills. Developing a buffet-style assessment and intervention approach helps encourage engaged self-authored minds versus a more traditional scoring approach: “You are a C, here’s how you become a B, do XYZ.”\nThus, we propose three badging levels associated with three assessment styles.\n(Explorer) Awareness: Taking the assessment without any reflection to understand where they stand (Everyone who does the mentimeter/other collaborative survey tool).\nReflection: Taking the assessment and sharing a reflection.\nValidation: Taking the assessment and sharing a link to their actual work.\n\nThey can be three separate assessments or three assessments where two questions (reflection and validation) are optional.\n\nAwareness:\nWe want people to be aware of the full extent of the competency while not overwhelming them with complexity. This short test should be fast/fun and support realizing what skills it takes to be an entrepreneur. \nThe criteria we chose for the assessment questions are:\nRelevance to Competency: Questions must directly relate to the core aspects of the competency they aim to assess.\nPractical/Fact-based: Questions that expose the underlying competency yet are written and easily answerable by yes/no questions.\nDepth of Insight: The ability of questions to elicit responses demonstrating a deep understanding and application of the competency.\nProgression and Complexity: A mix of questions ranging from basic understanding to advanced application and strategic thinking.\nClarity and Conciseness: Questions should be clear, direct, and easily understood to avoid ambiguity and ensure accurate responses.\nWe chose two question types: T/F and Likert-scale. We do not believe this is the ideal question type, yet it’s a good start and will be fun. \nThe scale-based questions have challenges; for example, some people will never put a 5, and some put 3s down without much thought. \nThe T/F based on more concrete(potentially observable) elements can help resolve this. The challenge now becomes, what if people put T all the way across? \nOne suggestion is to tell people at the start: “No one ever gets 100% taking this assessment; that would mean nothing to learn. Be honest, and let’s use this to find our learning adventure together.”\nTaking this assessment unlocks the “EntreComp Explorer” badge. \nReflection: \nThis assessment follows the same structure as the first, except rather than T/F, participants are encouraged to write reflections on the EntreComp competencies they are learning about in the program. The reflection process is where the learning from the program is deepened and owned by the learner. Participants are encouraged to identify Entrepreneurial Skills within themselves and each other. Everyone is encouraged and welcomed to badge others when they recognize someone displaying a skill. \nLearners who take the reflection are valorized by a PM(or AI engine), indicating depth of thinking, identifying growth areas, selecting growth activities, and reflecting on growth activities completed.\n\nIn this phase, PMs and learners can badge each other. \n\nValidation:\n\nValidation happens throughout the rest of the time in the program. As learners perform activities and participants create valuable content, PMs can validate their competencies with actual “portfolio pieces” that can be baked into their learning badge. \nThis means that their badge will contain evidence of the Entrepreneurial competency it indicates.\n\nThe design of the assessment is likely to be two assessments. First, a T/F exploratory assessment mapping the territory. This is followed by an assessment of optional reflection questions and places to provide evidence (Google Docs, loom videos, testimonial blocks of text from customers, etc). The evidence we can accept for each competence already has a first draft proposal in the “Assessment Task/Activity” column of the “EntreComp Observable Activities” sheet on this spreadsheet: Individual Pillar Assessments and Questions.\n\nA request: I would like this second assessment to have a new question type, one that has a ranking (move a slider from 0-5), and once the slider lands, a text field is unlocked with the number and a short text. You chose 4. Why do you think you’re a 4 in creativity? Reflect on this competency …. And then we include some reflection prompting.\n\nReasoning\nSome of the thinking behind this structure is to:\nKeep entrepreneurs in the driver's seat\nSolve the issue of “slippage” - where funders see people scoring lower after a program due to their awareness about the skill increasing.\nIncrease engagement and involvement with participants by\nHelping them see a map of the territory\nEncouraging them to recognize skills within themselves and each other\nGiving them the “power” to give informal badges, increasing the fun/gamification elements of our programs\nTo create verifiable skill badges, we can share them with our funders rather than the arbitrariness of 100 teams, which went from 4.2 to 4.3 in our assessment of a self-reported skill. \nFunders see 100 people got this badge, which you can see on bloom.pm/allbadges: \nthis badge means XYZ; \nThese are the names of the people that got this badge; \nHere is the evidence they provided that was validated by their PM (for formal badges). \nWe can even have a bloom.pm/communityBadges where people can see the informal badges.\nTo make the first assessment useful, fast, and fun to do. Creating a framing for the rest of the program.\n\nSelf Critique and Suggestions\nWhile this reasoning makes sense. I, Bilal, am still not 100% convinced that we should use EntreComp for our skills framework. \nThere are cool reasons to do so; for instance, there was a mapping from these skills to roles within the ESCO (ESCO is the multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) Framework. You can find that in this PDF: ESCO-vs-EntreComp-Annex.pdf\nFor example, EntreComp framework and jobs that are related to them.  \n\nWhile EntreComp has been out since 2016 (I think), it’s not gaining traction. It’s getting some research, but not a lot. Most of what’s happening is because the EU throws $ at it. It’s not taking off, and there’s not a lot of energy behind it. Most projects I saw developing things on/for it are dead, and their URLs are not renewed. \n\nThe EU is doubling down on these “Comps,” though. I have two new ones that I would like to explore after proposing this framework and assessment approach. One is the GreenComp, and the other is LifeComp. \nLifeComp seems to be the most likely candidate for what we initially set out to do: replace the SkillsBuilder Universal Skills framework. We decided to focus on the entrepreneurial element - yet that may overlap with our EntCap assessment, especially as this assessment goes into the more practical elements. \n\nI’d love your feedback on these critiques and thoughts on making our assessments faster, more social, useful, more verifiable, less arbitrary, less self-reported, and most importantly, fun! \n\nOne last bonus element to using EntreComp: this PDF has a nice guide and activities to develop each skill. So we quickly have some nice things for our library: \nExample for researching potential business opportunities:\n\nEntreComp-Europe-Pocket-Book-for-Aspiring-Entrepreneurs.pdf\nFrom the forward to the LifeComp PDF linked above.\n\nFor “pre-entrepreneurs,” - I believe working with things like LifeComp is important. Before you can build entrepreneurial skills, the LifeComp skills are, as the EU forward says, the baseline. They are:\nWithout some of these fundamentals, for instance, learning how to manage learning, flexibility (coachability is one of our criteria for selection), critical thinking to help with reflection and choosing a learning path, growth-mindset to make sure it all works. We may be unable to support participants in our entrepreneurial programs. \n\nHow we want to go about this is interesting. A proposal that’s coming up for me is that for LifeComp, we may need a psychometric assessment/3rd party assessment or onboarding interviews that get analyzed. This will allow us to split people in our programs into two: one that goes into the LifeComp path to learn how to learn. And the others who hit a baseline level of competence here can join us in the EntreComp path.\n\nThank you for listening to my TED talk. \n+Bilal\nAfterward.\nYou can find the Leadership for Entrepreneurship assessments below.

      "content": "Here’s a structured approach to extract **insights**, **themes**, **questions**, and **strategies** from the document to streamline your **questions doc** for the call:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insights**\n1. **Purpose of Assessments:**\n   - Assessments are tools for **recognition, reflection, and action**, not just measurement. They must incentivize learning and growth, making them valuable to participants, mentors, and funders.\n   - The **progression from awareness → reflection → validation** builds deeper engagement with competencies and fosters ownership of growth.\n\n2. **Framework Alignment:**\n   - EntreComp provides an EU-recognized structure, with added benefits like mapping to jobs (ESCO) and access to pre-built resources.\n   - LifeComp (baseline competencies) could complement EntreComp for pre-entrepreneurial participants needing foundational skills like critical thinking and flexibility.\n\n3. **Challenges with Current Assessments:**\n   - Overreliance on self-reported measures (e.g., Likert scales and T/F) lacks depth and verifiability.\n   - Misalignment between participant needs (insightful learning journey) and funder requirements (objective metrics).\n   - Lack of mentor engagement with assessment outputs.\n   - Slippage in scores due to the Dunning-Kruger effect, where increased awareness lowers perceived competence.\n\n4. **Opportunities for Innovation:**\n   - Using badges (Explorer, Reflector, Validator) for recognition can add gamification, build engagement, and make progress tangible for participants.\n   - Incorporating evidence-based validation (e.g., portfolio pieces) enhances credibility and utility for funders and stakeholders.\n   - Leveraging software tools to visualize participant progress and direct them to actionable resources improves engagement and learning.\n\n---\n\n### **Emerging Themes**\n1. **Awareness vs. Action:**\n   - Awareness assessments help participants map their competencies but must transition into actionable steps for meaningful impact.\n   - Badges can bridge this gap by rewarding participants for taking reflective and validated actions.\n\n2. **Alignment with Stakeholders:**\n   - Funders value measurable outputs, while participants need insights for personal growth. Assessments must balance both.\n\n3. **Tailored Pathways:**\n   - Differentiating participants based on their starting points (e.g., LifeComp vs. EntreComp pathways) ensures more effective learning journeys.\n\n4. **Verifiability and Credibility:**\n   - Moving beyond self-reports to evidence-based and third-party-validated assessments builds trust and value in the data.\n\n---\n\n### **Guiding Questions**\n#### **For the Assessment Design:**\n1. **Alignment and Relevance:**\n   - How can we align assessment questions with EntreComp categories while maintaining relevance for participants’ day-to-day entrepreneurial growth?\n   - Should we integrate LifeComp for participants who need foundational skill-building before entrepreneurship?\n\n2. **Participant Experience:**\n   - How can we make assessments more engaging and less intimidating for participants?\n   - What types of badges or rewards would most effectively motivate participants?\n\n3. **Data Utility:**\n   - How can we ensure assessments provide actionable insights for participants and mentors while meeting funder requirements?\n   - What data visualization or feedback mechanisms would make assessments more useful in mentorship sessions?\n\n#### **For Stakeholders and Funders:**\n1. What are the critical metrics funders want to see beyond self-reported scores? \n2. How can we better connect assessment outputs (e.g., badge achievements, portfolio evidence) to funder expectations of progress and impact?\n\n#### **For Implementation:**\n1. How can we integrate evidence-based elements (e.g., portfolio pieces, testimonials) into validation stages without overburdening participants?\n2. What’s the smallest, most impactful change we can implement for the upcoming program to test these improvements?\n\n---\n\n### **Strategies for Improvement**\n1. **Streamlining Questions:**\n   - Focus on **two key types of assessments:**\n     - **Awareness:** T/F or Likert-based quick assessments for mapping competencies.\n     - **Reflection & Validation:** Evidence-based assessments that deepen engagement.\n   - Use clear, simple instructions to prevent overthinking and score inflation.\n\n2. **Incorporating Frameworks:**\n   - Retain EntreComp as the primary framework but consider LifeComp for participants needing foundational skills. Create a pre-entrepreneurship track with LifeComp principles.\n   - Use EntreComp Implementation’s subset categories to simplify assessments while maintaining alignment with EU standards.\n\n3. **Building Engagement:**\n   - Introduce **progress badges** (Explorer, Reflector, Validator) to create tangible milestones for participants.\n   - Add **gamified elements** (e.g., progress tracking dashboards, peer-awarded badges).\n\n4. **Enhancing Data Credibility:**\n   - Incorporate prompts for participants to provide evidence for their self-assessments (e.g., short stories, screenshots, videos).\n   - Explore third-party validation options for key competencies (e.g., mentors validating portfolio pieces).\n\n5. **Piloting Small Changes:**\n   - For the next program:\n     - Simplify pre-assessments with EntreComp-aligned questions.\n     - Test a new “validation” step where participants submit one piece of evidence per competency.\n   - Observe and refine based on participant, mentor, and funder feedback.\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Document Structure for Call**\n1. **Introduction (5 min):**\n   - Purpose of the meeting.\n   - Overview of the current state and goals for improvement.\n\n2. **Key Insights and Challenges (10 min):**\n   - Strengths of existing assessments.\n   - Challenges with self-reported measures, funder alignment, and mentor engagement.\n\n3. **Emerging Opportunities (10 min):**\n   - Gamification through badges.\n   - Differentiated pathways (LifeComp vs. EntreComp).\n   - Evidence-based validation.\n\n4. **Proposed Paths Forward (20 min):**\n   - Pre-assessment updates (awareness, reflection, validation).\n   - Integration of badges and progress dashboards.\n   - Streamlined assessments aligned with EntreComp.\n\n5. **Discussion Questions (15 min):**\n   - See “Guiding Questions” section.\n\n6. **Next Steps (5 min):**\n   - Agree on priorities for immediate changes.\n   - Plan for piloting and refining new elements.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to draft a final call presentation outline or specific slide content based on this structure? Or should we focus on refining the strategies/questions further?",

Could we create a \"growth journey map\" that integrates all frameworks while keeping assessment simple?\n\n2. How might we use the badging system to solve both the Dunning-Kruger effect and the pre/post measurement challenge?\n\n3. What's the minimum viable evidence needed at each stage to make progress meaningful to all stakeholders?\n\n4. How can we maintain framework alignment (EU, EntreComp) while prioritizing user experience and engagement?\n\n5. Should we consider LifeComp as a \"roots\" assessment and EntreComp as a \"growth\" assessment in our tree metaphor?\n\nThe shift from measurement to recognition seems particularly powerful - could this help reframe the pre/post issue?\nThe three-tier approach (Awareness → Reflection → Validation) aligns well with natural program flow - how might this work in practice?\nThe relationship between LifeComp and EntreComp raises interesting questions about prerequisites - should this influence how we structure early program stages?\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these areas or explore other aspects of the synthesis?# 1.

Let's work with what you have and enhance the program dashboard approach.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\nSimplified Assessment Structure Instead of separate ECAT/PERMAH/EntreComp, create one integrated assessment with categories like:\nmarkdown\n\nCopy\n🌱 Business Foundation (ECAT core)\n- Strategy\n- Operations\n- Resources\n\n🌿 Growth Enablers (Personal + Team)\n- Leadership capacity\n- Team wellbeing\n- Learning culture\n\nEach question could follow your stage progression format:\nIdeation → Prototype → Early-Stage → Growth\nEnhanced Program Dashboard Modify your existing CSV format to include:\nmarkdown\n\nCopy\nPriority Areas (from assessment):\n- Business priority\n- Personal/team priority\n- Linked activities\n\nMonthly Tracking:\n- Power moves completed\n- Resources accessed\n- Key learnings (brief text)\n\nQuarterly Updates:\n- Stage progression\n- Priority area shifts\n- New capacities developed\nConnection Points Since you can write goals when selecting priority areas, structure these prompts to capture both business and personal elements:\nmarkdown\n\nCopy\nGoal Structure Template:\n\"We will develop [business capacity] while strengthening [personal/team capacity] through [specific activities/resources]\"\n\nExample:\n\"We will develop our customer discovery process while strengthening our team's empathy skills through user interview training and reflection sessions\"\nWould it be helpful to see a specific example of how this would look in your current program dashboard format? We could take one priority area and show how to track both business and personal growth within your existing constraints.\n\nThe key would be using the assessment categories and priority area selection to create natural connection points between business and personal growth, even without additional software features.\n\nWhat aspects of this would you like me to detail further? I can:\n\nDraft specific assessment questions that combine business and personal elements\nShow how to structure the program dashboard to track both\nCreate templates for goal-setting in your priority areasSimplification Through Integration\n\n\nThe guide emphasizes using ECAT as a core organizational development tool\nInstead of separate assessments, we could integrate key PERMAH and EntreComp elements into the ECAT framework\nGuide suggests \"identifying blind spots, providing a 360-degree perspective\"\n\n\nProgressive Learning Model\nFrom the guide:\n\n\n\"Learning happens by doing and reflecting\" (Praxis principle)\n\"1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days\" (Growth Mindset principle)\nThis could replace pre/post testing with continuous growth tracking\n\n\nReal-time Feedback Integration\nGuide mentions:\n\n\nWeekly activities with reflection\nEnd-of-month reflections\nRegular progress check-ins\nThis could help address the Dunning-Kruger effect by capturing growth as it happens\n\n\nPractical Solutions Based on Guide Principles:\n\nA. Replace multiple assessments with:\n\nCore ECAT framework\nWeekly reflection points\nMonthly development updates\nThis aligns with the guide's \"Step by Step\" principle\n\nB. Address Dunning-Kruger through:\n\nRegular mentor check-ins\nPeer learning sessions\nDocumentation of \"aha moments\"\nThis supports the guide's \"Community\" principle\n\nC. Transform pre/post into:\n\nProgressive depth mapping\nAchievement milestones\nGrowth portfolios\nThis aligns with \"Strengths Oriented\" principle\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points or explore how we might implement one of these solutions specifically? I'm particularly interested in discussing how we could integrate PERMAH and EntreComp elements into the ECAT framework while maintaining its operational effectiveness. CopyRetryBGcan you write a two pager with principles and describe the new appraoch and then critique it with 5 pointed questions ?EditI'll create a two-pager describing the new approach and then critique it.Bloom Assessment Framework: Integrated Growth ApproachClick to open documentI've created a comprehensive two-pager outlining the new assessment framework, followed by five critical questions. Looking at it from different perspectives (program manager, team member, stakeholder), I'd be particularly interested in your thoughts on:\n\nWhich aspects of the integrated framework resonate most strongly with your experience?\nDo you see any immediate challenges in implementing the progressive depth model?\nWould this approach better address the Dunning-Kruger effect you've observed?\n\nThe framework aims to solve multiple challenges simultaneously while simplifying the overall process, but I'm curious whether you think it achieves the right balance between comprehensiveness and practicality. CopyRetryBGcan you answer all the questions - particularly demonstrating program impact - reducing resources - and standardization.Also if we move wellbeing into the ECAT, how do we get the persons individual wellbeing measures as opposed to the overall assessment about th ebusiness, the ECAT measures your busness, not your personal wellbeing - maybe there's a way to change it to do... both?EditLet me address these key questions and the ECAT/wellbeing integration challenge:\n\nDemonstrating Program Impact\nInstead of relying solely on pre/post measurements, we could demonstrate impact through:\n\na) Growth Portfolio Evidence:\n\nDocumented examples of applying learning\nBefore/after business metrics tied to specific ECAT elements\nVideo testimonials capturing key transformation moments\nCase studies showing progression through depth levels\n\nb) Progressive Milestone Achievement:\nCopyLevel 1 (Awareness): \"I understand what financial planning means\"\nLevel 2 (Understanding): \"I can create basic financial projections\"\nLevel 3 (Integration): \"I'm using financial data to make decisions\"\nLevel 4 (Mastery): \"I can teach others financial planning\"\nc) Impact Triangulation:\n\nBusiness metrics (revenue, customers, etc.)\nGrowth documentation (portfolio evidence)\nExternal validation (mentor assessments, customer feedback)\n\n\nReducing Resource Requirements\nWe can actually reduce resources by:\n\n\nUsing technology for automated tracking\nIntegrating assessment into existing touchpoints\nBuilding assessment into natural program rhythms\n\nFor example:\nCopyWeekly mentor check-in → Capture growth moment\nMonthly cohort meeting → Group reflection point\nDemo day preparation → Portfolio compilation\n\nStandardization Solution\nCreate a clear rubric for each depth level:\n\nCopyAwareness:\n- Can explain the concept\n- Recognizes its importance\n- Identifies relevant examples\n\nUnderstanding:\n- Can apply to own context\n- Makes connections to other elements\n- Identifies improvement opportunities\n\nIntegration:\n- Shows consistent application\n- Measures results\n- Adapts approach based on feedback\n\nMastery:\n- Teaches others effectively\n- Creates new approaches\n- Demonstrates systemic understanding\n\nECAT and Wellbeing Integration\nYou raise an excellent point about the difference between business and personal measures. Here's a potential solution:\n\nCreate a dual-layer ECAT:Dual-Layer ECAT FrameworkClick to open diagramFor each ECAT element, we assess both:\n\nBusiness Capacity: How well the organization performs\nPersonal Capacity: How the individual is developing\n\nFor example, under \"Resource Access\":\n\nBusiness: Does the organization effectively acquire and manage resources?\nPersonal: Is the individual developing their ability to identify and secure resources?\n\nThis creates a more holistic view while maintaining distinct measures. We could structure it like:\nmarkdownCopyECAT Element: Resource Access\n\nBusiness Level:\n- Systems for resource management\n- Resource allocation efficiency\n- Resource sustainability\n\nPersonal Level:\n- Confidence in seeking resources\n- Network building capacity\n- Resource strategy skills\n\nIntegration Points:\n- How personal growth enables better business outcomes\n- How business progress supports personal development\nThis approach would:\n\nMaintain separate measures for personal and organizational growth\nShow how they influence each other\nAllow for individual tracking within team context\nProvide clearer development pathways\n\nWould this dual-layer approach help address your concern about maintaining individual wellbeing measures while integrating them into the ECAT framework? We could potentially create specific personal development indicators that parallel each ECAT business measure.Let me build on your response while incorporating the insights from that pasted text about simpler models and assessment frameworks.\nWhat I'm hearing is that, similar to how medical professionals need simple, actionable measurements they can do with pen and paper, you're looking to create something that's both meaningful and manageable. The paste.txt document actually provides a fascinating parallel - just as reducing variables can help avoid overfitting in statistical models, maybe reducing assessment complexity could help you focus on what really matters.\nLet me propose a framework based on your three key insights:\n\nFraming + Measurement Integration\nInstead of treating well-being/soft skills and business metrics as separate tracks, what if the ECAT became your \"backbone\" assessment that incorporates elements of well-being and universal competencies? Think of it like a tree:\n\n\nRoot system (well-being/PERMAH elements)\nTrunk (core business capacities)\nBranches (specific competencies)\n\n\nProgressive Depth Model\nRather than pre-post testing, what if you used what I'll call a \"deepening\" model:\n\n\nInitial ECAT assessment provides baseline\nThroughout the program, participants add layers of understanding to each element\nLike your infinity between numbers metaphor, each element could become progressively more nuanced\nThis accounts for the Dunning-Kruger effect by expecting and celebrating deeper understanding\n\nHere's a question: What if instead of measuring \"improvement,\" you measured \"depth of understanding\" in each area? This might better capture the actual growth happening.\n\nStreamlined Integration\nFor the operational side:\n\n\nKeep ECAT as core framework\nWeekly \"depth check-ins\" during mentorship (5-10 minutes)\nMonthly reflection sessions (like your Sunday PERMAH idea)\nUse qualitative data from these touchpoints to enrich quantitative baseline\n\nWould something like this address your core needs while simplifying the assessment burden? The key would be making sure each measurement serves multiple purposes - like how doctors choose vital signs that tell multiple stories about health.\nWhat aspects of this resonate with you? I'm particularly curious about whether the \"deepening\" model might better capture what you're actually trying to measure. CopyRetryBGI like the idea of having an analogy for cultivating garden or a tree and the different things that we're looking at and I'm wondering yeah this idea of like a deepening model. ECAT is the framework yeah I don't know. I'll give you some more information and maybe you can help me reflect.\n3. I think we can streamline assessments... focusing on agency, wellbeing, community closeness, power moves and coming alive, self awareness and self efficacy, etc...\n4. what if instead of a pre / post - we took a pre and then a progress towards a post where we count ahas, moments of awareness and insight, ways they changed their mind about what x category means, we measure change not an arrival.\n5. yeah, I think the metephor of a mirror for the teams might help us the most, we pick up an mirror and show them things, ask them questions, leading them, guiding them and measuring their growth this way - one question is how do we \"align with other organizations\" who use the same assessment, right now, no one else does. also - how do we utilize our software, which asks people to pick a priority area and then talk write out their learning goals inside it.\n6. we had these badges ideas in the past, although I'm not sure it's such a great idea anymore.\nyeah, i think maybe we can take a \"look inside yourself\" approach to entrepreneurial growth where we are entering the \"garden\" of their life, they bring in as much or as little information as they think is relevant and we work with them to cultivate a place of flourishing towards their goalsKey Questions to Rethink the Framework\nPurpose of Assessments\n1. What’s the ***one thing* you need these assessments to prove?\n   * Is it validating your program’s impact to funders?\n   * Coaching participants to grow?\n   * Building a research-backed methodology for entrepreneurial growth?\n2. What’s the most critical outcome to measure?\n   * Personal resilience?\n   * Professional success?\n   * A synthesis of both (e.g., how resilience drives business outcomes)?\n3. How can assessments balance rigor and simplicity?\n   * Could you streamline to one or two core assessments while still addressing your goals?\nImproving Pre-Post Dynamics\n1. How can you counteract the Dunning-Kruger effect?\n   * Could you use tiered self-assessments (e.g., confidence and competence ratings separately)?\n   * Could growth be framed as self-awareness, helping participants recognize progress in humility?\n2. Could you create moments of reflection during the program?\n   * Instead of just pre- and post-assessments, could smaller periodic check-ins (e.g., PERMA hangouts or ECAT reviews) track and celebrate growth?\nIntegration into Program Design\n1. How can assessments feel more useful to participants?\n   * Could you gamify the process, linking results to tangible rewards (e.g., unlocked library activities or grant milestones)?\n   * Could participants co-interpret results in mentoring sessions to identify growth strategies?\n2. What would it look like to integrate real-time feedback loops?\n   * Could you embed shorter, modular assessments (e.g., weekly or monthly focus on one PERMA element)?\n   * Could you use team discussions or journaling prompts to gather qualitative insights?\nStreamlining and Simplification\n1. What’s the minimum viable framework?\n   * If you keep just one assessment (e.g., ECAT), how can you integrate elements of PERMA or EntreComp without duplicating efforts?\n2. Could you redesign PERMA or EntreComp to be more actionable?\n   * For example, tying EntreComp directly to coaching goals or using PERMA to spark weekly well-being conversations.\n3. Would a new framework make sense?**\n   * Could you create an integrated framework (e.g., Flourishing Competency Map) that ties together personal, professional, and organizational growth?\n7. if we did shorter modular assessments, it could be nice, although it wouldn't be possible to do \"pre/post\" - which is why I think we really need to ask WHAT exactly are we mreasuring for?\n8. i think maybe the Minimum viable framework goes \"up another level\" and instead of measuring specific aspects we can measure things more upsetream and monitor the sepcifc aspects, this way we measure less things and use the aspects of PERMA and ECAT / etc as guides to activities, etc?\n9 . yeah, i lik entrecomp into coaching goals that makes sense and PERMAH conversations or floushing moments. maybe we need to share our \"garden\" analogy and integrate it across the boardEditYour latest input has helped crystallize something important - it seems like you're moving toward a more organic, upstream measurement approach that's less about discrete metrics and more about capturing growth and transformation. Let me propose a reframing using your garden metaphor:\nInstead of measuring individual plants (specific competencies), what if we measured the overall health of the garden through key indicators:\n\nSoil Quality (Foundational Capacity)\n\n\nSelf-awareness\nAgency\nComing alive\nWell-being\n\n\nGrowth Conditions (Environmental Factors)\n\n\nCommunity closeness\nAccess to resources\nPower moves (ability to take action)\n\n\nGarden Progress (Observable Change)\n\n\n\"Aha\" moments\nShifts in understanding\nNew growth patterns\nChanged relationships with challenges\n\nThis approach would let you:\n\nMove away from pre/post measurements toward tracking \"cultivation moments\"\nUse ECAT/PERMAH/Entrecomp frameworks as guides for activities rather than strict measurements\nCreate a more fluid assessment approach that captures transformation while it's happening\n\nHere's a key question: What if instead of measuring \"how much\" someone has grown, you measured \"how deeply\" they're engaging with their entrepreneurial journey? For example:\nCopyLevel 1: Awareness (\"I see the garden\")\nLevel 2: Understanding (\"I know what helps things grow\")\nLevel 3: Integration (\"I'm actively cultivating growth\")\nLevel 4: Mastery (\"I can help others grow\")\nThis could help address your alignment question too - rather than trying to match other organizations' metrics exactly, you could show how your \"garden health indicators\" map to traditional entrepreneurial success metrics.\nDoes this resonate with how you're thinking about evolution of the framework? I'm particularly curious about your reaction to the idea of measuring engagement depth rather than specific competency levels. CopyRetryBGYeah, although I still think that it might be nice to be able to share a methodology you know we train other accelerators as well and so is it possible to do this and train the other accelerators and can you make some artifacts diagrams graphs that talk about this think like Steve Chase or the program manager of another accelerator incubator program and critique this methodology and then ask me five questions about how to fix itEditLet me think about this from the perspective of another accelerator program manager and create some visual frameworks for discussion.Entrepreneurial Growth Garden FrameworkClick to open diagramEngagement Depth FrameworkClick to open diagramSpeaking as Steve Chase, Program Manager of TechGrowth Accelerator:\n\"While I appreciate the holistic approach of the 'garden' framework, I have several concerns about its practical implementation and scalability. Let me outline my critiques and then pose some questions:\nCritiques:\n\nMeasurement Standardization: How do we ensure consistent measurement across different mentors and programs? The subjective nature of 'aha moments' and 'growth patterns' could make it difficult to compare results across cohorts.\nInvestor Alignment: Most investors want to see concrete metrics. While personal growth is valuable, we need clear connections to business outcomes.\nTraining Complexity: Teaching other accelerators to implement this system requires them to shift their entire paradigm of assessment. That's a big ask.\nResource Intensity: Tracking individual growth journeys at this level of detail could require significant mentor time and expertise.\nValidation Challenge: Without traditional pre/post measurements, how do we validate program effectiveness to stakeholders?\n\nKey Questions for You:\n\nStandardization: How would you create a rubric or guide that allows different mentors/accelerators to consistently assess 'garden health indicators' without losing the nuance of individual journeys?\nROI Connection: Can you map specific 'garden health indicators' to traditional business success metrics? For example, how does improved 'soil quality' translate to measurable business outcomes?\nTraining Framework: What would a \"train the trainer\" program look like for this methodology? How long would it take to get another accelerator up to speed?\nResource Allocation: How much additional time/resources would accelerators need to implement this compared to traditional assessment methods? Can you quantify the difference?\nEvidence Building: Without traditional pre/post assessments, how do you propose building an evidence base that demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach to stakeholders like funders and partner organizations?\n\nWould you like to address any of these concerns first, or should we dive deeper into one of the specific questions?\"\nThis framing presents both the structured critique and opens the door for constructive dialogue about implementation. Which aspect would you like to address first? CopyRetryBGcan you attempt to answer with your best effort based on our conversation so far?EditI'll attempt to answer those questions based on our conversation and the insights you've shared:\n\nStandardization Solution:\nRather than trying to standardize the subjective elements directly, we could create a \"depth mapping\" system:\n\n\nInitial ECAT assessment provides the baseline structure\nProgress tracked through documented moments of deeper understanding in each ECAT area\nStandardized reflection prompts for mentors/coaches (e.g., \"How has your understanding of [ECAT element] evolved?\")\nEach \"level\" of understanding has clear markers:\n\nAwareness: Can explain the concept\nUnderstanding: Can identify it in their business\nIntegration: Can apply it strategically\nMastery: Can teach/guide others\n\n\n\n\nROI Connection:\nThe ECAT framework already ties directly to grant money allocation and business activities. We could enhance this by:\n\n\nTracking which \"garden health indicators\" preceded business success\nDocumenting how increased self-awareness led to better business decisions\nCreating case studies showing how flourishing entrepreneurs made better strategic choices\nUsing the \"progression\" framework to show how deeper understanding of ECAT elements correlates with business outcomes\n\n\nTraining Framework:\nA potential \"train the trainer\" program could look like:\n\n\nWeek 1: Core framework introduction and garden metaphor\nWeek 2-3: Practical application with sample cases\nWeek 4: Mentorship approach and reflection techniques\nMonth 2-3: Supervised implementation with existing cohort\nQuarterly check-ins for alignment and refinement\n\n\nResource Allocation:\nThis could actually be more efficient than current approach because:\n\n\nReplaces multiple assessments with one core framework (ECAT)\nIntegrates assessment into regular mentorship sessions\nUses weekly PERMA hangouts for group reflection\nAutomates tracking through platform where teams already document learning goals\nReduces time spent on formal pre/post testing\n\n\nEvidence Building:\nInstead of traditional pre/post measurements:\n\n\nTrack progression through understanding levels for each ECAT element\nDocument \"aha moments\" and concrete changes in behavior/strategy\nCollect stories of how deeper understanding led to better business outcomes\nUse the platform's learning goals and progress tracking\nBuild case studies showing correlation between flourishing metrics and business success\n\nThe key insight here is that by focusing on depth of understanding rather than surface-level metrics, we might actually get better data about program effectiveness while reducing assessment burden. The ECAT framework provides the structure, while the \"garden health indicators\" provide the context for growth.\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these areas? I'm particularly curious about whether the progression tracking through ECAT elements feels like it would be practical to implement. CopyRetryBGhow do we still connect the argument that a business needs to take care of personal and professional growth. Personal growth is seen in flourishing and EntreComp (soft skill) measures, and professional is seen in the ECAT (which also shows the team's aggregate score, they all do the ECAT)EditLet me approach this through the lens of how to make the connection between personal and professional growth clear and measurable.Personal-Professional Growth CycleClick to open diagramHere's how we could frame and measure this connection:\n\nCore Argument: Personal growth is not separate from professional growth - they're part of the same cycle:\n\n\nA flourishing entrepreneur makes better decisions\nBetter decisions lead to business success\nBusiness success reinforces personal flourishing\nThe cycle continues\n\n\nEvidence Chain:\n\n\nMeasure individual PERMAH + EntreComp scores\nTrack team aggregate ECAT scores\nLook for correlations between:\n\nHigh individual flourishing → Better team ECAT scores\nStrong universal skills → Better resource utilization\nTeam well-being → More effective action taking\nPersonal achievement → Organizational capacity\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement Approach:\nInstead of treating them as separate tracks, measure growth through \"resonance points\" where personal and professional development intersect:\n\n\nWhen someone reports high engagement (PERMAH), do they also show higher scores in \"taking action\" (ECAT)?\nWhen teams have strong relationships (PERMAH), do they score better in team development (ECAT)?\nWhen individuals develop universal skills (EntreComp), does this correlate with better organizational capacity (ECAT)?\n\n\nDocumentation Strategy:\n\n\nHave teams record moments where personal growth directly impacted business decisions\nTrack instances where business challenges led to personal development\nDocument how team flourishing affected organizational capacity\nNote when universal skills helped unlock new resources or opportunities\n\nWould this kind of framework help make the connection more explicit and measurable? We could potentially create a simple scoring system that looks at these intersection points rather than treating personal and professional growth as separate metrics.\nWhat do you think about using these \"resonance points\" as key indicators? This might help other accelerators see the practical value of measuring both personal and professional growth.it still doesn't distinguish between personal and organizational wellbeing in the ECAT, how can we also measure the persons individual entrecomp and wellbeing measures?\n\n\nAh, you're right - we need to maintain distinct measurements for personal development (PERMAH + EntreComp) while still connecting them to organizational development (ECAT). Let me propose a revised structure:\n\nHere's a \"Three Garden\" approach:\n\nPersonal Garden (PERMAH) Individual wellbeing measurements:\n\nCopy\n- Positive Emotions (energy level, optimism)\n- Engagement (flow, focus)\n- Relationships (support, connection)\n- Meaning (purpose, alignment)\n- Achievement (progress, growth)\n- Health (balance, resilience)\nSkills Garden (EntreComp) Individual competency tracking:\n\nCopy\n- Universal skills development\n- Leadership capabilities\n- Entrepreneurial competencies\nOrganization Garden (ECAT) Business capacity measurement:\n\nCopy\n- Strategy\n- Operations\n- Resources\n- Team development\nThen, in your software:\n\nKeep Separate Assessments\nPERMAH for personal wellbeing\nEntreComp for individual skills\nECAT for organizational capacity\nCreate Connection Points When someone takes the PERMAH or EntreComp assessments, they could indicate:\n\nCopy\nThis strength/skill helps our organization with:\n[ ] Strategy\n[ ] Operations\n[ ] Resources\n[ ] Team Development\n\nI want to develop this further to help with:\n[Free text goal setting]\nMonthly Check-ins Simple format:\n\nCopy\nPersonal Wellbeing (PERMAH):\n- What's flourishing?\n- What needs attention?\n- Support needed?\n\nSkills Development (EntreComp):\n- Key learning this month\n- Applied where?\n- Next focus area?\n\nOrganization Impact (ECAT):\n- How did personal growth support business growth?\n- Which skills were most valuable?\n- What connections do you see?\nDashboard Tracking Add columns for:\n\nCopy\n| Business Priority | Personal Priority | Skill Priority | Connections Made | Growth Evidence |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| ECAT element     | PERMAH element    | EntreComp skill| How they linked  | Impact seen     |\nThis way:\n\nIndividual measurements stay distinct\nConnections become visible\nGrowth in all areas can be tracked\nPeople can see how personal development supports organizational development\nWould this better preserve the individual nature of PERMAH and EntreComp while still showing their relationship to organizational development? We could create specific example questions if this general structure works.\n\n Copy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nIt's getting big and messy and we're trying to streamline here. Also I have a call in an hour to present not a final strategy, and a way to concieve of things so we can improve our assessment and pre-post measures. So the idea is to identify that and the questions and approaches, not a solution, can you help me identify paths forward by structuring a document that you think will help me present our thoughts in a clear way for an hour meeting? and ask me questions to help you fill it out?\n\n\nLet me help structure a document for your call that focuses on the key challenges and potential paths forward.\n\nLet me propose this structure and then ask you questions# Rethinking Our Assessment Approach\n\n## Current Challenges\n1.

      "content": "Below is an **updated meeting document** that integrates the key insights, themes, and strategies from the *EntreComp Assessment Development* document. It’s structured to help you present a clear overview in your call, while leaving space for participants to explore next steps collaboratively.\n\n---\n\n# Assessment Framework: Key Insights and Strategy\n\n## 1. **Core Themes Emerging**\n\n1. **Progressive Recognition vs. Traditional Measurement**  \n   - Shift from “detecting” skill levels to **recognizing and incentivizing** growth.  \n   - Consider a **three-tier** approach—*Awareness → Reflection → Validation*—to capture deeper engagement.  \n   - Emphasize the **growth journey** over static pre/post scores.\n\n2. **Evidence-Based Progression**  \n   - Adopt a **tiered validation** concept:  \n     1. **Self-assessment (basic awareness)**  \n     2. **Self-assessment + reflection (deeper insight)**  \n     3. **Validated evidence (practical demonstration)**  \n   - This can help address the **Dunning-Kruger effect** by rewarding deeper awareness rather than penalizing “lower” scores post-program.\n\n3. **Stakeholder Value Alignment**  \n   - **Participants:** A visible growth pathway that motivates them.  \n   - **Mentors/Program Staff:** Actionable insights to guide coaching.  \n   - **Funders:** Verifiable, standardized evidence of progress.  \n   - **Research/Partnerships:** Methodological validity, potential alignment with frameworks like **EntreComp**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Strategic Questions to Address**\n\n1. **Framework Integration**\n   - How do we maintain alignment with **EU frameworks** (EntreComp) while keeping the assessment simple?\n   - Should we introduce **LifeComp** as a “baseline” for participants needing foundational skills before tackling entrepreneurial competencies?\n\n2. **Assessment Design**\n   - **Lightweight + Meaningful**: How do we make initial assessments quick and engaging, yet substantively useful?\n   - **Reflection + Evidence**: What’s the right ratio of self-reported reflection to documented proof of growth?\n   - **Badging System**: Does gamification solve or complicate our need for data?\n\n3. **Measurement Approach**\n   - **Dunning-Kruger**: In what ways can we capture increasing self-awareness without misrepresenting “lower scores”?\n   - **Evidence Types**: Which forms of evidence (portfolio pieces, testimonials, short video demos) best demonstrate skill application?\n   - **Validation at Scale**: How do we keep it manageable for large cohorts?\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Recommended Strategy**\n\n1. **Initial Assessment (Bootcamp / Early Stage)**  \n   - A **quick, engaging baseline** focusing on awareness.  \n   - Introduce the **framework** (EntreComp, LifeComp, etc.) and help participants map current strengths/areas for growth.\n\n2. **Ongoing Documentation + Reflection**  \n   - Encourage **regular reflection prompts** and evidence capture (e.g., short journaling, weekly “aha” moments).  \n   - Create **easy paths** to share small wins or “power moves” in your software or worksheets.\n\n3. **Progress Validation**  \n   - **Milestone-based** or stage-based check-ins (e.g., monthly or quarterly).  \n   - Invite participants to add **evidence** of real-world application (portfolio items, new partnerships, lesson learned from customers).  \n   - Enable multi-stakeholder verification (mentor comments, peer acknowledgment).\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Key Considerations**\n\n1. **For Teams**\n   - Emphasize **self-direction** and a strong “why.”  \n   - Make **progress visible** through simple dashboards or badges.  \n   - Ensure each assessment yields **actionable** next steps.\n\n2. **For the Program**\n   - Balance **rigor** (funders want objective data) with **engagement** (participants need relevant insights).  \n   - Leverage existing tools (ECAT, priority-area tagging) and reframe them as part of a **progressive learning journey**.  \n   - If using **badges**, keep them simple and clearly tied to *demonstrable* growth.\n\n3. **For Stakeholders/Funders**\n   - Provide clear evidence of **progress** (before/after aggregated data or curated portfolios).  \n   - Maintain **framework alignment** (EntreComp as a recognized standard).  \n   - Demonstrate **impact** in ways that resonate with their objectives (e.g., bridging the gap from idea stage to revenue stage).\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Questions for Discussion**\n\n1. **Minimum Viable Framework**  \n   - *Which elements (ECAT, EntreComp, PERMAH) must we keep for immediate funder alignment, and which can be optional?*\n\n2. **Evidence Collection**  \n   - *What types of evidence best demonstrate progression for our stakeholders without burdening participants?*\n\n3. **Mentor Engagement**  \n   - *How can mentors more easily access and use assessment data? Would short, automated “snapshots” be enough?*\n\n4. **Tiered Approach Feasibility**  \n   - *Can we pilot the “awareness → reflection → validation” approach in one upcoming program phase and gather feedback?*\n\n5. **Alignment with Larger Ecosystem**  \n   - *Should we actively collaborate with other accelerators or pilot an “open-badges” approach for shared recognition?*\n\n---\n\n### **How to Use This Document in the Meeting**\n\n1. **Present the Core Themes** (5–10 min)  \n   - Explain the shift from traditional pre/post to a progressive, recognition-based system.\n\n2. **Pose the Strategic Questions** (10–15 min)  \n   - Invite participants to share immediate thoughts or concerns about each question.\n\n3. **Outline the Recommended Strategy** (5–10 min)  \n   - Show how “Initial Assessment → Ongoing Reflection → Progress Validation” could work in practice.\n\n4. **Discuss Key Considerations** (10–15 min)  \n   - Explore trade-offs: rigor vs. simplicity, data vs. insights, time vs. depth.\n\n5. **Dive into the **Questions for Discussion** (remaining time)  \n   - Decide on next steps and who will pilot or refine specific elements.\n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n- **Decide on Immediate Pilot**: Whether to introduce the new tiered approach in the next cohort or only in certain modules.\n- **Refine or Simplify**: Based on feedback, identify the simplest possible changes to implement quickly (e.g., adding a reflection prompt to the existing ECAT).\n- **Gather Mentor Input**: Ensure mentors know how to read and respond to assessment outputs.\n- **Evaluate**: After the pilot phase, collect data on engagement, insightfulness, and funder satisfaction for iterative improvement.\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Check**\n\n- Is there any specific stakeholder or accelerator partner who needs tailored data from this conversation?\n- Do you have examples or visuals you can share to illustrate how the new tiered approach would look in practice?\n- Are there any success stories or prototypes you can highlight to show “small changes, big impact”?\n\n---\n\nThis document should give you **just enough structure** to guide a productive meeting—introducing clear themes, open questions, and potential strategies without proposing a rigid “final solution.” Adapt or expand where needed, and feel free to slot in your own specifics (e.g., precise metrics or software screenshots).

Feel free to reorder or shorten as needed.\n\n---\n\n# Rethinking Our Assessment Approach\n\n## **1. Current Challenges**\n\n1. **Too Many Separate Assessments**  \n   - ECAT (organizational readiness), PERMAH (well-being), and EntreComp (entrepreneurial competencies) can overwhelm participants.\n\n2. **Pre/Post Measurement Issues**  \n   - **Dunning-Kruger effect**: As participants learn, they reassess their abilities, sometimes leading to “lower” post-scores.\n\n3. **Integration of Personal & Organizational Growth**  \n   - Need a clearer way to connect individual flourishing (PERMAH, soft skills) with business capacity (ECAT).\n\n4. **Data Utilization**  \n   - Mentors and funders need quick, actionable insights.  \n   - Teams want meaningful, user-friendly feedback.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Questions**\n\n1. **Personal + Organizational Growth**  \n   - *How can we measure both without burdening teams?*\n\n2. **Beyond Traditional Pre/Post**  \n   - *What alternative methods capture progress more authentically?*\n\n3. **Streamlining vs. Value**  \n   - *How do we maintain rigor, meet stakeholder needs, and keep it simple?*\n\n---\n\n## **3. Potential Paths Forward**\n\n### **Path 1: Progressive Growth Model**\n- Move from **point-in-time** measurement to **continuous journey tracking**.  \n- Focus on **“aha” moments** and real-world evidence (e.g., portfolio pieces).  \n- Integrate **personal** (PERMAH/EntreComp) and **organizational** (ECAT) growth in one framework.\n\n### **Path 2: Integrated Framework Evolution**\n- Use **ECAT** as the **core structure** but embed personal/well-being elements.  \n- Adopt a **three-tier** progression:  \n  1. **Awareness** (self-check)  \n  2. **Reflection** (insight)  \n  3. **Validation** (real proof)  \n\n### **Path 3: Simplified Assessment + Rich Documentation**\n- Reduce formal surveys; enhance **qualitative documentation** of growth.  \n- Use monthly or milestone-based reflection logs in existing software/worksheets.  \n- Focus on **quality** of insights over sheer quantity of metrics.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Core Themes Emerging**\n\n1. **From “Detecting” to “Recognizing & Incentivizing”**  \n   - Shift the lens: *not* “Are you skilled or not?” but “How have you grown since we last checked?”\n\n2. **Evidence-Based Progression**  \n   - Combine **self-assessment** + **reflection** + **practical evidence**.  \n   - Example: Teams log real actions taken, mentors validate, software tracks progress.\n\n3. **Stakeholder Alignment**  \n   - **Teams** get a clear growth pathway.  \n   - **Funders** see verifiable progress.  \n   - **Program** has a consistent framework for support.  \n   - **Research** gains more reliable data.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Key Considerations**\n\n1. **Program Goals**  \n   - **Impact demonstration** (funder metrics, research validity).  \n   - **Team development** (practical coaching).  \n   - **Participant engagement** (actionable feedback).\n\n2. **Practical Constraints**  \n   - **Current software**: limited discussion/note-taking.  \n   - **Resource limitations**: mentors can’t fill out extensive forms, participants can’t handle too many surveys.  \n   - **Program structure**: sprints/bootcamps/accelerators each have distinct timelines.\n\n3. **Next Steps**  \n   - Identify **priority path** (see Potential Paths).  \n   - Pilot small changes (e.g., an enhanced reflection step or simpler pre-post approach).  \n   - Gather feedback from mentors, teams, and funders.  \n   - **Iterate** the framework in subsequent cohorts.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Discussion Questions**\n\n1. **Which Path Resonates Most?**  \n   - *Progressive Growth*, *Integrated Framework*, or *Simplified Documentation*?\n\n2. **Critical Elements to Preserve**  \n   - *Is it essential to keep each existing assessment (ECAT, PERMAH, EntreComp) intact, or can we merge them?*\n\n3. **Balancing Rigor & Simplicity**  \n   - *Do we lean on self-assessment primarily or require more external validation?*\n\n4. **Minimum Viable Evidence**  \n   - *What’s the least we can collect while still satisfying funder/research needs?*\n\n5. **Mentor & Funder Engagement**  \n   - *How can mentors better use assessment data?  \n   - How do we show funders real progress without burying them in details?*\n\n---\n\n## **7. Visual Reference** (Optional)\n\nConsider a **“Garden” Metaphor**:\n```text\n                (Personal Growth)             (Business Growth)\n                       \\                       /\n                        \\         (Impact)    /\n                         \\         /|\\        /\n                       (Wellbeing)-(E.C.A.T)-(EntreComp)\n```\n- **Roots**: Foundational elements (self-awareness, agency).  \n- **Branches**: Evolving competencies (EntreComp, business strategy).  \n- **Fruit**: Observable results (revenue, well-being, innovation).\n\n---\n\n## **8.

The Bias-Variance Tradeoff\nThis concept explains why simpler models (with fewer variables) sometimes perform better. The tradeoff is that:\n\nHigh bias models (simpler models) make stronger assumptions about the data and might underfit.\nHigh variance models (complex models with many variables) can overfit to noise in the training data, failing to generalize well.\nA model that is too complex might capture noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on new data.\n\n2. Occam's Razor and Model Simplicity\nOccam's Razor is the principle that \"simpler explanations are more likely to be correct.\" In machine learning, this often means that models with fewer parameters are favored because they tend to be more robust and less prone to overfitting.\n3. Regularization Techniques\nRegularization methods (like Lasso and Ridge regression) deliberately penalize complexity by reducing the impact of less significant variables. Research has shown that regularization often improves model performance by effectively reducing the number of variables, leading to simpler models that generalize better.\n4. James-Stein Estimator\nThe James-Stein estimator is a famous result in statistics that demonstrates that, under certain conditions, shrinkage estimators (which \"shrink\" coefficients toward zero) can perform better than the usual maximum likelihood estimators. This idea aligns with the notion that reducing the complexity of the model (by reducing the impact of less important variables) can lead to more accurate predictions.\n5. Information Theory: Minimum Description Length (MDL) Principle\nThe MDL principle suggests that the best explanation of data is the one that leads to the smallest combined length of the description of the data and the model. In practical terms, it often leads to selecting simpler models with fewer variables.\n6. \"The Blessing of Dimensionality\" in High-Dimensional Data\nSome studies in machine learning and statistics indicate that in certain high-dimensional settings, reducing the dimensionality (or the number of variables) can actually lead to better performance. This is sometimes referred to as \"the blessing of dimensionality,\" which is a counterpoint to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" The idea is that too many dimensions can create noise and make it harder for models to identify meaningful patterns.\nIf you're looking for specific papers or sources, I can help you track down more precise references. Alternatively, if any of these ideas sound familiar, I could narrow down the search for you!\n\n12:17\n\n2/2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nit was also something about linear, working with doctors and ensuring that htey can do the calculations with paper and pencil\n12:18\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAh, it sounds like you're referring to the idea of using simple linear models or approaches that are interpretable and practical, especially in fields like medicine, where clinicians need to make decisions quickly and effectively, often without the aid of complex tools. This aligns with research advocating for simplicity in predictive models, particularly when users need to trust and understand the model.\n\nHere are some key aspects and potential research that might align with what you read:\n\n1. Linear Models in Medicine\nPaul Meehl's Work (1954): In Clinical vs. Statistical Prediction, Meehl argued that simple, linear statistical models often outperform clinicians' intuition in predictive tasks. His work showed that even basic models using a few well-chosen variables could rival or outperform complex, subjective judgments.\n2. Interpretable AI and Simplicity\nInterpretability in AI and Medicine: A common principle in medical decision-making is that predictive models should be interpretable and actionable. For example:\nA linear regression model with just a handful of variables can provide accurate predictions while remaining simple enough for clinicians to calculate or approximate without advanced tools.\nResearch has shown that even if complex machine learning models (like neural networks) are slightly more accurate, practitioners may prefer linear models because they are easier to understand and trust.\n3. Parsimony and Performance\n\"The Parsimony Principle\" in Healthcare Models: Studies show that reducing the number of variables to just the most important ones can often result in models that:\nAre easier for clinicians to use (e.g., on paper or with basic tools).\nPerform comparably or better because they avoid overfitting and reduce noise.\nOne famous example is the APACHE Score (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) used in intensive care units. It uses a manageable number of variables to predict mortality risk, balancing accuracy and usability.\n\n4. Evidence Supporting Simpler Models\nA study by G. Gigerenzer and others on \"fast-and-frugal heuristics\" shows that simple decision-making rules, using only a few key variables, can perform just as well as more complex methods in many real-world situations, including medicine.\n\nResearch in Risk Scores: Tools like the CHADS2 score (used for stroke risk in atrial fibrillation) or the TIMI risk score (used for heart attack risk) are intentionally simple and based on linear models so clinicians can use them without technology. These tools demonstrate how fewer variables and simple calculations can be clinically effective.\n\n5. Focus on Linear Models\nIn healthcare research, linear models are often favored for their:\nEase of use: Clinicians can compute them manually or with simple tools.\nTransparency: It’s easier to explain why a model produces a specific prediction.\nRobustness: Linear relationships are often good approximations for medical outcomes, where small variations in complex models may not add value.\nDoes this sound like what you were reading about? If you'd like, I can help track down papers or articles on interpretable models in healthcare or provide examples of such tools in practice!\"\"\"",

      "content": "Here’s how we could incorporate this into the document in a streamlined and purposeful way, connecting the principles and evidence to the assessment approach:\n\n---\n\n### Streamlining Assessments: Insights from Simplicity in Predictive Models\n\n1. **The Bias-Variance Tradeoff and Assessment Design**\n   - Simpler models often perform better because they avoid overfitting to noise. This aligns with our goal to simplify assessments, focusing on fewer key metrics like agency, self-awareness, and business growth.\n   - By limiting variables, we can design assessments that are more reliable, easier to administer, and meaningful for participants.\n\n2. **Occam’s Razor: Favoring Parsimonious Approaches**\n   - Borrowing from Occam's Razor, our assessment framework should prioritize simplicity by focusing on the most impactful measures. Instead of tracking an exhaustive list of variables, we can focus on actionable metrics that align with program goals (e.g., ECAT categories, PERMAH dimensions, EntreComp skills).\n\n3. **Regularization and Dimensionality Reduction**\n   - In the same way that regularization techniques improve model performance by reducing unnecessary complexity, our assessment approach can focus on refining and integrating key questions. This ensures the framework remains robust while being practical for program participants and stakeholders.\n\n4. **Lessons from Medicine: Usable, Linear Models**\n   - Similar to how simple risk scores in medicine (e.g., CHADS2, TIMI) balance usability and accuracy, our assessments should focus on interpretable, actionable outputs. For example:\n     - A straightforward ECAT-based self-assessment can provide participants with clear insights into business growth areas.\n     - Simple linear scales for personal growth (e.g., PERMAH or EntreComp measures) can guide participants without requiring excessive cognitive effort.\n\n5. **Evidence Supporting Simplicity**\n   - Research shows that simpler tools are more likely to be adopted and trusted by users. For instance, Gigerenzer’s work on heuristics demonstrates how \"fast-and-frugal\" models can perform as well as complex systems. Our assessment framework can integrate this principle by:\n     - Designing lightweight, engaging assessments that fit into existing program touchpoints (e.g., mentor sessions, team check-ins).\n     - Offering participants clear pathways to interpret and act on their results.\n\n6. **Focus on Transparency and Trust**\n   - As in healthcare, where practitioners need to trust and understand predictive models, our assessment framework must prioritize transparency. Simple scoring mechanisms and clear links between personal and business growth will help participants and stakeholders see the value of the data.\n\n---\n\n### Application to Our Assessment Framework\n\n- **Simplified Core Framework:** Combine ECAT, PERMAH, and EntreComp elements into a single, streamlined progression model. Focus on:\n  - **Key Outcomes:** Agency, self-awareness, and business outcomes.\n  - **Stages:** Awareness → Reflection → Validation.\n- **Actionable Outputs:** Design assessments that provide immediate insights (e.g., “Here’s how your self-awareness supports your team’s strategy”).\n- **Usability:** Ensure assessments are simple enough to complete on paper or with minimal digital tools.\n- **Trust and Adoption:** Use transparent scoring tied to observable progress (e.g., growth in customer understanding, team alignment, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### Discussion Questions for Today:\n1. How do we ensure simplicity without losing meaningful insights in our assessments?\n2. Could the principle of regularization (penalizing complexity) guide us in reducing the scope of assessment variables?\n3. How might transparent scoring (e.g., a single growth score) increase trust and usability for participants?\n4. What practical steps can we take to integrate simplicity into assessment design (e.g., reducing items, clear progression, intuitive scoring)?\n5. How can we communicate this simplified approach to stakeholders while still demonstrating rigor and validity?\n\n---\n\nThis addition highlights how concepts from simplicity in predictive models align with our assessment goals and provides a framework for discussion and implementation. Would you like to refine any part of this?",
