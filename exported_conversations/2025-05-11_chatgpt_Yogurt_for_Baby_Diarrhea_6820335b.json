      "content": "Yes, **yogurt is generally safe—and can even be helpful—for babies with diarrhea**, especially if they’re over 6 months old and eating solids.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n### ✅ Why yogurt can help:\n- **Probiotics**: Yogurt contains beneficial bacteria (like *Lactobacillus*) that help restore gut flora, which is often disrupted during diarrhea.\n- **Easier to digest**: The fermentation process breaks down lactose, making yogurt easier to digest than regular milk.\n- **Nutrients**: It provides protein, calcium, and hydration support.\n\n### ⚠️ What to keep in mind:\n- **Choose plain, unsweetened yogurt**: Avoid added sugars and artificial flavors, which can worsen diarrhea.\n- **Check for lactose sensitivity**: If the diarrhea is due to a temporary lactose intolerance (common after a stomach virus), start with a small amount and monitor.\n- **Avoid giving yogurt to infants under 6 months** unless specifically advised by a doctor.\n- **Greek yogurt** is a good option as it’s higher in protein and often lower in lactose.\n\nWould you like a sample diet or food suggestions for a baby with diarrhea?",

      "content": "**Chicken sausage is generally *not recommended* for babies with diarrhea**, especially if they are under 1 year old. Here's why:\n\n### ⚠️ Why it's not ideal:\n- **High in sodium**: Most sausages are heavily salted, which can dehydrate babies further—especially dangerous during diarrhea.\n- **Spices and additives**: Sausages often contain preservatives, spices, or fillers that can irritate the gut.\n- **Harder to digest**: Processed meats are more difficult for sensitive digestive systems, which is not ideal during diarrhea recovery.\n\n### ✅ Better protein options:\n- Plain, boiled or shredded **chicken breast**\n- Steamed or mashed **lentils** (for older babies)\n- Soft scrambled **eggs** (if already introduced and tolerated)\n\nIf you're trying to reintroduce proteins, start with very mild, well-cooked, and unseasoned foods.
