      "content": "Common comfrey (*Symphytum officinale*) is technically edible, but it comes with **serious cautions**.  \n\n### The caution first\n- **Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs)** in comfrey can damage the liver, especially with repeated or high consumption.\n- This is why most modern herbalists **do not recommend eating comfrey internally**—especially the roots, which have the highest PA levels.\n- External uses (poultices, salves, ointments) are generally considered safer, because little is absorbed through skin.\n\n### Historical / traditional edible uses\nBefore the PA risks were widely recognized, comfrey leaves and young shoots were eaten in small quantities:\n1. **Young spring leaves** — harvested when tender, blanched or boiled to reduce fuzziness, sometimes used like spinach in pies or fritters.\n2. **Comfrey fritters** — leaves dipped in batter and fried. This masks the hairy texture.\n3. **Soup or broth greens** — a handful of young leaves added with other greens for flavor, not as a bulk vegetable.\n4. **Flower stalks** — sometimes lightly steamed and served like asparagus.\n\n### If you still choose to try it\n- **Only harvest young leaves** before the plant flowers; older leaves are tough and more bitter.\n- **Cook, don’t eat raw** — boiling or frying improves texture but does not remove the PAs.\n- **Keep portions very small and occasional** — e.g., a leaf or two as a novelty, not a staple.\n- Avoid if you have any liver conditions, are pregnant/nursing, or plan to eat regularly.\n\nIf you want, I can give you a **safe “spring green fritter” recipe** adapted to comfrey leaves so you can try it as a one-off foraging treat without making it a habit.

Once the liquid is mostly gone, **let them sizzle in the butter** for 2–3 more minutes to get golden edges.  \n3. Taste a piece — if it’s still tender and flavorful, you’re good.  \n\nIf you just keep simmering them in water for ages, they won’t become unsafe, but they’ll get more bland and possibly rubbery.  \n\nIf you want them **juicy but flavorful**, you could also add a splash of stock, white wine, or lemon juice near the end instead of just letting the water cook away.  \n\nDo you want me to suggest a seasoning combo that will work well with both the mushrooms and your twist cheese?
