Here's a terminal command you can run to **echo out** the paths of all those files (e.g., to copy and paste or verify they exist):\n\n```bash\necho \"src/types/supabase.ts\\nsrc/hooks/useNotebook.ts\\nsrc/components/canvas/TextLayer.tsx\\nsrc/pages/notebooks/[id].tsx\\nsrc/contexts/AuthContext.tsx\"\n```\n\nIf you want to **copy all these files** into a separate folder (like for sharing or zipping), here's a command that creates a `cursive-share` folder and copies them there (adjust the `[id].tsx` path as needed):\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p cursive-share/src/{types,hooks,components/canvas,pages/notebooks,contexts} && \\\ncp src/types/supabase.ts cursive-share/src/types/ && \\\ncp src/hooks/useNotebook.ts cursive-share/src/hooks/ && \\\ncp src/components/canvas/TextLayer.tsx cursive-share/src/components/canvas/ && \\\ncp src/pages/notebooks/[id].tsx cursive-share/src/pages/notebooks/ && \\\ncp src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx cursive-share/src/contexts/\n```\n\nWould you also like a zipped version of the `cursive-share` folder?",

Add this at the end:\n\n```bash\ndone > all_files.txt\n```\n\nWould you like this formatted for Markdown or HTML instead?",
