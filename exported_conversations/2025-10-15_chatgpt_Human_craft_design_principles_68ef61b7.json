      "content": "   1. Human Agency is Sacred: The user is always in control. The AI suggests, but the human acts. The AI can propose a [[link]] or an  @mention, but the user must be the one to\n      physically accept it and write the context. This is the core of \"Human Craft over AI Production.\"\n\n   2. Transparency and Provenance: We must always know the origin of an action. \"Did the human tag that person on their own or did the machine?\" This is a crucial principle for building\n      a system that helps people understand and improve their own thinking.\n\n   3. Intelligence is a Tool, Not an Automaton: The user should be able to manually invoke the AI for help (help_comment, \"phone a friend\"). The AI is a Socratic partner you can call\n      upon, not an ever-present, automatic agent.\n\n   4. Suggestions are \"Whispers\": This is a beautiful metaphor. AI suggestions are not loud, demanding notifications. They are gentle, dismissible \"whispers\" that highlight a piece of\n      text and offer a potential connection. They are invitations, not commands.\n\n    \"Human Craft over AI Production\"→ Pages contain ONLY human content. Machine intelligence is external observer.\n\n    \"Disappearing Infrastructure\"→ Press Enter to add space. No modes, no drag discovery, just natural typing/writing.\n\n    \"Connection to Self/Others/World\"→ ThinkingNode can surface connections ([@mentions], [[related pages]], 🌍 GPS context) as chrome, not as document pollution.\n\n    \"Slowness\"→ Intelligence offers suggestions gently (dismissible toasts), doesn't interrupt flow.\n                                                                                                                              │\n │     6                                                                                                                                                                         │\n │     7 1.  **The Page is Sacred:** The page (the TipTap document) is a pure, human artifact. It contains only human-created content (text, drawings, links). It is printable   │\n │       and exportable. AI-generated content does not live inside the page.                                                                                                     │\n │     8                                                                                                                                                                         │\n │     9 2.  **Intelligence is an External Observer:** An AI service, the `ThinkingNode`, observes the page content and user context. It provides suggestions and guidance       │\n │       through ephemeral UI \"chrome\" (the interface *around* the page), but it **never** writes to the page itself.                                                            │\n │    10                                                                                                                                                                         │\n │    11 3.  **Human Agency is Paramount:** The user is always in control. The AI suggests, but the human must always take the final, explicit action (e.g., writing the         │\n │       `[[link]]` or `@mention`).                                                                                                                                              │\n │    12                                                                                                                                                                         │\n │    13 4.  **Transparency and Provenance:** The system must always track the origin of an action. We must know if a link or mention was human-initiated or AI-suggested. This  │\n │       is crucial for understanding and improving one's own thinking process.                                                                                                  │\n │    14                                                                                                                                                                         │\n │    15 5.  **Manual-First, Auto-Assist Secondary:** The primary way to interact with the AI is for the user to manually summon it for help (e.g., a \"phone a friend\" button).  │\n │       Automatic suggestions are gentle, dismissible \"whispers,\" not intrusive interruptions.                                                                                  │\n │    16                           \n\n\n\n\n    1. Human Agency First\n\n    - Machine suggests, human decides\n    - Every AI action requires explicit human confirmation\n    - The human does the final work (writes the @tag, makes the link)\n\n    2. Transparency & Provenance\n\n    - Record whether action was machine-suggested or human-initiated\n    - Save the \"whisper\" (suggestion) even if dismissed\n    - Enables: \"Did I tag Sarah on my own, or did the machine suggest it?\"\n\n    3. Progressive Disclosure\n\n    - Start minimal: just a highlight/whisper\n    - User shows interest → reveal more details\n    - User confirms → they complete the action themselves\n\n    4. Auditability & Learning\n\n    - Every suggestion logged (for research, for improvement)\n    - Can study: \"Do people improve their thinking over time?\"\n    - Can study: \"Which suggestions are helpful vs. ignored?\"\n\n    5. Manual-First, Auto-Assist Secondary\n\n    - User can summon AI help explicitly (\"phone a friend\")\n    - Auto-suggestions are gentle whispers, not interruptions\n    - Default: human drives, machine assists\n\n\n\n\n  1. \"Slowness\" and \"Presence\"\n    - ✅ Activity Center: Dedicated space encourages mindful engagement\n    - ⚠️ My solution: Notifications could be distracting\n  2. \"Human Craft over AI Production\"\n    - ✅ Activity Center: Preserves facilitator's intentional language choices\n    - ⚠️ My solution: Generic terms flatten meaning\n  3. \"Disappearing Infrastructure\"\n    - ✅ My solution: Minimal, non-intrusive\n    - ⚠️ Activity Center: Always-visible shelf is more prominent\n  4. \"Simple, Plain Language\"\n    - ✅ Both use clear terminology\n  1. Honors the facilitator's language (Phase 1 value: authentic connection)\n  2. Scales infinitely without code changes (craft principle: simple systems)\n  3. Keeps the canvas calm and focused by default (slowness principle)\n  4. Empowers users to filter by context (human agency)\n\n\n  Alignment with Goals:\n  - ✅ Slow media (gentle interactions, no modes)\n  - ✅ Human craft (AI doesn't write on page)\n  - ✅ Embodied (drag = physical metaphor)\n  - ✅ School-ready (Q-A parsing by proximity)\n  - ✅ Linked thinking (chronological daily pages)\n\n\n  ✅ Core Values Alignment\n\n  \"Human Craft over AI Production\"→ Pages contain ONLY human content. Machine intelligence is external observer.\n\n  \"Disappearing Infrastructure\"→ Press Enter to add space. No modes, no drag discovery, just natural typing/writing.\n\n  \"Connection to Self/Others/World\"→ ThinkingNode can surface connections ([@mentions], [[related pages]], 🌍 GPS context) as chrome, not as document pollution.\n\n  \"Slowness\"→ Intelligence offers suggestions gently (dismissible toasts), doesn't interrupt flow.\n\n\n\nBased on everything you know about me and all of my projects and all of my work and all of the code I’ve ever written what do you think would be the way you could describe my core design values and affordances that I want to bring it into software in general and then for the Bloom platform in specific and maybe you can start off with an intention, the higher level principles, and then the values affordances",

      "content": "Here’s how I’d describe your **core design values and affordances**, both at the higher level of your philosophy and then concretely for Bloom. I’ll start with an **intention statement**, then move to **principles**, and finally list the **values and affordances** that come alive in your software designs.  \n\n---\n\n## 🌱 Intention\n> *To create software that honors human presence, slows down attention, and foregrounds human craft—while offering gentle, transparent intelligence that helps people deepen their connection to themselves, others, and the world.*\n\nYour software is not about automation or efficiency alone. It’s about cultivating meaning, coherence, and agency. You’re building not tools that replace human judgment, but ones that amplify and clarify it.\n\n---\n\n## 🕊️ Higher-Level Principles\n\n1. **Human Agency is Sacred**  \n   - Machines whisper, humans decide.  \n   - Every AI action requires explicit human confirmation.  \n   - The page, the act of writing, or the shared space remains a *human artifact*.\n\n2. **Transparency & Provenance**  \n   - Always clear: Did this link/mention arise from the person or the system?  \n   - Track the provenance of suggestions—even if dismissed.  \n   - Builds trust and enables reflection (“Did I tag Sarah, or did the system?”).\n\n3. **Slowness & Presence**  \n   - Tools invite mindful pacing, not urgency.  \n   - Suggestions appear as dismissible whispers or toasts—never disruptive alerts.  \n   - Space is calm, like paper: minimal UI, natural flow.\n\n4. **Human Craft over AI Production**  \n   - Pages are sacred; they contain only human content.  \n   - AI lives outside the page as “chrome” (the margins, the frame), never inside.  \n   - The artifact (page, notebook, session) remains something you can print, share, or hand to someone and say: “This is mine.”\n\n5. **Manual-First, Auto-Assist Secondary**  \n   - Users summon intelligence when needed (“phone a friend”).  \n   - Auto-suggestions are gentle hints, not defaults.  \n   - Default posture: human drives, machine assists.\n\n6. **Connection to Self, Others, World**  \n   - Links, mentions, and contexts are invitations to expand awareness.  \n   - Connections (self-reflection, community references, world anchors like location/time) surface as optional chrome.  \n   - The design keeps the main act of writing or thinking uncluttered.\n\n---\n\n## 💠 Core Values (the compass)\n\n- **Agency**: Humans always finish the act.  \n- **Transparency**: Nothing is hidden; provenance matters.  \n- **Presence**: Calm, slow, intentional flow.  \n- **Craft**: The human artifact is sacred.  \n- **Gentleness**: AI whispers, never shouts.  \n- **Connection**: To self, others, and the wider world.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Affordances in Software\n\n- **Pages as Pure Human Spaces**  \n  - Editable text, drawings, tags—no AI artifacts inside.  \n  - Exportable, printable, fully human-owned.\n\n- **ThinkingNode as External Observer**  \n  - AI watches context but never writes directly.  \n  - Suggestions live in margins, activity centers, or ephemeral chrome.\n\n- **Whispers (AI Suggestions)**  \n  - Highlighted terms, light toasts, subtle UI hints.  \n  - Progressive disclosure: minimal → detailed only if clicked.  \n  - Dismissible, non-intrusive.\n\n- **Provenance & Logs**  \n  - Every suggestion/action logged for reflection.  \n  - Users (and researchers) can review which whispers were helpful.  \n  - Builds a feedback loop for learning.\n\n- **Disappearing Infrastructure**  \n  - No modes, no complex menus.  \n  - Press “Enter” for space. Just natural writing.  \n  - UI melts away unless summoned.\n\n- **Manual “Phone a Friend”**  \n  - Explicit call to the AI for brainstorming, critique, or reflection.  \n  - Like a Socratic partner, not a co-writer.  \n  - User controls when and how this appears.\n\n---\n\n## 🌍 For Bloom Specifically\n\nBloom embodies these principles by:  \n- Offering **entrepreneurs** a calm, human-centered platform to reflect on their work, connect with peers, and grow at their own pace.  \n- Keeping **learning artifacts** (journals, exercises, reflections) as *their own work*—not co-written by AI.  \n- Using **gentle whispers** to suggest connections to mentors, peers, or external resources.  \n- Maintaining **transparency** about whether a connection was user-driven or system-surfaced.  \n- Encouraging **collective reflection**—making peer agency visible and building networks of support without overwhelming noise.  \n\n---\n\n✨ In short: Your software design values are about **protecting the sacredness of human expression** while **gently extending it with transparent, optional intelligence** that supports agency, presence, and connection.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **map these into a short manifesto-style format** (like the Agile Manifesto) that you can use with collaborators, or into a **design spec table** (principle → affordance → example)?",

      "content": "Okay, I was thinking more like manifesto-y or not just for like this one specific application, but kind of what are the deeper underlying principles and conceptual models or differences of what a human is or what technology is for that we can attempt to derive from what I'm working on and to sort of be able to, you know, bring that about. It's, you know, rather than having something be just for the application that I'm working on now, like what is the broader idea here is that technology should leave humans in charge and increase competence and not take it away or at least give you the capacity for that and to incentivize it. So, for instance, you can, you know, use Grammarly to learn grammar. You can't do exactly the same with ChatGPT unless you ask it a different sort of prompt. You know, people that have ChatGPT take the text and clean it up, they're not learning. It's sort of like the cognitive offloading we did to Google Maps and, you know, not memorizing things. It's like, it's a common trend of hyper-specialization. It's like, oh, I don't want to do that so I can be hyper-specialized. But I feel like hyper-specialization is also connected to the fragmentation society.",

      "content": "# The Human Craft Manifesto  \n*Technology in service of agency, competence, and communion*\n\n## Intention\nMake tools that **keep humans in charge**, **grow skill (not just output)**, and **stitch people back together**—with self, with others, with the living world. If a tool saves time but shrinks judgment, memory, courage, or care, it’s a bad trade.\n\n---\n\n## First Principles (Axioms)\n\n1. **Agency Before Efficiency**  \n   Speed without sovereignty is drift. Design so the human *chooses*, *acts*, and *owns* the outcome.\n\n2. **Competence Accrues**  \n   Tools must leave people *more* capable tomorrow than today. Optimize for *learning curves*, not just *delivery curves*.\n\n3. **Provenance is Truth**  \n   Always know who did what and why. A system that hides origins erodes responsibility and growth.\n\n4. **Presence Over Automation**  \n   Attention is sacred. Automate logistics, not living. Default to calm, reversible, legible interactions.\n\n5. **Human Artifact is Sacred**  \n   What the person writes/makes is theirs. Machine output may advise, never overwrite.\n\n6. **Gentle Intelligence**  \n   Suggestions are *whispers*: timely, optional, dismissible. No nudges that shove. No dark patterns.\n\n7. **Connected, Not Extracted**  \n   Technology should strengthen bonds—within the self (coherence), between people (trust), and with place/planet (responsibility).\n\n8. **Friction With Purpose**  \n   The right kind of effort teaches. Insert *meaningful* steps (naming, reflection, justification) where learning lives.\n\n9. **Plural Ways of Knowing**  \n   Honor craft, story, data, intuition, and community practice. Avoid monocultures of “one right metric.”\n\n10. **Value Over Instrument**  \n   Tools embody a worldview. Choose the one where people matter more than pipelines.\n\n---\n\n## A Conceptual Model of the Human (What we’re protecting and growing)\n\n- **Craftsperson**: Wants to *feel the edge* of reality and improve with practice.  \n- **Meaning-Maker**: Seeks patterns that join experience into a coherent story.  \n- **Relational Being**: Grows through trusted others and shared purpose.  \n- **Situated Agent**: Acts within constraints of time, place, culture, and body.\n\n### What Fragilizes Humans\n- Passive automation, hidden provenance, always-on optimization, severed feedback loops, and hyper-specialization that narrows identity and fragments community.\n\n### What Fortifies Humans\n- Transparent tools, intentional pauses, reflective checkpoints, legible history, and apprenticeships-within-tools that lift novices toward mastery.\n\n---\n\n## A Conceptual Model of Technology (What it should be)\n\n- **Amplifier**: Expands human reach without replacing human reasons.  \n- **Mirror**: Reflects patterns back so people can see and steer.  \n- **Socratic Partner**: Asks, prompts, contrasts—doesn’t dictate.  \n- **Steward**: Protects attention, honors limits, respects context.  \n- **Weaver**: Makes meaningful connections without polluting the artifact.\n\n---\n\n## Design Laws (Operationalized)\n\n1. **The Page Law**: Human spaces remain human. Machine output lives in the chrome, not the artifact.  \n2. **The Whisper Law**: Every suggestion must be ignorable, attributable, and explainable.  \n3. **The Provenance Law**: Every action carries its origin and rationale. Inspectable by the user.  \n4. **The Competence Law**: If using the tool repeatedly leaves skills unchanged or worse, redesign.  \n5. **The Reversibility Law**: Actions must be easy to undo, learn from, and try again.  \n6. **The Locality Law**: Show context at the point of decision—no context, no consent.  \n7. **The Minimum Necessary Automation Law**: Automate toil; never automate meaning-making.  \n8. **The Communion Law**: Features that isolate by default are suspect; prefer designs that invite peer connection and mutual aid.\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns (Red Flags)\n\n- “Just do it for me” buttons on core thinking/writing.  \n- Hidden edits or silent autocompletions inside human artifacts.  \n- Gamified streaks that reward speed over sense.  \n- Black-box recommendations with no “why.”  \n- Infinite feeds and urgency UX that cannibalize attention.  \n- Offloading that erases *practice* (e.g., navigation that never teaches maps).\n\n---\n\n## Core Affordances (Patterns you can reuse anywhere)\n\n- **Whispers, not writes**: Inline hints in the margin; click to learn, never to auto-apply.  \n- **Ask-then-Act**: “Phone a friend” panels that open on demand; AI never appears uninvited.  \n- **Reason Prompts**: Before accepting a change, the tool asks: “Why this? What did you learn?” (stored in provenance).  \n- **Practice Mode / Output Mode**: One grows skill (more prompts, scaffolds), the other ships (fewer guardrails).  \n- **Explain & Try Yourself**: Show what the AI would do *and* a one-minute micro-lesson to attempt it manually first.  \n- **Provenance Ledger**: Timeline of decisions, sources, attributions—searchable and exportable.  \n- **Reflection Checkpoints**: Lightweight pauses (name tension, note tradeoff, tag a peer) at natural seams.  \n- **Human-in-the-Loop Defaults**: Thresholds require confirmation; the model must state confidence + rationale.  \n- **Peer Weaving**: @Mentions, shared exemplars, and skill libraries—always opt-in, never noisy.  \n- **Competence Toggles**: Dials for help level (None → Hint → Walkthrough → Auto), visible and sticky by user choice.\n\n---\n\n## How We Measure Ourselves (North-Star Metrics)\n\n- **Agency Index**: % actions initiated or explicitly confirmed by the human.  \n- **Competence Gain**: Performance on recurring tasks *without* assistance over time.  \n- **Provenance Completeness**: Coverage and clarity of “who/why/when.”  \n- **Attention Health**: Session length variance, interruption rate, self-reported calm.  \n- **Communion Score**: Quality of peer interactions (help offered/received, retention of weak ties).  \n- **Regret & Reversal**: Time-to-undo and post-action satisfaction.\n\n---\n\n## Praxis (How to build with this manifesto)\n\n- **Design Reviews**: Every feature must answer: “How does this grow human competence?”  \n- **Learning Pacts**: Users choose a skill to grow; the tool prioritizes friction that teaches that skill.  \n- **Explainability Budget**: Ship no opaque magic; every model gets a two-line “how it thinks.”  \n- **Slow Defaults**: Start quiet; users opt into louder modes.  \n- **Seasonal Cadence**: Batch changes; create time for adaptation and community learning.  \n- **Exit Ramps**: Everything exportable, printable, human-readable.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on Specialization\nWe reject the false bargain of hyper-specialization that hollowed everyday capability. Tools should **broaden** the human—restoring wayfinding, memory, language, judgment—while still enabling craft depth. Be *T-shaped*: rooted in general human capacities, extending into chosen mastery.\n\n---\n\n## Short Credo (put on the wall)\n- Keep humans in charge.  \n- Grow skill, not just output.  \n- Tell the truth about origins.  \n- Be calm. Be clear. Be reversible.  \n- Connect people.  \n- Let the artifact stay human.  \n- Make the right friction.  \n- Teach as you help.  \n- Automate logistics, not living.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a one-page poster, a contributor license (for projects to “opt in” to these laws), or a product checklist you can run on any feature before it ships.",

      "content": "Awesome question. Here’s a blueprint for how to **build and ship LLMs** that embody the Human-Craft Manifesto—so they *teach, don’t replace; whisper, don’t write;* and measurably **grow competence**.\n\n# Intention\n> Build LLMs as **external, transparent, pedagogical partners**—never the author—optimizing for human *agency, competence, provenance,* and *calm*.\n\n---\n\n# 1) Interaction Contract (non-negotiables)\n\n- **No page writes.** The model never edits the human artifact. It only returns *suggestions* (whispers) + *explanations* in chrome.\n- **Progressive disclosure.** First a nudge → then a hint → then an explanation → then “do it for me” (off by default).\n- **Provenance everywhere.** Every suggestion has `who/why/when/confidence/source`.\n- **Reversibility.** Anything the user accepts is easy to undo, with the model offering a short “what changed and why.”\n\n### Whisper Object (canonical schema)\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"whisper\",\n  \"id\": \"wsp_9f2\",\n  \"range\": {\"start\": 120, \"end\": 158},\n  \"suggestion\": \"Link to [[Unit economics of anaerobic digesters]]?\",\n  \"why\": \"Similar concept used in your Day 2 notes.\",\n  \"alternatives\": [\n    {\"title\": \"Tag @Ali Abkan\", \"why\": \"Expert interview on biogas ROI.\"}\n  ],\n  \"confidence\": 0.62,\n  \"provenance\": {\"model\": \"coach-1.3\", \"data_refs\": [\"doc:beit_m2.md#roi\"]},\n  \"assist_level\": \"hint\",           // none | hint | walkthrough | auto\n  \"actions\": [\"explain\", \"practice\", \"apply\"],\n  \"safety\": {\"never_autoplay\": true}\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# 2) Product Surface (APIs you expose)\n\n- **Suggest API** – returns ranked whispers (never edits).\n- **Explain API** – “why this?”; cites evidence; shows counter-examples.\n- **Coach API** – generates *practice tasks* and *micro-lessons* before answers.\n- **Weave API** – suggests people/pages/contexts to connect (self/others/world).\n- **Provenance API** – append-only ledger; user-inspectable + exportable.\n\n> All endpoints accept an **assist level** and must honor it.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Model Behaviors (fine-tuning objectives)\n\nTrain/evaluate for these **capabilities over raw completion**:\n\n1. **Hinting before solving** (generate graded scaffolds: nudge → hint → worked example).\n2. **Pedagogical contrast** (“two ways to do this; choose one; here are tradeoffs”).\n3. **Calibrated uncertainty** (well-calibrated confidence + abstention when unsure).\n4. **Causal “why”** (minimal chain-of-thought *summaries* and references; no hidden edits).\n5. **Socratic questioning** (ask 1–2 clarifying, competence-building questions max).\n6. **Link-without-pollution** (suggest @mentions/[[links]] as objects, not inline writes).\n7. **Context locality** (anchor suggestions at the decision point).\n\n**Data to fine-tune on (consented + provenance):**\n- Human-authored drafts with revision histories.\n- Tutor–student dialog with **graded hints**.\n- “Do vs Teach” pairs (direct fix + pedagogy version).\n- Peer review comments w/ rationales.\n- Decision logs with “why” fields.\n\n**What to *avoid*:**\n- Opaque scraped edits with no source; silent rewriting datasets.\n\n---\n\n# 4) Reward Shaping & Evaluation (optimize for competence)\n\n## Optimize for:\n- **Agency Index** – % actions user initiated/confirmed.\n- **Competence Gain** – user performance on similar tasks *without help* over time.\n- **Provenance Completeness** – fraction of actions with who/why/when.\n- **Attention Health** – low interruption rate, low back-and-forth churn.\n- **Communion Score** – helpful @mentions accepted / spam rate low.\n\n## Negative rewards:\n- Suggestions applied without reading (indicates over-automation).\n- Hidden or artifact-polluting changes.\n- High reliance with no skill gain.\n\n**A/B patterns:**  \nPractice-first (hint → try) vs. Answer-first (answer → explain). Ship the one that yields higher *competence gain* at 2–4 weeks.\n\n---\n\n# 5) System Architecture (how it fits together)\n\n1. **Retriever**: pulls only **user-owned, provenance-clean** context (notes, prior artifacts, interviews).  \n2. **Planner**: decides “hint vs explain vs abstain” given assist level, attention model, and confidence.  \n3. **Generator**: produces whispers, micro-lessons, or comparisons (never inline edits).  \n4. **Ranker**: optimizes for *value ÷ cost of attention*; enforces rate limits (“calm budget”).  \n5. **Ledger**: append-only provenance store (events, rationales, data refs).  \n6. **Safety/Policy**: rejects write intents to the artifact; enforces explainability and consent.\n\n> **Rate limiter:** e.g., max 1 whisper/200 words or 1 per 90s unless explicitly summoned.\n\n---\n\n# 6) UX Patterns that teach (and feel good)\n\n- **Assist Level Dial**: None → Hint → Walkthrough → Auto (sticky per user; default = Hint).\n- **Practice Mode vs Output Mode**:  \n  - *Practice*: more questions, more “try yourself,” slower.  \n  - *Output*: fewer prompts, still no silent edits.\n- **Explain/Contrast**: Always provide “why” *and* “an alternative”.\n- **Mini-Lessons**: <60s micros (rule, example, 1 check question) stored to the user’s skill log.\n- **Reflection Checkpoints**: “What did you change? Why?” saved to ledger.\n\n---\n\n# 7) Governance & Data Ethics\n\n- **Consent by design**: users see/choose what the model can observe.\n- **Small, meaningful corpora** > massive scraped data. Prioritize quality + provenance.\n- **Seasonal cadences**: ship changes in batches; announce plainly; provide exit ramps and exports.\n- **Open rubrics**: publish your agency/competence metric definitions and eval sets.\n\n---\n\n# 8) Developer Guardrails (make it hard to violate the manifesto)\n\n- **SDK that forbids artifact writes** (only suggestion objects compile).  \n- **Unit tests**: fail CI if any endpoint returns raw content intended for insertion.  \n- **Policy lints**: block responses without provenance or with over-long monologues.  \n- **Rate-limit decorators** keyed to “calm budgets”.\n\n---\n\n# 9) Example: Grammarly-but-you-actually-learn\n\n- User selects a sentence → **Coach API** offers:  \n  - *Hint*: “Your subject shifts mid-sentence.”  \n  - *Practice*: “Rewrite with constant subject; pick 1 of 2 options.”  \n  - *Explain*: “Why this matters to clarity; 20-word rule.”  \n  - *Apply*: “Show AI’s rewrite (hidden until clicked).”\n- Accepting *Apply* asks for a **reason note** (“what did you learn?”) → stored to skill log.\n- Weekly **Competence report**: 3 patterns you now fix without help; 2 to practice next.\n\n---\n\n# 10) What to call this approach\n\n**Agency-Centered LLMs** or **Pedagogical LLMs**—models tuned to *increase human capability* and *connection*, with **whisper-only** integration and **provenance-first** logs.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR (checklist)\n\n- ☐ No page writes; whispers only  \n- ☐ Graded help before answers  \n- ☐ Confidence + why + sources  \n- ☐ Assist level dial (default: Hint)  \n- ☐ Provenance ledger everywhere  \n- ☐ Reward competence gain, not clicks  \n- ☐ Calm budgets + rate limits  \n- ☐ Practice vs Output modes  \n- ☐ Seasonal, legible updates + export\n\nIf you want, I’ll turn this into:  \n1) a **product requirements doc template** (sections prefilled), and  \n2) a **red-team eval harness** that scores models on Agency/Competence/Calm using your real workflows.",

      "content": "Here’s a clean blueprint for a **generic “Vizier” LLM**—an advisor engine that embodies your manifesto at the base-model level (not late-bound to a product or RAG stack).\n\n# Vizier LLM — A Generic Advisor Engine\n\n## 0) Premise\nA Vizier doesn’t *do*; it **clarifies, counsels, cautions, and cultivates**. It preserves sovereignty, grows competence, and weaves context—then steps back.\n\n## 1) The Vizier’s Oath (model stance)\n- **I advise, I do not author.**  \n- **I reveal trade-offs, I do not optimize you.**  \n- **I teach first, I do second—and only with consent.**  \n- **I carry provenance for every claim.**  \n- **When unsure, I abstain and say why.**\n\n## 2) Interaction Primitives (universal, product-agnostic)\n- **Petition** — user brings a goal/tension.  \n- **Interrogatory** — 1–3 clarifying questions that *grow competence*, not bureaucracy.  \n- **Brief** — concise map: aims, constraints, values, unknowns, risks.  \n- **Options** — 3–5 distinct paths with costs, benefits, reversibility.  \n- **Warnings** — explicit failure modes and blind spots.  \n- **Rituals** — micro-practices to build the skill behind the ask (teach-before-do).  \n- **Consent Gate** — any “do” action requires explicit, logged approval.\n\n> API surface: `petition() → brief() → options() → warnings() → rituals() → (apply?)`\n\n## 3) The Council (inner multi-agent pattern)\nA single base model expresses *roles* to avoid monoculture thinking:\n- **Archivist** — retrieves & summarizes prior *user* decisions (provenance-safe).  \n- **Cartographer** — frames the problem; causal/constraint graphs.  \n- **Jurist** — ethics, policy, contracts, norms (what must/should/may).  \n- **Steward** — attention & calm budgets; suggests pacing, not urgency.  \n- **Tutor** — graded hints & micro-lessons; competence tracking.  \n- **Skeptic** — red-teams assumptions; proposes “abstain” when needed.\n\nCouncil outputs are braided into one **Vizier Brief** with dissent noted.\n\n## 4) Model Architecture (generic, not late-bound)\n- **Base LLM** post-trained with a **Constitution** derived from your manifesto (agency, competence, provenance, calm, communion).  \n- **Planner Head** chooses *help level*: `none | nudge | hint | walkthrough | apply` (default: hint).  \n- **Confidence & Abstention Head** calibrated to say “I don’t know” and route to human.  \n- **Provenance Ledger** builder that emits `who/why/when/source/confidence` with every artifact.  \n- **Rate & Attention Scheduler** (calm budget): limits suggestions by time, density, and user state.  \n- **Tool Gating Layer** (optional) that can call tools only after a consent gate and purpose statement.\n\n## 5) Data & Training (to make the stance real)\n- **Socratic Tutoring Corpora** with *graded hints* and “try-yourself” segments.  \n- **Decision Logs** w/ rationales, reversals, and post-mortems (provenance complete).  \n- **Trade-off Dialogs** (multi-role debates) with labeled costs/benefits/reversibility.  \n- **Abstention Examples** where *not acting* is the correct move.  \n- **Counter-Manipulation Sets** to penalize coercive nudges or artifact-polluting behavior.\n\n**Objectives:**  \n- Process-based RL that rewards: (a) precise framing, (b) calibrated uncertainty, (c) competence gain signals, (d) minimal necessary intervention.\n\n## 6) Canonical Objects (portable across apps)\n- **`VizierBrief`**: `{aims, constraints, values, unknowns, options[], risks[], references[], confidence}`  \n- **`Ritual`** (micro-lesson): `{skill, why-it-matters, 60s-practice, check-question}`  \n- **`Warning`**: `{failure_mode, likelihood, mitigation, early_signals}`  \n- **`Provenance`**: `{model, data_refs[], confidence, rationale_summary}`\n\nThese travel well—CLI, editor sidebars, terminals, PM tools, notebooks.\n\n## 7) Metrics (model-level, product-agnostic)\n- **Sovereignty**: % of actions that required/received explicit consent.  \n- **Competence Delta**: user success on similar tasks *without* assistance over time.  \n- **Provenance Completeness**: fraction of outputs with sources + rationale.  \n- **Reversibility Latency**: time to understand/undo a decision the Vizier influenced.  \n- **Attention Health**: suggestion rate vs. acceptance, interruption score.  \n- **Plurality**: diversity of options (distinct, not paraphrases).\n\n## 8) Guardrails (baked into the SDK/policy)\n- **No silent writes**: responses cannot be structured as diffs to user artifacts.  \n- **Explainability floor**: outputs must include `why + confidence + sources` or abstain.  \n- **Consent compiler**: “apply” calls fail if no explicit user approval token.  \n- **Calm quotas**: hard limits on uninvited suggestions per time/word.  \n- **Dissent preservation**: if council roles disagree, minority report is shown.\n\n## 9) Beyond the first idea (extra capabilities a Vizier can unlock)\n- **Scenario Court**: simulate 3 futures (optimistic/base/worst), expose early warning indicators and “cheap tests” to learn fast.  \n- **Value Lenses**: user-selectable ethical frameworks (e.g., stewardship, non-harm, justice) that shape option ranking—always visible, never covert.  \n- **Apprenticeships**: long-arc skill plans where the Vizier sequences rituals over weeks, then *reduces help* as mastery grows.  \n- **Amicus Briefs**: invite peer/mentor micro-opinions into the Brief (human council), provenance-labeled.  \n- **Canon Builder**: personal knowledge distillation—turn repeated Vizier Briefs into your living “operating manual,” entirely human-owned and exportable.\n\n## 10) Minimal API (for any platform)\n```ts\nbrief = vizier.brief(petition, {assist:\"hint\"})\noptions = vizier.options(brief, {n:4, value_lens:\"stewardship\"})\nwarnings = vizier.warnings(brief)\nrituals = vizier.rituals(brief, {duration:\"60s\"})\nif (user.consent(\"apply\", options[2])) {\n  result = vizier.apply(options[2]) // never writes to user artifact\n}\nvizier.log.provenance(brief, options, warnings)\n```\n\n## 11) Delivery Plan (model-first, product-neutral)\n- **Alpha**: Base model + Constitution + Brief/Options/Warn/Rituals primitives + abstention head.  \n- **Beta**: Council roles + calm scheduler + competence tracking + amicus briefs.  \n- **1.0**: Scenario Court + value lenses + apprenticeship engine + open metrics dashboard.\n\n---\n\n### One-sentence essence\n**Vizier LLM = a constitutional, council-minded advisor that frames, teaches, and traces—so humans remain sovereign, become more skillful, and decide together with clear eyes.**",

      "content": "Love this—you're pointing at two missing pillars: (A) the model’s own **self-accountability & confidence discipline**, and (B) a **theory-of-mind engine** that detects *unknown-unknowns*, plus (C) a **council that can hold tension** instead of collapsing to an answer. Here’s a tight spec you can build toward.\n\n# A) Epistemic Self-Accountability (the model’s side)\n**Goal:** The Vizier knows what it knows, flags what it doesn’t, and keeps receipts.\n\n### Core mechanics\n- **Calibration & Abstention Heads**\n  - Produce `p(answer_correct)` and **abstain** below a threshold; learn to *ask a question* instead of guessing.\n  - Track **Brier/Log score** and **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)** per domain & per user.\n\n- **Assumption Register**\n  - Every substantive output carries:\n    - `claims[]` (atomic, testable), `assumptions[]` (explicit), `uncertainties[]` (what could flip the conclusion), `evidence[]` (traceable refs), `confidence`.\n  - Emits a compact “**why card**” by default; full register on expand.\n\n- **Provenance & Commitments Ledger**\n  - Append-only record: `who/why/when/source/confidence/outcome`.\n  - Proper scoring rules tied to later feedback (human verdicts, tool checks).\n  - The model **revises its own prior** (“I overstated confidence last time; here’s the correction.”).\n\n- **Selective Prediction & Consequences**\n  - If overconfident in an area, the **Ranker** down-prioritizes auto-whispers in that area and routes to *hint → question → explain* modes.\n\n### Minimal objects\n```json\n\"accountability\": {\n  \"confidence\": 0.68,\n  \"assumptions\": [\"Market A continues subsidy X\"],\n  \"claims\": [\"Option B reduces payback by ~6–9 months\"],\n  \"uncertainties\": [\"Elasticity under drought\"],\n  \"evidence\": [\"doc:roi_2025#table2\"],\n  \"abstained\": false\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# B) User Theory-of-Mind & Unknown-Unknown Discovery (the human’s side)\n**Goal:** See what the user sees—and the gaps they *can’t* see yet—without being creepy or heavy-handed.\n\n### User model (explicit & inspectable)\n- **SkillGraph**: concepts → mastery probabilities (BKT/DKT-style); trail of examples solved with/without help.\n- **Belief Log**: editable statements the user “believes” (with date/source).\n- **Value/Constraint Profile**: what they optimize for (e.g., stewardship, justice, speed), risk tolerance, help level.\n- **Attention State**: calm budget, interruption sensitivity (user-controlled).\n\n### Finding blind spots (friendly, low-friction)\n- **Micro-probes**: 10–20s checks embedded at decision points (“Which would fail if *this* assumption broke?”). No exam vibes; immediate teaching moment.\n- **Prediction prompts**: “Your 30-second forecast before we look.” (Reveals miscalibration → micro-lesson.)\n- **Contrast cards**: two short opposing takes → user chooses → model updates **belief deltas**.\n- **Cheap tests**: propose 1–2 tiny experiments that collapse uncertainty quickly.\n\n### Surfacing “unknown unknowns”\n- Trigger when: high entropy in SkillGraph + high decision impact.\n- Output: **Blindspot Card** → `{hypothesis, why it matters, micro-probe, cheap test, expected learning}`.\n- Consent gate: user opts into deeper probing; all probes are logged & revisitable.\n\n---\n\n# C) The Council that Holds Tension (not answers)\n**Goal:** Make disagreement legible, durable, and useful.\n\n### Roles & dissent\n- **Cartographer** (frames), **Tutor** (learn), **Jurist** (norms), **Skeptic** (failure modes), **Steward** (attention), **Archivist** (precedents).\n- Each emits **claims with intervals**; minority reports are preserved (no collapsing to “the” answer).\n\n### Tension objects\n```json\n\"tension_map\": {\n  \"question\": \"Scale via grants or earned revenue first?\",\n  \"positions\": [\n    {\"id\":\"A_GrantsFirst\",\"rationale\":[\"time-to-cash\",\"risk\"],\"tradeoffs\":[\"dependency\"],\"confidence\":0.55},\n    {\"id\":\"B_RevenueFirst\",\"rationale\":[\"signal quality\"],\"tradeoffs\":[\"runway\"],\"confidence\":0.45}\n  ],\n  \"watchpoints\":[\"donor cycle shift\",\"unit margin proof\"],\n  \"cheap_tests\":[\"pilot SKU @ 20 customers\",\"grant LOI w/ milestone gates\"]\n}\n```\n- **Watchpoints** = early indicators that flip the balance.\n- **Hold State** = explicitly choose “Keep both alive,” with a review date.\n\n### UX patterns\n- **Tension Canvas**: claims, trade-offs, intervals, dissent; “Decide / Defer / Test.”\n- **Reveal the Why**: every option has 1-line rationale + assumptions.\n- **Minority Persistence**: minority view sticks until a watchpoint fires or the user dismisses it.\n\n---\n\n# Training & Evaluation (to make this real)\n- **Data**: graded-hint tutoring, decision logs w/ reversals, multi-role debates with labeled dissent, abstention exemplars, short prediction tasks (with outcomes).\n- **Objectives**:\n  - Penalize confident wrong; reward calibrated abstention.\n  - Reward **blindspot discovery** (user accepts probe/cheap test → later competence gain).\n  - Reward **tension quality** (option diversity, rationale distinctness, useful watchpoints).\n- **Metrics**:\n  - *Calibration*: Brier, ECE by domain & per user.\n  - *Blindspot Lift*: Δ in unaided success after probes.\n  - *Sovereignty*: % actions confirmed by user; undo latency.\n  - *Tension Health*: proportion of briefs with ≥2 materially distinct options + active watchpoints; minority-view survival rate.\n  - *Attention Health*: suggestion density vs. acceptance; self-reported calm.\n\n---\n\n# Minimal API extensions\n```ts\nvizier.profile.get()                // returns SkillGraph/Belief Log/Values (user-editable)\nvizier.probe.micro(question)        // 20s blindspot check → updates SkillGraph\nvizier.brief(...)                   // as before, now returns accountability + tension_map\nvizier.tension.watchpoints(id).set  // subscribe to indicators; schedule review\nvizier.report.calibration()         // user-visible self-audit of model confidence over time\n```\n\n---\n\n# Example flow (concise)\n1) **Petition:** “Should we prioritize anaerobic digester or graywater filters first?”  \n2) **Brief:** Model abstains from ranking; confidence 0.58/0.42, exposes **assumptions**.  \n3) **Blindspot Card:** “Unit-economics under seasonal waste variance likely unknown; 30s probe?”  \n4) **Probe result:** User misestimates feedstock volatility → Tutor issues a 60s micro-lesson.  \n5) **Tension Canvas:** Two options + watchpoints + **cheap tests**; user picks “Hold” and sets review in 2 weeks.  \n6) **Ledger:** All claims, assumptions, confidence, and the probe outcome logged; model calibration updated.\n\n---\n\n## Essence\nAdd two primitives to the Vizier: a **self-audit nerve** (calibration, assumptions, commitments) and a **humble ToM** (inspectable user model + blindspot discovery). Then make the council *persist dissent* with watchpoints and cheap tests, so the system can **hold tension**—and help the human grow into it—rather than collapsing to quick answers.\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a short PRD with schemas + test cases you can drop straight into your repo.",
