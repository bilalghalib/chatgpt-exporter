      "content": "Whole wheat and bulgur are not exactly the same, though they are related. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **Whole wheat** refers to the intact, unprocessed wheat kernel that contains all three parts: the bran, germ, and endosperm. It can be used in various forms, like flour or cooked as a grain.\n\n- **Bulgur** is a specific preparation of wheat. It's made by parboiling, drying, and then cracking whole wheat kernels into smaller pieces. This process makes bulgur quicker to cook than whole wheat.\n\nIn short, **bulgur** is a type of processed wheat, while **whole wheat** can refer to the entire grain before any processing. Both come from the same wheat plant but have different uses and cooking properties.",
