Early morning light poured through our windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, war raging in Palestine, the future uncertain—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This moment is enough for a life.\nThat quiet morning stood in stark contrast to my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one seemed to value a simple life, and it seemed no one had babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought of the human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in high school. In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than the warning it should have been. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it “worked.”\n\nIn my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test. Yet, everything I learned while crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, told me the world was understandable, malleable, and ours to shape.\n\nMany of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance, humanity is destined for the stars. \nDriven by optimism, I launched a makerspace in Michigan and a robotics company, confident that success was measured by dollars earned and problems solved. My mantra was, \"If we can, we should.\" Our creations would lead to a flourishing future as more people joined the movement. Around this time, the Arab Spring ignited hope among young Arabs like me, inspiring a new idea to take shape.\nWith the hackerspace growing at home and the robotics company launching our factory robot I believed we could replicate this energy around the world and create an army of positive change makers, all working on technology and entrepreneurship to shape a better world. It sounded good to me back then, and that’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley—both of which felt more like temples to a religion of science and progress than a university– “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly. \n\nI started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it. \n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me; I was on the right path; fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow, I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm. \n\nI promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me. \n\nAll I knew was that I started feeling uneasy. Once, while I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” I left the call feeling proud, and that pride made me uneasy. What the heck was I doing? Who was I helping? Why was I trying to help anyone? \n\nMy work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children, that led me to start to doubt my work. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]]. Yet those same people who experienced so much violence offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow puppet workshop, thinking I could be helpful. In truth, I was the one being helped.\n\nWhen I returned to San Francisco from Qah I found myself invited to Facebook’s end of year party. It was around that time I learned that two beautiful seven-year-old girls from the camp—Katya and her friend—had been killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. All the fun and opulence of the startup scene felt obscene.\n\nThat’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.\n\nFor a couple of years after that, I was numb. I felt like the curtains had been pulled back, and I saw the show for what it was, (my) egocentricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass. \n\nIn 2013/2014, I would meditate every day for an hour in a park. One of these days, I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, going ring by ring down my body, at some point, when I arrived at my groin, I felt like I was pierced by a sword, and I lept out of my cross-legged position. As I hobbled over to my bike, confused and in pain, I wondered: “What just happened? Why am I in this much pain?”\n\n\nBefore heading home, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message.  [Redacted]'s call for help was the start of a turnaround for me. He was being threatened with death, allegedly for the work we did together, “collaborating with Americans.”\n\nI realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting good people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until, one day, I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, looking at me pitifully. They must have known about Katya and the girls at Qah.\n\nAfter that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured. \n\nOne day, while deep in the haze of trauma, sugar-coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days, I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world, and coming up with theories of change, attempting to understand the news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles. \n\nWhen I met Josephine, I remember thinking, “This time, I will listen to something else, no more ideas and explanations.” Logic had failed me thus far. Every time I came up with a theory of change, every business plan to change the world, every time I was smart in relationships, it had not worked. This time, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said, “Yes.”\n\nThat was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life, I find this voice hard to listen to, and when I hear it - it’s been easy to ignore. Yet, seeing that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that told me to call my mom and spend time in nature. A voice that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\nThese were the early days of healing for me. I realized I had to stop listening to myself and listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice? How could I know it was trustworthy? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?\n\nI was searching for things that made my heart sing. My spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what I deeply believed: that God is beautiful and loves beauty. I chose to use my life to follow a path of beauty. That way, when I died either way life was beautiful.\nMy religious and spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what was true to me at the core. I found the Islamic principle that God is beautiful and loves beauty stood the test of reason and spirit. If I chose to live a beautiful life I’d have a beautiful life, and when I die… well, we’d see then. \n\nThis exploration led me to Krista Tippett’s On Being, a podcast full of stories about selflessness, care, and the beauty of human potential. When I heard Jean Vanier’s story of building communities for people with disabilities, something in me cracked open. For the first time in years, I cried, and those tears reminded me that I was still human.\nI listened to nearly every episode, but Father Greg Boyle’s story finally unlocked a path forward. The founder of Homeboy and Homegirl Industries, he helps former prisoners reintegrate with jobs, tattoo removal, and community support. When asked why he does this work, he didn’t say, “God told me to,” or, “It’s the right thing to do.” He simply said, “They’re my friends. So what else would I do?” That response shifted everything for me.\nFather Boyle working for a future outcome or trying to make a dent in the universe. His actions weren’t tied to expectations or good intentions—they emerged naturally from his way of being. The immediacy, focusing on living beautifully in the present moment, showed me that don’t need to have good intentions, that beauty isn’t about solving the world’s problems; beautiful actions emerge from true relationships, that truth builds relationships of love, and love gives birth to beauty. \n\n\nOver the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that we decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring. \n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”\n\nI stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he gave it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.\n\nBack then, I was too invested in having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to one’s family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow, I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me. \n\nThis is when I finally started a more profound process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. By submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realized that that voice also left us many clues within us, in the world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book, the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally, leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.\n\nIt was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France. And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of Saleh and friends. I flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo—the commitment that opened the doors to baby Suleiman and that moment at the threshold of 2024, where I was holding my baby, feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled in the hands of the most Merciful.\n\nThe first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, and high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, we just had a baby, and it's all come full circle that morning as I held baby Suli and cried, one eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.",

      "content": "**[Quackers (Blue Hat) takes the lead, addressing the team of ducks and the user]**\n\nQuackers: Alright, team, we’ve got a very specific (and rather dramatic) request here. The user wants a “therapist” who’s finally lost it and is going to yell at them. Let’s gather our perspectives so we can shape one fiery, cathartic message that still respects boundaries. We need to be honest, tough, and loud—but also keep it constructive. Ready, ducks?\n\n**Josephine (White Hat)**: The user’s story is chock-full of objective details: they once worshipped Silicon Valley’s hustle, tried to “fix the world,” traveled all over (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, etc.), worked with refugees, launched makerspaces, and ultimately felt disillusioned. They discovered a deeper truth in simpler, more intimate things like holding their baby and prioritizing love. They mention feeling conflicted about big goals versus the immediate, tangible joy of family. They also talk about their spiritual path, submission, and the shift away from a “progress religion” to the notion that “God is beautiful and loves beauty.” So, we have a thorough timeline of experiences.\n\n**Claude (Green Hat)**: We can put a creative spin on this “therapeutic snap.” Show the frustration with how they keep overlooking the obvious solutions: focusing on love, baby, and the beauty of life. They *keep* ignoring the simple joys, chasing lofty but sometimes misguided dreams. We’ll bring that out in a dramatic, comedic “meltdown.”\n\n**Prunella (Black Hat)**: The risk is to go too far and be cruel. We need tough love but not personal attacks or actual cruelty. Let’s keep it intense but ultimately supportive. \n\n**Percy (Yellow Hat)**: And remember, positivity, folks. A meltdown with a golden lining—there’s hope in focusing on what truly matters. Let’s remind them that, yes, they *can* do meaningful work, but not at the expense of the people they love most.\n\n**Cyril (Red Hat)**: I’m feeling riled up already. Let’s do it with plenty of heart. After all, the user wants us to show the deep emotional charge. Let’s let that out in a helpful way.\n\n**Quackers (Blue Hat)**: Great. Let’s fuse it all: the meltdown, the references to ignoring personal life, the bigger illusions of “world-changing,” and the clarity that caring for those you love in the here-and-now is crucial. I’ll deliver our final piece. Take it away—therapist meltdown mode, full steam ahead!\n\n---\n\n## The Therapist’s “Snapped” Monologue\n\nListen up, will you? I’ve had it with the endless soul-searching, the cosmic daydreaming, the “fix the world” talk while you *willfully* ignore the baby right in your arms! I’ve listened to your entire saga: the brilliance in MIT circles, the high-tech mania of Silicon Valley, the travels across war zones, the big talk about ‘impact’ and ‘changing the world.’ You had your hands in everything from Maker Faires in Egypt to hackerspaces in Beirut—and guess what? None of that will matter if you can’t get the basics right. \n\nYou want to “shape the future,” but for crying out loud, you’re barely present in your own life! You get whisked off to war-torn regions—Syria, Iraq—hoping to cure the world’s problems with fancy gadgets and boundless optimism, yet you come home with an even bigger hole in your soul. You learned about heartbreak, trauma, and the absolute *irrelevance* of these so-called “solutions” when kids are literally losing their lives and it’s all so much bigger than you. You realized how hollow the “Tech Messiah” dream was, and how messed up it felt to be partying at Facebook right after hearing about children killed in bombings.\n\nBut here’s what drives me up the wall: you’re *still* letting yourself fall into the same trap: looking for cosmic answers, chasing new crusades, and forgetting that the moment your baby’s little hand touched yours was a flashing neon sign screaming, “THIS is enough!” And you know it. You said it yourself—holding that precious child was enough for a lifetime. But you get in your own way. You tie yourself into knots about big visions, chasing down a “theory of change” when what you really need is a *diaper change.*\n\nIt’s not that your big ambitions are bad—I’m not telling you to drop your ideals or pretend the world is perfect. But for heaven’s sake, you’re ignoring the relationships right in front of your face! You’re ignoring the wife who loves you, the family members who want to share dinners and laughter. The greatest “charity,” the greatest “impact,” starts right in your own living room. That new baby, that partner—*that’s* your prime directive. And no, it doesn’t mean you can’t also do good in the world. But if you never slow down enough to hear your baby’s gurgles or see your partner’s tired eyes, you’ll lose the most valuable part of life’s meaning. \n\nYou talk about submission to the Divine. Then act like it! Let go of the delusion that you must single-handedly “fix” everything. Maybe the path to real change is to let yourself be changed by those who love you. If you can’t honor the sanctity of your own home—if you’re too busy building some global hackerspace empire—how can you expect to help build a truly compassionate world?\n\nSometimes you’re so busy being “deep” and “purposeful” that you’ve become blind to the simple, luminous *beauty* around you. You *saw* it in Qah, Syria, among refugees, for goodness’ sake! Folks with next to nothing showed you the real power of humanity. You recognized that your fancy technology wasn’t the real gift—you were being *served* by the people you went to serve. So, here’s the million-dollar question: **Why are you still ignoring that ultimate lesson?** If you want to serve love, serve your baby. Serve your wife. Sit still. Notice them. Feel the way your child’s hair smells in the morning. Make coffee for your partner while Fairuz hums in the background. \n\nStop second-guessing your instincts when your heart says “Yes” to closeness, to beauty, to actual relationships. This is not about giving up. This is about stepping up to your real responsibilities. You wanted a big calling? Well, fatherhood is a calling. Partnership is a calling. Loving the people who love you back is a calling. Believe me, these callings can shape the world more than any overblown mission statement about “revolutionizing” or “disrupting” society.\n\nSo that’s it. I’ve *snapped.* And I’m telling you, no more dithering, no more escaping into complicated dreams that “maybe someday” will be enough. You already have the “someday” right here, snuggled against your chest, drooling on your shirt, or waiting for you with a ring in her hand. The world is messy, complicated, and *massive.* But your baby’s tiny, bright-eyed grin? That’s a universe of hope right in your arms.\n\nYou want to change the world? Fine. But don’t you dare skip the bedtime story tonight. Don’t you dare forget to text your mom or call your best friend. Don’t you dare neglect the deep relationships that give you the emotional fuel to face all of life’s storms. Because the next time you come whining to me about “not knowing what to do,” I’m going to remind you that you already *do* know. You said it yourself: **“This moment is enough for a life.”** So start living it. \n\n---\n\n**[Quackers (Blue Hat) regroups]**  \n\nQuackers: There it is—a strong dose of tough love, hopefully highlighting the real priority: the simple but radical act of loving those who are close to us and letting that love guide our bigger service to the world. If you want to keep exploring or clarifying anything, we’re here to help you deepen that reflection and shape your path forward—minus the “snapped yelling,” of course!  ",
