Counter: \"Success is immediate in conscious commerce, not a distant goal\"\n   Refutes: The assumption that ethical economics is about future impact rather than present spiritual reality\n\n2. Counter: \"Abundance exists in seemingly simple choices made with awareness\"\n   Refutes: The assumption that positive change requires large-scale systemic transformation\n\n3. Counter: \"Divine presence manifests in the very act of conscious commerce\"\n   Refutes: The assumption that spiritual economics is primarily about cause and effect\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"revised-book-pitches\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"Revised Book Pitches with New Focus\">\n# The Economics of Presence: Revised Approach\n\n## Core Vision\nThis book invites readers into the immediate spiritual abundance available through conscious economic choices. Rather than promising future transformation, it reveals the divine presence already manifest in mindful commerce - from the blessing of supporting an ethical farmer to the contentment found in choosing \"enough\" over excess.
