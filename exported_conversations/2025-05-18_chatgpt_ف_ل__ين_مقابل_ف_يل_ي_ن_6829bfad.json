      "content": "In everyday Iraqi Arabic, فِلِّين‎‎—often transliterated filleen—is the word people use for “cork.”\n\n• If you’re talking about bottle-stoppers or bulletin-boards, the direct English equivalent is simply cork.\n\n• In building-supply or craft shops inside Iraq, the same word is also used for sheets and blocks of expanded polystyrene foam (Styrofoam); so in that context you’d translate it as “Styrofoam / EPS insulation board.”\nAlmaany\nWordReference\nWordReference\n\nA little more detail\nArabic spelling\tIPA / rough pronunciation\tTypical Iraqi usage\tBest English word(s)\nفِلِّين\t/filˈliːn/ (double L)\t• Bottle corks • Wall/ceiling insulation panels • Craft “foam”\tcork (material, stopper) or Styrofoam / polystyrene foam (when it’s the white insulation board)\nفِيلَيْنِ\t/fiːˈleːn/ (single L)\tOnly in formal Arabic: the dual of فِيل “elephant” → “two elephants.”\t“two elephants”\nموضوع سؤال وجواب\n\nNotice the spelling and sound difference: فِلِّين has a doubled لّ, while فِيلَيْنِ has a long ee vowel after ف and a ي.

      "content": "That's a solid summary—and a great example of how one Arabic word can span different domains in English depending on context. To quickly recap for clarity:\n\n### ✅ Everyday Iraqi Arabic: **فلّين** /filleen/\n- **Cork** (as in a bottle stopper or corkboard)\n- **Styrofoam** / **polystyrene insulation boards** (in construction or craft contexts)\n\n### ⚠️ Not to be confused with: **فِيلَيْنِ** /feelein/\n- A completely different word: the **dual form of “elephant” (فِيل)** → means “two elephants” in formal Arabic\n\n### 🔁 English translation tip:\nAlways **contextualize**:\n- **Wine bottles, shoes, corkboards** → “**cork**”\n- **Construction, packaging, crafts** → “**Styrofoam**” or “**polystyrene foam**”\n\n---\n\nIf you’re building glossaries, teaching Iraqi Arabic, or translating texts, distinguishing **فلّين** from **فِيلَيْنِ** can save a lot of confusion (and keep people from accidentally saying “two elephants” when they meant “cork board”).\n\nWant a visual infographic or flashcard-style breakdown of this?",

      "content": "An **on-grid** and **off-grid** system are two types of solar power setups, and they differ in how they interact with the main electricity grid.\n\n---\n\n### 🔌 **On-Grid System** (also called grid-tied)\n\n**Definition**: A solar system that is **connected to the public electricity grid**.\n\n#### ✅ Key Features:\n- **No batteries needed**\n- When your solar panels produce **more power than you use**, the extra goes to the grid (you may earn credits or get paid—called **net metering**).\n- When the sun isn’t shining or you use more electricity than your panels produce, you **draw power from the grid**.\n- **Cheaper to install** than off-grid (no battery costs)\n\n#### ⚠️ Limitation:\n- **If the grid goes down**, your power goes down too (for safety, to prevent backfeeding).\n\n---\n\n### 🔋 **Off-Grid System**\n\n**Definition**: A solar system that is **completely independent** from the public electricity grid.\n\n#### ✅ Key Features:\n- **Requires batteries** to store energy for nighttime or cloudy days\n- Designed to fully power a home, cabin, or business **without external electricity**\n- Often used in **remote areas** with no access to grid power\n\n#### ⚠️ Limitations:\n- **More expensive** due to batteries and backup systems\n- Must be carefully designed to handle your energy needs year-round\n\n---\n\n### ⚡ In Between: **Hybrid Systems**\n- Combines solar, grid connection, and batteries\n- Offers **flexibility**, backup power, and the ability to sell excess electricity\n\n---\n\nWould you like a visual chart comparing the three types?",
