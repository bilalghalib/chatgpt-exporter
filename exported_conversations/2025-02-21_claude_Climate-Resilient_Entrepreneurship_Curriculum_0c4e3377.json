This month is all about understanding your customers needs. We will do that in 3 ways, experiencing what our customers experience, observing them, and listening to them.\n\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends: Finally, we will spend some time on how you should organize your research as you implement your research plan. \n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nDesign Thinking review\nSO, LET’S REVIEW! This morning we talked about design thinking and we ran through a design sprint so you can experience the whole process in just about 1 hour! Can someone tell us what we have learned? What is Design thinking? Why is it one of the most important tools for entrepreneurs? What is it used for?\n\nSome possible answers:\nAllows for creative solutions to problems by defining needs as verbs!\nWe get to know our customers (who they are, where they are, how they behave, what they like/dislike, etc…) \nEmpathize with them\nSome people might mention a few (or all) of the steps\nCreate better products by ensuring that it is designed to meet their needs\n\nGo over the design thinking process briefly touching on points the entrepreneurs missed. Remind them that it is a continuous process that needs to be tested and re-evaluated again and again.\n\n\n4\nMINDSETS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nMindsets: Facilitate a discussion on what mindsets we should have going into the program. Write everyone's answer on the board and see where people are at. At the end, put these points up on the boards and say that in design thinking, there are a few additional mindsets that are really important to have. Point out if they have already said any of them. We operate from these mindsets:\nFocus on human values: Design thinking is human centered design. We look to understand the needs and emotions of people in order to design solutions for them. Empathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these\nusers is fundamental to good design\nShow don’t tell: Wherever you can, show people what you are doing, don’t explain it to them. You learn more from listening and observing real reactions, than having people respond to your talking. This is essential when we get to prototyping. Communicate your vision in an impactful and meaningful way by creating experiences, using illustrative visuals, and telling good stories.\nEmbrace experimentation: Don’t be afraid to try things. It is ok to fail, in fact, it can be good! The more you experiment and allow yourself to consider different options, the more you will learn and you will get better. Prototyping is not simply a way to validate your idea; it is an integral part of your innovation process. We build to think and learn. \nBe mindful of the process: Know where you are in the design process, what methods to use in that stage, and what your goals are. It is a process for a reason, don’t skip a step, but don’t be afraid to go back if you need more research or to reframe the problem to find better solutions!\nBias towards action: Design thinking is very hands on and action oriented. There will not be a lot of time sitting and learning, we want you to experience everything by doing! Design thinking is a misnomer; it is more about doing that thinking. Bias toward doing and making over thinking and meeting.\nRadical collaboration: In order to get a diversity of ideas and solutions, you have to collaborate. In this room there are so many people with different backgrounds and experiences. Use each other to brainstorm and develop your businesses. Later on, you will even collaborate with your customers or anyone else who would interact with your product/service. Bring together innovators with varied backgrounds and viewpoints. Enable breakthrough insights and solutions to emerge from the diversity.\nCraft clarity: Things are going to get messy. That is normal, take care to reframe the problem to make it clear. Produce a coherent vision out of messy problems. Frame it in a way to inspire others and to fuel ideation.\n\n\n\nUSER RESEARCH\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nEmpathizing is the first step we will look at in the Design Thinking process. We will empathize with our users through user research. It is the phase where you learn about your customers behaviors, needs, pains, and gains. \nAsk: Why is the user research phase of Design Thinking so important?\nUser research helps us to understand how people go about performing tasks and achieving goals that are important to them. \nIt gives us context and perspective and puts us in a position to respond with useful, simplified, and productive design solutions. \nUser research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and motivations through methodical, investigative approaches. \nIt helps us identify unarticulated needs and to fill in any gaps in our knowledge about our users, context of use, challenges, and opportunities. \nIt also helps us to align our product and business strategy with the core needs and goals of our users.\nInsights are then used to ensure that all product design decisions do benefit the user. \n\nWHO IS YOUR USER?\nGOALS\nNEEDS\nPAINS\nWANTS\nDESIRES\n20 minutes: Discussion\n\n5- 10 minutes: Guided discussion on user personas. Who is your user?\nI’m sure by now, you guys already have an idea of who your customers are. We are going to spend some time taking a look at who we think are our customers at this point. \nLet’s take an example from the room.  ___(name person in the room)____, can you tell me a little bit about one of your potential customers? Lets look at this as if they were a real person. Tell me the person’s name, where they are from, and what do they love to do.\nGuide the person to fill out all of the components of a user persona (shown on the next slide). Make sure you are writing what they say on the board in a way that will draw out the user persona as depicted in the next slides. \nContent could include:\nGeographic: Location, city, reach, country, international vs local\nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, ethnic background\nBehavioral: Patterns, usage rates, \nPsychographic: Social class, lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes, \nGoals:  What is this person trying to accomplish? \nCustomer pains: What challenges does this person face? What are the big and small problems they have and how does it affect their lives?\nTell this person’s story: Tell a short story about this person trying to accomplish their goal (related to your business). What challenges do they face on their journey? \nIn market segmentation, you can be general. It is a good way to summarize large groups of your customers. However, in this case with personas, we want to make it as real as possible so we will use very specific information.\n*** If you do not feel comfortable facilitating the discussion with a new business idea, learn what is on the example on the hidden slides and create a user persona around that (it is for a tourism business). Still make sure to engage the audience by asking them to talk about a potential customer for the tourism business you are creating.\n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nEveryone should now fill out a user persona for their business. We want you to be really specific. Find an example of a real person who might use your product/service. Describe them like they are real. Your customers will be real people with needs, values, and feelings. \nAsk 1-2 people to share their persona they have created.\nDebrief: You guys all did a great job here. Actually, what you just did was create a “fake” user persona. I think a lot of these points might be accurate; however, we are assuming that these are accurate. This is just based on who we THINK is our user, and it is not really based on much data. Over the next few weeks, we are going to spend some time doing intensive user research and come up with accurate user personas by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data.\n\n\n\n\n\nPICTURE & NAME\n  DEMOGRAPHIC:\nShe is 22 years old, \nSingle, \nStudies international cultures, \nWorks as a waitress. \n  GEOGRAPHIC:\nChristie is living in a small apartment in New York\nHas a strong online presence and spends 3-4 hours on social media every day.\n  BEHAVIORAL:\nShe likes to try new things\nShe eats out at restaurants on a weekly basis\nShe uses her phone to research user reviews to help her decide what to do and buy\nTravels every summer with her family to the mountains\n  PSYCHOGRAPHIC:\nVegan & animal rights activist\nDoesn’t care about her looks, always dresses down  \nLoves adventure\n\nAlternative example (slides 7-8)\n\n5- 10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nGuided discussion on user personas.

She is 22 years old, single, studies international cultures, and works as a waitress. She dreams of a future where she can combine work and travel. She wants to work in work in a company where she can travel and make a difference in the world. She’s not sure about having kids and a husband. At least it’s not on her radar just yet.\n\nTravel internationally in a sustainable way\nSee the world\nHelp others\nSave money\n\n\nTraveling is too expensive\nShe doesn’t know where to look for sustainable tourism options\nIt is really hard for her to keep track of prices, hotel options, and day trips she is reviewing\n\n\n9\nBREAK\n\nYOUR RESEARCH:\nDO\nLOOK\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nYour research plan: Welcome back from your break. I hope you are feeling re-energized! So, as we said before, we all have an idea of who our customers are and what they want, but really, these are just assumptions. We might be right on some things, but we probably don’t have the whole picture. That’s why it is so important to create a research plan. To help us fill these gaps and give us more insights on what our customers need!\n\nHow will we do this? Through three research methodologies: Do, Look, and Listen.\n\nDo is all about experiential learning. Putting yourself in the shoes of your customers.\n\nLook is learning through observation. Trying to see the behaviors of your customers to pinpoint needs and opportunities.\n\nListen is where we talk to our customers through user interviews. Here we hear from them and try to get to the root of their problems and really understand their behaviors and emotions.\n\nDO\nhttps://www.cleancookingalliance.org/binary-data/RESOURCE/file/000/000/407-1.pdf\n20 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nDO is all about experiencing what your customers experience. In order to understand the pains of your customers, you have to go through the process yourself. For the DO, tell the story of one of IDEO's engineers:\nIDEO is one of the leading companies in product development focusing on design thinking methodology. IDEO was working on creating a new design for a stove in a third world country.  They wanted to design a solution for women to make cooking easier for them. So what did they do? They went to the country and used the stove. They experienced how people cooked every day and got to feel how those women felt using that stove. The lesson in this story is that even if you are an expert, you have to go through the same experience of your users to feel their challenges!\n\n15 minutes: Activity - Immerse (DO)\nHave participants partner up\nGive each pair a task: \nGo into the bathroom and wash your hands, \nWalk around the space, get a book, and put it on the table in the kitchen, \nMake a cup of tea\nDo a lap around the space\nGet a piece of paper and write directions to the bathroom\nYou can do anything, be creative!\n\nOne participant will close their eyes and try to complete the task, while their partner guides them and makes sure they don’t run into things or hurt themselves\nThen switch so that both people go through the process\n\nDEBRIEF: How was that experience? What did it make you learn? How do you think it would be to be blind in a space like this? \nNow think, if you were to design a product for someone who was blind, what are some things you would include? Think about what helped you accomplish the task. Was it useful to hold onto things? Were sounds helpful? Did you like it when someone was in front of you? What were things that frustrated you while you were “blind“, how could that be fixed?\nLESSON: It is important to walk in your customers shoes, especially if you are developing a product for them. To see life from their perspective will allow you to truly understand them and their needs\n\n\nWhat are they doing? \nHow are they doing it?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?\nLOOK\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nAnother form of research is observation. You can learn so much by just observing people in their natural routine. While you are watching, take note of a few things:\nWhat are they doing? What are their actual behaviors? List them step by step. Be detail oriented.\nHow are they doing it? Are they doing something a little odd that needs further explanation? Is it easy for them? Difficult?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?  What are they trying to accomplish? What is the end goal? \n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nObserve (LOOK): What is this a picture of? What do you see?\nSpend 5-10 minutes getting thoughts from people. Take the time to build up a story about this person.\nWrite everyone's thoughts on the board\nRemember to touch on the previous slides questions (what, how, why)\nWhat do you see versus what do you think based on what you see?\n\nLESSON: You can learn so much from just looking, taking a step back and trying to figure out what you’re seeing, what you can learn from watching. Keep in mind that you can only learn some things. You can see their actual behaviors. You can observe body language and make assumptions about WHY they are doing it that way. If you can, get some clarification and speak to the person to understand why they did it in that way. \n\nAsk for stories\nTalk about emotions\nAsk why?\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe last research method we are going to cover is the User Interview. In a user interview, you spend 2-30 minutes to speak with customers to hear from them about their experiences. If you take the time to speak to customers, they will tell you everything you would ever need to know about how to make a great product for them. They will tell you what they like and don’t like, the challenges they have with existing solutions and even more! You just have to listen! \n\n\n\n“Tell me about the last time you…”\n“What was the best/ worse...”\n“Why is that?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\nLISTEN\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBe careful how you phrase questions. It is important that you don’t lead your customers into saying what you want to hear. By doing this, your interview data will be useless. To give you some example of bad interview questions:\nDo you like my idea? People tend to be nice, chances are nobody would want you to feel bad and tell you that you have a bad idea. By asking this, you invite people to say “yes, I like your idea” even though it might not be true. \nWould you buy this product? This is another question that is tricky and usually provides you with false information. Again many people would be tempted to say “yes” or “probably” to this question. The best way to test if people are willing to buy a product is to see if they actually take out their wallet and try. \nDo you have trouble with _____? By posing challenges for them, you are putting words in their mouth. Maybe they do have trouble with that, but you want to hear it from them. Maybe they are facing the challenge differently than you are. Allow them to share their thoughts on their own. Don’t tell or suggest to people how they feel or behave. \nCan you tell me how you normally …..  This question is ALMOST good; however, it is too general. You don’t get any real information. If you ask for generalities (‘what is your normal evening like?’) then you’ll get a false picture, it will be their ‘idealized’ evening. You need to ask a question that allows people to give you a specific story that has real emotions.\n\nSo what are good questions to ask? The questions ask for stories, evoke emotions, and go deeper into their actual behaviors. \n“Tell me about the last time you…”  By asking this question, you are able to get very specific information. They will have details about what they liked and didnt like, there might be a timeline, etc... You will get very rich information with this question. \n“What was the best/ worse...” By asking these questions, you are learning more about what the person likes and doesn’t. As you develop your product, it is important to know what your customers care about and what their problems are.\n“Why is that?” and “Can you tell me more?” These questions are great for going deeper. If your interviewee says something surprising or interesting, you should want to know more about it. Don’t assume anything, ask them about their thoughts. \nAsk why 5 times – keep asking why so that you get to the deeper meaning and emotion behind decisions. Humans make decisions based on emotion, it’s important for you to understand why your users/ customers make their decisions\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW\nIntroduce yourself\nIntroduce project\nBuild rapport\nEvoke stories\nExplore emotions\nQuestion statements\nThank you & wrap up\nTime\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + example\n\nExplain all the steps that go into an interview. Here are some tips on what to ask in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of a user interview:\n\nBeginning: In the beginning of the interview, you should ask opening questions to set people at ease and build rapport. You should not ask about sensitive topics. Instead, focus on setting the stage and bringing your interviewees on board so they’re comfortable enough to be, and remain, open with you. What you do at this stage can include the following:\nTelling participants what topics will be covered\nTelling participants how their data will be used\nAsking innocuous questions such as what their role is in their organization\nAsking concrete questions that are easy to answer\n\nMiddle: In the middle of the interview, you’re hitting high gear. Having established a direct channel with your interviewees (the users), you move on and ask the bulk of your questions, but maybe not in the order you had originally planned. Remember to:\nKeep the flow of the conversation as natural as possible, but cover the topics you want to cover.\nPick up on what participants have said earlier and get full replies to questions they have only partially answered.\nSteer participants back on track if they go too far off topic.\nShow that you have been listening.\nGo deeper where necessary\n\nEnd: At the end of the interview, you wrap up in a way that makes participants feel as though they have said what they wanted to say and that their answers are valuable. By this point, you will have managed to tie up any loose ends on matters that had not been clear before, and both you and they should be satisfied that the interview has brought all the issues out into the open. Things you should do include:\nAsking if there is anything participants would like to add.\nTelling your participants what you are going to do with their data and what the value is for them.\nThanking them for taking the time to help with your research. Above all, remember to conduct a pilot study before you start approaching real-life participants and tackling ‘organic’ interview settings. Also, always be sensitive to the fact that people are different and need different things!\n\n5 minutes: Example\nHave 2 trainers go through a User Interview. Show a good user interview and a bad one. \n\n\nEMPATHY MAP\n8 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nSo after your interview, you should reflect on and reorganize your information. We will do this through an empathy map. \nAfter you give the explanation of the empathy map, fill it in for the practice interview you just had in front of the group (with the trainers). Have it be a conversation and write out the answers as a group on the white board. As you discuss together, highlight some information about each quadrant (no need to explain each point in detail!)\n\nThe Says quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or some other usability study. Ideally, it contains verbatim and direct quotes from research.\n“I love Asiacell because I never have a bad experience.”\n“I want something reliable.”\n“I don’t understand what to do from here.”\nThe Thinks quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. Ask yourself (from the qualitative research gathered): what occupies the user’s thoughts? What matters to the user? Pay special attention to what users think, but may not be willing to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure, self-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?\n“This is really annoying.”\n“Am I dumb for not understanding this?”\nThe Does quadrant encloses the actions the user takes. From the research, what does the user physically do? How does the user go about doing it?\nRefreshes page several times.\nShops around to compare prices.\nThe Feels quadrant is the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What does the user get excited about? How does the user feel about the experience?\nImpatient: pages load too slowly\nConfused: too many contradictory prices\nWorried: they are doing something wrong\n\nYou might encounter inconsistencies — for example, seemingly positive actions but negative quotes or emotions coming from the same user.  This is when empathy maps become treasure maps that can uncover nuggets of understanding about our user. It is our job as UX professionals to investigate the cause of the conflict and resolve it.\n\nSome of these quadrants may seem ambiguous or overlapping — for example, it may be difficult to distinguish between Thinks and Feels. Do not focus too much on being precise: if an item may fit into multiple quadrants, just pick one. The 4 quadrants exist only to push our knowledge about users and to ensure we don’t leave out any important dimension. (If you don’t have anything to put into a certain quadrant, it’s a strong signal that you need more user research before proceeding in the design process.)\n\n**This is important to do together because we consistently have trouble with the entrepreneurs not understanding how to use the empathy map. \n\n\n\n\n\nPRACTICE\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nInterview Your Users (LISTEN)\n5 minutes: prepare questions\nCome up with 3-5 questions you want to learn from your customers about their lives/ about your product (5 minutes)\n10 minutes: 2 rounds of interviews (5 minutes each)\nEach person is matched with a partner\n5 minutes: Plot info on an empathy map\nAsk them to plot results on the empathy map right after the interview. This is a great way to re-think the interview and reflect.\n\n\n\n\nEXTREME USER\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users. Who are the people who use this product every day? \nFor example, if you are making a new cleat, you definitely want to talk to people who play sports (kids, parents who buy them, university students, etc…), but you would probably want to talk to people who LIVE in cleats too. Take professional athletes for example, they know every part of their shoes because they wear them for hours every day. They know about what they love and hate about them. \nLet’s take another example. If we were designing a new type of seat in a car, who would the extreme user be? --- allow them to answer. Taxi drivers live in their cars. All day long they are sitting in the seats and probably know really specific details of what makes them comfortable or not. They might even share ideas on how it could be better.\nWhile creating your user research plan, make sure to include extreme users!\nYou will want to include at least 1-2 extreme users into your research plan.\n\n------------------------------------\nNotes about Extreme Users to help facilitate discussion, no need to explain them all:\n\nWhen considering the user's needs in design, it’s very easy for a designer to fall into the trap of designing for the first, average user they can think of. \nOnly by understanding the viewpoints of a full range of people is it possible to avoid the pitfall of designing for yourself. \nThrough speaking to the extreme users and identifying their amplified needs, it can help pull out more meaningful insights and thus gives the potential to push ideas in different directions that you wouldn’t have previously explored. \nThis group of users can help spark creativity by introducing you to hacks and use cases you wouldn’t have imagined. \nIn the hope of trying to please the mainstream, which is still a very diverse group, it’s all too easy to end up designing something generic and easy to replicate.\nAn idea that suits an extreme user is more likely to please the mainstream users too. \nBy focusing on the extremes, you can find the highest priority issues. Most commonly, the high priority issue is what motivates people to buy this thing, and what is keeping them from buying this thing?\nExtreme user's are most in-tune with their needs, emotions and behaviors when using a product or service and can, therefore, articulate needs/challenges better. \n\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user.\nAsking the user to design for you.\nAsking the user to respond to your idea.\nUSER RESEARCH IS NOT:\n3 minutes: Remember!\n\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user. \nRemember you want to make sure they are talking, not you!\nDon’t assume things, allow them to share their own experiences\n\nAsking the user to design for you\nDon’t ask your interviewer what they think the solution is\nDon’t have them list features\nYOU are the designer! You need to gather information from people to create the solution that will best fit their needs. By asking others to design for you, you stunt your creativity and can come up with generic solutions.\n\nAsking the user to respond to your idea\nAvoid asking the user if they like your idea. Any person will just say “yes, I like it” or “yes, I will use/buy this”\nIn general, people are polite, so you shouldn’t trust what they say in that way. Make sure the questions are framed in a way where you are just focusing on the challenges they are facing and learning about how they are currently dealing with them.\nYou should NOT give an explanation of your idea in a user interview.\n\n\n\n\n3 places to immerse\n30 people to interview \n5 extreme users\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nSpend the rest of the session writing your user research questions and practicing with other people in the cohort  (we will also do this tomorrow morning)\nPractice your user research on at least 5 members of the cohort\nGive each other feedback on their interview style. Help them ask the right questions and dig deeper.\n\nResearch: \nCreate your research plan (They should come tomorrow morning with a DO, LOOK, LISTEN research plan that they will begin to implement tomorrow!)\nHow will you experience your customers' pains (DO?)\nWhere can you observe your customers (LOOK)?\nWhere will you go to speak to users (LISTEN)?At least \n30 user interviews needed (not including friends and family)!\n20-30 minutes per interview\nInclude 5 extreme users\n\nYou will have this week and the next to implement your research plan. You need at least 30 interviews. Go deep in these interviews. They should last 20-30 minutes each! If you are stuck, ask why. Go deeper. \n\nHow to structure a user interview.\nInterview guide.\nInterview examples and extra tips.\n\nHANDOUTS\nInstructions for a qualitative \nuser research interview:\nEmail these resources to the group at the end of the session, or before the session begins. \"\"\"\t]]]\n\nChatGPT said:\nHere's your structured analysis of the User Research Module, with a summary and climate resilience integration table based on the provided content.\n\nTask 1: Module Summary\nCore Learning Objectives: The User Research module equips participants with skills to understand their customers deeply using user personas, empathy maps, and qualitative research methods like interviews and observations. The goal is to teach entrepreneurs how to design products and services that genuinely meet customer needs.\n\nKey Activities:\n\nDeveloping user personas through guided discussions and examples.\nConducting user research using the Do, Look, Listen framework.\nApplying empathy maps to analyze user motivations, challenges, and behaviors.\nEngaging with extreme users to uncover critical pain points.\nPracticing user interviews and refining questioning techniques.\nCurrent Participant Outcomes:\n\nImproved ability to define customer profiles based on real data.\nEnhanced skills in conducting effective user research and empathy-driven product development.\nGreater understanding of how to align business solutions with real market needs.\nTask 2: Climate Integration Analysis\nOpportunities to Integrate Climate Resilience into User Research\n\nLocation\tCurrent Activity\tSuggested Change\tLocal Context & Reasoning\nUser Persona Activity\tParticipants create fictional user personas.\tAdd a \"Climate Awareness\" section in user personas, asking: \"How does climate change impact this user?\" \"What are their sustainability concerns?\"\tMany Iraqi/KRI consumers are increasingly aware of water scarcity, rising energy costs, and climate risks—these factors influence their purchasing behavior.\nEmpathy Map Exercise\tFocuses on user needs, wants, pains, and desires.\tInclude eco-awareness pain points, e.g., \"What challenges does this user face related to climate?\" \"What sustainability choices do they make?\"\tHelps entrepreneurs understand local green consumer preferences, which is critical for market viability.\nUser Interviews (Listen Phase)\tParticipants learn how to conduct user interviews.\tProvide a set of sustainability-focused interview questions (e.g., \"What eco-friendly features do you look for in a product?\" \"How do environmental issues affect your buying decisions?\").\tIraqi businesses are shifting toward green solutions (e.g., energy-efficient housing, water-saving technologies). Entrepreneurs need to capture this market trend.\nExtreme User Engagement\tParticipants interview users who heavily interact with their product.\tIdentify climate-vulnerable users (e.g., farmers, construction workers, energy-intensive businesses) to highlight sustainability needs.\tIraq/KRI faces extreme heat, water shortages, and unreliable electricity—businesses must integrate resilience into their models.\nMarket Research Discussion\tCovers identifying customer needs.\tIntroduce case studies of green businesses in Iraq/KRI (e.g., solar-powered homes, water recycling startups).\tEncourages participants to explore green business models that respond to local climate challenges.\nResearch Plan (Do, Look, Listen)\tParticipants design a plan for gathering user insights.\tRequire participants to observe environmental behaviors, such as energy use, waste disposal, or transportation choices.\tEncourages real-world data collection on sustainable behaviors, shaping eco-conscious product development.\nWorkshop Wrap-Up\tParticipants refine their user research strategies.\tInclude a discussion on \"Green Business Insights\"—how sustainability trends affect customer preferences.\tEnsures that eco-awareness becomes a standard part of business strategy discussions.\nKey Takeaways\nUser research must integrate sustainability insights to align with climate-conscious consumer behavior in Iraq/KRI.\nEntrepreneurs need clear frameworks for identifying climate pain points in their target audience.\nThe Do, Look, Listen methodology can be expanded to explore sustainable consumption patterns.\nEngaging climate-affected extreme users (e.g., farmers, construction workers, off-grid communities) can reveal business opportunities in climate resilience.\nAdding green market case studies will make sustainability more tangible for participants.\nWould you like me to refine or expand any part of this analysis?\n\nYou said:\n\"Phase 2: Module Scoring Prompt\nINSTRUCTIONS\nYou are a curriculum consultant specializing in integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.

I hope you guys got a chance to talk and get to know each other a little bit better.\nNow, for the rest of the day, we are going to go into the first step of Design Thinking, User research.\n\n\nLearn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs while considering long-term trends and market shifts\nBuild a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology to uncover key user challenges.\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends, including changing priorities in purchasing decisions and product expectations.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nLearn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs:  We will show you why user research is so important and how it is essential for developing any product or service. \n\nBuild a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology: Next, we will talk about building a research plan. This month is all about understanding your customers needs. We will do that in 3 ways, experiencing what our customers experience, observing them, and listening to them.\n\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends: Finally, we will spend some time on how you should organize your research as you implement your research plan. \n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nDesign Thinking review\nSO, LET’S REVIEW! This morning we talked about design thinking and we ran through a design sprint so you can experience the whole process in just about 1 hour! Can someone tell us what we have learned? What is Design thinking? Why is it one of the most important tools for entrepreneurs? What is it used for?\n\nSome possible answers:\nAllows for creative solutions to problems by defining needs as verbs!\nWe get to know our customers (who they are, where they are, how they behave, what they like/dislike, etc…) \nEmpathize with them\nSome people might mention a few (or all) of the steps\nCreate better products by ensuring that it is designed to meet their needs\n\nGo over the design thinking process briefly touching on points the entrepreneurs missed. Remind them that it is a continuous process that needs to be tested and re-evaluated again and again.\n\n\n4\nMINDSETS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nMindsets: Facilitate a discussion on what mindsets we should have going into the program. Write everyone's answer on the board and see where people are at. At the end, put these points up on the boards and say that in design thinking, there are a few additional mindsets that are really important to have. Point out if they have already said any of them. We operate from these mindsets:\nFocus on human values: Design thinking is human centered design. We look to understand the needs and emotions of people in order to design solutions for them. Empathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these\u000busers is fundamental to good design\nShow don’t tell: Wherever you can, show people what you are doing, don’t explain it to them. You learn more from listening and observing real reactions, than having people respond to your talking. This is essential when we get to prototyping. Communicate your vision in an impactful and meaningful way by creating experiences, using illustrative visuals, and telling good stories.\nEmbrace experimentation: Don’t be afraid to try things. It is ok to fail, in fact, it can be good! The more you experiment and allow yourself to consider different options, the more you will learn and you will get better. Prototyping is not simply a way to validate your idea; it is an integral part of your innovation process. We build to think and learn. \nBe mindful of the process: Know where you are in the design process, what methods to use in that stage, and what your goals are. It is a process for a reason, don’t skip a step, but don’t be afraid to go back if you need more research or to reframe the problem to find better solutions!\nBias towards action: Design thinking is very hands on and action oriented. There will not be a lot of time sitting and learning, we want you to experience everything by doing! Design thinking is a misnomer; it is more about doing that thinking. Bias toward doing and making over thinking and meeting.\nRadical collaboration: In order to get a diversity of ideas and solutions, you have to collaborate. In this room there are so many people with different backgrounds and experiences. Use each other to brainstorm and develop your businesses. Later on, you will even collaborate with your customers or anyone else who would interact with your product/service. Bring together innovators with varied backgrounds and viewpoints. Enable breakthrough insights and solutions to emerge from the diversity.\nCraft clarity: Things are going to get messy. That is normal, take care to reframe the problem to make it clear. Produce a coherent vision out of messy problems. Frame it in a way to inspire others and to fuel ideation.\n\n\n\nUSER RESEARCH\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nEmpathizing is the first step we will look at in the Design Thinking process. We will empathize with our users through user research. It is the phase where you learn about your customers behaviors, needs, pains, and gains. \nAsk: Why is the user research phase of Design Thinking so important? What factors—such as cost, access, or long-term usability—might impact user behavior?\nUser research helps us to understand how people go about performing tasks and achieving goals that are important to them, including external factors that influence decision-making.\nIt gives us context and perspective and puts us in a position to respond with useful, simplified, and productive design solutions, uncovering pain points and emerging customer expectations.\nUser research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and motivations through methodical, investigative approaches. \nIt helps us identify unarticulated needs and to fill in any gaps in our knowledge about our users, context of use, challenges, and opportunities. \nIt also helps us to align our product and business strategy with the core needs and goals of our users.\nInsights are then used to ensure that all product design decisions do benefit the user. \n\nWHO IS YOUR USER?\nGOALS\nNEEDS\nPAINS\nWANTS\nDESIRES\n20 minutes: Discussion\n\n5- 10 minutes: Guided discussion on user personas. Who is your user?\nI’m sure by now, you guys already have an idea of who your customers are. We are going to spend some time taking a look at who we think are our customers at this point. \nLet’s take an example from the room.  ___(name person in the room)____, can you tell me a little bit about one of your potential customers? Lets look at this as if they were a real person. Tell me the person’s name, where they are from, and what do they love to do.\nGuide the person to fill out all of the components of a user persona (shown on the next slide). Make sure you are writing what they say on the board in a way that will draw out the user persona as depicted in the next slides. \nContent could include:\nGeographic: Location, city, reach, country, international vs local, access to reliable energy or water availability?\nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, ethnic background\nBehavioral: Patterns, usage rates, eco-conscious preferences, cost vs sustainability trade-offs?\nPsychographic: Social class, lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes, environmental concerns?\nGoals:  What is this person trying to accomplish? Do they seek energy-efficient or resource-saving solutions?\nCustomer pains: What challenges does this person face? What are the big and small problems they have and how does it affect their lives?\nTell this person’s story: Tell a short story about this person trying to accomplish their goal (related to your business). What challenges do they face on their journey? \nIn market segmentation, you can be general. It is a good way to summarize large groups of your customers. However, in this case with personas, we want to make it as real as possible so we will use very specific information.\n*** If you do not feel comfortable facilitating the discussion with a new business idea, learn what is on the example on the hidden slides and create a user persona around that (it is for a tourism business). Still make sure to engage the audience by asking them to talk about a potential customer for the tourism business you are creating.\n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nEveryone should now fill out a user persona for their business. We want you to be really specific. Find an example of a real person who might use your product/service. Describe them like they are real. Your customers will be real people with needs, values, and feelings. \nAsk 1-2 people to share their persona they have created.\nDebrief: You guys all did a great job here. Actually, what you just did was create a “fake” user persona. I think a lot of these points might be accurate; however, we are assuming that these are accurate. This is just based on who we THINK is our user, and it is not really based on much data. Over the next few weeks, we are going to spend some time doing intensive user research and come up with accurate user personas by collecting both qualitative and quantitative data.\n\n\n\n\n\nPICTURE & NAME\n  DEMOGRAPHIC:\nShe is 22 years old, \nSingle, \nStudies international cultures, \nWorks as a waitress. \n  GEOGRAPHIC:\nChristie is living in a small apartment in New York\nHas a strong online presence and spends 3-4 hours on social media every day.\n  BEHAVIORAL:\nShe likes to try new things\nShe eats out at restaurants on a weekly basis\nShe uses her phone to research user reviews to help her decide what to do and buy\nTravels every summer with her family to the mountains\n  PSYCHOGRAPHIC:\nVegan & animal rights activist\nDoesn’t care about her looks, always dresses down  \nLoves adventure\n\nAlternative example (slides 7-8)\n\n5- 10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nGuided discussion on user personas.

She is 22 years old, single, studies international cultures, and works as a waitress. She dreams of a future where she can combine work and travel. She wants to work in work in a company where she can travel and make a difference in the world. She’s not sure about having kids and a husband. At least it’s not on her radar just yet.\n\nTravel internationally in a sustainable way\nSee the world\nHelp others\nSave money\n\n\nTraveling is too expensive\nShe doesn’t know where to look for sustainable tourism options\nIt is really hard for her to keep track of prices, hotel options, and day trips she is reviewing\n\n\n9\nBREAK\n\nYOUR RESEARCH:\nDO\nLOOK\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nYour research plan: Welcome back from your break. I hope you are feeling re-energized! So, as we said before, we all have an idea of who our customers are and what they want, but really, these are just assumptions. We might be right on some things, but we probably don’t have the whole picture. That’s why it is so important to create a research plan. To help us fill these gaps and give us more insights on what our customers need!\n\nHow will we do this? Through three research methodologies: Do, Look, and Listen.\n\nDo is all about experiential learning. Putting yourself in the shoes of your customers.\n\nLook is learning through observation. Trying to see the behaviors of your customers to pinpoint needs and opportunities.\n\nListen is where we talk to our customers through user interviews. Here we hear from them and try to get to the root of their problems and really understand their behaviors and emotions.\n\nDO\nhttps://www.cleancookingalliance.org/binary-data/RESOURCE/file/000/000/407-1.pdf\n20 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nDO is all about experiencing what your customers experience. In order to understand the pains of your customers, you have to go through the process yourself. If your product relates to energy, materials, or waste, try experiencing the challenges your users face—like cooking with limited electricity or navigating a city without clean drinking water.\nFor the DO, tell the story of one of IDEO's engineers:\nIDEO is one of the leading companies in product development focusing on design thinking methodology. IDEO was working on creating a new design for a stove in a third world country.  They wanted to design a solution for women to make cooking easier for them. So what did they do? They went to the country and used the stove. They experienced how people cooked every day and got to feel how those women felt using that stove. The lesson in this story is that even if you are an expert, you have to go through the same experience of your users to feel their challenges!\n\n15 minutes: Activity - Immerse (DO)\nHave participants partner up\nGive each pair a task: \nGo into the bathroom and wash your hands, \nWalk around the space, get a book, and put it on the table in the kitchen, \nMake a cup of tea\nDo a lap around the space\nGet a piece of paper and write directions to the bathroom\nYou can do anything, be creative!\n\nOne participant will close their eyes and try to complete the task, while their partner guides them and makes sure they don’t run into things or hurt themselves\nThen switch so that both people go through the process\n\nDEBRIEF: How was that experience? What did it make you learn? How do you think it would be to be blind in a space like this? \nNow think, if you were to design a product for someone who was blind, what are some things you would include? Think about what helped you accomplish the task. Was it useful to hold onto things? Were sounds helpful? Did you like it when someone was in front of you? What were things that frustrated you while you were “blind“, how could that be fixed?\nLESSON: It is important to walk in your customers shoes, especially if you are developing a product for them. To see life from their perspective will allow you to truly understand them and their needs\n\n\nWhat are they doing? \nHow are they doing it?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?\nLOOK\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nAnother form of research is observation. You can learn so much by just observing people in their natural routine. While you are watching, take note of a few things:\nWhat are they doing? What are their actual behaviors? List them step by step. Be detail oriented.\nHow are they doing it? Are they doing something a little odd that needs further explanation? Is it easy for them? Difficult?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?  What are they trying to accomplish? What is the end goal? \nHow do they navigate trade-offs in their daily decisions?\nWhat patterns emerge in how they balance cost, efficiency, and convenience?\n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nObserve (LOOK): What is this a picture of? What do you see?\nSpend 5-10 minutes getting thoughts from people. Take the time to build up a story about this person.\nWrite everyone's thoughts on the board\nRemember to touch on the previous slides questions (what, how, why)\nWhat do you see versus what do you think based on what you see?\n\nLESSON: You can learn so much from just looking, taking a step back and trying to figure out what you’re seeing, what you can learn from watching. Keep in mind that you can only learn some things. You can see their actual behaviors. You can observe body language and make assumptions about WHY they are doing it that way. If you can, get some clarification and speak to the person to understand why they did it in that way. \n\nAsk for stories\nTalk about emotions\nAsk why?\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe last research method we are going to cover is the User Interview. In a user interview, you spend 2-30 minutes to speak with customers to hear from them about their experiences. If you take the time to speak to customers, they will tell you everything you would ever need to know about how to make a great product for them. They will tell you what they like and don’t like, the challenges they have with existing solutions and even more! You just have to listen! \n\n\n\n“Tell me about the last time you…”\n“What was the best/ worse...”\n“Why is that?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\nLISTEN\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBe careful how you phrase questions. It is important that you don’t lead your customers into saying what you want to hear. By doing this, your interview data will be useless. To give you some example of bad interview questions:\nDo you like my idea? People tend to be nice, chances are nobody would want you to feel bad and tell you that you have a bad idea. By asking this, you invite people to say “yes, I like your idea” even though it might not be true. \nWould you buy this product? This is another question that is tricky and usually provides you with false information. Again many people would be tempted to say “yes” or “probably” to this question. The best way to test if people are willing to buy a product is to see if they actually take out their wallet and try. \nDo you have trouble with _____? By posing challenges for them, you are putting words in their mouth. Maybe they do have trouble with that, but you want to hear it from them. Maybe they are facing the challenge differently than you are. Allow them to share their thoughts on their own. Don’t tell or suggest to people how they feel or behave. \nCan you tell me how you normally …..  This question is ALMOST good; however, it is too general. You don’t get any real information. If you ask for generalities (‘what is your normal evening like?’) then you’ll get a false picture, it will be their ‘idealized’ evening. You need to ask a question that allows people to give you a specific story that has real emotions.\n\nSo what are good questions to ask? The questions ask for stories, evoke emotions, and go deeper into their actual behaviors. \n“Tell me about the last time you made a decision based on price, convenience, or long-term value.”  By asking this question, you are able to get very specific information. They will have details about what they liked and didnt like, there might be a timeline, etc... You will get very rich information with this question. \n“What was the best/ worst experience you had with a product/service in terms of quality, usability, or cost-effectiveness?” By asking these questions, you are learning more about what the person likes and doesn’t. As you develop your product, it is important to know what your customers care about and what their problems are.\n“Why is that? Did cost, durability, or other practical factors influence your choice?” and “Can you tell me more? Were there any outside factors that influenced your decision over time?” These questions are great for going deeper. If your interviewee says something surprising or interesting, you should want to know more about it. Don’t assume anything, ask them about their thoughts. \nAsk why 5 times – keep asking why so that you get to the deeper meaning and emotion behind decisions. Humans make decisions based on emotion, it’s important for you to understand why your users/ customers make their decisions\n“What drives their choices—cost, reliability, or ease of access? Are there patterns in what they prioritize?” Ask users open-ended questions to understand their behaviors. \n\n\n\nINTERVIEW\nIntroduce yourself\nIntroduce project\nBuild rapport\nEvoke stories\nExplore emotions\nQuestion statements\nThank you & wrap up\nTime\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + example\n\nExplain all the steps that go into an interview. Here are some tips on what to ask in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of a user interview:\n\nBeginning: In the beginning of the interview, you should ask opening questions to set people at ease and build rapport. You should not ask about sensitive topics. Instead, focus on setting the stage and bringing your interviewees on board so they’re comfortable enough to be, and remain, open with you. What you do at this stage can include the following:\nTelling participants what topics will be covered\nTelling participants how their data will be used\nAsking innocuous questions such as what their role is in their organization\nAsking concrete questions that are easy to answer\n\nMiddle: In the middle of the interview, you’re hitting high gear. Having established a direct channel with your interviewees (the users), you move on and ask the bulk of your questions, but maybe not in the order you had originally planned. Remember to:\nKeep the flow of the conversation as natural as possible, but cover the topics you want to cover.\nPick up on what participants have said earlier and get full replies to questions they have only partially answered.\nSteer participants back on track if they go too far off topic.\nShow that you have been listening.\nGo deeper where necessary\n\nEnd: At the end of the interview, you wrap up in a way that makes participants feel as though they have said what they wanted to say and that their answers are valuable. By this point, you will have managed to tie up any loose ends on matters that had not been clear before, and both you and they should be satisfied that the interview has brought all the issues out into the open. Things you should do include:\nAsking if there is anything participants would like to add.\nTelling your participants what you are going to do with their data and what the value is for them.\nThanking them for taking the time to help with your research. Above all, remember to conduct a pilot study before you start approaching real-life participants and tackling ‘organic’ interview settings. Also, always be sensitive to the fact that people are different and need different things!\n\n5 minutes: Example\nHave 2 trainers go through a User Interview. Show a good user interview and a bad one. \n\n\nEMPATHY MAP\n8 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nSo after your interview, you should reflect on and reorganize your information. We will do this through an empathy map. \nAfter you give the explanation of the empathy map, fill it in for the practice interview you just had in front of the group (with the trainers). Have it be a conversation and write out the answers as a group on the white board. As you discuss together, highlight some information about each quadrant (no need to explain each point in detail!)\n\nThe Says quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or some other usability study. Ideally, it contains verbatim and direct quotes from research.\n“I love Asiacell because I never have a bad experience.”\n“I want something reliable and cost-effective over time.”\n“I don’t understand what to do from here.”\nThe Thinks quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. Ask yourself (from the qualitative research gathered): what occupies the user’s thoughts? What matters to the user? Pay special attention to what users think, but may not be willing to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure, self-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?\n“This is really annoying.”\n“Am I dumb for not understanding this? Or are there too many wasteful steps in this process?\"\nThe Does quadrant encloses the actions the user takes. From the research, what does the user physically do? How does the user go about doing it?\nRefreshes page several times, compares energy costs of different products.\nShops around to compare prices.\nThe Feels quadrant is the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What does the user get excited about? How does the user feel about the experience?\nImpatient: pages load too slowly, frustrated by hidden costs or wastefulness.\nConfused: too many contradictory prices\nWorried: they are doing something wrong\n\nYou might encounter inconsistencies — for example, seemingly positive actions but negative quotes or emotions coming from the same user.  This is when empathy maps become treasure maps that can uncover nuggets of understanding about our user. It is our job as UX professionals to investigate the cause of the conflict and resolve it.\n\nSome of these quadrants may seem ambiguous or overlapping — for example, it may be difficult to distinguish between Thinks and Feels. Do not focus too much on being precise: if an item may fit into multiple quadrants, just pick one. The 4 quadrants exist only to push our knowledge about users and to ensure we don’t leave out any important dimension. (If you don’t have anything to put into a certain quadrant, it’s a strong signal that you need more user research before proceeding in the design process.)\n\n**This is important to do together because we consistently have trouble with the entrepreneurs not understanding how to use the empathy map. \n\n\n\n\n\nPRACTICE\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nInterview Your Users (LISTEN)\n5 minutes: prepare questions\nCome up with 3-5 questions you want to learn from your customers about their lives/ about your product (5 minutes)\n10 minutes: 2 rounds of interviews (5 minutes each)\nEach person is matched with a partner\n5 minutes: Plot info on an empathy map\nAsk them to plot results on the empathy map right after the interview. This is a great way to re-think the interview and reflect.\n\n\n\n\nEXTREME USER\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users, including those who prioritize in their decisions or face resource challenges Who are the people who use this product every day? \nFor example, if you are making a new cleat, you definitely want to talk to people who play sports (kids, parents who buy them, university students, etc…). Similarly, if you’re designing a product with materials, you may want to consider customers who prioritize durability, reusability, or low-waste solutions. \nLet’s take another example. If we were designing a new type of seat in a car, who would the extreme user be? --- allow them to answer. Taxi drivers live in their cars. All day long they are sitting in the seats and probably know really specific details of what makes them comfortable or not. They might even share ideas on how it could be better.\nWhile creating your user research plan, make sure to include extreme users! Eco-conscious buyers and those affected by resource constraints often offer unique insights.\nYou will want to include at least 1-2 extreme users into your research plan.\n\n------------------------------------\nNotes about Extreme Users to help facilitate discussion, no need to explain them all:\n\nWhen considering the user's needs in design, it’s very easy for a designer to fall into the trap of designing for the first, average user they can think of. \nOnly by understanding the viewpoints of a full range of people is it possible to avoid the pitfall of designing for yourself. \nThrough speaking to the extreme users and identifying their amplified needs, it can help pull out more meaningful insights and thus gives the potential to push ideas in different directions that you wouldn’t have previously explored. \nThis group of users can help spark creativity by introducing you to hacks and use cases you wouldn’t have imagined. \nIn the hope of trying to please the mainstream, which is still a very diverse group, it’s all too easy to end up designing something generic and easy to replicate.\nAn idea that suits an extreme user is more likely to please the mainstream users too. \nBy focusing on the extremes, you can find the highest priority issues. Most commonly, the high priority issue is what motivates people to buy this thing, and what is keeping them from buying this thing?\nExtreme user's are most in-tune with their needs, emotions and behaviors when using a product or service and can, therefore, articulate needs/challenges better. \n\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user.\nAsking the user to design for you.\nAsking the user to respond to your idea.\nUSER RESEARCH IS NOT:\n3 minutes: Remember!\n\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user. \nRemember you want to make sure they are talking, not you!\nDon’t assume things, allow them to share their own experiences\n\nAsking the user to design for you\nDon’t ask your interviewer what they think the solution is\nDon’t have them list features\nYOU are the designer! You need to gather information from people to create the solution that will best fit their needs. By asking others to design for you, you stunt your creativity and can come up with generic solutions.\n\nAsking the user to respond to your idea\nAvoid asking the user if they like your idea. Any person will just say “yes, I like it” or “yes, I will use/buy this”\nIn general, people are polite, so you shouldn’t trust what they say in that way. Make sure the questions are framed in a way where you are just focusing on the challenges they are facing and learning about how they are currently dealing with them.\nYou should NOT give an explanation of your idea in a user interview.\n\n\n\n\n3 places to immerse\n30 people to interview \n5 extreme users\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nSpend the rest of the session writing your user research questions and practicing with other people in the cohort  (we will also do this tomorrow morning)\nPractice your user research on at least 5 members of the cohort\nGive each other feedback on their interview style. Help them ask the right questions and dig deeper.\n\nResearch: \nCreate your research plan. Consider how external factors—such as cost, market trends, or access to key resources—shape user decisions. (They should come tomorrow morning with a DO, LOOK, LISTEN research plan that they will begin to implement tomorrow!)\nHow will you experience your customers' pains (DO?)\nWhere can you observe your customers (LOOK)?\nWhere will you go to speak to users (LISTEN)?At least \n30 user interviews needed (not including friends and family)!\n20-30 minutes per interview\nInclude 5 extreme users\n\nYou will have this week and the next to implement your research plan. Pay attention to shifts in consumer behavior, especially around affordability, usability, and long-term benefits. You need at least 30 interviews. Go deep in these interviews. Uncover hidden pain points, such as frustrations with affordability, convenience, or product reliability. They should last 20-30 minutes each! If you are stuck, ask why. Go deeper. \n\nHow to structure a user interview.\nInterview guide.\nInterview examples and extra tips.\n\nHANDOUTS\nInstructions for a qualitative \nuser research interview:\nEmail these resources to the group at the end of the session, or before the session begins. \n"

A powerful story connects to real-world challenges—many of which include financial, social, or environmental concerns.\nEveryone should find a partner. If there is an odd number, use another trainer.\nEach person is going to get 3 minutes to tell a story. It can be something funny, a favorite childhood story, or anything else (except about your business). \nSet the timer for 3 minutes for one person, then switch to give 3 minutes for the second person.\n\n8 minutes: Discussion\nWho heard a good story? What made it a good story? What really worked well? Was there anything that wasn’t so good? Why?\nDiscussion Question Addition:“Can sustainability or resilience be part of a compelling business story? How?”\nWrite answers on the board\nSome potential answers that might come up:\nIt was funny, sad, happy, scary, etc… (Was good because it connected with you emotionally)\nIt was relatable (you could empathize with the person in the story)\nIt was meaningful (had a purpose, or moral)\nI learned something (had a purpose, or moral)\nIt is about something I care about (engaging)\nEtc…\n\nWas there anything that you didn’t like?\nI didn’t understand the point of the story\nI didn’t get the backstory so couldn’t relate\nI wasn’t interested in the topic\n3\n\nTension\nIntro\nMoral\nTime\nTension\nTELL A STORY!\nClimax\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nAll of those points you brought up are right. There is a lot that goes into a great story. Great stories typically follow this framework which includes many of the points that you already brought up. \nThere is an introduction, background and a setting is provided. \nThere is a build up. Tension connects with you on some type of emotional level.\nThen something happens! (climax)\nAnd then you wrap the story up with some type of moral or purpose.\n\nWhy is storytelling an important skill when thinking about your pitch? \nA pitch is just a story!\nIntroduction: Introduce yourself and your business idea. What is the problem you have identified?\nTension: Give some more information. How big is this problem? Why so many people need your solution. Connect with people emotionally here!\nClimax: We can solve it! Tell us about your amazing idea here. How does it solve the problem?\nMoral: This is what we need. Your pitch should have an ending or some type of conclusion. This can be a moral, an ask, or a call to action.\n4\n\nKNOW YOUR AUDIENCE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nHow you choose to tell your story shouldn’t always be exactly the same way. There are other factors that go into great storytelling that would impact your delivery. \nA good story will shift and adapt depending on the situation. A pitch is the same thing. You have to be so clear on your business, you can talk about it in any situation. \nYou need to consider:\nWhat is important to your audience? Do they care about reducing costs, improving efficiency, or adapting to market changes? Share the solution for your audiences problem.\nWhat is the size of your audience?\nWhat is the education level of your audience?\nEtc…\n\nGo through each of the pictures and talk about the different ways you would want to communicate based on the situation. \nAsk: How would you pitch to a small group of business people?\nAnswer: Focus on numbers, impact on their business, formal, can be more personal and interactive because of the small group size, etc…\nAsk: How would you pitch to a large audience with hundreds or thousands of people? \nAnswer: A bit more general, possibly informative, find something common about the whole group they can relate to (if possible), etc…\nAsk: How would you pitch to a smaller group (maybe they are students for example)?\nAnswer: Focus on the groups needs, make connections with individuals and personalize things more, formal/informal depending on the group, etc…\nAsk: How would you pitch to a group of children? \n Answer: Can be fun and silly, get low on their level, use a friendlier voice, can add elements of magical storytelling, etc…\nAsk: How would you pitch to an investor focused on long-term returns or a customer who prioritizes smart, efficient solutions?\nAnswer: Emphasize business resilience, cost efficiency, and scalability over time. Show how your business adapts to market shifts and reduces risks. Highlight how your product/service saves time, reduces costs, or improves performance in a way that benefits them.\n\n\n5\n\nYOUR STANCE\n10 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What do you think about these people stances? Go one by one and discuss the good and bad things about each persons stance. Think about best practices and how each person can improve.\nPerson 1: She looks professional and friendly. She is very comfortable and has open body language. \nPerson 2: His hands clasped in front of him shows “closed” body language. This can show signs that he is uncomfortable or nervous. Some people might point out that he is smiling too much. It shows his personality here which is nice, but don’t over exaggerate too much or be unnatural. Some people might point out that he is leaning a little weird and that he should stand up straight.\nPerson 3: She looks confident, happy and comfortable. She looks confident here, but this is a slightly “closed” body position because her hands are in her pockets. Her thumbs are out of which actually shows confidence, but generally hands in pockets should be avoided. Be careful of hands in pockets because it can show a lot about how you are feeling!\nPerson 4: He looks happy, but his arms are crossed and crossed. This can signal to people that you are uncomfortable (same as crossed arms, fidgeting, or clasped hands).\n Person 5: He is referencing something on the board in this image. It is ok to reference the board; however, be careful how you do it. Don’t do it too often and make sure that your body is facing the audience! If you look at the board, it is very easy to do it too much and end up “talking to the board”. This is not good in a presentation as you want the audience’s eyes on you while you speak to THEM (not the board)!  Also his hand is in his pocket which is a “closed” position.\n\n\nBased on what we have already said, recap some best practices:\nStand confidently\nDon’t cross your arms, stay open\nTall and proud\nBe grounded, don’t wobble and fidget\nDon’t turn your back to the audience\nKeep good posture and aligned spine\nDon’t look over confident with chest pushed out too far, \n\nAgain, make sure that you consider the people in the room when considering your stance and body language. Who is in the room might change your stance.\nChildren: Get low, on their level\nFew people: Can gather around. Be comfortable with the group (still professional). If you are speaking to a small group is a great time to be engaging. Make eye contact with everyone.\nLarge group: This might be more of a formal presentation. \nElders or officials: You might want to show other signs of respect or have more “humble” body language.\n\n6\n\nYOUR VOICE\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe are humans. Pause, breathe, speak to people, not at them. Don’t shove information down their throats. \nAsk: What are some ways to use your voice to actually help you tell a better story?\nUse voice inflections. This will help people stay engaged by introducing new sounds and tones (show an example of speaking monotone vs speaking with inflections)\nTone can bring emotion into a story (build suspense, show happiness/sadness, etc…)\nDon’t scream, but be loud enough that people can hear what you are saying. \nDon’t whisper, nobody will be able to hear you! Speak to the people in the far back of the room.\n\n\n7\n\nSHOW YOUR PASSION!\nLook happy!\nBe yourself\nShow the business that you love and are passionate about!\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nPlease, LOOK HAPPY! \nBe yourself\nShow the business that you love and are passionate about!\nPeople often buy into the entrepreneur, not the idea\nI have seen so many entrepreneurs come up to pitch and they look too serious or very uncomfortable. When this happens, you appear unapproachable or it brings the feeling that you don’t really want to be there. \n\n8\n\nTHE 1 SENTENCE PITCH\nWHAT \ndo you do\n15 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAs mentioned earlier, it is important to be prepared to pitch your idea in a variety of situations and contexts. Trainer will draw a triangle on the board and use this shape to describe the content of your pitch depending on the time available.\nAt the point of the triangle (the top), there is a very little bit of time; therefore, the information shouldn’t be very detailed. When you only have a short period, clarity is the most important. WHAT do you do? \nAs you go down the triangle, it gets wider, leaving more time for more detailed information such as your strategy, finances, or traction. \nMake sure you prioritize the importance of the information to the audience. There is no need to talk about everything. Think about what is necessary based on the time you have and the audience you are talking to. \n\n10 minutes: Activity\nWe will focus on the 1 sentence pitch first. \nAsk the class “What should the 1 sentence pitch consist of?”\nAnswer: The core of your business. A clear sentence about what you do, emphasizing its relevance by addressing key challenges or improving efficiency.\nNo details are included in this, but it clearly shows what you do and touches on what makes you unique.\nExample: Tourism App is a mobile application to help tourists easily experience the real Kurdish culture. (that is it!)\n\n2 minutes: Everyone should write out their 1 sentence pitch.\nHave a few people share and give feedback depending on the time. \n\n9\n\nTHE 3 SENTENCE PITCH\nWHAT \ndo you do\nStrategy\nGrowth plan\nMore details\n8 minutes: Lecture + Discussion\n\nThe 3 minute pitch:\nAt the end of the program, you will all pitch for 3 minutes. \nWe went from the 1 sentence pitch to 3 minutes. \nDiscussion: What should we add into this with the additional time?\nCan talk more about strategy (including how your business adapts to challenges like shifting market conditions, rising costs, or changing consumer needs)\nHow you will make it happen (highlighting financial feasibility, operational efficiency, or competitive advantages).\nYour growth plan (considering long-term stability, scalability, and potential funding opportunities)\nMore details about your business (such as how your product/service improves performance, reduces costs, or meets evolving market demands).\nEtc…\n\n\nA question that might come up:\nWhy 3 minutes?\nWe believe that if you can’t explain your idea in 3 minutes, you don’t have a clear picture of your idea. \nThe pitch isn’t meant for you to explain every detail of your business, but rather to get the attention of the audience and lead to further conversations down the line.\nPeople will get distracted and not listen much longer after 3 minutes.\n3 minute pitches are the standard. If you are invited to a pitch competition, you should expect approximately 3 minutes to present.\n10\n\n5. Your Business Model\n6. Your Growth Strategy\n7. Your Team\n8. Your Ask\nThe Challenge\nThe Customers\nThe Solution\n Value Proposition\nKEY POINTS:\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nRecap the discussion from the previous slide: \nThere are so many things that you could include in your pitch, but as we said before, you want to prioritize some things. Here are some key points that should be included in your pitch:\nThe Challenge: What is the problem that you are solving? If you aren’t solving a problem, it probably isn’t a viable business idea.\nThe Customers: Who is facing that problem? \nThe Solution: How does your business offer a smarter, more effective, or cost-saving solution?\nValue Proposition: What makes your solution stand out—better performance, lower costs, long-term benefits?\nYour Business Model: How does your business work and make money?\nYour Growth Strategy: Is this idea sustainable? How do you see your business growing in the coming years? How do you plan on making that happen?\nYour Team: Who is going to make this happen? It is hard to believe that 1 person can do all of this alone! Who else is on your team?\nYour Ask: Why are you pitching? What are you asking for? Is it financial? Are you looking for help? Are you looking for another type of support?\n\nQuestion that might come up:\nHow can we do all of this in 3 minutes?\nRemind them that they don’t need a slide for every point. They are telling a story and combine these points in creative ways. \nPoints 1-4 are so closely tied into each other they can be covered in 1-2 slides if you wanted. \nYou don’t need to talk on every point for a long time, just touch on them. \n\n\n11\n\n10 minutes: Video + Discussion \n\nWatch the example pitch together.\nAsk: What did you think about this pitch?\nPotential answers: \nSpoke slowly\nA little hard to understand\nGreat use of visuals\nClearly defined problem\nOnly 3 minutes!\nEtc...\n\n12\n\nThree minutes to pitch\nTwo minutes for questions\nThree judges\nTHE PITCH\n5 minutes: Lecture + Q&A\n\nTo wrap up, I just want to give some more information about the pitch coming up on Thursday\nThree minutes to pitch: Each entrepreneur will have three minutes to pitch. \nWhy three minutes? We believe that if you can’t explain your idea in 3 minutes, you don’t have a clear picture of your idea. \nThe pitch isn’t meant for you to explain every detail of your business, but rather to get the attention of the audience and lead to further conversations down the line.\n3 minute pitches are the standard. If you are invited to a pitch competition, you should expect approximately 3 minutes to present.\nOnce the timer goes off, we will interrupt you and begin clapping. Make sure you have practiced so that you have a strong finish and don’t get interrupted because you ran out of time. \nTwo minutes for questions: After your pitch time is up, the judges will have 2 minutes to ask questions. The time will start once the first judge has finished asking his/her 1st question. Once the timer goes off, we will allow you to wrap up your answer, but no more questions will be asked. \nThree judges: During Ignite, we choose judges who are a part of our community. These judges have worked with entrepreneurs before or are entrepreneurs themselves. Some of them have even gone through Ignite. Trainers should share any relevant information about the judges that will be in attendance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-Defined Challenge\n\n(1-5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct or Service Meets Customers’ Needs\n(1-5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong Business Model\n\n(1-5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeasible Approach and Plan\n\n(1-5)\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative or Innovative Idea\n\n(1-5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact-Driven Pitch\n\n(1-5)\nJUDGING CRITERIA:\n55 minutes: Lecture + Activity\n\n5 minutes: Lecture + Q&A\nJudging criteria: \nWell-defined challenge: Does the entrepreneur have a clear understanding of the challenge or gap that they're trying to solve?\nProduct or service meets customers' needs: Does the entrepreneur's business idea clearly solve the challenge that they've defined, and is it supported by customer interviews and market data?\nStrong business model: How does the startup produce, deliver, and receive compensation for the product or service they are providing to their customer? Does the entrepreneur have an understanding of how they will make money? For nonprofits, have they thought through how to be sustainable and what types of organizations and people may be interested in sponsoring?\nFeasible approach and plan: Is the startup idea feasible in this context and market? Does the entrepreneur understand what steps need to be taken to launch, and will they be able to complete them?\nInnovative or creative business idea: Is this something new and creative? Does this have the potential to disrupt “business as usual”? Is the idea interesting and compelling?\nImpact-Driven Pitch: Does this business demonstrate a smart, adaptable, and resource-efficient approach to solving a real challenge?\nEach of these components will be judged from a score between 1-5\n\n50 minutes: Practice! \nNow, you will have the rest of the session to work on your pitches! We will come back together at 11:30 to talk about some final points. \nLet them go where they are comfortable to work on their pitches. \nThere are a ton of templates and free high quality pictures available to you.As you are creating your first pitches, consider taking a look at some of these resources:\nPowerpoint\nSlidescarnival\nFlaticon\nFreepik\n\n\nContinue working on your pitch deck!\nShare it with 2-3 other people for feedback!\nIf you choose to use slides, please use Google Slides!\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up!\n\n15\n\nTHANK YOU\nAny Questions?\n16\n"

How are you doing today? \nBy now we have done research and started to evaluate it. Today we will define clear problem statements for our personas and generate many ideas that you can use for your business. \n\n\nDefine your problem statement.\nLearn different ideation and selection techniques.\nChallenge assumptions you are making about your business.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nDefine your problem statement: First, we are going to continue from yesterday and write out a clear problem statement.\nLearn different ideation and idea selection techniques: Next, we will go over some ideation techniques to apply to our businesses to solve the problem statement you have identified. \nChallenge assumptions you are making about your business: By challenging your assumptions, we will make even the craziest ideas possible.\n\n\nIdeate to find the best ideas\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Can someone tell us where on the design thinking process we are today?\nSo far we have empathized with our customers and have reframed our data. Now we will clearly define the problem our “personas” are facing, and think through creative ways to solve the problem. \n\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n1 minute: Transition\n\nBased on the personas you have created, and their journey map we are now going to define problem statements. \nAn integral part of the design thinking process is the definition of a meaningful and actionable problem statement. This problem statement will be the focus when beginning problem solving. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the Design Thinking process. It is difficult; however, if you have done enough research, created your user personas, and went over their journey, it is not hard at all!\nHow Might We problem statement (30 minutes)\n\n\nHow might we help \n(our customers) (need as a verb), \nkeeping in mind (info about our customers and external factors like cost, resource constraints, or sustainability)?\nHOW MIGHT WE…\n10-15 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm\n\nA “How Might We” statement is a meaningful and actionable problem statement, which will allow you to ideate in a goal-oriented manner. Your HMW captures your design vision by defining the RIGHT challenge to address in the ideation sessions. You articulate a HMW statement by combining your knowledge about the user you are designing for, their needs, and the insights which you’ve come to know while researching and empathizing with them. \n\nGroup brainstorm: Make a How Might We statement for the tourism agency business:\nDo this together on the board\nAllow them to develop the HMW statement for the tourism agency business\nStep 1: Define your customer (which persona are you focusing on?)\nStep 2: What is that personas need? Remember to focus on needs as verbs to ensure a variety of solutions are possible\nStep 3: Write an insight about them \n\nSome answers they might end up with include:\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are worried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\nHow might we help local tourists find and book inexpensive vacations for their families keeping in mind they always look for recommendations from family and friends because they don’t trust the agencies. \nRemind the class that this information should be based on their research. The example we are giving might not be true because we don’t have any evidence to prove this.\n\n----------\nHere is some more information about HMW statements:\nIdeation sessions require dedicated environments for standing back to seek every angle after addressing the right problem. So Before starting to look for ideas, your team needs a clearly defined problem to tackle – a focused problem statement to inspire and guide everyone. \nYour HMW should be an actionable problem statement that will drive the rest of your design work.\n(HMW) questions are questions that have the potential to spark ideation sessions such as brainstorms. They should be broad enough for a wide range of solutions, but narrow enough that specific solutions can be created for them. “How Might We” questions should be based on the observations you’ve gathered in the Empathise stage of the Design Thinking process.\n\nFor example, you have observed that youths tend to not watch TV programs on the TV at home, some questions which can guide and spark your ideation session could be:\nHow might we make TV more social, so youths feel more engaged?\nHow might we enable TV programs to be watched anywhere, at any time?\nHow might we make watching TV at home more exciting?\nThe HMW questions open up to Ideation sessions where you explore ideas, which can help you solve your design challenge in an innovative way.\n\n\n\n\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find eco-friendly hotels, keeping in mind they are worried about sustainability and want to minimize their carbon footprint?\u000b\n15 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nGo over another example\nAfter you have created the HMW statement together, show them this one as another example of a good HMW statement.\nRecap: By defining a “How might we…?” question, you are able to clearly define the problem for your user and this will help prompt an effective pathway towards potential solutions. \n\n10-15 minutes: Activity\nCreate HMW statement\nNow, everyone should create HMW statements for each of your user personas that you have created. \nEach persona (that you made yesterday) should have their own HMW statement based on their individual needs\nMake sure to go around the room and help entrepreneurs define accurate statements. \nRemember to define needs as VERBS! If you don’t do this accurately, your ideation sessions will be limited to only a few answers. \n\n\nCREATIVITY\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is creativity? How can a person be creative? Are you born a creative person? Can you become a creative person?\nHave a discussion on the white board talking about a few of these points.\n\n\n- Steve Jobs\n“Creativity is just connecting things.”\n3 minutes: Explanation\n\n“Creativity is just connecting things” -Steve Jobs\nIt’s not something that some people have and others don’t.  It is about systematically going through the process of being creative to find solutions. Creativity isn’t inventing new things, it’s allowing you to think and consider things that weren’t obvious at first. Really creative people sometimes point out really obvious solutions that nobody put in this particular context before.\nFull quote from Steve jobs “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.”\nSometimes the answer is obvious, but you won’t look past your imagination or mental limits and roadblocks you put up or yourself\nSometimes we need to include other people who have more diverse experiences than we do\nWe need to be open to alternative possibilities and not think in a linear way\n\n\nIDEATION\n3 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is Ideation? Why is it important? How do you do it?\nHave a discussion on the white board talking about a few of these points.\nIdeation is a creative process where the people involved generate ideas in a variety of ways. \nIt is the third stage in the Design Thinking process. \nEntrepreneurs should aim to produce as many ideas as they can to address a problem statement\nIdeation is a judgment-free environment open to silly and crazy ideas.\n\nCome up with innovative ideas\nIdentify new opportunities\nBring together the strengths of your team.\nCreate volume and variety of ideas\n10\nIDEATION WILL HELP YOU:\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nIdeation will help you with:\nCome up with innovative ideas\nIdentify new opportunities\nBring together the strengths of your team.\nCreate volume and variety of ideas\nAsk: What else?\nAsk the right questions and innovate.\nStep beyond the obvious solutions and therefore increase the innovation potential of your solution.\nGet obvious solutions out of your heads, and drive your team beyond those simple solutions and into innovative ones.\n\n\n11\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nThrough creativity and ideation, you are turning messy problems and questions into solutions and good ideas. \nThe answer might not seem obvious, but over time, it can become clearer and clearer. Now that we have our problem statements, the solution won’t be very difficult to come up with.\n\n\n“It's not about coming up with the right idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of possibilities.” \n\n\n\n-Hasso Plattner \n\n\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\n“It's not about coming up with the ‘right’ idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of possibilities.” \nBefore we get into the brainstorming session, I want you to consider this quote. \nWe are going to set some ground rules to make sure that we are able to all of you leaving this session with a wide range of ideas and possibilities for your business. \n\nStart with “How Might We”\nNo judgement or criticism\nGo for weird, wacky and wild ideas\nConsider eco-impact\nQuantity over quality\nBe visual\nOne conversation at a time\nRULES\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nAsk: Before we begin the brainstorm, we need to set some ground rules. As always, it would be great to hear from you all first to see what rules you want to set for this brainstorm. \nTake 3-5 minutes to listen to everyone's ideas and write them down on the whiteboard. \n\nGreat, I have a few additional rules that I would like to add as well to make sure the session is really productive. \nStart with a problem statement (HMW): This is necessary to keep the team focused on the right topic. Make sure that you have defined your need as a verb, otherwise you will face roadblocks early on in the brainstorm.\nThere is no judgement or criticism: Write down everything! There is no such thing as a bad idea. By being bold and curious, you can challenge commonly held beliefs and explore possibilities past typically limited imagination. \nGo for weird, wacky and wild ideas: Even if these ideas seem ridiculous, it helps to break down barriers and think more creatively. Additionally, there could be an element that is applicable in a “bad” or “crazy” idea. The most innovative ideas are often these unrealistic or wacky ideas.\nConsider eco-impact: Could this solution be sustainable or reduce waste?\nQuantity over quality: Get as many as possible, try not to stop writing the whole time. By forcing yourself to go for quantity, you are reaching ideas that you would have never even considered.\nBuild on each others' ideas: Lets “Yes, and” this! Team members should take each others’ ideas and build on them, find ways to link concepts, recognize patterns and flip seemingly impossible notions over to reveal new insights.\nBe visual: If you cant express your idea, no worries, draw them out or express them in another way.\nOne conversation at a time: Don’t interrupt each other and let everyone on the team have an opportunity to speak and put their ideas to paper. \n\nRecap: By following these rules, you are setting yourself up for a successful brainstorm!\n\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are worried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\u000b\n5-8 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nSo let’s do a quick example all together. \nHave a brainstorm with the class on how to solve this HMW statement “How might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are worried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood”\nPotential answers could be:\nSharing pictures of hotel rooms\nGetting customer feedback\nRating systems\nHaving an application that shows restaurants, hotels, prices, tours, etc…\nCollecting information about all the hotels in the neighborhood/city/region in a database\nHave a transportation guide\nHave a security guide\n\nPush them to give crazier ideas\nWork with airlines to put hotels in the airports on the screens as tourists are arriving to filter through options\nRent a house in a village where it is super cheap, but can be cool for a cultural visit\nEtc…\n\n\n2 minutes: Recap\n\nGreat, you just saw how we were able to generate so many ideas in just a few minutes. \nRemember there are no bad ideas and different perspectives help generate more ideas!\nWe were able to break through any judgement and have everyone feel comfortable to throw out allow all kinds of ideas \nIt’s ok if you come up with “bad” ideas, because you never know who it might work for? – actually using bad ideas could be a great way to come up with good ones in some cases. \n\n\n16\nBRAINSTORM\n<1 minute: Explanation\n\nOk let’s get started!\nWe will spend the next 45 minutes brainstorming on the ideas of each other.\nEveryone should get into pairs. If there is an extra person, you can brainstorm with the trainer (a group of 3 would throw off the timing). \n\n\nRAPID BRAINSTORMING\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n\nRapid brainstorming: We are going to start off with a rapid brainstorm. \nYou will have 3 minutes for both partners to brainstorm on one HMW statement. \nOnce those 3 minutes are up, do another 3 minutes on the same HMW statement. Push harder. Go deeper. Be crazier.\nAfter 1 partner gets 6 minutes on his/her HMW statement, switch attention to the second person- Do the same thing for them.\n\nIf people are struggling, tell them that some answers could be solved by:\nThe trainer can share some ideas\nRemind them that any and all ideas are ok\nThink about crazy ideas\nImagine you were someone else, how would they solve the problem (a doctor, a teacher, a politician, etc…)?\n\n17\n\nSHARPENING YOUR BRAINSTORMING\nAs you refine your ideas, consider:\nCould this idea be more cost-effective by reducing resource use?\nCould it use materials that are cheaper and more available locally?\nCould it simplify operations by minimizing unnecessary waste?\nCould it offer a competitive advantage by being more efficient?\n18\n\n19\nBREAKING THE WALLS: “WHAT IF?” APPROACH\nWHAT IF?\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nGreat, rapid brainstorming is a great way to get a lot of ideas down on paper.\nWhat we are going to do now are “what if” brainstorms.\nWe will challenge some limitations we put on ourselves. \nBy breaking down these barriers, we allow ourselves to be more creative!\n\n$0\n10 minutes: Activity\n\n$0 brainstorm: Our first “What if” brainstorming approach is $0\nAsk: What if we had no money at all AND needed to reduce waste? How would we solve this problem? \nEach partner will get 5 minutes. \nDuring this time, the two people in the group put all their attention on solving the first partners HMW statement.\nAfter 5 minutes, they switch to focus on the other partner.\n\nIf people are struggling, tell them that some answers could be solved by:\nCommunity based ideas\nWorld changing ideas\nVolunteer led projects\nFree resources\nEtc…\n\n20\n\n$1,000,000..?\n10 minutes: Activity\n\n$1,000,000,000 brainstorm: Our second “What if” brainstorming approach is $1,000,000: \nAsk: What if we had all the money in the world AND had to future-proof our business against major risks? If money wasn’t an issue, how would we solve this problem? \nEach partner will get 5 minutes. \nDuring this time, the two people in the group put all their attention on solving the first partners HMW statement.\nAfter 5 minutes, they switch to focus on the other partner.\n\nIf people are struggling, tell them that some answers could be solved by:\nBuying expensive machinery or tools\nHiring amazing teams\nExpanding their products/services/locations\nUsing expensive technologies\nEtc…\n21\n\n?\n?\n?\n10 minutes: Activity\n\nWhat would Google do? The final brainstorming technique is to think about technology and big data!\nAsk: How would Google solve this problem? \nEach partner will get 5 minutes. \nDuring this time, the two people in the group put all their attention on solving the first partners HMW statement.\nAfter 5 minutes, they switch to focus on the other partner.\n\nIf people are struggling, tell them that some answers could be solved by:\nApplications\nWebsites\nAlgorithms\nInnovative technologies\nEtc…\n22\n\nWHICH IDEAS TO CHOOSE?\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAwesome, how did it go? Did you come up with any great ideas? Take a few minutes to hear from the group. What was their experience like? How many ideas do they have?\nIt is clear that we have been able to generate so many ideas. But what do we do with these? How do we evaluate them and which should we implement? Now what we are going to do is take a look at all of these ideas and try to prioritize them to see which ones you should actually implement for your businesses. We will look at 2 idea selection techniques:\nDot voting (5 minutes)\nNow, How, Wow (15 minutes)\n\n\nDot Voting\nNow, WoW & How.\n\n\nHOW TO SELECT IDEAS:\nDOT VOTING:\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nIdea selection and prioritization: We will look at 2 idea selection techniques: Dot voting and Now, How, Wow. We will start with Dot Voting.\nDot Voting: \nDot voting is very simple. Make sure all ideas which the participants have chosen are on individual Post-its. \nThen you give all participants a number of votes (around three to four should do per person). \nEach person will “vote” and choose their personal favorite ideas. \nParticipants vote by using stickers, post-it notes, or simply using a marker to make a dot on the ideas they like. This process allows every member to have an equal say in the shortlisted ideas. You can also use variations in color in order to let participants vote on which ideas they like the most or which they dislike the most.\nHave everyone take 5 minutes to vote for the ideas they liked the most during their brainstorm sessions\n\nAn alternative idea for selection (just for trainers information, no need to explain this):\nThe Four Categories method entails dividing ideas according to their relative abstractness, ranging from the most rational choice to the 'long shot'. The four categories are: the rational choice, the most likely to delight, the darling, and the long shot. This method ensures that the team covers all grounds, from the most practical to the ideas with the most potential to deliver innovative solutions. What Best practice: How Ideation participants decide upon one or two ideas for each of these categories: the rational choice, the most likely to delight, the darling, and the long shot. If you’re a relatively small team you simply discuss the pros and cons of the chosen ideas. \n\nNow, How, Wow:\nNow\nWow\nHow\n15 minutes: Activity\n\nPlot ideas\n5 minutes: Explanation\nAnother way to evaluate ideas is through the Now, How, Wow Matrix. This is a great tool for you to frame the best ideas and what you should actually begin to implement.\nExplain the differences between the categories.\nMake sure to note the x and y axis’. X axis is about how unique the idea is while y axis is about the ease of implementation of the idea. \nNow: These ideas are realistic. You can probably implement them right now; however, they might lack novelty.\nWow: These ideas are also realistic, climate-smart, and you were surprised by them. It is probably the case that nobody is doing this right now and it’s a good idea.\nHow: These ideas are big projects and probably require strategic innovation, considering sustainability. You don’t know where to start with these ideas, but might be great for the future. \nFourth box: If it is not feasible and not original, don’t even consider it! You can probably scrap those ideas.\n\n10 minutes: Application\n\nIDEA FILTERATION:\nMeet customer needs\nNew and creative\nFeasible\nTeam passion\nCan make money\n5 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nLastly, you want to do a final check in on your ideas. \nYou always want to make sure that this idea is something that is useful and valued by your customers.\nAsk these questions and check if it is in line with your customers needs\nDoes it fit with people's needs? Is there demand?\nDoes it really meet the goals set initially?\nDoes it meet the requirements in our problem statement/Point Of View?\nDoes it answer our “How Might We” questions in a satisfying way?\nIs it different enough from what exists to add additional value?\nDo we have access to the budget—enough to implement even partially?\nIs the technology available?\nWill we be able to roll it out with the available resources?\nCan we get approval from decision makers?\nCan it make money?\nGet rid of any that are problematic. \n26\n\n List obstacles\n Challenge those obstacles – What if?\n Test your solutions!\nCHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS\n15 minutes: Lecture + application\n\nI know that some of these ideas seem crazy, or even impossible, but don’t let that stand in your way of implementing an innovative or otherwise great idea. \nI would like to challenge you on some of the really crazy ideas you came up with. Take one of the “How” ideas and go through these steps. \n\nStep 1: List out all the obstacles that are in the way. Remember that everything is a perspective. The one and only “truth” does not exist. Even this statement is a perspective – or a belief. Typical assumptions include:\nThat it is impossible to do something – particularly within constraints such as time and cost.\nThat something works because of certain rules or conditions. \nThat people believe, think, or need certain things.\nThink money, resources, connections, legal barriers, time, etc...\n\nStep 2: Challenge assumptions: Assume that you can overcome and challenge all assumptions. For each of those obstacles, consider what if that particular obstacles end goal was actually possible\nAsk questions like “How could this be not true?” or “What if we could do this twice as well in half the time?”\nConsider if you could use an alternative resource\nIs there a way around the obstacle?\nCan you skip that step?\n\nStep 3: Find ways of making the challenge a reality: The real challenge is to make it happen in reality. \nTest your solutions! If this is something really worth doing, make some steps to actually try it out and see if it works! \nTest out any alternatives you identified and see if you could get around those obstacles. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nFirst principle story: Tell the story of Elon Musk as an example of how he challenges assumptions to create innovative businesses. \nHe uses the first principle theory to reevaluate problems by breaking challenges into its simplest parts.  \nHe uses this technique often when he faces barriers that might seem “impossible” to overcome.\nElon Musk had a dream to get to space. To do this, he needed to buy rockets.  He tried to buy rockets from the USA, but it was too expensive. He then went to Russia to see if there were better options for him; however, they were still too expensive. He negotiated with Russia 3 times to get rockets, but he had no success. He was really frustrated by this, but refused to quit. He started to ask himself why he couldn’t build the rockets himself. He asked, \"What if we build the rocket and the launch pad in a new way that cuts traditional costs for creating a rocket “. It sounds crazy to completely reinvent the rocket, but because he was able to ask those “what if” questions, it allowed him to overcome the financial barrier that was stopping him. He held a series of brainstorming sessions to find the best way to break down and rebuild a rocket. He worked with his team every week until they tackled the problem and found a cheaper way for creating rockets. He now has SpaceX and is changing the future of space exploration. \nMoral of the story is don’t let anything stop you. Break the problem down and find clever solutions around barriers. \nAsk “what-if” questions to help break down those barriers. \n\nAsk: How can you guys apply this theory to your businesses? Is it relevant for you?\n\n29\nBRAIN WALKING\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nGreat job today everyone!\nMake sure that you keep all of your work up on the walls. We will come back after lunch and “brain walk”\nSometimes we need to step back after brainstorming to collect your thoughts and regroup.\nThis afternoon we will all go around and read through everyone's ideas and provide additional feedback from the rest of the group. \nThis way you get more perspectives and hopefully more ideas!\n\nTHANK YOU!\nAny Questions?\n"
