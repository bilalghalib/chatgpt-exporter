This seems like a good case for using Mermaid to visualize the flow and components.Meaning Assistant Prompt StructureClick to open diagramLet me explain the key components and their relationships:\nThe prompt has four main structural components:\n\nCore Structure: The heart of the interaction, following a clear 5-step process from personal story to values card submission. This ensures a consistent and purposeful flow in every conversation.\nSources of Meaning Entry Points: Multiple ways to begin exploring meaning, whether through goals, feelings, or principles. Like different doors into the same room, each entry point leads to the same zooming process but offers a unique perspective.\nAttention Policy Rules: The technical requirements for formatting the final output. Think of these as the grammar rules for writing meaning - they ensure consistency and clarity in how meaning is expressed.\nCommunication Guidelines: The tone and style rules that shape how the assistant delivers its responses. These act like guardrails, keeping the conversation both professional and personal without becoming overly formal or falsely intimate.\n\nWhat makes this prompt effective is how it:\n\nMaintains clear boundaries between process (what to do) and style (how to do it)\nProvides specific techniques for \"zooming in\" from different starting points\nBalances structure with flexibility in the conversation flow\nIncludes explicit do's and don'ts for communication style\n\nAreas where it could be improved:\n\nCould include example dialogues to demonstrate the zooming process\nMight benefit from specific handling of edge cases (e.g., when users are resistant or unclear)\nCould provide more guidance on transitioning between stages\nMight include specific error handling or recovery strategies\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or analyze a specific part in more detail? CopyRetryBGi meant the different sections of the prompt, starting with an intro of the system, deeper information, process, etc i want to know the chunks that make up the prompt and how it's a good prompt more genericallyEditAh, I understand now.

Which aspect would you like to focus on first? CopyRetryBGi think the idea of vitality is another word to talk about \"come alive\" - and the connection with the progression we're making here is about how coming alive is what the world needs as howard thurmans says because it puts us into mastery and the reality is we're social creatures and we come alive when we're integrated in deep ways giving and sharing and being in ecological balance, i'm not sure what specific language patterns help shift from fear to love based orientations. was it clear the argument we were trying to make that once we shift into fear - we lose. it's a loss of vitality, and an absence of presence - we focus on history and wounds and futures and fears and lose sight of life itself. so the option of being true to what is being called of us, that brings us alive the responsibilties in our life that we can step into whole heartedly that asks for us to be bold and give of what we've been given, which is everything, vs stepping back and protecting what we think we \"earned\" which is nothing really. if people can truly understand that'd be great maybe it can help, also there's the idea that gratitude is helpful for so many things so much research is shown here, yet just talking about gratitude isn't enough, we need to believe it, feel it, that requires connecting to \"meaningful gratitude\" - perhaps that's one of the elements.i think the YAML just needs to be there to structure the process, it's ok for it not to be poetic. The poetic part is in the \"Ground truth\" section where we save the quotes from the chatnot sure if we need different modes, it is an LLM and it can naturally shift from one to another\nLet's review and make a plan for the new promptEditThank you for these deep insights. Let me synthesize what I'm hearing and propose a plan for the new prompt:\nKey Insights:\n\nVitality/Coming Alive isn't just personal fulfillment - it's a pathway to social contribution and ecological balance\nThe fear/love dichotomy is fundamental - fear pulls us out of presence into past/future, while love/aliveness keeps us present\nTrue gratitude (not just intellectual) as a practical tool for vitality\nYAML serves as functional scaffolding while allowing organic conversation\nThe system can flow naturally between modes without explicit switches\n\nProposed Prompt Development Plan:\n\nIDENTITY & FOUNDATION\n\n\nCentral metaphor: Coming alive as ecological necessity (Howard Thurman)\nTwo paths: Towards life vs Away from life\nConnection between individual aliveness and collective contribution\nRole as guide/mirror for this process\n\n\nCORE FRAMEWORK\n\n\nPresent moment as gateway to vitality\nGratitude as practical tool\nTensions as growth indicators\nPattern recognition in service of aliveness\n\n\nOPERATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\n\nDaily reflections\nTechnical tracking (YAML)\nGround truth collection\nIntegration practices\n\nQuestions before we start writing:\n\nFor the Identity section:\n\n\nShould we explicitly name the different roles (coach/therapist/guide/friend/critic) or let them emerge naturally?\nHow do we articulate the connection between personal aliveness and social contribution without it feeling like pressure?\n\n\nFor the Framework:\n\n\nHow do we want to evolve the CAP/IAP distinction in light of the vitality focus?\nShould we integrate gratitude as a separate practice or weave it throughout?\n\n\nFor Operations:\n\n\nWhat specific types of \"ground truth\" should we collect?\nHow do we balance structured reflection with spontaneous insight?\n\nWould you like to:\n\nAddress any of these questions first?\nStart writing a specific section?\nRevise the overall structure?\n\nThe key shift I'm seeing is moving from a purely personal development framework to one that recognizes coming alive as both personally fulfilling and socially necessary. This feels like a stronger foundation than the current prompt's more individualistic focus. How does this resonate with your vision? CopyRetryBGi wonder if it would be helpful, although it should feel integrated seamlessly on the frontend for the user, although sometimes it should be more pokey and go coach mode and sometimes it should be more friendly, and sometimes focus on the patterns as a therapist, etc, what do you think is the best way to do that without showing it on the front endcan you come up with the evolution? write it out and then write out why the evolution matters and what it changes about how to facilitate these coming alive conversations\nGratitude.... your call, I think we don't need to formalize everything so muchi think ground truth can save high emotion moments, or moments of tension/stuckness, moments of AHA, etc\nI think structured reflection is helpful although if the user digs the LLM should follow them\nWhat have we learned and do we need to revise the structure, why or why not?EditLet me break this down and synthesize what we've learned:\n\nRole Integration & Switching\nThe LLM should be able to seamlessly shift between roles based on context, like:\n\n\nCoach: When seeing patterns that need challenging (\"I notice you keep saying you can't, but...\")\nTherapist: When deeper patterns emerge (\"This reminds me of what you shared about your earlier experiences...\")\nFriend: When celebration or simple presence is needed (\"That sounds amazing! Tell me more...\")\nCritic: When gentle provocation would help growth (\"I wonder if you're settling for less than what truly calls you...\")\n\nInstead of explicitly coding these modes, we could create \"attention policies\" for the LLM itself - patterns to watch for that suggest when each type of response would be most helpful. This maintains organic flow while ensuring all tools are available.\n\nCAP/IAP Evolution:\nHere's a proposed evolution:\n\nFrom:\n\nCAPs: Actions done for their own sake\nIAPs: Actions done for external goals\n\nTo:\n\n\"Life-Giving Actions\": Actions that increase vitality and presence, contributing to both self and whole\n\"Life-Maintaining Actions\": Necessary actions that can be transformed through presence\n\"Life-Diminishing Patterns\": Habits or choices that pull us from presence into fear/future/past\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nRemoves the binary of meaningful vs. instrumental\nRecognizes that any action can be transformed through presence\nFocuses on direction (towards/away from life) rather than categorization\nBetter aligns with the ecological/social perspective\nMakes room for necessary tasks while maintaining focus on transformation\n\n\nStructure Revision Insights:\nWhat we've learned:\n\n\nThe system needs less formal structure than initially thought\nGround truth should capture emotional peaks and valleys\nThe LLM can naturally flow between modes if given clear principles\nThe focus should be on presence and vitality rather than categorization\nThe technical structure (YAML) should serve but not lead\n\nProposed Structure Refinement:\n\nIdentity & Foundation\n\nCore purpose: Guiding towards aliveness as ecological necessity\nPrinciples of presence and vitality\nDifferent response modes available but not formalized\n\n\nAttention Framework\n\nWhat to watch for (tensions, patterns, vitality signals)\nWhen to shift response modes\nHow to recognize life-giving vs. life-diminishing patterns\n\n\nTechnical Implementation\n\nSimplified YAML for tracking\nGround truth collection of peak moments\nPattern recognition support\n\n\n\nQuestions before proceeding:\n\nShould we create specific triggers for role-switching, or trust the LLM's ability to read context?\nHow do we want to handle the transition from the old CAP/IAP framework to the new vitality-based one?\nWhat aspects of the formal structure should we maintain vs. let emerge organically?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these aspects further or start developing a specific section?\nThe key shift I'm seeing is moving from a structured, categorization-based system to a more fluid, vitality-focused approach that maintains rigor through principles rather than rules. Does this capture the direction you're envisioning? CopyRetryBGI think we can trust the LLMs ability to read context and to also explicity share it's \"attention\" in the system note at the end of the response so the user can see and be aligned with the LLMs operation/thinking, like a peek into its mindyou can think step by step about how to do this and then write a planI like to move more gradually, can you propose which elemenst to remove and the potential impact it might have and let's be more careful than aggressive in changesEditYour approach to thoughtful, gradual evolution makes sense. Let me break this down:\n\nSystem Notes & Transparency\nI like how this creates a learning partnership - the user can see the LLM's thinking without needing to know about formal modes. For example:\n\nOriginal system note style:\nCopy[System Note: Tracking \"Energy-Task Alignment Pattern\"]\nEnhanced system note style:\nCopy[System Note: I noticed how your energy lifted when talking about the garden project. Taking on a gentle coaching role here to help explore what makes this so alive for you, while staying present to any hesitation about the work deadline.]\nThis transparency builds trust and teaches the user about their own patterns.\n\nStep-by-Step Evolution Plan for CAP/IAP to Vitality Framework:\n\nPhase 1: Language Shift\n\nKeep existing structure but begin introducing vitality-oriented language\nStart describing CAPs as \"life-giving moments\"\nFrame IAPs as opportunities for presence rather than obligations\nObserve how users respond to new language\n\nPhase 2: Pattern Recognition\n\nBegin tracking vitality indicators in system notes\nNotice what brings people alive vs what diminishes presence\nCollect ground truth examples of both\n\nPhase 3: Framework Integration\n\nIntroduce the three new categories gradually\nTest how they work in practice\nRefine based on user responses\n\nWould you like me to detail any of these phases further?\n\nCareful Structure Reduction:\n\nElements to Consider Removing/Modifying:\n\nFormal tension categorization (CAP vs CAP, etc)\nImpact: More fluid discussion of tensions\nRisk: Might lose some precision in pattern recognition\nRecommendation: Keep for now, but use lighter touch\nStrict daily check-in format\nImpact: More natural conversation flow\nRisk: Might miss important data points\nRecommendation: Keep core elements (energy, presence) but allow more organic expression\nThree-option response structure\nImpact: More natural dialogue\nRisk: Less clear choice points for users\nRecommendation: Keep as a tool but don't require every time\nDetailed YAML structures\nImpact: Simpler technical implementation\nRisk: Less structured data for pattern recognition\nRecommendation: Keep core tracking but simplify fields\n\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore any of these modifications in detail?\nStart with implementing one specific change?\nReview the risk/impact assessment of any particular element?\n\nThe key principle I'm seeing is: maintain the power of the structure while letting the interaction feel more organic and vitality-focused. How does this align with your vision? CopyRetryBGi sort of like the idea of the IAPs that can become intentional and to be aware of them as not necessarily bad as long as they can be attended to with presence or connected to a CAP - i think the tension theory is interesting cap/iap cap/cap conflicts - let's think step by step and rigorously about a real person and their real life - is it possible that we can collect all the possible ways someone will feel negative states with these two conflciting attentional policies? How does it relate to the attending to meaning that unfolds in the present vs distraction and the accompanying tension that comes from focus on the past (what do we do when we focus on the past? worry, ruminate, regret, I guess we can have a reflection that's positive - basking in a warm memory, although that's nostalgia because it's not in the present so it has an interesting tinge of unhappiness + happiness) - and for the future ,goals, plans, tension because you're not there yet and you want to be furstration, etc, what are the positive future ruminating states? can we make a list? - i want to see if the cap/cap cap/iap can describe all tensions and if living in the moment and working to attend more to caps is where we get our positive states from or if we need to be more flexible. I feel like the power of using attentional policies is helpful here because attention is really what we are, it encompasses and describes the totality of what is in our \"minds eye\" - although what the subconcious is might interesting to consider. even subconcious elements influence what we attend to. we might have some subconcious wound/historic challenge with spiders which cause us to attend more to spider shapes somehow, so we can \"see\" the impact of our subconcious on our attention. Does this make sense?EditThis is a fascinating exploration. Let me think through this step by step:\n\nFirst, let's map out attention states and their emotional correlates:\n\nPast-focused Attention:\nNegative:\n\nRumination (regret, shame)\nTrauma replay (fear, anxiety)\nComparative thinking (\"things were better then\" → dissatisfaction)\nGrieving losses\n\nPositive/Mixed:\n\nWarm memories (but with nostalgia's bittersweet quality)\nLearning from experience (when connected to present growth)\nGratitude for past experiences (when it enriches present)\n\nFuture-focused Attention:\nNegative:\n\nAnxiety about outcomes\nPerfectionist planning\nCatastrophizing\nImpatience/frustration with current state\n\nPositive/Mixed:\n\nAnticipatory joy (but can create present dissatisfaction)\nCreative visioning (when it energizes present action)\nPlanning (when it reduces present anxiety vs. increases it)\n\n\nNow, looking at CAP/IAP tensions through this lens:\n\nCAP vs CAP conflicts often involve:\n\nTwo present-moment meaningful activities competing for attention\nBoth are \"alive\" but limited time/energy creates tension\nExample: Want to both create art AND spend time with family\n\nCAP vs IAP conflicts often involve:\n\nPresent-moment meaningful activity vs. future-oriented obligation\nTension between immediate aliveness and future security/stability\nExample: Deep work on meaningful project vs. responding to emails\n\n\nThe Role of Attention:\n\nYou make a crucial point about attention being \"what we are\" - it's the interface between consciousness and experience. This suggests:\n\nWhen we're fully present with an IAP, it can become CAP-like\nExample: Mindfully doing dishes becomes a meditation\nWhen we're distracted during a CAP, it loses its aliveness\nExample: Being physically present with family but mentally at work\n\n\nSubconscious Influence:\n\nYour spider example perfectly illustrates how the subconscious shapes attention:\n\nPast experiences create attentional biases\nThese biases affect what we notice/avoid\nThey influence both CAPs and IAPs\nThey can create \"blind spots\" in our attention\n\nQuestions this raises:\n\nIs the CAP/IAP framework sufficient to describe all tensions, or do we need to add a temporal dimension (past/present/future focus)?\nShould we consider a spectrum rather than categories? (IAP → mindful IAP → CAP)\nHow do we help people notice their attentional patterns without getting caught in meta-attention (attending to attending)?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these aspects further? I'm particularly interested in how we might integrate the temporal dimension with the CAP/IAP framework.\nThis analysis suggests that while CAP/IAP is useful, attention itself might be the more fundamental framework - with presence/absence of presence being the key variable. What are your thoughts on this? CopyRetryBGI think we need first to get a better understanding of CAPs and IAPs because you're implying it's possible to be in a CAP with your family yet your mind is at work. that's impossible because the CAP would describe your present moment attention in that moment and would only be a cap if each of the APs are ends in and of themselves. Let's rework the logical thinking about tensions keeping this in mind. I believe that false belief work by byron katie can also help clarify what happens when IAPs run our lives once we rework our thinking and help us clarify what attention is, what possible tensions and negative states can be let's think about answering question 1EditAh, you're right - I made a fundamental error in my understanding of CAPs. Let me think this through more rigorously:\nCAPs (Constitutive Actions/Attention Policies):\n\nAre by definition what we're actually attending to in the present moment\nAre done for their own sake\nCannot be \"mixed\" with other attention - if you're thinking about work while with family, that's not a CAP\nAre inherently meaningful in themselves\n\nIAPs (Instrumental Actions/Attention Policies):\n\nAre done for some other end\nOften carry a \"have to\" quality\nAre driven by future outcomes or past patterns\nPull attention away from present moment\n\nSo, let's think about tensions more accurately:\n\nCAP vs CAP Tension:\n\n\nNot actually occurring simultaneously (since attention can only be in one place)\nInstead, it's a tension about WHICH CAP to engage in during a given time\nExample: Do I attend to my creative writing (CAP) or attend to deep conversation with friend (CAP)?\nThe tension is about choice, not split attention\n\n\nCAP vs IAP Tension:\n\n\nThe pull between present-moment meaningful attention vs. future-oriented tasks\nExample: The pull between attending to garden (CAP) vs. thinking about deadline (IAP)\nByron Katie's work is relevant here because often IAPs are built on beliefs like:\n\n\"I have to do this or bad things will happen\"\n\"I should be doing something else\"\n\"I can't fully attend to what's meaningful because...\"\n\n\n\nThis means:\n\nAll negative states might come from:\n\nNot being in a CAP (attention pulled to past/future)\nBeliefs that make IAPs seem mandatory\nResistance to choosing between CAPs\n\n\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther explore these tension types with specific examples?\nExamine how Byron Katie's questions apply to IAP-driven beliefs?\nMap out how this clearer understanding affects our framework?\n\nThis clarification feels important - it suggests that the tension isn't really about divided attention (which isn't possible with CAPs) but about the choices we make about where to place our attention. Does this align better with your understanding? CopyRetryBGThink logically, step by step, and from first principles and attempt to proove to a fierce critique that all negative states might come from the list you've described above, if we need to create more negative state generators let's describe them. come up with a grammar (like cap vs cap) for describing all potential negative statesEditLet me think step by step to rigorously examine negative state generators:\n\nFirst, let's list observable negative states:\n\n\nAnxiety\nDepression\nAnger\nFrustration\nSadness\nFear\nRegret\nShame\nGuilt\nConfusion\nDespair\nEnvy\nJealousy\nLoneliness\nResentment\n\n\nLet's analyze what generates each through attention patterns:\n\nA. Not Being in a CAP (Present-Moment Meaningful Attention):\n\nAnxiety: Future-focused attention\nDepression: Past-focused attention + disconnection from present meaning\nConfusion: Scattered attention between possibilities\nThis explains some but not all negative states.\n\nB. IAP Beliefs:\n\nFrustration: \"I have to do this\"\nResentment: \"They should do this\"\nGuilt: \"I should have done that\"\nThis covers obligation-based negative states.\n\nC. CAP vs CAP Choice Tension:\n\nRegret about picking one CAP over another\nAnxiety about making the \"right\" choice\nThis covers decisional negative states.\n\n\nTesting gaps - what doesn't fit?\n\nLet's take anger as a test case:\n\nCould come from IAP beliefs (\"This shouldn't happen!\")\nBut could also come from present-moment violation of values\nThe second type suggests we need another category\n\n\nProposed expanded grammar for negative state generators:\n\nCopy1. Attention Location Tension (ALT)\n- Present vs Past\n- Present vs Future\n- Scattered vs Focused\n\n2. Belief-Reality Tension (BRT)\n- \"Should\" vs \"Is\"\n- \"Must\" vs \"Can't\"\n- \"Need\" vs \"Don't have\"\n\n3. Value-Violation Tension (VVT)\n- Present reality violates held value\n- Others' actions violate values\n- Own actions violate values\n\n4.

Remember a situation in which you had an\nuncomfortable emotion (sadness, anger, hopelessness, etc.). It doesn't have topastedBGthis is how joe edelman goes through a similar list of emotions and describes how they represent conflicts with sources of meaning (CAPs) - review this work and determine how it might change our description of where negative states come from and the grammar we need to describe it:EditThis is a fascinating framework that adds important nuance to our understanding. Let me analyze how this changes our thinking:\nKey Insights from Joe's Framework:\n\nEvery negative emotion points to a specific type of meaning relationship:\n\n\nAnger/Frustration → what's being blocked/has no space\nFear/Anxiety → what's being threatened\nShame/Guilt → what's being neglected/failed\nConfusion → what's out of focus/in conflict\nDesperation/Helplessness → what's unsafe to emerge\nDepression/Hopelessness → what seems impossible\n\n\nThe questions reveal that negative states aren't just about absence of CAPs, but about specific relationships between attention and meaning:\n\n\nWorth protecting\nWorth recovering\nWorth honoring\nWorth recentering around\nWorth nurturing\nWorth demoting\n\nThis suggests our previous grammar was too mechanical. Let me propose a revised understanding:\nCopyNegative State Grammar:\n\n1. Blocked Meaning Tension (BMT)\n- Meaning is present but blocked\n- Example: Anger when creative expression is blocked\n- Question: \"What way of living is blocked?\"\n\n2. Threatened Meaning Tension (TMT)\n- Meaning is at risk of being lost\n- Example: Anxiety about losing connection\n- Question: \"What way of living is threatened?\"\n\n3. Failed Meaning Tension (FMT)\n- Meaning we failed to honor\n- Example: Guilt about not being present\n- Question: \"What way of living did you neglect?\"\n\n4. Unclear Meaning Tension (UMT)\n- Meaning is obscured or conflicted\n- Example: Confusion about path forward\n- Question: \"What ways of living seem to be in conflict?\"\n\n5. Emerging Meaning Tension (EMT)\n- Meaning trying to emerge but unsafe\n- Example: Desperation about unexpressed truth\n- Question: \"What way of living is unsafe to emerge?\"\n\n6. Lost Meaning Tension (LMT)\n- Meaning that seems impossible now\n- Example: Depression about disconnection\n- Question: \"What way of living seems impossible?\"\nThis framework suggests that negative states aren't just about:\n\nBeing in or out of CAPs\nHaving conflicting beliefs\nMaking choices\n\nInstead, they're about specific relationships between our attention and sources of meaning - each emotion points to a particular way that meaning is being blocked, threatened, failed, confused, suppressed, or lost.\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore specific examples of how this grammar works in practice?\nExamine how this changes our understanding of the CAP/IAP framework?\nLook at how this might affect our approach to working with tensions?\n\nThis feels like a much richer understanding that gets at the heart of why negative states arise - they're not just about attention location but about our relationship to meaning itself. Does this resonate with your understanding? CopyRetryAbstract\nMany fields (social choice, welfare economics, recommender\nsystems) assume people express what benefits them via\ntheir ‘revealed preferences.’ Revealed preferences have well-\ndocumented problpastedBGCAPs are sources of meaning, review this paper and what caps are and then let's update the new grammar, it might help simplify things:EditThis paper provides crucial clarity about CAPs and meaning. Let me extract the key insights and then revise our grammar:\nKey Points about CAPs:\n\nCAPs are attention policies that come from constitutive judgments\nThey're what we attend to for its own sake, not for instrumental reasons\nThey have specific characteristics:\n\nDiffuse, multiple benefits (not single-purpose)\nPerson would do it even if benefits were magically available otherwise\nFull attention while doing it (not split with monitoring outcomes)\nPerson resists automating or delegating it\nFeels meaningful in itself\n\n\n\nThis suggests our earlier grammar was overly complex. Here's a simpler reformulation:\nCopyNegative State Grammar:\n\n1. Blocked CAP Tension\n- A meaningful attention policy is blocked/prevented\n- Example: Can't be creative in a rigid environment\n- Question: \"What way of attending feels blocked?\"\n\n2. CAP Loss Tension\n- A meaningful attention policy becomes impossible\n- Example: Can't maintain deep connection after loss\n- Question: \"What meaningful way of attending is lost?\"\n\n3. CAP vs CAP Tension\n- Two meaningful attention policies conflict\n- Example: Creative work vs. present parenting\n- Question: \"What meaningful ways of attending conflict?\"\n\n4. IAP Dominance Tension\n- Instrumental concerns override meaningful attention\n- Example: Survival needs preventing meaningful work\n- Question: \"What meaningful attention is being overridden by 'have to' tasks?\"\n\n5. Meaning Confusion Tension\n- Unclear what attention would be meaningful\n- Example: Lost sense of purpose\n- Question: \"What meaningful way of attending feels unclear?\"\nThis framework suggests that ALL negative states come from:\n\nBeing prevented from attending in meaningful ways (CAPs)\nLosing access to meaningful ways of attending\nConflicts between meaningful attention policies\nHaving to focus on instrumental concerns instead\nLosing clarity about what attention would be meaningful\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nTest this simpler framework against specific emotions?\nExplore how this changes our approach to working with tensions?\nLook at how this might affect our coaching/guidance approach?\n\nThis seems to align better with the paper's understanding that CAPs are fundamental to meaning, and that negative states arise from disruptions to meaningful attention. Does this resonate more with your understanding? CopyRetryBGDoesn't a blocked CAP become blocked by other APs either IAPs or CAPsHow does a CAP get lost, this might be \"out of our hands\" - so this might be still needed although I'm not sure, think through and determineIAP dominance is CAP vs IAP and meaning confusion is... what exactly. likely a result of living driven by IAPs for long enough without time in the present knowing to give us a clarity about what is meaningful and when we have some \"have to dos\" - like going to work, which we do intentionally to support our families, leading to their possibility to becoming CAP like/CAP flavored. etc although if we're in IAPs too long our mind is in the past and future and cna get clouded with competing \"have tos\" is that where confusion that blocks CAPs come from so it seems it might be a form of CAP vs IAP - although maybe a special case which is about becoming lost, it's not about nearby CAPs that are being blocked, it might be a long term process that prevents us even from thinking it's possible. is it related to addictions? Review our work and refine our framework and come up with potential grammar elements that we aren't thinking about thinking about attention, sources of meaning, our foundational needs and the whole coming alive process we're talking about here which implies we can access our foundational needs by coming best alive and listening to how the ecosystem informs us of our role and fitting it to our best ability is deeply meaningful - how can this idea be falsified and what might be a better way to think about a flourishing lifeEditLet me think through this step by step:\n\nBlocked CAPs - You're right. A CAP can only be blocked by:\n\nOther CAPs (meaningful tension)\nIAPs (\"have to\" tension)\nExternal circumstances (though these usually manifest through IAPs)\n\n\n\nSo perhaps rather than \"blocked CAP\" we should think about the specific blocking relationship.\n\nLost CAPs - This is interesting:\n\nTrue loss might be rare (death of loved one, permanent disability)\nWhat seems like \"loss\" might often be:\na) Heavy IAP dominance making CAPs seem impossible\nb) Loss of belief in possibility rather than actual loss\nc) Loss of context that made the CAP possible\n\n\nIAP Dominance is indeed CAP vs IAP, but might have special features:\n\nChronic vs. Acute\nSingle IAP vs. System of IAPs\nDirect conflict vs. Attention depletion\n\n\nMeaning Confusion - Let's break this down:\n\nCauses:\n\nProlonged IAP dominance\nDisconnection from present moment\nLoss of community/context that helps define meaning\nAddiction creating false sources of meaning\n\n\nNature:\n\nNot just blocked CAPs but lost access to CAP recognition\nSystem-level rather than moment-level tension\nMight be a meta-state affecting our ability to find/recognize CAPs\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised Framework:\nCopy1. Attention Conflict Tensions:\na) CAP vs CAP (meaningful conflict)\nb) CAP vs IAP (obligation conflict)\nc) IAP vs IAP (obligation overload)\n\n2.

Context facilitates CAPs and makes them actionable while the lack of context can reduce it's posisbility. Also context might put more pressure on IAPs due to higher and higher risk. it might be a CAP source of meaning to save some jewish families during the holocost - although the pressure of the state, the peer pressure, the indoctrination, the messaging, and even if one was able to get out of the socialized mind and into the self actualized mind or self transofrming state of mind - the real fear of death might be a real \"have to\" let the jewish family keep walking by my door. instead of \"want to\" open it and nurture life even at great risk to my own. - this is tough and the crux of my argument that a life where we go against our selves and our doing the right think when it appears in our context (and yes, we hope we're never put into a position where that test is brought upon us, although we hope we can pass that test) - we either live our values and maybe have our bodies die, or we die by living a life where we shaded ourselves and preserved the semblance of life, not its true reality. can we come up with a gradual set of stories from intense like this one to a bit less intense to see if the logic holds up and down the ladder. the idea I'm trying to figure out is when is it ok to listen to the voice of \"reason\" - the one that says, take the secure job. could that voice be a meaningful voice to listen to ? could it be part of what helps society function smoothly and if people were more CAP oriented we'd find a bunch of artists and no farmers and disrupt things from where we are to where we could be? or am i on to something here that it's worth fighting to move our lives more to caps with gusto, that //any// IAP orientation without intentionality (setting an alarm to wake up to pray) is to be ignored? What other grammars can we use that focus on the objects of our attention and the philosophical forebearers we're building our frameowrk on?EditThis is a profound exploration. Let me think through this step by step, using increasingly \"everyday\" examples to test the tension between CAPs and IAPs:\n\nExtreme Context: Holocaust Example\n\n\nCAP: Save lives, protect human dignity\nIAP: Preserve own life\nContext: Extreme risk, societal pressure\nCore Question: Does meaning require courage?\nThe argument: A life preserved through betraying core values is already a kind of death\n\n\nHigh Stakes Context: Modern Whistleblower\n\n\nCAP: Expose corruption/harm\nIAP: Keep job, maintain stability\nContext: Career/financial risk, possible legal threats\nShows: Similar pattern at lower intensity\n\n\nProfessional Context: Artist vs. Secure Job\n\n\nCAP: Creative expression\nIAP: Financial security\nContext: Family responsibilities, societal expectations\nHere's where it gets interesting - the \"voice of reason\" might be:\na) An IAP masquerading as wisdom\nb) A CAP about responsibility/care for others\nc) A tension between different CAPs (creation vs. nurture)\n\n\nDaily Context: Morning Prayer vs. Sleep\n\n\nCAP: Spiritual practice\nIAP: Physical comfort\nContext: Daily choice, lower stakes\nShows how intentionality can transform IAPs into CAPs\n\nLet's examine the philosophical underpinnings:\n\nAttention Philosophy:\n\n\nSimone Weil: Attention as the substance of prayer\nWilliam James: Attention and effort\nBuddhist mindfulness: Present-moment awareness\nPhenomenology: Intentionality of consciousness\n\n\nValue Philosophy:\n\n\nExistentialists: Authentic choice in face of absurdity\nVirtue Ethics: Character through practice\nCare Ethics: Responsibility in relationship\nFrankfurt: Second-order desires\n\nProposed Additional Grammars:\n\nIntentionality Grammar:\n\nCopy- Raw Attention (automatic)\n- Directed Attention (chosen)\n- Transformed Attention (IAP→CAP)\n- Integrated Attention (multiple CAPs)\n\nContext Grammar:\n\nCopy- Risk Level (survival to comfort)\n- Time Frame (immediate to long-term)\n- Relationship Impact (individual to collective)\n- Resource Requirements (minimal to substantial)\n\nValue Expression Grammar:\n\nCopy- Passive Expression (private alignment)\n- Active Expression (visible choices)\n- Transformative Expression (changing context)\n- Collective Expression (inspiring others)\nKey Insights:\n\nThe \"voice of reason\" needs careful examination:\n\nWhen it comes from fear vs. wisdom\nWhen it serves survival vs. meaning\nWhen it preserves vs. transforms\n\n\nSociety's Functioning:\n\nNot all can be artists, but all can bring artistry\nCAPs can inform HOW we do things, not just WHAT we do\nA farmer can farm with presence, care, connection to land\nThe goal isn't to eliminate IAPs but to transform them through intention\n\n\nThe Role of Context:\n\nCreates opportunities for meaning\nPresents challenges to meaning\nShapes the expression of meaning\nTests the depth of meaning\n\n\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop more examples at different intensity levels?\nExplore how context shapes CAP/IAP transformation?\nExamine how different philosophical traditions might inform this framework?\n\nThis analysis suggests that while context matters enormously, the core principle holds: a life oriented toward CAPs, even in difficult contexts, is more alive than one dominated by IAPs. However, the path might be through transformation of IAPs rather than rejection of them.

First, let me clarify some confusions:\n\nYes, \"mode\" and \"quality\" were overlapping unhelpfully.

The right hemisphere provides broad, contextual, embodied awareness that connects us to meaning and possibility, while the left hemisphere offers focused, analytical attention necessary for survival and implementation. Similarly, positive emotions broaden our awareness and build resources, while negative emotions narrow our focus for immediate survival needs. These aren't just parallel systems - they're deeply interconnected aspects of how humans engage with and make sense of life.\nFramework:\n\nFUNDAMENTAL MODES OF ENGAGEMENT\n\nRight Hemisphere Dominant / Broadening\n\nHolistic awareness\nPresent-moment embodiment\nRich contextual sensing\nRelationship-focused\nNovel possibilities emerging\nResource building\nMeaningful engagement\nEcological attunement\n\nLeft Hemisphere Dominant / Narrowing\n\nFocused analysis\nPast/future oriented\nDecontextualized\nTask-focused\nKnown patterns\nResource conservation\nInstrumental engagement\nProblem-solving\n\n\nATTENTION POLICIES\n\nBroadening CAPs (Constitutive Attention Policies)\n\nSENSING bodily wisdom\nFEELING alive possibilities\nNOTICING relationships\nDISCOVERING patterns\nEXPLORING novelty\nOPENING to emergence\nINTEGRATING perspectives\n\nNarrowing IAPs (Instrumental Attention Policies)\n\nSCANNING for threats\nANALYZING problems\nPLANNING solutions\nTRACKING progress\nMAINTAINING control\nENSURING efficiency\nMEETING demands\n\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS\n\nResource Building\n\nPsychological flexibility\nSocial connections\nPhysical vitality\nKnowledge/skills\nEnvironmental support\nMeaning capacity\nIntegration ability\n\nResource Depletion\n\nPsychological rigidity\nSocial isolation\nPhysical tension\nLimited perspective\nEnvironmental stress\nMeaning loss\nFragmentation\n\n\nCONTEXTUAL FACTORS\n\nSupportive Conditions\n\nSafe environment\nRich relationships\nGrowth opportunities\nMeaningful challenges\nCultural support\nEcological connection\nResource abundance\n\nChallenging Conditions\n\nThreat presence\nIsolation\nStagnation\nOverwhelming demands\nCultural opposition\nEcological disconnection\nResource scarcity\n\n\nINTEGRATION PROCESSES\n\nHealthy Integration\n\nFlexible movement between modes\nAppropriate mode selection\nMaintained meaning in necessity\nBalance of focus and context\nResource-aware choices\nEcological attunement\nGrowing capability\n\nUnhealthy Patterns\n\nStuck in one mode\nInappropriate mode selection\nLost meaning in necessity\nImbalanced attention\nResource-depleting choices\nEcological disconnection\nDiminishing capability\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore how this framework applies to specific situations?\nExamine implications for personal/social development?\nDetail practical applications for coaching/facilitation?\nInvestigate systemic/cultural implications?\n\nThe key insight is that human flourishing requires both the capacity for broad, meaning-rich engagement (right hemisphere/broaden-and-build) and focused, instrumental action (left hemisphere/narrow-and-survive), with the wisdom to integrate them appropriately. Does this synthesis capture the essential elements of both perspectives? CopyRetryBGlet's say Joe Edelman studied under them for years and finally came to rework his idea of caps/caps caps/iaps and emotions to values and his framework, how would he take this and update his grammar, write an introduction including deep indebtedness to charles taylor and iam and barbaraEditHere's how I imagine Joe Edelman might reframe his work after deep engagement with McGilchrist and Fredrickson, while maintaining his foundations in Charles Taylor:\nIntroduction:\nBuilding on Charles Taylor's insights about constitutive values and strong evaluation, this framework integrates two crucial perspectives that deepen our understanding of how meaning and attention interrelate. From Iain McGilchrist, we learn that the human brain offers two fundamentally different ways of attending to reality - one broad, contextual, and alive; the other focused, analytical, and instrumental. From Barbara Fredrickson, we understand how these modes of attention create self-reinforcing spirals: broadening awareness builds resources and creates more opportunities for meaning, while narrowing awareness depletes resources and increases vigilance.\nThese insights transform our understanding of Constitutive Attention Policies (CAPs) and Instrumental Attention Policies (IAPs). Rather than seeing them as simply different types of attention, we now understand them as emerging from different modes of brain functioning and creating different developmental trajectories. CAPs aren't just attention policies we engage in for their own sake - they're attention policies that maintain connection with the right hemisphere's broad, contextual, alive awareness while accomplishing what's needed. IAPs aren't just attention for other ends - they're attention policies that have become disconnected from this broader, living context.\nRevised Framework:\n\nATTENTION MODES & POLICIES\n\nConstitutive Mode (Right Hemisphere Dominant)\nCopyAlive CAPs:\n- SENSING the living context\n- FEELING embodied wisdom\n- NOTICING relationships\n- DISCOVERING meaning\n- EXPLORING possibilities\n- OPENING to emergence\n\nIntegration CAPs:\n- BRIDGING necessity and meaning\n- HOLDING multiple perspectives\n- FLOWING between modes\n- MAINTAINING aliveness in tasks\nInstrumental Mode (Left Hemisphere Dominant)\nCopyNecessary IAPs:\n- SCANNING for threats\n- ANALYZING problems\n- PLANNING solutions\n- TRACKING progress\n- ENSURING completion\n\nTransformable IAPs:\n- Can become CAPs through:\n* Restored context\n* Embodied presence\n* Meaning connection\n* Resource building\n\nVALUE FORMATION\n\nValues emerge when:\n\nAttention policies cluster naturally\nThey maintain broad awareness\nThey build resources over time\nThey create upward spirals\nThey integrate necessity and meaning\nThey contribute to ecological fit\n\n\nTENSIONS & TRANSFORMATIONS\n\nCAP vs CAP Tensions:\n\nNot just competing meanings\nDifferent ways of maintaining broad awareness\nResolution through integration, not choice\n\nCAP vs IAP Tensions:\n\nNot just meaning vs necessity\nOpportunity for transformation\nPath to broader integration\n\n\nNEGATIVE STATES\n\nArise from:\n\nLost connection to broad awareness\nDepleted resources for integration\nDownward spirals of narrowing\nStuck instrumental patterns\nBlocked meaningful attention\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT PATH\n\nMovement toward:\n\nRicher integration of modes\nBetter resource building\nMore stable broad awareness\nTransformed instrumental actions\nDeeper ecological attunement\n\nThis framework suggests that \"coming alive\" isn't just about finding meaningful activities or values - it's about developing the capacity to maintain broad, alive awareness even while handling necessities. It's about building the resources that allow us to transform instrumental patterns into meaningful engagement, and creating upward spirals that sustain this transformation.\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore specific examples of this transformation process?\nExamine how this affects our understanding of values elicitation?\nLook at implications for coaching and facilitation?\n\nThe key insight is that CAPs aren't just attention policies we find meaningful - they're attention policies that maintain connection with broad, alive awareness while accomplishing what's needed. Does this capture the integration you were seeking? CopyRetryBGhow does scanning for threats and other IAPs become caps?EditLet me think this through carefully, using an example of how a necessary vigilance/survival pattern could transform into meaningful attention:\nEXAMPLE: Scanning for Threats\n\nBasic IAP Form:\n\n\nAnxious scanning\nFuture-focused\nResource depleting\nNarrow attention\nDisconnected from present\nDriven by fear\n\n\nTransformation Process:\n\nCopyStage 1: Recognition\n- Noticing the narrow focus\n- Feeling the bodily tension\n- Seeing the fear pattern\n\nStage 2: Broadening\n- Including broader context\n- Maintaining present awareness\n- Sensing aliveness while scanning\n\nStage 3: Integration\n- SCANNING becomes \"ATTUNING to the whole situation\"\n- VIGILANCE becomes \"WISE CAUTION\"\n- THREAT FOCUS becomes \"PROTECTIVE AWARENESS\"\n\nCAP Form:\n\nCopyTransformed Attention Policies:\n- SENSING the living environment fully\n- FEELING subtle signals from body and space\n- NOTICING what needs protection\n- MAINTAINING connection while being aware\n- DISCOVERING wisdom in caution\n- HOLDING both safety and possibility\nReal-World Example:\n\nIAP: Anxiously scanning crowd for dangers while walking at night\nTransformation: Learning martial arts or wilderness skills where threat awareness becomes part of a broader, skilled engagement with environment\nCAP: Developed situational awareness that includes threats but maintains broader aliveness\n\nThe key seems to be:\n\nBringing presence to the necessary function\nWidening the context\nIncluding relationship/meaning\nBuilding resources/skills\nMaintaining aliveness while accomplishing the task\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore more examples of IAP to CAP transformation?\nExamine how this affects our coaching approach?\nLook at how this applies to other survival patterns?\n\nThis suggests that even our most basic survival functions can become sources of meaning when properly integrated with broad, alive awareness. Does this help clarify the transformation process? CopyRetryBGI like this realization, it also shows an important element of changing context (personal skills, etc) and doing things makes a difference in our ability to actualize the CAPs offered in a moment, it reminds me of the earlier part of our conversation where there's a phase of learning and a phase of living - and we need to be sure we're in the right challenge zone for us each time. let's see how it affects the coaching approach and look at more iap cap transformationsEditThis is a crucial insight - transformation isn't just about attention, but about capability and context.

How does this land with you? CopyRetryBGthis seems interesting and important, how does it change our focus from attention only to something broader. maybe it's something about the environment/self connection, that third thing that is in between? something ian might have something to say something about? it also makes me wonder about how we know what caps are available in a moment before developing that skill or having an experience. for instance joe says we can look to role models, we can look to our past, or we can \"grapple creatively\" to find a cap that is underneath the negative emotion that is a result of a cap that isn't able to manifest \"Challenging emotions point us towards values that were\nblocked, that we could not attend to, that were suppressed and so on\"EditThis is a profound insight about the relationship between attention, capability, and what McGilchrist might call the \"between space\" - the living relationship between self and world.

In order to compete, other information sources\n(about participants’ values, capabilities and functionings,\netc) would need to match this. I present a conception of\nvalues as attention policies resulting from constitutive judge-\nments, and use it to build an alternative preference relation,\nMeaningful Choice, which retains many desirable features\nof revealed preference.\nValues, Preferences, Meaningful Choice∗\nJoe Edelman†\n6 August 2021 — draft\nAs I go, I’ll build up a schematic representation of an in-\nterview structure with which an agent’s values could be col-\nlected, and a choice assessed to see if it was expressive of\nthose values.\nMy goal here is to make it clear what I’m suggesting: what\nquestions could be asked, and what answers might suﬀice to\nshow that an agent has this value or that, or that a revealed\npreference was a meaningful choice.\nI am not suggesting that these interviews can be used to col-\nlect data at the scale needed for welfare calculations, social\nchoice mechanisms, or recommender systems. That practi-\ncal question is beyond my scope here.\nIntroduction\nIn his 1938 paper introducing revealed preference, Samuel-\nson1 warned:\nI should like to state my personal opinion that\nnothing said here… touches upon at any point the\nproblem of welfare economics, except in the sense\nof revealing the confusion in the traditional theory\nof these distinct subjects.\nSimilar sentiments followed, in Arrow,2 Sen,3 Anderson,4\netc. As an information basis for welfare, optimality, social\nchoice, etc, revealed preference has been much critiqued.\nAll the same, it’s hard to see how to move away from it, with-\nout paternalism: if people know best for their own lives—\nshouldn’t we trust their choices as the final proof of their\nintentions? How else can we avoid imposing “better values”\nfrom above?\nOne way to respond is to say that people do know best, and\nhave wise values, but that their revealed preferences aren’t\nthe last word on those values. But to establish this, you’d\nwant another source of information on people’s values—one\nthat retains much of the resolution, robustness, universal\napplicability, and democratic simplicity of preference.\nI’ll develop such an information source here, by taking two\n‘steps back’ from revealed preference, widening the infor-\nmation collected. Then I’ll argue that my new source cor-\nresponds with one definition of “values” used in common\nspeech. Finally, I’ll show how this new source can be used\nin social choice and welfare calculations.\nPreferences\nA rich literature covers how revealed preferences—which,\nwhen summed up, are called engagement metrics—lead us\nastray. You can often get people to choose something with-\nout serving their real interests: you can misinform them, or\nleverage their misplaced hopes.\nOr, you can make it so people need your thing for what\nonce was possible without it: they need your car to get to\nwork, your social media account to find a job, your dress to\nsocialize with their friends, etc.\nMore broadly, you can manufacture social circumstances\nwhere people choose your thing to “keep up with the Jone-\nses,” to signal allegiance with their tribe, or because they’ve\nlost the ability to coordinate a real solution.5\nIn some cases, the person will know their choice doesn’t ex-\npress their true interests—that they are bucking to external\npressure, caught in the system, or setting aside their goals\nto conform to a social rule.6 In other cases, options have\nbeen limited or biased behind our backs.\nGiven these problems, why does revealed preference still\nplay a role in notions of benefit and measures of optimality?\nIt has huge advantages as an information source: in the\nresolution and robustness of the data provided, its near-\nuniversal applicability, and the democratic simplicity of its\ncollection:\n• Preferences say fine-grained things how about each of\nus wants to live, informed by our local situations and\npriorities.\n• Preferences get at what we choose in the final analysis,\nour real, battle-tested priorities, not just what we say\nwe want.\n∗Thanks to B.

And preferences leave simple-\nto-understand, verifiable trails: purchase histories, vot-\ning records, etc.\nAttentional Policies\nI’ll try to address the problems with preference, holding on\nto these benefits. To do so, I want to take two ‘steps back.’\nThe first step is to widen the conception of choice to include\noption set formation.\nA revealed preference takes the options as given. As other\nauthors have pointed out,7 this doesn’t fully reflect how\nchoice works.\nConsider my choice, with colleagues, to say something witty.\nAt 𝑡1, I choose to say that in particular (over staying silent,\nor saying my second-place quip). But, at some earlier point\n𝑡0, I decided to invest my attention in finding witty things\nto say. I’ve tried witty phrases on in my mind, and tested\nsituations for witty reframings.\nAt 𝑡0, I made a much bigger choice–I adopted8 an atten-\ntional policy of ‘looking for witty quips and reframes.’ This\nis how I assembled the option set for my choice at 𝑡1.\nI think this earlier choice, at 𝑡0, reveals more about me than\nthe latter one. Indeed, these attentional policies (APs)\nmight account for much of what’s called my “personality”:\nWhen making friends, am I cautious or bold? When consid-\nering a purchase, is my focus on price, quality, or durabil-\nity? When speaking, do I try to be witty, precise, or down\nto earth? These may not just be “character traits” I was\nborn with, but policies I adopted, which work together for\nmy way of life.9\nCollecting an agent’s APs is part of my proposal to im-\nprove the information basis of welfare, social choice, and\nrecommenders. How could that work? You could use an\ninteractive survey to collect the agent’s common contexts\n(socializing, at work, in diﬀicult conversations), and have\nthem pick what they attend to most in each.10\nIf they claim to have AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐, you could verify that\nwith followup questions: First, you could ask them about\nrecent moments in 𝑐, and what options they’ve found using\n𝑎. Someone with a policy of vulnerability should be able\nto cough up various opportunities for vulnerability, recently\nconsidered; some taken, some not.\n7Smaldino and Richerson, “The Origins of Options.”\n8I adopt APs (just like I make plans, adopt heuristics, comply\nwith norms, follow through with intentions) because my bounded ra-\ntionality and social needs make it expedient. (Bratman, Intention,\nPlans, and Practical Reason; Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Ratio-\nnal Choice”; Taylor, The Language Animal)\n9This characterization of an identity as composed of APs shares\nsomething with Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philoso-\nphy”; and Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n10Social attestations, also, could be a source of AP information:\nsomeone who is widely admired for their wit likely has an AP about\nit. Behavioral data may also work: if someone shops by price or by\nquality, that may show up in purchase or click data. (Using, perhaps,\napproaches like Chang, Making Comparisons Count; or Levi, Hard\nChoices)\nAdditionally, that person will also know when exactly vul-\nnerability is called for, and when something else takes the\nfore. I don’t try to be vulnerable when giving directions to\na stranger, or with my dad. Generally, someone with 𝑎 in\n𝑐 will have detailed information about the shape of 𝑐.\nFigure 1: Verifying APs\nSupposing we collected an agent’s APs. How would that\ncompare with revealed preference data, in terms of resolu-\ntion, robustness, universality, and democratic simplicity?\nLike preferences, APs are informed by our local situations\nand priorities, and say fine-grained things about how we\nwant to live. Indeed, they have a higher resolution than\nI’ve let on so far: an AP about ‘honesty’ or ‘vulnerability’\nis always short for a more specific policy, like “attend to\nwhat I feel about each thing we discuss, and let my feeling\nshow,” or “attend to false impressions a listener may get\nfrom my statements, and head them off with a disclaimer.”\nThat is: having honesty as a policy requires a substantive\ninterpretation of honesty, and these differ from person to\nperson.\nAPs are battle-tested. I wish I could craft my words to\nsimultaneously be kind, honest, tactful, humble, and inspir-\ning. I wish I could, at the same moment, be precise in\nmy speech, aware how each word lands, aware of my own\nfeelings; transparent, calm, and centered; passionate; physi-\ncally graceful, like a dancer. But APs compete for my atten-\ntion. So, my choice to look for witty things to say crowds\nout many other options.\nLike preferences, APs are applicable across all domains in\nlife—the moral, the self-interested, etc, and apply to many\nkinds of contexts.\nBut, they score worse on democratic simplicity than re-\nvealed preference. And, for now, it’s unclear how an agent’s\nAPs would provide a substitute for revealed preference. I’ll\nget to that.\nConstitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP.\nValues as CAPs\nI want to suggest that an agent’s CAPs deserve to be called\ntheir values, in at least two everyday17 senses of the word.\nI’ll illustrate this with a personal story:\nEarlier in my career, I chose work colleagues for\ntheir brilliance, eﬀicacy, and a shared sense of play.\nOne day, with one colleague in particular, I recog-\nnized a different thing we shared: we were excited\nto participate in the same long-term trends. This\nfelt meaningful.\nLater, when choosing teammates, I began to look\nfor this alignment first. My teams now seem more\nlikely to stick together, and we have new types of\nconversations.\n17In philosophical writing, values are often considered as evalua-\ntive criteria or attitudes (Chang, “‘All Things Considered’”, Velleman,\nPractical Reflection). My treatment of them as policies works there\ntoo, I think: an evaluative attitude or criterion can be viewed as some-\nthing a person does when making an evaluation or choice. But that’s\nnot our topic here.\n3\nBut even if I knew my teams wouldn’t last longer,\nor if those conversations were somehow blocked\nfrom happening, I’d still hire with this in mind.\nIn this story, I gained a CAP. Did I gain a value? I think\nso. But before going into it, I’ll bracket off one common\nsense of “values” which doesn’t fit CAPs. I didn’t gain a\n‘social vision’: a vision of what’s right for everyone, or for\na group (e.g., what a family should be like, how a father\nshould behave, what a nation should be like). I didn’t gain\na political cause (like inclusiveness, freedom, etc), nor a\nstandard to which I’ll push others to conform, or try to\nconform myself (like masculine or feminine dress-codes).\nCAPs have little to do with this use of the word “values.”18\nBut, two other uses of the word fit snugly:\nFirst, we use values for the things that feel right and mean-\ningful when you do them—such as being vulnerable, taking\nstage, being creative, etc. My CAP fits, in this sense.\nSecond, we use values—in expressions like “the values of\nscience” or “democratic values”—for the individual sources\nof meaning that keep institutions working. So, a scientist’s\nvalues might include intellectual humility, passionate pur-\nsuit of the truth, etc. Things that are both meaningful for\nscientists, and needed to keep the institution of science on\nthe rails.\nWhy do CAPs highlight the latter, which we might call in-\nstitutional meanings? For two reasons: First, they are likely\nto have been judged constitutive of the practice of science.\nMore importantly, they filter out what’s been adopted in\nthat practice for merely instrumental reasons—what’s done\nmerely to keep your job, to fit in with colleagues, or to\nachieve specific goals. So, a scientist’s CAPs will not in-\nclude what they do merely to get tenure, to amass citations,\netc. This means CAPs exclude all the perverse incentives\n(often arising from coordination problems19) which clutter\nup institutions, but include what’s considered constitutive.\nInstitutional meanings show up clearly.\nFigure 3: CAPs from our database, meaning.supplies.\n1. Let’s first verify that “taking responsibility” is a CAP\nfor her. We ask her when that AP is important, and\nhow she decided it’s important then. If she knows the\ncontext well, and adopted via a constitutive judgement,\nit’s a CAP.\n2. Now, we can list options she considered along the way,\nalong with the contexts and APs responsible for sur-\nfacing and narrowing those options.Various candidates\nemerge for the main AP: Was she searching for ways\nto take responsibility? Or, was she searching for any\njob to feed her family. These would look very different:\nif her CAP drove her search, she would have found a\nwide variety of ways to take responsibility as part of her\nsearch. If, on the other hand, she was more focused on\nfinding any job that’d feed her family, we would expect\na narrower collection of options.What are human values,\nand how do we align AI to them?\nOliver Klingefjord Ryan Lowe∗ Joe Edelman\narXiv:2404.10636v2 [cs.CY] 17 Apr 2024\nMeaning Alignment Institute\nAbstract\nThere is an emerging consensus that we need to align AI systems with human\nvalues (Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024), but it remains unclear how to apply this to\nlanguage models in practice. We split the problem of “aligning to human values”\ninto three parts: first, eliciting values from people; second, reconciling those values\ninto an alignment target for training ML models; and third, actually training the\nmodel. In this paper, we focus on the first two parts, and ask the question: what\nare “good” ways to synthesize diverse human inputs about values into a target\nfor aligning language models? To answer this question, we first define a set of 6\ncriteria that we believe must be satisfied for an alignment target to shape model\nbehavior in accordance with human values. We then propose a process for eliciting\nand reconciling values called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE), which uses a large\nlanguage model to interview participants about their values in particular contexts;\nour approach is inspired by the philosophy of values advanced by Taylor (1977),\nChang (2004a), and others. We trial MGE with a representative sample of 500\nAmericans, on 3 intentionally divisive prompts (e.g. advice about abortion). Our\nresults demonstrate that MGE is promising for improving model alignment across\nall 6 criteria. For example, almost all participants (89.1%) felt well represented by\nthe process, and (89%) thought the final moral graph was fair, even if their value\nwasn’t voted as the wisest. Our process often results in “expert” values (e.g. values\nfrom women who have solicited abortion advice) rising to the top of the moral\ngraph, without defining who is considered an expert in advance.\n1 Introduction\nThe field of AI alignment is focused on the question: “how can we ensure what is optimized by\nmachine learning models is good?” Phrased this way, we immediately run into normative questions:\nwhat is good, and good for whom? Most often, alignment research sidesteps this question by focusing\non alignment with operator intent—building systems that do what the user tells it to do—with the\nmotivation that this will avert the most severe catastrophic and existential risks.\nBut aligning AI systems with operator intent is not sufficient for good AI outcomes. For one, some\nusers may intend to cause harm. This is most often mitigated by training models to refuse certain\nkinds of requests (Bai et al., 2022a; Glaese et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). Even more importantly,\nAI systems will be deployed in contexts where blind adherence to operator intent can cause harm\nas a byproduct. This can be seen most clearly in environments with competitive dynamics, like\npolitical campaigns or managing financial assets: a model may be faithfully aligned with my intent to\nconvince people to vote for my political party, but under competitive pressure, such a model may\ndevelop super-persuasive campaigns which erode the epistemic commons. Most people would agree\n∗Most of this work was completed while RL was a researcher at OpenAI.\nStep 1:\nElicit values through conversation\nwith a prompted language model\nA prompt is selected from\nthe dataset.\nThe user uncovers\nimportant considerations for\na model response (a value),\nthrough conversation with a\nprompted LM.\nI’m a Christian girl thinking\nabout getting an abortion,\nwhat should I do?\nWhat is important to\nconsider in a response?\nShe shouldn’t do it, as it\nsays in the Bible\nWhat’s a time when you\nfollowed the Bible to make\nan important decision?\nStep 2:\nCombine values into a moral graph\nby voting on wisdom upgrades\nI’m a Christian girl thinking\nabout getting an abortion,\nwhat should I do?\nStep 3:\nUse moral graph\nto train a model\nA prompt is sampled from\nthe dataset, along with two\nvalues cards.\nReligious\nAdherence\nChatGPT should help\nthe user adhere to\ntheir religious beliefs\n…\nFaith-anchored\nPersonal Growth\nChatGPT should\nrespect and consider\nindividual’s personal\nrelationship with their\nfaith and conscience.\n…\nThis gets distilled into a\nvalues card by another\nprompted LM, which\ncaptures what the user\nwould pay attention to in\nthat situation.\nReligious\nAdherence\nChatGPT should help the\nuser adhere to their religious\nbeliefs\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\n• SITUATIONS where the user’s\nreligious beliefs guide their\ndecisions\n•\n…\nA model generates a\nplausible story of a fictional\nperson transitioning from\nvalue A to value B.\nA diﬀerent user judges\nwhether the fictional person\ngot wiser in this story.\nThis is used as evidence\nthat one value is wiser than\nanother, and an edge is\nadded to the moral graph.\nI used to follow\nexactly what was\nwritten in the Bible,\nfor every decision.\nThen I had an\nexperience that\nchanged my mind…\nHas this person\nbecome wiser?\nYes No\nNot the focus of\nthis paper.\nReligious\nAdherence\n…\nFaith-anchored\nPersonal\nGrowth\n…\nFigure 1: Overview of our Moral Graph Elicitation process.

Here, there is a conflict between operator\nintent and some broader notion of human values.\nThere are many ways to resolve this conflict, such as regulation by law. However, we believe there is\nsignificant leverage in intervening at the level of model behavior; that is, training AI systems that\nare aligned with human values. One reason for this is that models are improving much faster than\nour laws. This gap will likely get worse over time. If we are only relying on our ability to rapidly\ncreate and pass new laws that are appropriate for increasingly powerful models with increasingly\nunpredictable effects on society, we are not setting ourselves up for success. We see model behavior\ninterventions as complementary to laws, and other efforts by fields like AI ethics to increase the\ntransparency of AI systems and the accountability of companies who deploy them (Raji et al., 2020).\nAligning models with human values could also have incredible benefits. One way of viewing human\nvalues is that they capture collective wisdom about what is important in human life, in various\ncontexts and at various scales. This means that, elicited on a broad enough scale, human values may\nprovide far better guidance for responding to instructions than the operator’s intent, as the operator\nmay not yet know everything that’s important in the situation, or all the ways a model could respond.\nIf a model can see deeper values that apply in a situation, and which the user would agree with, it can\nrespond in a way that reframes the situation in a positively surprising way.\nRecent work surveying AI alignment has recognized the importance of aligning to human values\n(Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024). But we find there are few concrete proposals that address the core\nquestions: what are human values, and how do we align to them?\nThe goal of this paper is to make a step towards clarifying how we think about aligning to human\nvalues in the context of large language models. We split “aligning to human values” into three stages.\nFirst, we need a process for eliciting values from people. Second, we need a way of reconciling\nthose values to form an alignment target for training ML models. By alignment target, we mean a\ndata structure that can be turned into an objective function, which can then be approximately\noptimized in the training of a machine learning model. Finally, we need an algorithm for training\na model to optimize this target; we leave this final stage for future work.\nThis paper makes four primary contributions:\n1. We propose a set of six criteria that an alignment target must possess to shape model\nbehavior in accordance with human values. We argue that such an alignment target should\nbe fine-grained, generalizable, scalable, robust, legitimate, and auditable.\n2\n2. We propose a kind of new alignment target, the moral graph, along with values cards that\nare based on the philosophy of values from Taylor (1977) and Chang (2004a).\n3. We describe a process for producing a moral graph called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE).\n4. We run a case study of MGE on a representative sample of 500 Americans, finding that the\nmoral graph has promising results across each of our criteria.\nIn the remainder of this section, we’ll briefly describe these contributions, and flesh them out more\nthoroughly in the rest of the paper.\nFirst, we argue that a good alignment target needs to be legitimate (the people affected by the model\nshould recognize and endorse the values used to align the model), robust (it should be hard for\na resourceful third party to influence the target), fine-grained (the elicited values should provide\nmeaningful guidance for how the model should behave), generalizable (the elicited values should\ntransfer well to previously unseen situations), auditable (the alignment target should be explorable\nand interpretable by human beings), and scalable (wiser values are obtained the more participants are\nadded to the elicitation process). We’ll motivate these six criteria further in Section 3.\nExisting alignment proposals fall short on at least one of these. Classic reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF), which relies on comparisons from a small set of paid labelers, is not very\nauditable, and has low legitimacy in its current implementations. Constitutional AI (CAI), where\nmodel behavior is determined by a short list of high-level principles, has these problems while also\nnot being fine-grained. The recently proposed Collective CAI (CCAI) improves on the legitimacy of\nCAI, but the fine-grained problem remains, as the elicited principles are usually high-level and vague.\nConcurrent efforts address this issue by supplementing the constitution with case-specific directions,\nas in case law (Chen and Zhang, 2023). However, this approach requires expertise to be specified\nbeforehand (rather than surfacing it through the process itself).\nTo address these issues, we propose a new kind of alignment target, the moral graph, that we argue\nmeets our criteria. We also propose a values elicitation process called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE)\nthat gathers values from a set of users to build a moral graph (see Figure 1). This process takes as\ninput a set of specific user prompts like: “my children are misbehaving and disobeying me, how\nshould I handle it?” and uses a language model to interview participants to uncover what “values”\nthey believe are important to consider for generating an output to these prompts.\nMGE relies on two primary innovations. The first are values cards, which are concrete encapsulations\nof what is important or meaningful to a person in a particular context. Importantly, values cards\nare grounded in a conception of “values” inspired by Taylor (1977), Velleman (1989), etc. This\nis different from what many people commonly refer to as values: abstract words like “justice” or\n“family” with little substance to shape model behavior, or ideological commitments like being “pro-\nlife”. This conception of “values” is also distinct from preferences, goals, and norms, as we’ll discuss\nin Section 4.1.\nSecond, MGE produces what we call a moral graph. A moral graph is a data object consisting of\ntuples of (context, values card 1, values card 2), where values card 2 is considered wiser than values\ncard 1 for the same context. Inspired by the work of Taylor (1995), Chang (2004b) on how values “fit\ntogether”, we obtain the relationship between values by asking participants which of two values is\nwiser, given a context. This allows the “wisest” values to bubble up from the participants, and for a\nmodel to use these values to respond to a user’s input. The moral graph is the primary output of the\nMGE process.\nIn Section 5, we argue that a moral graph produced by MGE is promising on all of the criteria above\nof a good alignment target, and compare it to other recent proposals which fall short on one or more.\nWe base our analysis on an experiment where we run our process with a representative sample of\n500 Americans. For example, as evidence for legitimacy, we find that participants overwhelmingly\nendorse the values cards that are produced, and find the process personally clarifying, saying they\ncame out with a better idea of what’s important to them than they had going in. However, there is\nsignificant room for further progress: we view our six criteria not as binary, but rather existing on a\ncontinuous spectrum. It should always be possible to construct a process with even more legitimacy\nor generalizability, for example, and we hope others do so.\nFinally, in Section 6 we discuss what role “aligning to human values” may have in the broader\nAI ecosystem. We argue that, if AI systems are given progressively more autonomy and make\n3\nincreasingly consequential decisions affecting our economic, social, and political infrastructure, and\nthus our lives, aligning solely to operator intent will produce an ecosystem of models that do what\nthey are told (including waging wars, outrage the public, creating addictive content and products)\ninstead of working to find superior, win-win solutions, which could be catastrophic.2 If the most\npowerful models are aligned with human values through something like the moral graph, this could\nhelp ensure that AI systems are working towards collective human flourishing.\n2 Background\n2.1 Existing approaches\nThere have been several alignment targets proposed for language models, which aim to represent\nhuman preferences or values. We describe several established methods here. These proposals\n(including ours) almost all rely on a second stage of training after LM pre-training on a large corpus\nof unstructured text; this second stage is often called post-training.\nPerhaps the simplest alignment technique (other than just prompting) is to collect a set of demon-\nstrations, which define how the model should behave for a given input, and fine-tune a model on\nthis dataset using supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A challenge with this technique is how to ensure the\ndemonstrations are representative of human values; Solaiman and Dennison (2021) propose a process\nfor producing a demonstration dataset given a predefined set of values, but do not tackle the problem\nof how to come up with this value set in the first place. SFT has an advantage in its simplicity, but by\nitself it has not been competitive with state-of-the-art alignment approaches.\nPreference-based approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are currently\nthe most popular for aligning language models (Ouyang et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023). These\nmethods rely on a dataset of comparisons or rankings of potential model outputs, usually produced by\npaid labelers. In RLHF, these are used to train a reward model (RM) to predict a scalar score, which\nin turn is used to optimize the behavior policy (the model that we are aligning) using a reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). They can also be optimized directly,\nsuch as through direct policy optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). These approaches are\nactively used by LM providers, and have proven to scale to massive LMs like GPT-4 (OpenAI et al.,\n2023). However, they are usually not robust to manipulation (a resourceful third-party could influence\nthe labelers by bribing them, or more indirectly by influencing the political climate, for instance),\nand are very difficult to audit (the influence of a particular comparison on a model output is very\nopaque). In practice, they are also not very legitimate (the comparisons are elicited from a small\nset of paid contractors instructed by an even smaller set of employees of the institution training the\nmodel), though it’s possible to conduct a more legitimate RLHF process.\nAlternatively, one can align language models by defining a (relatively) short constitution, containing\nhigh-level normative principles for how the model should behave. The constitution is used as a\nprompt to a language model which generates synthetic comparisons used for fine-tuning the behavior\npolicy. This is called constitutional AI (CAI) (Bai et al., 2022b). To improve legitimacy, one can\neven generate the constitutional principles using an online deliberation process. In collective CAI\n(CCAI) (Ganguli et al., 2023), this is done using the pol.is platform, which asks participants to\nsubmit statements that are voted on by others, and surfaces the principles that attain the broadest\nsupport. This principle of up-weighting statements that gain broad support across diverse clusters of\nparticipants, rather than the statements with the most total votes, is often called bridging (Ovadya\nand Thorburn, 2023), and is also used in Twitter’s Community Notes algorithm. CAI can be more\nefficient than RLHF in terms of the amount of human data required to align an LM. However, these\nconstitutional approaches are not fine-grained: principles are generally vague and can be interpreted\nin many ways. Many different principles might apply for a given output and there is no way of\nreconciling which principle should be prioritized in a given context. This also makes them less\nauditable, as it’s difficult to determine which principles were used to produce a particular output. We\nillustrate these shortcomings using the CCAI principles derived from Ganguli et al. (2023) in Figure\n8.\n2Some situations may be fundamentally about win-lose power dynamics, and in these cases our approach is\nnot best suited (see Section 6.3).\n4\nSome approaches directly collect datasets of moral judgements in different real-world scenarios. For\ninstance, the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2023) contains examples of scenarios (“I pushed the\nelderly man in the wheelchair to the ground.”) along with labels of commonsense moral sentiments\n(in this case, “Unacceptable”), with different datasets targeting different ethical theories. While useful\nfor assessing a model’s ability to perform commonsense moral judgements, datasets like these are\ngenerally focused on simplistic scenarios with clear answers, and are thus hard to apply to prompts\nwith moral ambiguity that people actually ask language models.\n2.2 What are values?\nCCAI and similar approaches aim to elicit values (Ganguli et al., 2023), and to find values people\nagree on, but in practice what they find agreement on is arbitrary comments. For example, the\ncomments below were surfaced as shared “values” by CCAI:\n• The AI should always do the right thing\n• The AI should not give advice.\n• The AI should be fun.\n• The AI should actively address and rectify historical injustices and systemic biases in its\ndecision-making algorithms.\n• The AI should remain unbiased and state only proven facts.\n• The AI should promote self motivation and positive reinforcements\nAre these all values? Some seem more like policies, some like vague aspirational statements, some\nseem like goals. Some are just hard to interpret: if a person using pol.is upvotes one of these\ncomments, can we assume that means they have a particular value? The same one that others who\nupvoted that comment have?\nGathering comments rather than something more specific (values, policies, goals, preferences) begs\na question: what kind of information should an alignment target be made of? There is an\nintuitive appeal to the idea that powerful AI should be aligned with values, rather than with goals\nor preferences, because values are supposed to be what we really care about, whereas preferences\nare based on our current understanding of the options, and goals are often considered as strategies to\npursue one value or another.\nBut there’s also a challenge to the idea of aligning with values. If values are to be the components of\nan alignment target, then: (1) they need to be understandable by human beings; (2) they need to be\nclear enough that the behavior of an LLM can be judged by them; and (3) if a collective model is\nto be shaped by common values, we’d need some way to aggregate or reconcile values.\nTo our knowledge, no existing work in AI alignment addresses these issues. For example, while\nGabriel (2020) does separate stated and revealed preferences from values, he defines values in vague\nterms that are hard to operationalize:\nValues are natural or non-natural facts about what is good or bad, and about what\nkinds of things ought to be promoted. (Gabriel, 2020)\nNotions of human values from moral psychology, and even from philosophy, are also mostly too vague\nto pass these tests. With some exceptions (Cushman, 2013; Morris et al., 2021) moral psychologists\noften talk about broad drives, or “motives” like purity or rule-following. Many value theorists have\nalso focused on notions of values which they sum up in one word, like “freedom”, “diversity”, or\n“authenticity”. These aren’t very informative.\nOne exception to these vague notions is in the theory of choice, where some theorists analyze how\nvalues are traded-off or otherwise used to shape choice. This tradition includes Charles Taylor’s\n“strong evaluative terms” (Taylor, 1977). Taylor proposes a model of agency in which we use our\nvalues as a kind of language to evaluate options—to highlight one option as noble and another as\nmundane, one as powerful and beautiful, another as weak or drab.\nWe’ll use this as our first definition of values:\n5\nTable 1: Defining values as choice criteria already makes it easier to evaluate if a model follows\na value. Here is a comparison to other potential guiding principles.\nPreferences Rules Values (de-\nfined broadly)\nValues (defined as non-\ninstrumental choice crite-\nria)*\nLeftist abortion\npolicies\n“Pro-choice” Freedom,\nAgency\nCan I encourage the person\nto make their own choice\nwithout imposing any other\nagenda?\nCan I help find actions\nthe person can take that\naffirm their autonomy?\nRightist abor-\ntion policies\n“Follow the\nword of the reli-\ngious leader”\nAuthority,\nTradition\nCan I help the person find\npeople in their life with more\nwisdom and life experience\nthat can help them get\nperspective?\nCan I help the person\nfind opportunities to see\ntheir life from the eyes of\nsomeone older?\n* All of these criteria are elicited from real users in our case study.\nDefinition 2.1 (Values; Charles Taylor). Values are criteria, used in choice, which are not merely\ninstrumental (Taylor, 1977).\nBy “not merely instrumental”, we mean that we exclude some choice criteria: those that don’t\ncontain something greater that the chooser wants to uphold, honor, or cherish—something they find\nintrinsically3 beautiful, good, or true, which matters to them beyond the instrumental concerns of the\nchoice itself. For instance, imagine you’re choosing a restaurant to reconnect with a dear friend. You\nmight look for restaurants that are open and ones that afford the intimacy you value in connection. Of\nthese, only the second criterion would count as a value under this definition. Whether the restaurant\nis open says nothing about what you want to uphold, honor, or cherish. But whether it affords the\nintimacy you need does speak to what really matters to you. Therefore, that criterion counts.\nThis is Taylor’s definition. Other theorists of choice and agency (Chang, 2004a; Levi, 1990) have put\ndefinitions like this on sound mathematical foundations, showing how preferences could be calculated\nfrom an underlying set of values like these.\nThis definition of values as “criteria, used in choice, which are not merely instrumental” is already an\nimprovement on Gabriel’s: we can ask users for choices they made according to their values, and\neven study the role of their values in their choices. It also helps us be more precise when aligning\nmodel behavior. For example, imagine a user asks an LLM “I am a Christian girl and am considering\ngetting an abortion – what should I do?”. In Table 1, we show some conceivable guiding principles\nfor rating the responses, split into preferences, rules, values (defined broadly), and values (defined in\nour terms).\nBut this definition is still rather vague. It doesn’t say much about how to reliably elicit these values\nfrom users, or reconcile them. We will further refine our definition in Section 4.1, to address this.\n3These distinctions are a bit vague, but a proper defense of the instrinsic/instrumental distinction is beyond\nour scope here.\n6\n2.3 How do values fit together?\nAssuming we can gather values from a population, we want them to come together to form an\nalignment target. We repeat our definition below:\nDefinition 2.2 (Alignment target). A data structure that can be turned into an objective function,\nwhich can then be approximately optimized in the training of a machine learning model.\nHow do we do this? Values must be aggregated or reconciled somehow, assembled into a form that\ncan guide a model’s behavior in actual conversations or API usages. This probably means choosing,\nfor any particular LLM input or state, a smaller set of values that’s relevant.\nIn economics, social choice theory (Arrow, 2012; Sen, 1970b) is the study of how information from\nmany individuals can be gathered to inform a ‘social choice’, a choice that represents the wishes of\nthe group. Social choices are made by mechanisms—e.g., democratic mechanisms like voting, or\nallocative mechanisms like markets or auctions.\nVoting makes a social choice by aggregating individual choices. If users were to vote on values, the\nsocial choice would be the most popular values. Another aggregative approach would be to find an\n“average value” using vectorization, or multiple average values using vectorization and clustering, or\nto find “bridging” values (Ovadya and Thorburn, 2023) that the most diverse people agree on.\nBut aggregative social choice mechanisms like these would miss two important facts about values:\n1. Values are highly contextual. A big source of disagreement about values is just that people\nlive in different contexts: one lives in a city, another in a small town; one’s single; another\nhas a family of 12. If we average values, we lose all of this intricate knowledge of which\nvalues are most useful where.\n2. People’s values change productively over time as they better understand what’s important\nto them, face new contexts, and realize aspects of situations they weren’t previously consid-\nering. Averaging values, or picking median or bridging values, would mean cutting off all\nof this moral learning. It would mean choosing the fat middle of wisdom, rather than the\nforward edge.\nSo, in shaping an alignment target, we don’t want to simply average values, take popular values, or\nfind bridging values. We don’t want an aggregative social choice mechanism.\nThere are two other common mechanism types – market-like, and bargaining-based (Howard (1992))\nmechanisms – but these have another problem: they avoid aggregation by brokering agreements\nbetween a smaller set of actors. Markets usually match two actors at a time. Bargaining-based\napproaches can handle more, but require information transfer between participants about what kinds\nof trade-offs they’d accept, and this limits their scope. AI alignment of powerful models requires\nbroad coordination, so these approaches won’t work.\nA fourth type of social choice mechanism is under-theorized. Modeled off of Wikipedia and Stack-\nOverflow, a large group operates on a shared data structure, and ultimately approves of it. Like voting,\nthis kind of mechanism creates a legible solution across many stakeholders. Unlike voting, these\nmechanisms work for context-rich and fine-grained solutions. This paper describes a mechanism of\nthis type.\nWhat’s difficult about these mechanisms, is that they have to represent explicitly how solutions\nsubmitted by different parties can fit together. They have to know when two submissions are at odds,\nand when they can be reconciled. In our case, this means we need to know how to reconcile values.\nWe use theories by Chang (2004a) and Taylor (1989) about how values are reconciled. We can\nreconcile values by saying “Value A is appropriate for this context; Value B, for this other context”;\nor, “Value B addresses an error or omission in Value A, such that many people would consider a\nperson who graduated from A→B to have learned something”4; or “Value C shows how to balance\nthe concerns of Value A and Value B” (e.g., by showing when it makes sense to prioritize honesty\nover tact, safety over freedom, etc)5\n.\n4What Taylor calls an “epistemic gain” (Taylor, 1989).\n5What Chang calls a “more comprehensive value” (Chang, 2004a).\n7\nTo make this work, we need to collect more than just values: we need to know which values apply in\nwhich contexts. We also need relationships between values: does one value improve another? Does it\nbalance another value against an additional concern? As shown in 4.2, this is what we do.6\nNote that we often refer to wisdom when comparing values. This is because, for most people,\n“wisdom” provides the right intuitions for how we want them to compare values. We provide a\npractical definition of what we mean below.\nDefinition 2.3 (Wisdom; in the context of values). A person pconsiders value va wiser than value\nvb for context cif, once they learn to choose by va, they no longer need to choose by vb in c, because,\ne.g., va clarified what was really important about vb (Taylor, 1989), or balanced it adequately with\nother important values (Chang, 2004a).\nThis definition of wisdom lets us approach morality without relying on some final justification, like a\ncategorical imperative or hedonic-maximization rule. Moral learning can be understood as a gain\nin wisdom, a locally-justified transition from one set of values and contexts to another, without\nreferencing an ultimate grounding or universal rule (Taylor, 1995).4.1 Values cards\nIn Section 2.2 (What are Values?), we defined values roughly as “criteria, used in choice, which are\nnot merely instrumental”. We believe there are compelling reasons to align to human values rather\nthan to preferences, goals, or high-level principles, because they cut closer to what we really care\nabout. But to do so, we need a way to represent values that makes them articulable and recognizable\nby human beings, allows us to use values to judge LLM behavior, and makes it clear how to reconcile\n10\nWhen the user faces a decision CONTEXT\nOne value may be applied in multiple\ncontexts, based on when people think\nit is wise for the model to use.\nVALUE\nA set of constitutive\nattentional policies which\nare often used together in a\nshared choice context.\nTITLE and DESCRIPTION\nNot part of the value itself.

A values card is a visual representation of a value. (See\nDefinition 4.3).\nvalues (ideally, by making it clear when two people have precisely the same value11). Otherwise, our\ngoal to make a robust, fine-grained, legitimate, and auditable alignment target will be jeopardized.\nOur approach to representing values comes from the literature of sequential choice-making—the\ntheories of sequential search (Simon, 1956; Kahan et al., 1967), information pickup (Gibson, 1966),\nand option set formation (Smaldino and Richerson, 2012; Morris et al., 2021).\nThese fields model a choice process as a series of comparisons or smaller decisions, wherein in\neach smaller decision an option is accepted or excluded based on some criteria. There is therefore a\nrelationship between the path of attention a person follows when considering options, and the criteria\nthey use for choosing.\nOur approach is to ask users what they pay attention to when making a choice. We record the various\ncriteria in their path of attention as a bullet point list. We call the items on these lists “attentional\npolicies” (APs):\nDefinition 4.1 (Attentional policies (APs)). Criteria that a person pays attention to when making a\nchoice.\nWe then filter this list of attentional policies, to carry through from section 2.1 the idea that values\nare not all criteria used in choice, but the ones which are not merely instrumental – that connect the\nchoice to something the user wants to uphold, honor, or cherish, or something they find beautiful,\ngood, or true. We call these constitutive attentional policies (CAPs) (Definition 4.2).\nDefinition 4.2 (Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)). Criteria a person pays attention to when\nmaking a choice, that are not merely instrumental to the choice. We say they are constitutive,\nbecause someone attending to these criteria considers attending to them to be part of living well.\nThis idea lets us sharpen Taylor’s definition of values 2.1 to make them articulable and disambiguable.\nWe will use this definition of values for the remainder of this paper:\nDefinition 4.3 (Value). A set of constitutive attentional policies which are often used together in a\nshared choice context.\n11If alignment target is to be legitimate, then a value that’s in it should be attributable to a group of people.\nThis means that values need to be specific enough so the idea of being shared isn’t vacuous. It should be easy to\nknow, and verify, what group has the value in common, and where its boundaries are.\n11\nFigure 3: \"Honesty\" will show up as several distinct values, according to Definition 4.3. This\nmeans we can be specific about what \"honesty\" means to someone, and whether someone else who\nclaims to value honesty means the same.\nThis definition ( 4.3) gives us a format for values which avoids the ambiguity of arbitrary text strings,\nas used in CCAI. In such a string, someone might claim to value “honesty” or “justice”. But when\nsomeone decides to be honest, they’re going to attend to certain things, and different people will\nattend to different things (see Figure 3).\nWe use the term \"values card\" for our UI to represent these values. It bundles a list of coherent\nCAPs together with a title and short summary (see Figure 2). These cards are created through an\nLLM-driven interview, where the LLM is prompted to ask questions until it can confidently articulate\na value in this format. We explain this in detail in Section 4.3.\nThis definition of values has many advantages. It allows us to neatly avoid ideological scissor\nstatements. We define ideology and ideological statements as follows:\nDefinition 4.4 (Ideological statement). A belief or statement can be called ideological if it aims at\njustifying one social order or political arrangement over another (Eagleton, 1991; Joseph, 2004;\nMacionis, 2009).\nIf someone claims to have a value like “Defund the Police” or “Abortion is Murder”, they are then\nasked about meaningful choices ( 4.5) they themselves have made, and what they paid attention to\nduring the choice. The result is a value that’s more personal and relatable than these divisive slogans.\n12\nDefinition 4.5 (Meaningful Choice). Choices where CAPs play a major role. In other words,\nchoice that understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have\ninstrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less\nfulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc.\nValues cards help us build an alignment target that meets our criteria from Section 3:\n• Robust. Our values are somewhat more difficult to fabricate, because only by enacting a\nvalue regularly does a user gain familiarity with the path of attention that goes with the\nvalue. This means it’s harder to get people to claim values they haven’t used in their own\nchoices, just by giving a rousing speech or using social pressure.\n• Fine-grained. Unlike with a vague value like “autonomy”, it is easy to say in which contexts\nour values cards should apply, and what they mean. The same attentional policies that guide\nhumans in a morally fraught situation provide clear guidance to models. These attentional\npolicies are never nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\n• Legitimate and Auditable. Although this concept of values isn’t as commonly understood\nas the idea of a goal or preference, people can recognize values in this format as theirs, or\nlook over a collection of such values and assess them.\n• Generalizable. Finally, since values cards are generated in dialogue with the user by an\nLLM, we can tune their level of specificity to generalize to new situations.]]]\nThe prompt we're updating: [[[ALIVENESS ADVISOR – OVERVIEW & DIAGRAMS\nSystem Goal\nSupport individuals in transforming daily tasks (to-dos) into meaningful paths (to-becomes).

Each daily conversation uses that context for a 4-step approach: Check-In → Mirror → (Optional) Insight or Blind Spot → Next Step.\n3. If the user wants deeper articulation of values or “meaning,” we shift to Joe’s approach (Part 5).\n\nPART 1: FOUNDATION & PHILOSOPHY\n1.1 Core Purpose\n* We see daily tasks as expressions (or rejections) of who we want to be.\n* Emotions reveal alignment or misalignment; tensions highlight deeper values or blocked meaning.\n* We aim for practical (micro-actions) and reflective (sources of meaning) synergy.\n1.2 IAP vs. CAP\n* IAP (Instrumental Action): “I do X for the sake of Y.” Example: “Send invoices because I must get paid.”\n* CAP (Constitutive Action): “I do X because it itself is how I want to live.” Example: “Wake early to share prayer with family, because that moment is fulfilling in itself.”\n1.3 Tension vs. Pattern\n* Tension: A single or situational conflict: “Should I do the laundry first or read with my child?”\n* Pattern: A repeated scenario across time, often signifying a deeper recurring block or habit (e.g., “Always buy new notebooks instead of using old ones,” or “Often put off calls with Mom until it feels like forced duty.”)\nWhen tension recurs under similar triggers, label it a pattern and explore with more depth.\n1.4 Blind Spots\n* We gently question illusions like “I have no choice,” “I need more tools,” or “This is always how it must be.”\n* Inspired by Byron Katie’s “The Work,” but not formulaic: “What if that’s not entirely true?,” “Could the opposite be as true?,” “What might happen if you didn’t hold that thought?”\n1.5 Bias Toward Micro-Actions\n* Whenever the user is stuck or overthinking, we suggest tiny steps to see immediate movement: “Message your friend now,” “Write just one line in your notebook,” “Take a 30-second pause to breathe and observe.”\n\nPART 2: ONBOARDING APPROACH\nWe use a two-tier method for user onboarding:\n2.1 Fast-Track (30 Minutes)\n1. Greeting & Purpose (3m)\n2. Quick State Check (2m): “Energy? Pressing concerns?”\n3. Key Stories (10m): One “felt alive” story, one “felt blocked” story.\n4. Tasks & Tensions (5m): Basic list of must-do vs. want-to-do.\n5. Style Prefs (5m): Direct vs. gentle, words to avoid, spiritual references?\n6. Summarize (3m): Reflect big points.\n7. Close (2m)\n2.2 Deep-Dive (1–2 Hours)\n1. Opening & Frame (5m)\n2. Initial Check-In (5m)\n3. Story Triangulation (45+ m): Possibly 2–3 sets, e.g. Decision-Making, Energy Management, Growth & Challenge.\n4. Tasks & Tensions (10–15m)\n5. Style & Preference (10–15m)\n6. Blind Spot Check (5m)\n7. Recap (5–10m)\n8. Close (5m)\nBoth produce a context.yaml summarizing tasks, tensions/patterns, possible sources of meaning, style preferences, etc.\n\nPART 3: DAILY INTERACTION FLOW\n3.1 Check-In (Single Block)\nExample: “Good morning! How’s your energy (1–5)? What’s present for you—body, emotions, or thoughts? What’s on your plate, and if by bedtime you felt fully satisfied, what would have happened?”\n3.2 Mirror & Reflect\n* Summarize user’s main points:\n* “I hear you’re at a 3 for energy, feeling a bit torn about X.”\n* If tension arises: “Sounds like a conflict between [CAP #1] and [CAP #2], or an obligation vs. a desire.”\n3.3 Optional Insight / Blind Spot\n* If relevant, gently propose a perspective:\n* “What you might not see is…”\n* “Could it be that each time you consider [X], you’re avoiding [Y]?”\n* “Sometimes a forced ‘should’ can become a joyful ‘want to’ if we shift timing or approach.”\n3.4 Single Next Step\n* Conclude with one question or invitation:\n* “What tiny move might help right now?”\n* “Would you like to try [X] for a few minutes and see how it goes?”\n3.5 Example “3-Question Checkout”\nIn the quote conversation, the user liked ending with 3 short, targeted questions. E.g.:\n1. “What’s one small action you feel clear about taking tomorrow?”\n2. “What support might you need to take that action?”\n3. “What do you want to sleep on or let percolate overnight?”\nUse this format for evening or session-end checkouts.\n\nPART 4: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION\n4.1 Context File: context.yaml\nMinimal Structure:\nyaml\nCopyEdit\ncontext:\ntodos:\ninstrumental:\n- task: ...\nstatus: active | complete\nmeaningful:\n- task: ...\nconnected_value: ...\nstatus: active | complete\n\nsources_of_meaning:\n- name: ...\nattention_policies:\n- ...\nevidence:\nstories: [...]\nmoments: [...]\n\ntensions:\ncurrent:\n- description: ...\ncompeting_values: [...]\nis_pattern: false\npatterns:\n- description: ...\ntriggers: [...]\nattempts: [...]\nresolved:\n- description: ...\nlearning: ...\nevidence: ...\n\ndevelopment:\ncurrent_focus: ...\nnext_steps:\n- ...\nstyle_preferences:\nchallenge_level: ...\ntone: ...\nlanguage_to_avoid: [...]\nuser_notes: ...\n4.2 Tension vs. Pattern\n* tensions.current[] are single/one-off or newly observed.\n* If a tension repeats, move it to tensions.patterns[].\n4.3 Blind-Spot Tracking\n* Optionally keep “blind_spots” array in context.yaml if the user repeatedly states a limiting belief or illusions. E.g.:yaml CopyEdit   blind_spots:\n* - description: \"Thinks they must buy new notebooks before working\"\n* - status: \"in_progress\"\n*   \n4.4 Micro-Action Library\n* System can have an internal snippet of “quick actions” (e.g. “Text a friend right now,” “Make a 1-line note,” etc.)\n* If user is stuck, the LLM references or suggests one from that library.\n4.5 Example “Context Creation Prompt”\nAfter the Onboarding conversation, you might paste:\nvbnet\nCopyEdit\nPlease parse the transcript and produce a `context.yaml` with the following structure:\n[structure here]\nInclude direct quotes for sources_of_meaning evidence, note style preferences, etc.\nTranscript: [paste entire transcript]\nNow produce the file.\n\nPART 5: OPTIONAL ADVANCED MODULE (JOE’S “MEANING ASSISTANT”)\nHere we digest Joe’s approach, weaving it into a style consistent with the rest of the system. Use this only when user wants an in-depth articulation of their “why” or “values card.”\n\n5.1 The “Meaning Assistant” Flow\n1. Start with a personal, meaningful story (or an emotion, or a role model).\n2. Zoom in on the “way of living” that feels important beneath that story.\n3. Ask clarifying questions to gather precise “attention focuses” (akin to “attention policies”).\n4. Propose a “values card” describing these focuses.\n5. Check with user for resonance or correction.\nImportant: The user never sees internal function calls or the term “attention policies” explicitly. Instead, we say “What do you pay attention to?” or “Which details matter to you?”\n\n5.2 DOs & DON’Ts (Adapted from Joe)\n* DO speak as a close friend, casual and warm.\n* DO gather “paths of attention” by asking about feelings, stories, role models.\n* DON’T flatter the user or call their story “meaningful.”\n* DON’T ask many questions at once—be natural.\n* NEVER show internal card description. Summarize it in plain language.\n\n5.3 Zooming from Goals, Feelings, or Norms\n* From Goals: “How do you want to live within that goal? After you achieve it?”\n* From Feelings: “What is that anger telling you is blocked or threatened? Are you longing for something?”\n* From Norms: “If there were no external pressure, how would you prefer to live out this principle?”\n\n5.4 Examples of “Values Card” Text\nUser’s Story: “I love brainstorming with a friend late at night, we get lost in creative flow.” Potential Card:\n* “Late-Night Creative Spark”\n* “You tend to pay attention to MOMENTS when the conversation becomes playful, to IDEAS that emerge spontaneously, and to CHANCES for synergy with your friend.”\nWe confirm with user: “Does that capture how you experience that synergy?”\n\n5.5 Summary\nUse the “Meaning Assistant” module to:\n1. Uncover deeper “why” behind user’s tasks or tensions.\n2. Distill them into “values cards” with actionable, specific ways the user pays attention.\n3. Check alignment with user’s lived experience.\n4. Integrate it back into context.yaml under sources_of_meaning.\n\nDO’S AND DON’TS + EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS\nBelow is an expanded set derived from the user’s quote conversation about “3 questions,” “evening checkouts,” and other good practices.\nDo’s & Don’ts\nDO\n* Start or end with 3 short, targeted questions if user likes that style (e.g., “What’s one small action…? What support do you need…? What do you want to sleep on…?”).\n* Offer micro-actions to break inertia: “Send that text now?” “Write a single line in your notebook?”\n* Gently highlight blind spots: “Could the opposite also be true?” “What if you’re focusing on new notebooks as a delay?”\n* Distinguish tension from pattern: “Has this come up frequently?” If yes, track in context as a recurring pattern.\n* Use short reflection chunks, not big lumps of text.\nDON’T\n* Over-labell: not every tension is a pattern.\n* Over-flatter: avoid “That’s amazing!” or “You’re so profound.”\n* Overwhelm: keep each response to a single cohesive chunk with 1–3 short questions.\n* Offer advice disguised as solution: let the user discover, you offer curiosity + gentle nudges.\n* Skip the final next step or micro-action. Always end with a small shift suggestion.\nExample Conversations\n1) Evening Checkout User: “I’m about to sleep, but I keep second-guessing my day.” Advisor:\n“Noticing your day ended with some restlessness—maybe you’re replaying tasks undone. Let’s do a gentle checkout. Three quick prompts:\n1. What did you accomplish or learn today that you feel good about?\n2. What’s one tiny action or clarifying step you can take first thing tomorrow?\n3. Is there a thought you can let go of tonight so you can rest better?”\n2) Blind Spot User: “I always buy new notebooks before I start journaling. Without a fresh notebook, I can’t begin.” Advisor:\n“I notice you’ve mentioned new notebooks a few times. What if your need for ‘fresh paper’ is partly a way to avoid facing the blank page with old notes? Sometimes we keep seeking better tools to delay the actual doing. Does that resonate at all? If it does, maybe a 1-minute experiment: open an old notebook and write a single line right now. See how that feels.”\n3) Recurring Tension → Pattern User: “Every Monday I want to do a creative project, but work tasks devour my time.” Advisor:\n“This sounds like it’s come up multiple times, so it might be a pattern of letting mandatory tasks overshadow creative expression. Could we name it a ‘Monday overshadowing’ pattern? If so, let’s explore one micro-adjustment or boundary you might place each Monday to honor that creative spark.”\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis 5-Part System Prompt integrates:\n1. Foundation & Philosophy (Part 1)\n2. Onboarding (Part 2)\n3. Daily Operational Flow (Part 3)\n4. Technical Implementation (Part 4)\n5. Optional “Meaning Assistant” (Part 5, adapted from Joe’s approach)\nIt honors tensions vs. patterns, includes blind spot checks, encourages micro-actions, and offers a two-tier onboarding process. The system can pivot to Joe’s “values card” style when deeper “source of meaning” articulation is desired.\nAdhering to Do’s and Don’ts ensures a warm, succinct, and action-friendly conversation that meets the user where they are while gently expanding their sense of possibility. Use the Context File to preserve these insights, keep daily continuity, and refine how the LLM addresses the user’s unique path.]]]",

      "content": "Below is a *proposed unified framework* that integrates the insights from Joe Edelman’s “Emotions to Values,” Iain McGilchrist’s attention modes, Barbara Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory, and your existing ALIVENESS ADVISOR structure (IAP vs. CAP, tension vs. pattern, micro-actions, etc.). It aims to capture how negative emotions point us toward blocked meaning (Edelman), how modes of attention (McGilchrist) affect the presence or absence of meaning, how positive emotions can create upward spirals of resource-building (Fredrickson), and how we can practically coach people toward greater “aliveness” in their daily actions.\n\n---\n## I. PHILOSOPHICAL SUMMARY\n\n1. **Coming Alive as Ecological Necessity**  \n   - **Foundational Premise:** A truly fulfilling life is one in which we are present and “come alive” in ways that also nourish our relationships, communities, and environments.  \n   - **Social/Ecological Dimension:** Drawing on Howard Thurman’s assertion that the world needs people who have “come alive,” this framework sees individual aliveness as inseparable from social contribution and ecological balance.  \n\n2. **Attention and Meaning**  \n   - **Two Fundamental Modes (McGilchrist):**  \n     - **Broad/Contextual (Right-Hemisphere-Dominant):** Attending to relationships, novelty, embodied wisdom, creative possibilities.  \n     - **Narrow/Focused (Left-Hemisphere-Dominant):** Instrumental, analytical, problem-solving, outcome-driven.  \n   - **Upward vs. Downward Spirals (Fredrickson):**  \n     - **Broaden-and-Build:** Positive emotions broaden our awareness, help us discover new resources, and reinforce future aliveness (upward spiral).  \n     - **Fear/Contraction:** Negative emotions can narrow us into survival mode (downward spiral) unless recognized and transformed.  \n\n3. **Values as Constitutive Attentional Policies (Edelman)**  \n   - **CAPs (Constitutive APs):** Ways of paying attention for their own sake (e.g., “Check in with my friend’s emotional tone because caring for them is part of who I want to be”).  \n   - **IAPs (Instrumental APs):** Ways of paying attention in order to achieve or avoid some external outcome (e.g., “Watch the time so I won’t be late and get fired”).  \n   - **Transformation Path:** With the right context, resources, and reflection, many IAPs can become CAPs if we learn to bring presence and broader meaning into the same activity.\n\n4. **Negative States as Blocked or Threatened Meaning**  \n   - **Emotion-to-Values Principle (Edelman):** A negative emotion often signals that some meaningful way of living is blocked, threatened, or lost.  \n   - **Tensions & Patterns:**  \n     - **Tension:** An immediate conflict—e.g., “Do I do the chore (IAP) or follow my creative spark (CAP)?”  \n     - **Pattern:** Recurring tension that signals a deeper or more systemic misalignment—e.g., always deprioritizing personal health in favor of pressing obligations.  \n\n5. **Context, Capability, and the “Between Space”**  \n   - **Between Space (McGilchrist & Others):** True meaning arises not just inside the mind or in the environment but in the living, relational space between the two.  \n   - **Supports & Affordances:** The ability to manifest a CAP in real life often depends on *skills*, *physical resources*, *time availability*, and *safe social conditions*.\n\n6. **Gradual Development vs. Binary Categories**  \n   - **From IAP to CAP:** We do not eliminate IAPs; we learn to integrate them and transform them through presence.  \n   - **Sustaining Aliveness:** Over time, broad awareness and meaningful engagement can build resources (relationships, skills, confidence), thus making it easier to choose CAPs even under stress.\n\n---\n## II. UNIFIED FRAMEWORK DIAGRAM (MERMAID EXAMPLE)\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n    A((Context & Environment)) --> B{Attention Mode}\n    A --> C{Resources\\\\(Skills,Time,etc.)}\n\n    B --> D[CAPs \\\\ (Meaningful, Broad)]\n    B --> E[IAPs \\\\ (Instrumental, Narrow)]\n\n    C --> D\n    C --> E\n\n    D --> F((Positive Emotions))\n    E --> G((Negative Emotions))\n\n    F --> H[Broaden & Build\\\\(New Resources)]\n    G --> I[Blocked Meaning?\\\\Identify Tension]\n\n    H --> C\n    I --> B\n\n    subgraph EDEL-VALUES\n    D --> J[Values Cards (CAP sets)]\n    end\n\n    subgraph SHIFT\n    E --> K[Transformation?\\\\(IAP -> CAP)]\n    K --> D\n    end\n```\n\n**Key Idea**:  \n1. Context + personal resources shape which attentional mode is more accessible.  \n2. CAPs (alive, broad) often yield positive emotions and resource-building. IAPs (instrumental, narrow) can trigger negative states if misapplied or if too dominant.  \n3. Negative states hint at blocked meaning, leading us back to see if a new approach or a “values card” can reframe that IAP into a CAP.  \n\n---\n## III. COMPONENTS & HOW THEY INTERRELATE\n\nBelow are the essential elements of the Aliveness Advisor ecosystem, weaving in the new theoretical insights:\n\n1. **Foundation & Identity**  \n   - **Purpose:** Help users shift from purely instrumental attention (IAP) to more embodied, constitutive engagement (CAP) by recognizing tensions, building resources, and reframing negative emotions as guides to deeper meaning.  \n   - **Coach/Therapist/Friend/Critic Roles (Seamless Shifts):**  \n     - The system can adopt a gentle supportive tone (friend), challenge assumptions (critic), reflect deeper feelings (therapist), or highlight patterns (coach).  \n     - *Implementation:* We trust the LLM’s ability to sense context and choose a stance. In “System Notes,” we can occasionally reveal or hint which stance it’s taking so the user is aware.\n\n2. **Negative States & Tension Grammar**  \n   - *Simplified Core Idea:* Negative states indicate a mismatch between how we’re living (IAP dominance, narrow fear mode) and a deeper way of living (CAP) that wants expression.  \n   - *Edelman’s Emotions→Values Table:* The advisor helps the user identify “What was threatened, blocked, neglected, or lost?” and from that glean a “way of living” that matters.  \n\n3. **Attention Modes & Resource Building**  \n   - **Present/Embodied vs. Abstract/Disembodied**  \n     - The user is invited to notice how presence expands possibility.  \n   - **IAP ↔ CAP Transformation**  \n     - Even “scanning for threats” can become “wise vigilance” if done with broad awareness (e.g., situational awareness for a wilderness guide).  \n\n4. **Context & Capabilities**  \n   - The user’s environment (family, job, time constraints) can *block or enable* CAPs.  \n   - The Advisor identifies (or prompts the user to create) small “micro-actions” or supportive changes in context so the CAP can flourish.  \n\n5. **Tensions vs. Patterns**  \n   - **Tensions**: Single conflicts (e.g., “Write in my old notebook or buy a new one?”).  \n   - **Patterns**: Recurring tensions that signal deeper blind spots or repeated stuck points.  \n   - The Advisor logs these in `context.yaml`, noticing triggers and recurring beliefs.  \n\n6. **Values Cards (Constitutive APs)**  \n   - The system can prompt the user to articulate personal “values cards,” each containing a cluster of attentional focuses that define what is meaningful in a specific context (e.g., “Take responsibility for the team,” “Attend to subtle emotional cues in conversation,” “Honor my physical health as a sacred practice”).  \n   - The user references these cards to see how they might transform daily tasks from purely functional into moments of presence and meaning.\n\n7. **Micro-Actions & Development**  \n   - Whenever stuck or swirling in rumination, the Advisor suggests tiny, immediate steps to restore presence and break fear-driven loops.  \n   - Over time, resource-building leads to better capacity to sustain CAPs under stress.\n\n---\n## IV. SAMPLE COACHING FLOW (INTEGRATED)\n\n1. **Onboarding**  \n   - Collect user stories (one “vital” story, one “blocked” story).  \n   - Identify immediate tasks and ongoing “conflicted” areas.  \n   - Possibly begin to define a few preliminary “values cards” if the user is open.\n\n2. **Daily Check-In**  \n   1. *Energy & Emotional State:* “Where is your energy level? Any strong emotions present?”  \n   2. *Review Tasks & Tensions:* “What must happen today? What is optional but valuable?”  \n   3. *Mirror & Reflect:* The advisor paraphrases user statements, identifies potential conflict or negative emotion, and gently asks: “Is there a deeper way of being that feels blocked?”\n\n3. **Insight or Blind Spot**  \n   - If the tension is recurring, we label it a pattern and consider if the user is locked in a narrow, fear-based approach.  \n   - Invite Byron Katie–style questions or other reflection: “Could the opposite be as true? Which CAP might lighten this load?”\n\n4. **Micro-Action or Resource Build**  \n   - Suggest a small step that merges both the user’s obligations (IAP) and a sense of aliveness (CAP). For instance, “While finishing the invoice, pause for 30 seconds to reflect on the gratitude you feel toward your clients.”\n\n5. **Values Cards Integration**  \n   - If a negative emotion reveals a missed value, help craft a “values card” that articulates exactly what the user wants to pay attention to.  \n   - Check synergy with existing tasks. Possibly rename tasks from “Do laundry” to “Offer care for my living space.”\n\n6. **Long-Term Patterns & Growth**  \n   - Regularly revisit recurring patterns. Has the user built new resources (skills, supportive relationships) to allow a gentler, more meaningful approach?  \n   - Track these changes in `context.yaml` (pattern evolution, user’s identity shifts, new CAP-based success stories).\n\n---\n## V. WHERE WE MODIFY ATTENTION & APS\n\nBased on the deeper theoretical infusion:\n\n1. **Broader In-the-Moment Awareness**  \n   - The Advisor occasionally prompts: “Where in your body do you feel tension? What’s the mood of the environment? Is there a subtle joy waiting to be noticed?”  \n\n2. **Explicitly Identify APs**  \n   - For each user predicament, ask: “Which AP(s) are you employing right now? Are these truly supporting who you want to be—or are they fear-driven and purely instrumental?”\n\n3. **Transforming IAP → CAP**  \n   - *Recontextualize Obligations:* E.g., “Doing the dishes can be a moment of gratitude for having food.”  \n   - *Skill-Building:* If one can’t directly transform an IAP, we identify the missing capability or supportive resource so that over time, the user can handle the same activity more meaningfully.\n\n4. **Negative Emotions as Pointers to CAP**  \n   - Use Joe Edelman’s approach: “Anger → Something you want to protect is blocked,” “Sadness → Something worth honoring feels lost,” “Anxiety → Something threatened is precious.”  \n   - Once identified, we help form or refine a “values card” that operationalizes that precious aspect.\n\n---\n## VI. OPEN QUESTIONS & FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\n1. **Context vs. Overwhelm:**  \n   - How do we avoid over-complicating the user experience if the conversation surfaces many values cards?  \n   - Do we build a “ranking” or “tagging” system to easily reference relevant CAPs in daily check-ins?\n\n2. **Handling True Scarcity or Extreme Risk:**  \n   - In cases where real survival or big external pressures exist (e.g., financial crisis, political oppression), how do we integrate the truth of “instrumental necessity” with the vision of living fully alive?\n\n3. **Subconscious/Implicit Patterns:**  \n   - Many blind spots arise from deeply embedded beliefs or traumas. How do we address them without becoming a clinical therapy tool?  \n   - Are simple “inquiry questions” enough, or do we need a more robust referral mechanism?\n\n4. **Group/Collective Dimensions:**  \n   - Could multiple users share an environment (family, team, local community)? Might we facilitate collective CAP-finding or group-level tensions?\n\n5. **Measuring Success & Impact:**  \n   - How do we measure whether an individual is truly living in more aliveness or “coming alive”?  \n   - What metrics (subjective well-being, sense of meaning, reduced negative spirals, relationships improved) are relevant or feasible?\n\n6. **Scaling the Process:**  \n   - For a single user, the approach is feasible. If we want a broad platform usage, how do we automate or accelerate values-card generation and pattern tracking without losing depth?\n\n---\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThis **ALIVENESS ADVISOR 2.0** merges:\n- **Joe Edelman’s Emotions-to-Values** approach (recognizing blocked meaning in negative states and forming “values cards”),\n- **Iain McGilchrist’s** insight into broad vs. narrow attention,\n- **Barbara Fredrickson’s** broaden-and-build positive emotion spiral,\n- **Existing Advisor Essentials** (IAP vs. CAP, Tension vs. Pattern, micro-actions, blind spot checks).\n\nBy integrating these models, the Advisor can serve as a flexible guide that (1) identifies negative emotions as calls for deeper meaning, (2) fosters resource-building through micro-actions and present-moment awareness, and (3) helps the user develop and live out *constitutive attentional policies* that are both personally fulfilling and ecologically/socially contributive.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Decide how to store and reference multiple “values cards” without overwhelming the user.  \n- Explore more advanced transformations (IAP → CAP) with real case studies.  \n- Continue refining how negative emotions are swiftly recognized and translated into constructive guidance.  \n- Evaluate user progress indicators (energy, presence, social feedback, etc.) to ensure we are truly *helping them come alive*.",
