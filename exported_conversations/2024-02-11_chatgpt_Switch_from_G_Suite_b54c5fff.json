      "content": "To switch from G Suite (now called Google Workspace) to using only your personal domain with Gmail without the additional paid services, you'll need to go through a few steps. Here's a basic outline of what you should do:\n\n1. **Backup Your Data**: Before making any changes, ensure you have a backup of all your important emails, documents, and other data. You can use Google Takeout to download your data.\n\n2. **Cancel Your Google Workspace Subscription**: \n    - Sign in to your Google Workspace account.\n    - Go to the Admin console.\n    - Navigate to Billing, and then choose your subscription.\n    - Here, you should have an option to cancel your subscription. Follow the prompts to do so.\n\n3. **Set Up Email with Your Personal Domain on Gmail**:\n    - To use your personal domain with Gmail (without Google Workspace), you will need to use an email hosting service that allows domain hosting (like Zoho Mail, or another third-party provider).\n    - Once you have set up your domain with a hosting provider, you can configure Gmail to send and receive emails using your domain's email address. This is done through the \"Accounts and Import\" settings in Gmail.\n\n4. **Configure Mail Forwarding or POP/IMAP** (Optional):\n    - If you still have access to your Google Workspace email, you might want to set up forwarding to your new email address.\n    - Alternatively, you can use POP or IMAP settings to access your old emails through your new email client.\n\n5. **Update Email Address with Contacts and Services**: Don’t forget to update your email address with any contacts, services, or subscriptions that were using your old Google Workspace email.\n\n6. **Resolve Storage Issues**:\n    - Since you mentioned a problem with the 100GB plan, check if your current storage usage exceeds the free limit provided by Google (15GB as of my last update). \n    - If you are over this limit, you may need to delete unnecessary files or purchase additional storage through Google One.\n\nRemember, these steps are a general guide. The exact process may vary slightly based on your specific situation and the third-party services you choose. If you encounter any difficulties or specific error messages, seeking assistance from the support teams of the services you're using (like Google or your new email hosting provider) would be beneficial.",
