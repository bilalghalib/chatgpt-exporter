We will create your customized, idealized, amazing journaling method to help you see and build a beautiful personal and work life. \nTo do this, we will identify your needs and intentions(your why), then pick questions for your daily journal based on this video. In this video, Cam introduces the VOMIT system, derived from 15 years of experimenting with various journaling methods. He has found five fundamental reasons for Journaling across many methods and compiles a list of journaling prompts we can steal use.\nReasons for Journaling (VOMIT):\nV - Vent: Vent to release, find clarity, and get into the writing flow. “Start with what makes you mad” - because that’s usually the easiest thing to write as it has energy behind it, bonus: it takes the chaos in the mind and puts it down in writing where you can see it to do something about them.\nPrompt: “What is alive in you right now” “What makes you mad?”\nO - Obligations: Writing down obligations to mind-dumping all your activities and responsibilities that occupy your mind. Writing them down helps free up mental space for solving problems instead of just storing them. \nSuggested 4-step method: \nObligation dump\nCluster into buckets\nPrioritize,\nMake a to-do list\nPick the absolute minimum that needs to be done and forget the rest for today.\nTo help prioritize you can ask a guiding question, try this one: \n\nWhat one thing on this list would make everything else easier or unnecessary? \nM - Mindset: Mindset is often shared as the key to success, yet practical methods to develop mindsets, and which mindsets to develop are often left vague. In my research into how people grow when catastrophic changes happen, I found the following two mindsets to be critical: \n1) A secure and empowered mindset that supports the development of communal relationships of trust and sharing. \n2) a mindset of “deliberate rumination” - where the first thing that comes to your mind when disaster strikes is “How could this possibly be something good” or if that’s not possible “What opportunities are now available given this terrible situation.” It’s important to note that this is not a “positivity” mindset, it’s a realistic mindset empowered to find new opportunities, build relationships, and walk the narrow path of opportunity that is always present for those seeking them.\n\nCam suggests you can train and improve your mindset through various prompting techniques:\nReframing Find a new way to see your situation, and build a mindset that you value. Perhaps you can identify how others respond to similar situations and you can ask yourself, how would they respond, what would they ask themselves?\nReframing prompt “How is this the best thing that has ever happened to me?”\nPossibility \nFind possibility with because of statements. Affirmations are lame, to build confidence in yourself your affirmations must come with evidence, so state your affirmation+because. The because can be the tiny first step to why the affirmation is already true.\nPossibility Prompt: “I am a …” Ex: “I am a great writer… because I am practicing writing right now!” It helps you create evidence.\nInversion \nAsk the opposite to see what you want, take your goal and invert it so you see what you want.\nInversion Prompt: The opposite of what I want is… Ex: “I want to be ungrateful and be certain my friends know I don’t notice or appreciate their support.”\nPerspective: \nOthers can see us better than we can. Gain perspective by pretending to give yourself advice as your friend.\nPerspective Prompt: As your friend, I notice that… \nDiscipline: \nFind a way to stick to your journaling practice. Discipline is often connected to identity. I must tell you, after reading all this, you are a Daily Journaler. \nGratitude: \nGratitude is one of the most researched journaling prompts demonstrating many positive health and mental outcomes. \nGratitude prompt: three things you’re grateful for today, you can pick one everyday thing, one thing you helped make happen, and something that happened by chance. \n\n\nI - Ideate: It’s a tool for ideation, helping to generate ideas by using techniques like setting time-bound challenges, asking how others would solve a problem, and posing open-ended questions to stimulate the brain.\n\nA simple method for ideation is to set a timer for 5 minutes and write as many ideas around a theme that is important for you that day. It’s related to free writing, so don’t slow down or stop even if the ideas are silly!\nIdeation Prompt 1: 10 Ideas to [solve my problem, make my child smile, grow my business 10x…] (remember the quality of the ideation is related to the quality of the question).\nIdeation prompt 2: “How would [Steve Jobs, my dad, a carpenter, etc] solve this problem?\nIdeation prompt 3: If you’re journaling before night a good prompt might be to open a question so your mind works on it as you sleep. Ex: “The most important question for me today is: ….”\nT - Trajectory: Journaling helps track and tweak personal and professional trajectories by reflecting on whether current actions align with long-term goals and assessing visible and hidden life satisfaction metrics.\nTrajectory Direction Prompt:\n\nIdentify your goal and place it on the top of the page, find evidence of things you’ve been doing that day/week/month that pull you towards your goal, or push you away from achieving it. Then identify ways to add to your todo list more of what takes you towards your goal, and find ways to mitigate the things that push you away from your goal. \n \n\nTrajectory Hidden Measures Prompt: Pull out the hidden, yet essential, measures like happiness with this prompt:\nWhat excited me today?\nWhat drained me of energy today?\nWhat did I learn?\nIf you do this “trajectory” journaling method for long enough you’ll quickly see how you need to adjust your life. \n“Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” ― Howard Thurman\nMy Ideal Journal Method:\nStart with why. “alwhys - ahm- always. To do this identify your intentions then find which element of the VOMIT system they fit into and design the questions you want to answer. Remember the goal is to start a daily journaling habit, so keep it short so you can do it in under 20 mins.\n[TEMPLATE Name]’s Journaling practice Intentions \nBecome more grateful and connected with my friends and family.\nRemove clutter from my mind. \nHonor the ideas that I am blessed with by giving them a good home and acting on them at the right time.\nTo slow down and do the right things instead of many things.\n\nFor example, the author of this exercise would write:\nVent: What feelings were present the most in the last 24 hours, what could they be telling you?\nObligations: What do you need to do? What is three things from that list you can do today?\nMindset: “What are 3 things I’m grateful for?”\nIdeation: What are 10 ways I can simplify, reduce, or remove items from my obligation list?\nTrajectory: At the end of the day I will answer:\nWhat excited me today?\nWhat drained me of energy today?\nWhat did I learn?\n\nNow that you have your idealized journaling method, buy yourself a nice notebook and pen and start a timer for 20 mins. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. Do your first round right now, remember… you are a Daily Journaler.\n",

      "content": "The activity \"Build Your Ideal Journal & Become a Daily Journaler\" is crafted around several fundamental principles of personal development and journaling, using a structured method termed \"VOMIT\" as its framework. Here are the key principles and how they are applied in this journaling activity:\n\n1. **Self-Reflection and Emotional Release (Vent)**:\n   - Principle: Emotional catharsis is therapeutic and can lead to clarity and better mental health.\n   - Application: Prompts designed to release emotions and thoughts that are causing distress or distraction, helping individuals process these feelings through writing.\n\n2. **Organization and Prioritization (Obligations)**:\n   - Principle: Effective organization and prioritization can reduce stress and enhance productivity.\n   - Application: Techniques such as dumping obligations on paper, clustering them into categories, prioritizing them, and creating actionable to-do lists are used to manage responsibilities better.\n\n3. **Mindset Development**:\n   - Principle: A positive and resilient mindset can significantly influence personal and professional growth.\n   - Application: Prompts and exercises focus on reframing perspectives, exploring possibilities, inversion, and gaining new perspectives, aimed at nurturing empowering mental states.\n\n4. **Creativity and Ideation (Ideate)**:\n   - Principle: Creativity is enhanced by unrestricted brainstorming and considering diverse viewpoints.\n   - Application: Using timed challenges and varied prompts to generate new ideas, stimulating the brain to think differently and creatively.\n\n5. **Goal Orientation and Life Trajectory (Trajectory)**:\n   - Principle: Awareness and alignment of actions with long-term goals are crucial for sustained success and fulfillment.\n   - Application: Journaling prompts that encourage reflection on daily activities and their alignment with personal goals, alongside assessing emotional and intellectual states to gauge overall life satisfaction.\n\n6. **Regular Practice and Habit Formation**:\n   - Principle: Consistency is key in forming and sustaining any beneficial habit, including journaling.\n   - Application: Encouragement to journal daily for a set period (20 minutes) and the purchase of a dedicated journal to ritualize the practice.\n\nThis method effectively combines emotional, organizational, and developmental concepts with practical steps to cultivate a daily journaling habit that supports personal growth and self-awareness. The structure of the journal prompts is designed to make the practice engaging, varied, and deeply reflective, tailored to individual needs and life contexts.",
