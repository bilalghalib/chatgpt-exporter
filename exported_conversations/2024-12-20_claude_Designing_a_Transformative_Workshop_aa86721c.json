Let me break this down systematically.\nCurrent Structure Analysis:\nThe current workshop is 2 hours and 50 minutes long, focusing on design thinking and prototyping with marginalized communities.\nStrengths:\n\nGood flow from introduction to practical application\nInteractive elements throughout (check-ins, chat sharing, icebreakers)\nMix of theory and practice\nIncludes both high-tech and grounded solutions\nBookended with reflection (opening word and closing word)\nIncludes case studies and real examples\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n\nToo compressed for community work - rushing through important topics\nMany complex topics get only 5 minutes\nNot enough time for relationship building\nLimited time for actual prototyping work\nMissing community context-setting\nNo breaks scheduled\nNo time allocated for cultural considerations\n\nRecommendations for 2-Day Split:\nDay 1 - Community Context & Design Thinking Foundations\nMorning (9:00-12:30):\n\nOpening ceremony/cultural considerations (30 min)\nIntroductions & community building (45 min)\nCommunity context mapping (60 min)\nBreak (15 min)\nUnderstanding prototyping in community context (60 min)\n\nAfternoon (13:30-17:00):\n\nStory sharing session (45 min)\nDesign thinking principles (60 min)\nBreak (15 min)\nLocal solution showcase (45 min)\nCommunity feedback session (45 min)\nClosing reflection (30 min)\n\nDay 2 - Practical Application & Prototyping\nMorning (9:00-12:30):\n\nOpening check-in (30 min)\nReview & reconnection (30 min)\nHands-on design thinking exercises (90 min)\nBreak (15 min)\nPrototyping basics (45 min)\n\nAfternoon (13:30-17:00):\n\nPrototype development (90 min)\nBreak (15 min)\nCommunity feedback session (45 min)\nAction planning (45 min)\nClosing ceremony (30 min)\n\nKey Improvements:\n\nMore time for relationship building\nProper breaks included\nCultural considerations integrated\nExtended time for actual prototyping\nCommunity feedback sessions\nAction planning for implementation\nOpening and closing ceremonies\nBalance between structure and flexibility\n\nAdditional Recommendations:\n\nInclude local community leaders in facilitation\nBuild in documentation methods\nConsider accessibility needs\nPlan for different literacy levels\nInclude movement activities\nProvide materials in local languages\nCreate space for storytelling\nInclude evaluation components\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or focus on specific areas you'd like to develop further? CopyRetryBGIt's a zoom session and each person is in an different country working on their own projectEditAh, this changes the approach significantly! Let me revise my recommendations for a virtual, multi-timezone workshop with individual projects.\nKey Considerations for Virtual Format:\n\nZoom fatigue - need shorter sessions with more breaks\nTime zone management - participants from different countries\nVirtual collaboration tools needed\nDifferent internet connectivity levels\nIndividual project focus while maintaining group learning\n\nRecommended 2-Day Structure:\nDAY 1 - CONNECTION & CONTEXT\nSession 1 (2.5 hours):\n\nVirtual welcome & tech check (15 min)\nIntroduction & project sharing (30 min)\nCommunity context presentation (20 min)\nBreak (10 min)\nInteractive session: Mapping challenges (45 min)\nStory highlight presentations (20 min)\nClosing check-in (10 min)\n\nBreak (1.5 hours) - Offline project work\nSession 2 (2.5 hours):\n\nEnergizer (10 min)\nDesign thinking principles (30 min)\nBreak (10 min)\nIndividual project work with group consultation (45 min)\nCross-regional solution sharing (45 min)\nDay 1 reflection (10 min)\n\nDAY 2 - PROTOTYPING & ACTION\nSession 1 (2.5 hours):\n\nOpening & reflection sharing (20 min)\nPrototyping methods for virtual context (30 min)\nBreak (10 min)\nIndividual prototyping work (45 min)\nPeer feedback sessions in small groups (35 min)\nClosing check-in (10 min)\n\nBreak (1.5 hours) - Offline project work\nSession 2 (2.5 hours):\n\nEnergizer (10 min)\nProject iteration time (45 min)\nBreak (10 min)\nAction planning presentation (20 min)\nIndividual action plan development (35 min)\nFinal sharing & next steps (20 min)\n\nTechnical Recommendations:\n\nUse Miro/Mural for visual collaboration\nCreate breakout rooms for small group work\nUse chat actively for ongoing engagement\nHave alternative participation methods (chat, verbal, collaborative docs)\nRecord sessions for those who may have connectivity issues\nUse asynchronous tools for between-session work\n\nEngagement Strategies:\n\nPair participants across regions for peer feedback\nCreate smaller accountability groups in similar time zones\nUse shared document for real-time documentation\nIncorporate silent reflection time\nMix individual work with group sharing\nUse polls and quick surveys for engagement\nCreate a virtual gallery of projects in progress\n\nWould you like me to detail any specific segment or suggest specific activities for any part of this structure? CopyRetryBGLet's add some real depth, perhaps we can do breakouts where people talk about the problem and create a story and share it and see if they can get to really feel what drives them, what is the underlying value that fuels them Are there any quotes for this, bonus points if it's international rather than just western although western is fine tooEditYes! This kind of deep, values-based storytelling work is crucial for building authentic community solutions. Let me suggest a structured storytelling session that gets to the heart of people's motivations.\nValues-Based Storytelling Workshop GuideClick to open document\nThis deep storytelling session would work well as the foundation for Day 1, helping participants connect with their core motivations before moving into solution design. The mix of proverbs and quotes from different traditions helps create an inclusive space while acknowledging ancient wisdom about storytelling and change.\nWe could then use these stories as touchstones throughout the workshop, returning to them when:\n\nEvaluating potential solutions (\"Does this honor your core value?\")\nMaking design decisions (\"Which option better serves the future you described?\")\nFacing challenges (\"Remember why you started this work...\")\nCreating implementation plans (\"How does this connect to your community's story?\")\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop specific facilitation techniques for virtual storytelling?\nAdd more structured exercises for getting to core values?\nCreate a framework for connecting stories to solution design?\nSuggest ways to document and weave these stories throughout the workshop?\n CopyRetryBGhow can we add some of the design thinking loops streamlined into this so that it's not an abrupt transition? \nI'd like to talk about the importance of How might we questions, and also bring the idea of closeness with creativity and innovation and problem solving The title of the talk is: \nPrototyping With/In Marginalized Communities - Workshop Day 2Please join us for an interactive workshop exploring approaches to inclusive prototyping with marginalized communities.EditI'll help integrate design thinking loops with the storytelling approach to create a more fluid workshop experience.\nPrototyping With/In Marginalized Communities - Workshop GuideClick to open document\nThis integrated approach:\n\nUses stories as the foundation for design research\nNaturally flows into problem framing through \"How Might We\" questions\nLeverages proximity and community knowledge for ideation\nKeeps values at the center while moving into prototyping\nMaintains an iterative, community-centered approach throughout\n\nThe key is that we're not teaching design thinking as a separate methodology, but rather showing how it naturally emerges from deep community engagement and storytelling.\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop specific exercises for any of these sections?\nCreate more detailed facilitation guides?\nAdd example cases showing this flow in action?\nElaborate on any particular aspect?\n CopyRetry\n\n00:00:08 Kalyan\nWe struggle with a common challenge.

When the only tool you have every problem looks like a nail, that's why people so often make an \"app for that\" and today it will be AI solutions for that. Let's think more deeply and diversely and I'd like people to know what skills they have in the room from their cohorts to learn from and get support from - not only do they need to knjow the problem deeply, they need to get out of their own heads so they see they have more than a hammer to solve the problemEditYou raise an excellent point about avoiding single-tool thinking and fostering diverse problem-solving approaches. Let me help structure this into a workshop framework that encourages broader thinking while incorporating Kalyan's insights.\nBeyond Single-Tool Solutions: Workshop FrameworkClick to open document\nThis framework helps participants:\n\nRecognize their default problem-solving patterns\nExplore diverse solution approaches\nConnect solutions to community validation\nBuild on existing wisdom\nCreate immediate, visible impact\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop specific exercises for any section?\nAdd more validation mechanisms?\nSuggest ways to document the process?\nElaborate on any particular aspect?\n CopyRetryBGLet's also emphasize how beauty can also be a part of the solution, like the beautiful salsabil's which are water fountains that cool the air or court yards - \nAlso another core part is to see if the problem itself can be the solution, for instance the problem of garbage and then founding fuze up to transform it into bags, etc - what other kinds of problems can be solutions can you find 5 cool projects that do that and 5 other ways that beauty is a core part of the solutionEditHere's an exploration of how problems can become solutions and how beauty can be integral rather than decorative:\nProblems as Solutions - Real Examples:\n\nFuze Up (Iraq) - Transforms plastic waste into fashionable bags\n\n\nThe problem: Plastic pollution\nThe solution: Economic opportunity + waste reduction\nAdded value: Fashion and style makes recycling desirable\n\n\nOrange Fiber (Italy) - Converts citrus waste into sustainable fabric\n\n\nThe problem: Massive citrus peel waste from juice industry\nThe solution: Luxury sustainable textiles\nAdded value: Created a whole new material category\n\n\nToast Ale (UK) - Turns wasted bread into craft beer\n\n\nThe problem: Bakery waste\nThe solution: Premium beverages\nAdded value: Raises awareness through enjoyable product\n\n\nMushroom Packaging (Ecovative) - Uses fungal growth for packaging\n\n\nThe problem: Agricultural waste\nThe solution: Biodegradable packaging\nAdded value: Natural aesthetics appeal to eco-conscious consumers\n\n\nPlastic Bank - Transforms ocean plastic into currency\n\n\nThe problem: Ocean plastic + poverty\nThe solution: Economic system for recycling\nAdded value: Creates dignity through entrepreneurship\n\nBeauty as Core Solution:\n\nSalsabil Water Fountains (Islamic Architecture)\n\n\nFunctional: Cools air through evaporation\nBeautiful: Creates soothing sounds and visual appeal\nCultural: Integrates spiritual significance with practical needs\nPsychological: Sound of water reduces stress\n\n\nTraditional Moroccan Riads\n\n\nFunctional: Natural cooling and privacy\nBeautiful: Gardens, tilework, and fountains\nSocial: Creates community gathering spaces\nEnvironmental: Passive cooling reduces energy needs\n\n\nLiving Root Bridges (Meghalaya, India)\n\n\nFunctional: Crosses rivers, gets stronger with time\nBeautiful: Natural integration with environment\nCultural: Represents generational thinking\nEducational: Teaches patience and natural engineering\n\n\nSolar Trees (Various Locations)\n\n\nFunctional: Generates clean energy\nBeautiful: Creates artistic landmarks\nEducational: Makes energy production visible\nSocial: Creates gathering spaces under shade\n\n\nVertical Gardens (Patrick Blanc)\n\n\nFunctional: Improves air quality, reduces heat\nBeautiful: Creates living art\nPsychological: Connects urban spaces with nature\nEnvironmental: Supports biodiversity\n\nKey Principles for Integration:\n\nMulti-solving:\n\n\nLook for solutions that solve multiple problems\nFind ways beauty can enhance function\nConsider cultural and social benefits alongside practical ones\n\n\nNatural Integration:\n\n\nLearn from traditional architecture\nUse local materials and patterns\nWork with natural processes\n\n\nCultural Resonance:\n\n\nConnect to local aesthetic traditions\nHonor cultural practices\nCreate meaningful spaces\n\n\nSocial Impact:\n\n\nMake solutions gathering points\nCreate opportunities for interaction\nBuild community pride\n\n\nEducational Value:\n\n\nMake processes visible\nCreate teaching opportunities\nInspire new thinking\n\nThis approach helps us see that:\n\nProblems contain hidden resources\nBeauty can be functional\nSolutions can honor tradition while innovating\nDesign can serve multiple purposes simultaneously\nCultural practices often contain deep wisdom about sustainability\n\nWould you like me to explore any of these examples in more detail or suggest additional ways to integrate these principles into the workshop?

Ask me 10 questions to help you create a smooth workshop flow. I will add the context and thpastedBG\nEditBased on the comprehensive context you've provided, I'll analyze your workshop goals, themes, and key needs. Then I'll ask 10 strategic questions to help create a smoother workshop flow.\nKey Goals:\n\nBridge theory and practice in prototyping for marginalized communities\nIntegrate multiple approaches to problem-solving beyond tech solutions\nEmphasize validation through community impact\nConnect learning directly to community needs\nBalance design thinking with indigenous wisdom and local solutions\n\nCore Themes:\n\nValidation vs. Motivation\nBeauty as Functionality\nProblems as Solutions\nThe Power of Doing Less\nMultiple Forms of Capital\nCommunity Connection and Impact\n\n10 Strategic Questions:\n\nHow can we modify the opening to immediately establish the connection between personal stories and design thinking, perhaps incorporating Kalyan's concept of \"validation through impact\"?\nThe current ice breaker focuses on imagination - should we adapt it to include more community storytelling elements while keeping the playful energy?\nYour slides include multiple frameworks (Einstein's problem-solving, Jobs' problem definition, etc.) - how can we streamline these to create a clearer narrative thread?\nWould it be valuable to include a segment where participants identify different forms of capital in their communities before starting the design process?\nThe current flow moves quickly between concepts - should we restructure to give more time for depth in fewer areas rather than covering many topics briefly?\nHow can we integrate the \"beauty as solution\" examples more naturally into the design thinking process rather than treating them as separate case studies?\nThe current workshop includes many individual exercises - should we incorporate more pair or small group work to build on the collective wisdom in the room?\nCould we create space for participants to identify and share examples of \"doing less\" solutions from their own communities?\nThe closing currently focuses on individual feelings - should we expand it to include community impact reflections?\nHow can we better integrate the practical prototyping exercises with the various theoretical frameworks (8 forms of capital, problems as solutions, etc.) without overwhelming participants?\n\nWould you like me to explore any of these questions in more depth or propose specific modifications to the workshop structure? CopyRetryBG1) I think we can do that by going into breakouts and sharing a story of gratitude to start? Or starting quickly with some breakouts so people notice it's not a day for being by themselves without sharing\n1. yeah, would love to keep the playful element and connect it with stories and feelings and attention and values in a simple way\n2. these are just going to be background elements so it's nice\n3. yeah, that would be awesome, what resources do people have. we need to redefine marginalized, what is marginalized, where is the margin? \n4. yeah, let's see what the essentials are and focus on that - the design thinking framework I tohught could be for day 2\n5. i like the idea of talking about beauty, there is no problem, and do nothing as solutions to help with creativity and see if we can use this to look at their problems and to find a \"beautiful, problem is the solution, or do nothing solution\" for their challenge \n6. yeah, i was thinking to do more things in breakouts\n7. yeah, love that idea suggesting to do that in answer six here\n8. yeah, i think i'd like to bring in the community more somehow, what knowledge do we have and skills and abilities \n9. I think the practical can be seen as a way of getting deeper stories and a framework to DO things with a time limit because that can enhance creativity. which reminds me I'd like to do a 10 ideas / paper clip creativitiy ice breaker in the startEditGreat feedback! Let me propose a revised flow incorporating these ideas:\nOpening Sequence (30 mins):\n\nQuick Welcome & Paperclip Challenge (10 mins)\n\n\n10 ideas in 2 minutes: \"What can you do with a paperclip?\"\nShare most creative ideas in chat\nLinks to: creativity under constraints, reframing problems\n\n\nBreakout Storytelling (20 mins)\n\n\nGroups of 3-4\nShare a story of gratitude from your community\nListen for: values, attention points, what makes people come alive\nReturn and share key insights\n\nRedefining Margins & Resources (45 mins):\n\nCommunity Asset Mapping (25 mins)\n\n\nUse 8 forms of capital framework\nIn breakouts: \"What resources do we have?\"\nChallenge assumption of \"marginalized\"\nWhere is the center?

CopyRetryBGWhat if we also had an element where we added the importance of getting out of your head/finding different ways to think about the problem, analyzing it and looking at the different scales, and levers one can hold on to to identify solutions and that involves education, perhaps using AI to help break down a problem into its ocmponents to see which is the most managable part to work on or other people's experiences and knowledge can bring more hammers screwdriers and chisels to bear to the probelmEditYes! Adding systematic problem analysis and different thinking modalities can help people get unstuck and see new angles.

I'm so glad to have this opportunity\n00:30: to hang with you guys today.\n00:37: This is Joyce, who's my partner in crime.\n00:48: Change your name. Change your name.\n00:53: Hey. Hey. Do you have a song you\n00:57: would like to welcome? I like what's Going On. I like this,\n01:00: like, boppy fun.\n01:03: Should I change my background?\n01:10: There's a bunch of, like, art. But I could.\n01:14: Where is this? I could put the.\n01:18: Oh, this could\n01:21: be red but blurry, maybe. This is nice.\n01:24: Less distracting. I think that's good.\n01:28: All right. How many people are in the.\n01:31: In the waiting room right\n01:37: now? Yeah, no,\n01:40: I think. No, I think a little less because they're a bunch of note\n01:44: takers. Yeah,\n01:49: I think now you need to.\n01:55: Oh, okay. Cool, cool. Let me just do that.\n02:02: Okay.\n02:16: Oh, shall we let them in? Yeah, sure.\n02:19: Cool.\n03:04: Let me take you through.\n03:27: Thank you. Thank you. Welcome, everyone.\n03:31: All right. Bonjour. Hello.\n03:36: Let's maybe wait a couple of more minutes for folks to join in, and then\n03:40: we can introduce the session. Okay, so while people are\n03:43: waiting for the joiners, can. Can we just,\n03:47: like, get people to write where they're dialing in from in\n03:50: the chat? This is my first time meeting people, so let me.\n03:53: I'll start off. So where are you recording in progress.\n03:57: Oh, hello, everybody. Yeah, so where are you signing in from? And maybe\n04:02: if you feel excited, you can share something\n04:05: you're grateful for signing\n04:14: today.\n04:26: You know, I wish I could be less corny, but, like, when I really feel\n04:30: into it, I am actually kind of excited and really happy to meet all\n04:33: of you guys today. So it's corny,\n04:38: but it's true. It's like, it's not corny at all.\n04:41: This is the feeling that we can all echo. It never gets boring.\n04:45: And, yeah, wow. We got people from. Oh, my goodness.\n04:49: We got people about to sleep and people like waking up. So thank\n04:53: you guys for, you know, either getting up early\n04:57: or skipping dinner to be a part of this.\n05:00: Uganda, Kenya. We have some people from Mexico,\n05:03: Kimberly from Hawaii. Wow. Amazing.\n05:07: Okay, so, you know what? As long as we're waiting, a couple of more\n05:12: minutes or seconds, if you have a\n05:16: challenge that you would like to design a solution for already,\n05:20: you can write the challenge, or if you don't have the challenge, say, I'm looking\n05:24: for a challenge. So I'm not. I'm not. I just kind\n05:27: of. I want to feel where people are at. So do you know what problem\n05:30: you're trying to solve today? And if you do, please write it in the chat.\n05:35: Short description. Otherwise, Say, I'm still looking for\n05:39: a challenge to solve.\n05:47: Welcome.\n05:52: It's not the first time, Shaytan, that people tell me I\n05:56: remind them of a poet, especially people from\n06:00: India and the subcontinent. Mashallah.\n06:06: My challenge today is interesting.\n06:21: It's a good one. Zakaria Zachariah.\n06:27: Water scarcity and water management. Yeah,\n06:30: awesome.\n06:34: Great. So, yeah, today we're going to be talking a little bit about\n06:38: really getting to understand the problem.\n06:41: And also we're going to be talking a little bit about some\n06:45: maybe counterintuitive approaches.\n06:49: Inshallah.\n06:55: Fantastic. And I think with that, we can begin.\n06:58: Okay, great. So let me.\n07:01: It gives me such pleasure to introduce Lalal to all\n07:05: of you. He's been such a key part of my life and key part\n07:08: of so many initiatives between us over\n07:13: the years and somebody I deeply admire and so\n07:17: deeply inspired by. And I hope Lalal\n07:21: also gets to share his journey with you\n07:25: and a little bit of his life story, because it'll blow you away.\n07:29: And also just his energy, his aura\n07:33: is really infectious. So you really get to see a lot\n07:37: of that today. So I won't\n07:40: dabble too much into the story. I'm sure you've read a little bit about it.\n07:45: But what I can tell you is that his perspective\n07:49: and his passion for the\n07:52: work to bring communities together, to get communities to believe\n07:56: in themselves and in each other, is unmatched.\n07:59: And I hope we get to see even a little bit of\n08:02: a glimmer of that with all of you today. So over to\n08:06: you. Okay. All right. Thank you so much.\n08:10: I am, yeah, I'm so glad that we\n08:14: have some good time together today. And it looks like.\n08:17: Okay, so we have people that are working on actually a\n08:21: couple of water pollution. Um, there's people already on the\n08:25: prototyping, which is awesome. And it never hurts to\n08:28: go back and think about the challenge a little bit deeper.\n08:31: Um, so, inshallah, everyone will benefit today.\n08:34: Um, and. And it looks like we have a bunch\n08:37: of active and engaged people. That's so for me,\n08:42: you know, when you do a workshop, especially when it's virtual, it can\n08:45: be really challenging. So as I. Do you guys know how to do this?\n08:50: One second. Check this out.\n08:54: You guys know how to do that? Can you see my screen with the hearts\n08:57: floating around? Do you guys know how to, like, add different\n09:02: gestures or chat\n09:05: in the chat? If you know how to chat in the chat,\n09:09: like write your nickname or what your parents called you when you were a kid?\n09:12: Okay. My parents called me Bulbul. I want to\n09:15: see some Chat moving. Okay. So feel free. I want to see. I want to\n09:19: see people reacting. Yeah, what up? I'm. You know\n09:22: what? You can even add it to your name. That'll be kind of cool.\n09:24: Like, get familiar and happy with Zoom.\n09:27: We live in an age where we\n09:33: often are talking online, but we're\n09:36: just passive. Okay? So please, I will not\n09:39: be annoyed if you add bunny emojis like Nihal just did\n09:43: or. Or if you're adding stuff in the chat. I'm gonna be monitoring it.\n09:46: You know, we have Nihal here. She's my\n09:49: colleague. I have these co conspirators with Nihal and\n09:53: Joyce. We can handle you guys. Okay?\n09:56: So whatever you want, bring it,\n09:59: and it'll be way more fun for me and hopefully more\n10:02: fun for you guys. So thank you, Joyce. Thank you,\n10:05: Lucy. Thank you, I guess. Thank you,\n10:08: Parker. Lucy, your parents called you Parker. Is that true?\n10:13: Okay. Okay. Can we just get, like a short story about that before\n10:16: we begin? And then. And then I'll get into my slides. I promise I'll do,\n10:19: like, some serious work. But, yeah,\n10:22: okay. Well, when I was\n10:25: young, I used to love Spider Man.\n10:28: Yeah. So his name was Peter Parker,\n10:33: so I really loved him. I love the costumes,\n10:37: everything. So they were like, okay, now we're going to call you\n10:40: Parker, and I go by Parker now on social media.\n10:43: So, yeah. Amazing. Amazing. Okay.\n10:47: You know, with great power comes\n10:50: great responsibility. Absolutely, absolutely. And so, you know,\n10:53: what we have in this room right now, we're going to talk about something called\n10:58: the eight forms of capital. You know, capital is a kind of\n11:01: power in our age. And we're going to see that this room\n11:04: is actually really, really just full of power. And hopefully you\n11:09: guys are beginning to see that and connect with each\n11:12: other. I. You know, I'm not as involved as\n11:16: Nihal and Joyce, but really, when I see a room full of people\n11:19: that are, like, seeing challenges of water, seeing their communities without jobs,\n11:23: and think, like, wait, what can we do about this? It really is inspiring\n11:27: and I'm really hoping to, yeah.\n11:30: Share something interesting about a little bit about my journey and\n11:34: in the process, learning about yours as well. So I'm going to share my\n11:37: screen. Let me just share everything,\n11:41: and then I'll go here and Bismillah. Okay.\n11:47: Joyce, Nihal, please be monitoring the chat.\n11:50: If. If you guys want to, like, interrupt me and tell, like, a really\n11:54: amazing story or something like that, I'd be way more\n11:58: than happy to oblige. So feel free.\n12:01: Raise your hand so I can see you guys pop up as you guys know,\n12:04: Zoom only gives me this little sliver of a window for all of the\n12:08: faces. So use the hand raising thingy\n12:11: Mabob or how do you do that over here? That way it actually shows you\n12:15: up on my screen. Okay, so bespin and sorry and\n12:19: sorry, if you can, as we start\n12:23: to have more discussions, please turn on your camera so we\n12:27: can have a more personalized conversation and you\n12:30: can build a much deeper relationship as we\n12:34: proceed with the workshop. So unless your connection is,\n12:37: is not allowing you to do that, I, I would really appreciate turning\n12:40: on your camera. Maybe when you're presenting it's fine, but like\n12:44: when we're having conversations, I would really appreciate that.\n12:47: All right, sorry. Bilal, over to you. Yeah, no worries about it. I did hear\n12:50: that we have people from, I mean I saw people from all over the world\n12:53: and I used to live in Lebanon and the power would just cut arbitrarily.\n12:57: Like I'd be in the middle of a very important work session and the power\n12:59: would go blank and it would be like this and then I'd have to come\n13:03: back. So I understand what it's like to be in a place without power and\n13:07: without good access to Internet.\n13:10: But today we're going to be trying to keep it as\n13:13: interactive as possible. So in the chat, in breakout\n13:16: rooms, if, if you're not able to share,\n13:19: it will actually be kind of difficult for\n13:23: me to facilitate because when I break send people into breakout rooms,\n13:28: I hope that you're able to share. So without a video, totally fine.\n13:31: Even if you have to type, totally fine. But I hope you guys are ready\n13:34: to be engaged and connecting with each other today.\n13:38: That's one of the things that I think Nihal mentioned is\n13:42: really a lot of my dream. You know, I used to be an engineer.\n13:45: I used to build robots for recycling machines.\n13:49: And I had this thought one day, I was like,\n13:53: oh, okay. So let's say that I solved this very specific\n13:56: technical engineering problem trying to do good in the world, right? Work on\n13:59: recycling. Then I would solve another one and then I'd\n14:03: solve another one and maybe I could have three breakthroughs in my life\n14:06: versus what if I became a teacher\n14:10: and started sharing this idea that we can together.\n14:14: If we see a challenge in the world, if we start to\n14:18: realize that the world that we see is co constructed.\n14:22: Of course there are people that are, you know,\n14:26: creating more of some\n14:29: of the difficulties and the challenges than others.\n14:33: But we are all a part of this. The way that\n14:37: the we put our energy where\n14:41: we place our feet where we vote with\n14:45: our resources and where we shop and how\n14:48: we do things. These are the ways that we actually co construct\n14:51: the world, not just with our projects. And when we actually take\n14:55: an active role in creating a project and saying okay this,\n15:00: this world is like this, I can either fit into it or if we see\n15:03: the world and we think okay, it's not exactly how I would like\n15:07: it to be, maybe there's something that I can do about it then\n15:11: we're actually more engaged in becoming active co constructors and so\n15:15: I hope that this, it's so interesting. Prototyping with\n15:19: and in marginalized communities. The word marginalized\n15:23: is so interesting for me and I really hope that we get to\n15:26: talk about it. Does anybody want to kind of tell\n15:30: me what they think about this title about like prototyping in and with marginalized communities?\n15:34: What does it mean for you? You can feel free to raise your hand,\n15:36: put it in the chat.\n15:41: Bloop. Go ahead Ricardo.\n15:45: So well my context it would be\n15:49: communities far away from the center of\n15:52: the country, center of the cities we have here.\n15:57: So what I'm expecting\n16:02: startup is on how to engage with them.\n16:05: Since I'm not someone that has. I've been like far away from the cities but\n16:09: not in these communities. So I'm expecting to learn tools to\n16:12: engage properly with them. Yeah,\n16:15: absolutely. Interesting. I didn't, I didn't actually think about that but that\n16:18: makes a lot of sense that especially when there\n16:22: are people that you feel for and that you see the\n16:25: challenges of people in maybe the outskirts of\n16:30: city and you might think okay, how can I break in in an\n16:33: appropriate way and, and enter into a conversation that\n16:37: that's actually a really important thing that inshaallah. We'll talk\n16:41: about it a little bit today and but I'll just\n16:44: straight off the bat share a small story of a\n16:49: kid named Saleh. Saleh and I met\n16:53: in a refugee camp in Lebanon. So I'm a college educated person. I came from\n16:57: America, I flew to Lebanon and I knew nobody.\n17:00: And what started happening was\n17:05: I know, okay, this is just a personal reflection but my, my experience\n17:09: but I found that language\n17:14: and making sure that language was there. So being able\n17:17: to speak Arabic was really helpful. And then food sounds\n17:21: crazy but just like making experiences where you\n17:24: can have a human to human relationship before\n17:28: you start adding other ideas about like oh so what problems are you having?\n17:31: Let me design something for you. Or however the conversation goes\n17:35: is creating a context where there's a regular experience of humanity\n17:39: and connection and so What I\n17:42: did was I turned my house into a co living space.\n17:46: And initially, you know, we would do little events related\n17:51: to storytelling and food and you know,\n17:56: years go on. And at some point he's like my co founder and we're like\n17:59: living together and it grows from there. And I guess the\n18:03: other element of that is don't rush it. So anybody\n18:07: else want to share a little bit about, like, what does this slide\n18:11: mean for them or how does it resonate with them? I'm kind of curious how\n18:14: people take this. This prompt.\n18:17: Yeah. Inclusivity. Bottom. Okay.\n18:21: Zachary, is prototyping with people a little behind in technology?\n18:25: Okay, interesting. Yeah, absolutely.\n18:28: Means go ahead. Yeah, I'll say\n18:32: prototyping in marginalized or with marginalized people mean\n18:38: prototyping a project with or designing\n18:41: a project with people that are excluded from\n18:45: economic, political or social reasons.\n18:48: And so at this point, you're prototyping to understand or to\n18:52: address the real challenges that the people in that community are facing.\n18:56: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. This idea of the\n19:00: real challenges that people are facing,\n19:03: how do you think you can get access to that?\n19:06: How do you think you can really identify those challenges?\n19:11: Maureen or anybody else?\n19:26: Go ahead, Alexandra. And then, and then Maureen, if you want to follow up.\n19:31: No, on that note, I just wanted. I kind of went\n19:35: through that process already when I traveled to the northeast of India.\n19:39: And on that note of understanding what the real\n19:43: issue is, I think often with like college educated people,\n19:46: we have like a preconception of what the problem probably\n19:50: is and what has to be done. But I think this\n19:53: is really the first step to lose that preconception and first of all\n19:58: become like a humble listener and really just\n20:02: listen and don't say anything and just try to take\n20:05: it in and then later on to react. And I think for me at\n20:09: least, that was like a big lesson I learned. And I think this is\n20:13: really something every process needs. If you really want to\n20:17: work on a real problem and not show something just on your head.\n20:20: Yeah, yeah. Could you actually tell us maybe one of the\n20:24: things that you learned and maybe a short story about it,\n20:28: in short. So I got invited by university\n20:32: to northeast India, in Assam,\n20:35: to a city called Guwahati. And the idea was to\n20:39: analyze the traditional architecture and come up with new\n20:43: social housing ideas. And of course\n20:46: I was really like\n20:50: impacted by my education and like sustain sustainable thoughts\n20:54: of like, the different practices and how things\n20:58: should be happen, especially coming from Europe. But then\n21:02: once I started to talk to people, there are way more social\n21:06: and cultural reasonings also behind things they're doing,\n21:11: like also of choosing certain building typologies.\n21:15: So then often what I did is, was trying to get to\n21:18: these people that are on this transition and like just talking\n21:22: with them how they feel about their building right now. How do they\n21:25: feel about getting information? Okay, you're building this now,\n21:29: why you're doing it in terms of construction, but also\n21:33: how it works in the, in the community there\n21:36: in what is the impact? And slowly\n21:40: through that, getting a better picture. That was a bit. The process.\n21:45: Yeah, yeah. One of the core things that I heard you talk about was\n21:49: how you feel and the word feeling came up a couple\n21:53: of times and yeah, I think.\n21:57: Have you. Yeah, I think this idea of letting go\n22:01: of what you know, to listen enough\n22:05: so that you can hear how things can be different.\n22:09: Right. You know,\n22:12: the challenge is I'm going to just put up the slide. I wasn't going to\n22:15: do it initially, I was going to do it at a later time. But this\n22:18: idea of what we know, what we\n22:21: learn. So I study computer programming and almost every time I see a\n22:25: problem, I'm like, oh, let's make an app. You know, like,\n22:28: how many, how many times have you guys, like, especially people that use apps all\n22:32: the time, like, you come up with a problem and you're like, oh my God,\n22:35: like this should be an app where you can like push a button and you\n22:38: know your facilitation, you just put what's next on the slide and\n22:42: some kind of app. I don't know, like for me, because of what I studied\n22:45: and what I learned and what I know, I come with a\n22:49: bunch of perspectives and I think what you were sharing about\n22:53: feelings and connecting with feelings as\n22:56: the beginning of a design process is really important.\n23:00: And this is going to be not\n23:04: controversial, going to be a challenge. I'm going to challenge everybody here.\n23:08: It's. It's okay. Who wants to hear one of my, one of my big\n23:11: failures, like in my life, like failures that\n23:15: I keep confronting in my life over and over.\n23:18: Anybody willing, you want to hear how an almost 40 year\n23:21: old dude just like keeps making stupid mistakes?\n23:26: My stupid mistakes happen because I\n23:30: don't listen deeply enough and\n23:34: change what I'm doing based on feedback. And pivoting\n23:38: is scary. Pivoting is hard.\n23:41: Changing your idea is extremely difficult because you're so\n23:44: invested. You know, you put in so much time and effort and money. Let's say\n23:48: you produce something, you worked on something for ages. I get,\n23:52: I'm a very nostalgic person. I have like this kind of this feeling of like,\n23:55: oh my God, no, I can't let this go. It's, it's so important.\n23:59: We like, we wrote all this code. Can we actually throw\n24:02: away all this code? And sometimes it's the right thing to do.\n24:06: So this is what I'm going to try to flip for you guys.\n24:10: The solution should be the less important part of\n24:14: this like prototyping thing. The thing that we're going to\n24:17: be learning more is the courage to love and\n24:21: to care enough to solve the real problem\n24:25: and to listen well enough to hear what this real problem is.\n24:29: And I hope that's something that I can\n24:33: learn. I don't know how. Does anybody have any ideas\n24:36: about that actually? Like, what advice would you give me? I built something,\n24:41: right? I spent a long time working on it and coding it\n24:44: and it doesn't get much traction. Like it doesn't seem like people really\n24:48: want to be using it and I'm not listening enough to\n24:52: either change it or even do something else. What would you tell me?\n24:55: Okay, go ahead, Maureen. I didn't think it was going to be a therapy session\n24:58: today. I'm sorry, Nihal. Like I'm taking over the workshop\n25:02: and turning into my own personal therapy session. But I hope it's useful for others.\n25:05: Marine, go ahead. Yeah, I wanted to\n25:08: mention that there's part of our.\n25:12: In Module 5 we were talk about something called cognitive bias\n25:15: and in there they something to do with sun cost fallacy.\n25:19: So I think that is probably something they're experiencing where you insist\n25:23: on a specific project because you've already invested a lot of resources into it.\n25:27: So maybe it's a bias that you need to like look into and try and\n25:30: find ways to overcome it. Yeah, yeah. The sunk cost fallacy\n25:34: is definitely strong with me. I'm curious how,\n25:38: Ricardo, how would you suggest I let go of the sunk cost\n25:41: fallacy?\n25:45: Well, I had a similar situation before my project,\n25:50: this project I had a project of over three years.\n25:53: We had pretending we were almost in the\n25:59: contract side of making contracts already getting\n26:03: customers. But things\n26:07: happened and I wasn't able to continue with it. And I was like\n26:12: it was really dragging me down.\n26:15: I was able to realize that. So what I did is\n26:19: look where my project was useful\n26:25: for someone else and in this case it was\n26:28: a friend of mine that he wasn't interested\n26:32: really in the project per se, but he wasn't able to\n26:35: make one himself to get into property he wanted.\n26:44: That was like easier for me to let go that way.\n26:48: It clipped a little Bit at the end.\n26:52: Can you, can you just say the end or write it? I'm not sure if\n26:55: it was just for me or for everyone. Oh, well, I,\n26:58: I, sorry. I have, I,\n27:02: like my friends, got the job based on my thanks to my that project.\n27:06: And that was like easier for me to let go,\n27:09: like knowing it was useful even though I\n27:12: no longer work with it directly. Okay,\n27:16: so seeing it like continue out in the world somewhere helps\n27:20: you kind of let go of you needing to do it yourself, but like\n27:24: having it live on. I think that's a beautiful idea and it's\n27:27: actually very useful, very helpful for me.\n27:30: Georgina, is that how you pronounce your name?\n27:34: Yes, it's Georgia. Welcome.\n27:38: Thank you. So whenever I'm in such a situation,\n27:42: I, I have a group of\n27:45: friends. So whenever I'm in a situation where I\n27:49: don't know whether to move forward with something, I feel like this idea maybe\n27:53: doesn't make sense. Having doubts. I call\n27:57: them and I'm like, look, please just tell me the truth. This is\n28:00: where I'm at. This is what has happened. This is everything.\n28:04: Just tell me the truth. Am I wasting my time? Should I continue?\n28:08: And I found that having those few friends who\n28:12: tell you, yeah, this is good, this is crap\n28:16: just helps because they are very honest. And sometimes getting\n28:21: honesty from someone you know that is cares\n28:24: about you and your project help to get some clarity on\n28:28: your way forward. Absolutely,\n28:30: absolutely. And it reminds me of this quote that I\n28:34: had prepared. The shortest distance\n28:38: between truth and a human being is a story.\n28:42: And so I thought what we could do is\n28:46: get into breakouts and actually, you know\n28:49: what, what I'll do first is I wanted to also go through\n28:53: an example of a time where I\n28:57: think I did it a little bit better in\n29:00: another facilitation. So who am I? My name is Vidal Ghalib.\n29:05: I've had some experience with being\n29:08: a part of different hackathons and camps\n29:12: around sustainability. I've, you know, I used to build my own\n29:16: robots for recycling and then worked with\n29:20: community spaces around the world. I moved from building to\n29:23: creating communities of people around me and being\n29:28: a part of these groups that were thinking about challenges and\n29:32: you know, working on open source solutions and creating projects\n29:36: and at some point businesses. I currently run an\n29:40: accelerator program in Lebanon called Bloom Bloom\n29:44: pm where we're trying to bring in personal development and professional\n29:47: development and really show that it's one and the same. That as\n29:51: you grow as a person, what you can grow through, your organizations\n29:55: are symbiotic and synergistic. They actually work together.\n29:59: So that's kind of where I'm at today.\n30:02: And one of the projects though, that I did a long time\n30:05: ago now, back in 2014, we were running\n30:09: a lot of hackathons. Has anybody been in a hackathon before?\n30:12: Or like, yeah, okay, so I got a couple hands, I got a couple\n30:15: of nods. Okay, great. So a hackathon is like, okay, let's solve a problem.\n30:19: Here's the. Let's, you know, let's talk about water. You guys want to solve like\n30:22: a water problem. There's a couple of water people here. And let's do three days,\n30:26: go Internet research, make a prototype present.\n30:29: And I started really realizing that it wasn't connecting much\n30:33: with people. People weren't really able\n30:38: to talk to people and understand their problems with water access\n30:41: or the bigger context because hackathons\n30:45: are so fast. And so I proposed and\n30:48: I got some support\n30:52: to run a month long session where we called it\n30:55: DIY sustainability. And it was all about building relationships\n30:59: between people that could create stuff,\n31:02: right? They, they were the hackers, the makers. They have like laser cutters and I\n31:05: don't know what, and people with real challenges in the\n31:09: local communities. And so this\n31:13: is just some slides from one of the teams that were there.\n31:16: They called themselves city growers. And city Growers\n31:21: basically takes unused lots in, in the\n31:24: Boston area and they turned them into farms.\n31:28: So it's taking a problem,\n31:32: which is blight and empty spots inside of a\n31:35: city and it turns them into food because often cities are food deserts.\n31:39: This happens a lot where I grew up in Michigan,\n31:43: in metro Detroit and in the Detroit area. And what\n31:47: they did really well though was actually going and asking\n31:51: them their real challenges. And so they were\n31:55: talking about how much they're spending on weeding. They talked about\n31:58: like how expensive seeds are increasing crop yields.\n32:02: And they did like this team in particular, I think they\n32:05: called themselves Team Wasabi. I don't know why. Got really, really good\n32:09: at getting them to share more of their\n32:13: problems. And at some point they get into\n32:17: the solution side of things. But I'm not even gonna focus on the solution side\n32:20: of things like this. Like we mentioned earlier, it's not as\n32:23: important as this slide, which is after making the\n32:27: solutions, they go and they present them and\n32:30: they continue to get feedback. And this is going to be an important thing.\n32:34: Some people are kind of early in their journey for their,\n32:37: their projects and people seem to already have a prototype.\n32:40: But no matter where you are, this idea of being\n32:44: able to let it all go based on real authentic feedback\n32:48: means that it's more connected to truth and people and\n32:52: goodness. And yeah, it kind of looks like this,\n32:56: right? Like where there's food and people\n32:59: and paper and stories and sharing and\n33:02: it's a very different way of thinking about creating and creating solutions.\n33:07: So what I, what I wanted to\n33:10: do, I don't know, it's my dad. I'm gonna turn that off and\n33:14: close this. Okay, Sorry about that, guys. Let me just.\n33:17: Yeah, I think it's closed. Yeah. What I wanted to do is get\n33:22: people to connect and to share the\n33:26: challenge and to share the story. So not just\n33:30: like what the problem is, but I also want to know why\n33:34: does it matter to you? And one brave\n33:38: person then breakouts means is there somebody who\n33:41: didn't share yet willing to go first of\n33:46: the problem, that they. Of the things that they see\n33:49: in the world tell the story in a way that can help us\n33:53: see what you see and then tell us why does it matter to you?\n33:56: And then we're going to go into breakouts where everyone can do it.\n33:59: But is there a volunteer?\n34:05: Hillary.\n34:11: Hi.\n34:15: Yeah, so my name is Hillary and I think I'll just\n34:18: try and make this quick. Yeah.\n34:22: So a number of us are able to recall\n34:26: a Covid period and during that\n34:31: period we found ourselves at an intersection where I\n34:35: was out of school and we\n34:39: are at home. But then because of our prevailing\n34:44: circumstances, we realized that we are\n34:47: not really able to get access to what you call energy\n34:52: security. So in this sense it means that when you\n34:56: want to prepare your meals, then you are unable to\n34:59: do so. And then it\n35:03: went so bad to the extent that now we had to like ensure that\n35:07: we cooked in open fires by 6pm\n35:12: simply because it will be raining from\n35:16: 6pm and then, so when\n35:20: I, when I faced this challenge, then I thought to myself,\n35:24: how many more people have to\n35:28: undergo the inconveniences\n35:32: of having trouble accessing a clean\n35:36: and an affordable cooking solution?\n35:40: And that is where now it moved from me\n35:44: thinking about getting money to buy what is already there in the market\n35:48: to try and change the narrative\n35:51: or the situation, not just for myself,\n35:54: but for others as well. Yes. And my\n36:00: idea, or rather how I went to go about\n36:04: this is I went back to school\n36:08: and now with a couple of other friends,\n36:11: we tried to bring a portable biodigester\n36:16: so that people are able to make use of\n36:20: organic waste which is around them in the remote villages.\n36:24: So this will mean animal waste, this would\n36:28: mean the food waste. And then I was like, hey,\n36:31: Wait a minute. This is still limited because we are only serving\n36:36: those who are in the, in the remote areas, who are in\n36:40: the villages, and not necessarily those who are within\n36:45: the, the informal urban areas, which is where\n36:49: a number of people right now are, because at the\n36:52: outside, at the outside areas of\n36:56: the urban areas. And they are unique because\n36:59: yes, they, they are looking for access to opportunities, but are still.\n37:04: Are still limited in terms of their social\n37:08: and economic, I'd say, abilities and demographics.\n37:12: And that is now what is leading me to try and think\n37:16: of other ways that we are able to ensure that clean\n37:21: and affordable cooking solutions become affordable\n37:25: generally to those who are at the base of\n37:29: the pyramid. Yeah. Okay. Beautiful. Hillary.\n37:33: My, my favorite part started when you said,\n37:36: hey, wait a minute, because I could see that you cared.\n37:40: Okay. And this is, this is a message for everybody.\n37:44: I want to figure out when you go into these breakout rooms,\n37:47: like, why you care. And hopefully\n37:52: this isn't a storytelling workshop, but when you tell\n37:55: the story, if you can tell people's names. For instance, when I shared\n37:58: my story about Saleh and he grew up in a refugee camp in Syria\n38:02: and I met him in Lebanon and we moved into this house together,\n38:06: I kind of went over the story a little bit quickly because I didn't want\n38:08: to linger too much on it. But, you know, help people see\n38:12: what you see so that they can care. When you\n38:15: talk about the challenge with the cooking\n38:19: and these, the issues, I couldn't\n38:23: feel it personally because, first of all, I haven't\n38:26: experienced it, so maybe it's a little bit easier for others\n38:30: that might be able to imagine the problem. But paint a picture,\n38:34: give us names, show. Show what happens to people in this\n38:39: and then, and then especially, like, why it matters to\n38:42: you. So this is what I'm hoping for everyone to do when they're in the\n38:45: breakouts. So this is like a storytelling time. I'm going to pick\n38:49: on some people to, to share the.\n38:53: Their partner's story, not their story. So you need to be listening\n38:57: to your partner because I'm going to ask somebody to share what their partner\n39:00: said. And my, my, my hope is that you'll be able to\n39:04: tell us, like, something that they don't know about themselves. Like,\n39:08: wow, my part, the person who shared, he's a\n39:11: really, like, sweethearted person and he actually really loves whatever\n39:15: X, Y or Z, because I saw it in his story.\n39:18: So please go talk about the challenge that\n39:21: you guys are looking at, the people that you want\n39:25: to design for and help tell a story\n39:28: that shows another Person why it matters to you. So I'm\n39:32: going to open up some breakout rooms.\n39:36: Nihal and Joyce, do you guys want to hop into our room too?\n39:39: You guys can participate or you guys want to. We can stop\n39:43: by and see how they're doing. Okay. So how big do you want the groups\n39:46: to be below? I'd like it too pairs.\n39:50: Oh, just two. Okay. I'd suggest three because sometimes\n39:54: people drop off because of that connection. Okay.\n39:57: And would that. Would that work? No worries.\n40:00: I'm gonna. It's gonna be. Or we can do two in\n40:04: case somebody drops out. Then come back to the main room and I'll read\n40:08: us reassign you. Yeah, no worries. I. I set it up to two\n40:11: to three. It'll be mostly three. Maybe one, one group of two,\n40:15: and hopefully everyone. Have you set it up already? I'm about to hit go,\n40:18: but. Oh, okay, cool. Let's do it. Okay. Yallah. And yeah,\n40:23: so try to take around. What time\n40:26: is it? Yeah, take. Take three minutes\n40:30: each and we'll come back in around six to seven minutes.\n40:33: Okay. I know it's not very, very long to tell\n40:37: a good and deep story, but try to remember to get to\n40:41: names, feelings, why things matter for you and share your\n40:45: problem and I will see you guys soon.\n40:50: Okay. That won't work. Recording stopped.\n40:58: Is it open up? People moving?\n41:03: Yeah, yeah, people are just starting to go.\n41:06: Okay, great. So you guys. Okay, I'll get a timer up.\n41:21: We have some active people and then some\n41:25: maybe on their phones or something, but so\n41:28: far so good.\n41:44: Thank you, Fiona. Actually, I didn't read that yet.\n41:47: This idea of the only permanent thing in the world is change.\n41:51: That's a good one.\n42:00: You wanna. You guys want to hop into some rooms? I'm gonna see and just\n42:03: make sure people are doing all right. Yeah, I'm stalking\n42:07: now. Okay. From the progress\n42:11: chart, it's stalking time. Yes.\n42:14: See you guys here in bed. See, Kimberly.\n42:19: Okay, here we go. I'll jump into this one.\n42:22: Right.\n42:26: They started off solution based,\n42:29: whereby I knew that my problem\n42:33: was the use of kerosene lamps in\n42:37: communities where they relied on it as light\n42:40: energy sources. So I was like, the best thing I can do is\n42:44: provide them with lamps. But then going into\n42:48: these communities and seeing the problems that they were facing,\n42:52: they were not interested in adopting solar lamps\n42:56: because they want to save the environment. They are stricken with\n42:59: poverty. They have things that they value more at\n43:03: the moment than saving the environment.\n43:07: So getting into the community and imaging myself\n43:11: in these people's experiences. Yes. The constant Use of\n43:15: kerosene does make them susceptible to\n43:19: fire hazards, some health hazards, and you know, eventually also\n43:23: indoor, indoor air pollution and outdoor.\n43:26: And I also realized that poverty was one of the biggest problems\n43:31: they were facing. So what I thought of\n43:34: was creating an entrepreneurial loop. What are their strengths?\n43:39: So I realized that women are women and children who\n43:43: are currently in school are the people who actually really need\n43:46: light, especially at night. And I\n43:50: was like, let me bring them into the energy space. It's usually very male\n43:54: dominated. So how can I teach women to be local artisans\n43:58: to make these lamps and be the ambassadors of\n44:02: helping people within the community to transition to cleaner\n44:07: and affordable energy sources?\n44:10: So that's now what my project is focused on,\n44:14: bringing women into the energy space, teaching them how to make these solar\n44:18: lamps and then I'm selling it.\n44:21: But then the model that I want to sell is through like lamps with stories,\n44:25: attaching stories behind every lamps. So my target\n44:28: base when it comes to selling is the upper middle class and the rich.\n44:32: And then for every lump that is sold, one is donated\n44:36: to underserved areas. That way we're creating\n44:40: that sort of connection and inter, like an entrepreneurial\n44:44: loop where one community strength fits into another one that's\n44:48: able to afford and get on, that makes. And then that cycle continues like\n44:52: that and like that. Like that. Yeah, yeah,\n44:55: that's, that's really, that's really beautiful.\n44:58: Sorry, I'm hopping between each room.\n45:03: Yeah, no, I just want to know, Sorry, I didn't catch\n45:07: it. Where exactly your location to do\n45:11: that? Sorry. Oh, so currently it's\n45:15: in Kenya, Nairobi. But I'm going to be focusing on the outskirt\n45:18: areas where the it's usually off grid areas.\n45:22: They do not have access to electricity at all and they are heavily dependent\n45:26: on the use of kerosene lamps.\n45:29: So these lamps are also going to be made using recycled materials.\n45:33: So I want to also employ the circular economy principles\n45:38: in this. Oh yeah, yeah. Thank you.\n45:42: All in Kenya. Okay. So it's really great.\n45:45: It's beautiful. You love.\n45:48: It's very beautiful. And so one of the questions that popped\n45:51: up for me sort of because I'm a little bit curious about,\n45:57: you know, I saw your process of going and being like, okay, I want to\n46:00: bring this lamp will like solve all of these issues\n46:04: from fire hazards and indoor air pollution. But first of all, people have\n46:08: bigger and more pressing needs because of poverty.\n46:12: And you went to this idea of entrepreneurship\n46:16: and entrepreneurship support. And the\n46:20: question is, could it be something\n46:25: else? Like why focus only on the\n46:29: lamps if the real problem that you\n46:32: moved into solving is into jobs.\n46:37: Are there more scalable, easier, more abundant,\n46:41: more relevant jobs that you\n46:45: would rather be supporting? I, I don't mean to be pushing.\n46:48: Maybe I shouldn't even do this right here because it's supposed to be a storytelling\n46:51: session rather than the, the pivot session.\n46:54: But the idea is to be a little bit less held on to our initial\n46:58: idea and to see what the other ones could possibly be. Not that I don't\n47:01: like it. I think it's actually pretty cool. The strategy, the storytelling,\n47:04: the connection between places, the market,\n47:07: innovation as well. And. Yeah.\n47:10: So congrats. I'm gonna let Niram share\n47:14: a little bit about what she's doing and the problem of flooding\n47:18: in her house. And I'll see you\n47:22: guys back in the main room in a bit. Okay,\n47:25: thank you. Thank you.\n47:33: Feeding the hungaries and come back\n47:36: home with food. And being that it wasn't too much,\n47:39: she'll just give the kids food and the husband and she'll decide not to eat\n47:43: or probably take a very small portion. And most of the time,\n47:46: you know, it will be aligned like health issues, she'll get sick\n47:50: and stuff like that. It was very challenging for me to\n47:54: watch. And so I have always grown in a passion of ensuring that every\n47:58: household has food because I don't, I don't believe that fair for someone to go\n48:01: hungry. Yeah, it's supposed to be a right for everybody. And so\n48:05: during my work, my work experiences,\n48:10: I have worked with marginalized communities that are facing exactly the same situation because\n48:16: the mother will sacrifice and she goes to an extent of even marrying\n48:20: off their kids because she cannot provide for that kid. So she was\n48:23: to see how can I help these families by helping them put food to their\n48:27: table. And so I chose a community in the\n48:30: northern parts of Kenya.\n48:35: Then he will have\n48:39: got in. Yes,\n48:43: he will have. The prices of his produce will be four\n48:46: times less than he will have getting the seas.\n48:50: So that's why he choose to go wake up\n48:54: every morning, every day at 2am and return home\n48:58: and barely asleep. And I just saw his hard work\n49:02: every day. And I just, and I just saw the\n49:05: situation that for farmers and producers it's so hard sometimes\n49:10: to get good profits and clean\n49:15: energy resources in the Assad regions of Kenya. And to\n49:19: address that, I was trying to come up with like\n49:23: a community owned solar farms,\n49:26: solar plants, that is. And for\n49:29: the prototyping, I was maybe trying to think, should I,\n49:33: am I even in a position to come up with a simple, a Simpler\n49:37: version of a solar farm that requires some financial investment.\n49:42: So to address that, since I'm trying to\n49:46: cut on the cost because the initial acquisition cost is the major problem\n49:50: the community. I'm intending to serve a person.\n49:53: My venture course just gave me a hint\n49:56: that maybe I can try to come up with something like a financial model\n50:01: to finance the acquisition of the product.\n50:04: And then from the model I can share it with respective a\n50:08: few of the community members based on the way I'll be sampling\n50:11: them. I share with them and then I get their feedback\n50:16: based on my proposed financial model.\n50:20: Yes, I think it's a good idea because I also experience\n50:25: the same thing. I'm also at\n50:28: the prototyping so\n50:33: I'm trying to solve.\n50:37: So so far what I've noticed\n50:41: to do my prototype. Yeah, I can do it.\n50:47: I already have a structure in mind.\n50:51: I did all the calculations because.\n51:11: All right,\n51:24: great. Did you get to see anybody?\n51:27: Joyce or Nihal? You pop into any of the rooms?\n51:33: No, no, I was just managing. A few people dropped out\n51:36: so I had to reassign them. Sneaky coffee.\n51:40: Snack break. Oh yeah, people want\n51:44: a snack break.\n51:47: Okay, so welcome back everybody.\n51:51: I will again go back to sharing actually.\n51:55: Yeah, let's. Let's see people's faces first. Let's just\n51:58: wait for everyone to come back.\n52:04: Hello. Hello. Welcome back. It's great to\n52:08: see videos on. That means that you guys had your videos on when you were\n52:10: in the breakouts. I went into some of the breakouts\n52:14: and I heard some impassioned people telling\n52:18: some incredible stories. I'm really honored actually just to\n52:22: be a part of this amazing initiative that's gathered together\n52:26: such beautiful people.\n52:29: I heard. I don't even remember recording in progress. Welcome back\n52:33: everybody. I hope you guys heard some beautiful stories.\n52:37: I just popped into some of the rooms and I heard some incredible things.\n52:40: One moment that, you know, stood out to me was\n52:45: somebody was saying it was really challenging for me to\n52:48: see. And then. And the way that\n52:52: it was said, you knew that it was felt and\n52:56: that they were talking about food and how food is a right for\n52:59: everybody and they were impassioned. And the reason why\n53:03: I'm kind of emphasizing this, the storytelling and\n53:06: this feeling part is because solving\n53:11: a real problem is really hard and it takes a long\n53:14: time and to get to\n53:18: a. You know,\n53:21: I think it's a Friedrich Nietzsche quote. He goes,\n53:24: he who has a strong enough why\n53:29: can overcome any. How have you guys heard this quote?\n53:34: And this is it, this feeling. Who here got into\n53:37: a feeling mode, put up like some reaction. Do we have\n53:42: reactions? Got to a feeling sharing your stories.\n53:45: Anybody? Okay, great. Bill Bhavan.\n53:49: Ricardo, definitely the lady who was talking when I was in her\n53:53: room. Jessica. Priya.\n53:56: Priya. Oh, my God.\n53:59: Priyaranjan.\n54:01: Priyaranjan. Okay, I'm terribly sorry. Let me know how\n54:04: to pronounce it better. Or you can call me Bolbol. You should put your little\n54:08: nickname at the end of your name if you have one. Okay,\n54:11: great. So for the people listening to the stories,\n54:15: who thinks they can share what\n54:19: makes their partner come alive, this is it.\n54:23: This is the reason why we're doing this, is to get these stories,\n54:27: because I really believe this quote from\n54:31: Howard that what the world really\n54:35: needs are people that come alive. Not necessarily this\n54:39: idea of how to make a better world, because when you're.\n54:42: When you come alive, you are a part of that better world. So who\n54:46: wants to share a story and maybe highlight where their\n54:50: partner came alive? Feel free, raise your hand. You can share your partner's story.\n54:57: All right, well, Ricardo went a couple of times, so I'm going to look for\n55:00: a couple more hands. Charity, would you like to share? Not that I\n55:04: don't want to hear from Ricardo. We'll hear from you again. I keep raising\n55:07: your hand. Charity, please feel free.\n55:11: Okay, thank you. So I'm going to share the\n55:16: moment where my partner kids\n55:21: that one. He gave a case scenario of\n55:25: her mother, who is a farmer and. And works\n55:29: in the farm from. From morning to.\n55:32: To evening. And since that is around the problem\n55:36: he's trying to solve, you know, working with farmers and.\n55:39: And farmers. Most of their. Most of the farmers in their community are\n55:43: women. So the fact that he gave an\n55:47: example of the mother and how she was diagnosed with some\n55:51: issue that. That is when he came up with a. With an idea\n55:55: of I can solve this problem. I really felt that. Yeah.\n55:59: So the. The story was connected to a personal\n56:03: family connection. And I think this is one of the.\n56:07: The best places to work on designing\n56:11: a challenge around is the thing that you know the best, the thing that's,\n56:14: like, really that close to you that it matters to you. It's your\n56:18: family even, that is confronted by the problem.\n56:21: So beautiful. And I can't hear. Wait to hear\n56:25: more about the challenge. Chetan, Inshallah Priyaranjan.\n56:31: Feel free to go and share your partner's story. Oh, actually,\n56:35: actually, real quick, Chetan, did she get it right?\n56:42: Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. I could.\n56:46: Or projects. I could feel relatable. So.\n56:50: Yeah. Okay. Wonderful, wonderful. We're gonna do that\n56:53: because this is, this is the, the process of kind of validating\n56:58: your listening. So Priya Ranjan, feel free to go ahead and\n57:02: share what your. Your partner's story and what made them come alive.\n57:06: Yeah, like I just want to apologize that I\n57:10: forgot my partner name. So like\n57:13: I was so much into his story. So basically he told me\n57:17: how he went to his friend house and the way he saw that his friends\n57:21: is a farmer. He is, he is.\n57:24: He used to grow pineapples and he\n57:28: have to wake up like around. He used to wake up at around 2am in\n57:31: the morning and he have to sell his product.\n57:35: And like after doing so much hard work, there were multiple\n57:38: middlemans. Because of that he was not able to get the fair price.\n57:42: So he has been working on thinking of like\n57:46: how he can eliminate those middlemen\n57:49: and how he can get his, like get\n57:53: the farmers to get the right price of their product and\n57:57: how they can connect them with the companies and organization which can\n58:00: also provide them tools and the machineries. So what I understood\n58:04: from his. So that was something was\n58:08: like very connected, something with his personal experience\n58:12: because he has stayed with his friend and he has seen the\n58:17: journey. So he really understands the core problem\n58:20: and the problem they are facing throughout the years from growing the\n58:24: product to selling in the market and still not getting the fair price.\n58:28: So all right, what would you say, your unnamed\n58:32: partner, what is a value that they hold that\n58:36: made them care?\n58:39: So I think the value they hold,\n58:43: the struggle which they have seen like after doing\n58:47: like, you know, from scratch. Because farmers are the root\n58:52: which is like you know, producing the product and\n58:56: in the end of the day if they are not earning enough.\n58:59: So it will, there will be a time when, you know,\n59:02: farmers would be looking for other opportunities and that\n59:06: is going to create a struggle for whole, whole world.\n59:10: I say because if we will not produce so\n59:14: we cannot sell, we cannot get like everything. The whole system,\n59:17: the chain starts from farmers and the whole system\n59:21: will get destroyed. So in the end of the day someone get\n59:24: paid or not. The farmer who is growing, putting months\n59:28: in and you know, developing the product,\n59:31: struggling to get us the right product.\n59:35: If he's not getting paid, then it is going to create a problem.\n59:39: So I think that was the main value, core value. All right,\n59:42: unnamed partner, could you name yourself and tell us did\n59:47: he get the story right and do you think the\n59:50: value was right as well?\n59:55: Yes, sure. My name\n59:58: is Anges. So yes, he got the story just\n60:03: as I told it and it was really good to hear from\n60:06: him and also the value he told was\n60:11: very well. Right. Yeah. Did you\n60:15: learn something from the stuff that stood out to\n60:18: him? And did you learn from hearing how somebody else tells your story?\n60:23: What, what did you learn hearing that?\n60:30: Well, I,\n60:34: I learned to.\n60:42: I learned that I learned from hearing\n60:46: the way he told my story that what\n60:56: I learned, just so you see, is that he was\n61:00: so impassioned that he started going off talking about\n61:04: how farmers are the root of everything in the world. And like he's\n61:07: going to do your project for you now, like maybe you found a team member.\n61:11: So I think that's, that's one of the things that I noticed is your\n61:15: story was moving and moving enough to really light\n61:19: a fire for Priya Ranjan as well.\n61:23: Yeah, that's right. I, I did.\n61:26: So the way that he told the story with Bashan, it was\n61:29: very. Yeah. Motivating.\n61:33: Yeah. And we need each other like this, this way of seeing\n61:36: each other is really beautiful. So maybe we can get another story\n61:40: or two. Let's see if people are excited to share. Anybody want to share a\n61:45: story that they think was really powerful?\n61:53: Good one, Good one. Nyasha.\n62:01: Anybody want to share another story from. From one of their part?\n62:11: Otherwise, do you want to. Oh, go ahead, go ahead. Who is saying\n62:15: that? So I had two\n62:19: partners. I was with Bill and\n62:24: Gucci. Yeah, with Bill, he spoke\n62:28: about water contamination. Forgive the\n62:32: background noises. He spoke about contamination,\n62:36: something that's close to him as he isn't comfortable with\n62:40: seeing people drinking unsafe water. And he also\n62:44: realized that bottled water is\n62:47: quite expensive. So he came up with a safer drinking,\n62:51: safe drinking water with through solar powered water purifiers.\n62:56: And he also tested his prototype and the user experience\n63:00: yesterday and he says it was a big success.\n63:03: And then with Kuc, it was about SDGs.\n63:07: And her root is the educational\n63:12: teaching and finding games to get people to be hands\n63:16: on, on what to do. She started having\n63:20: this passion for it when she\n63:23: was a volunteer and she noticed that sustainable.\n63:28: She noticed a sustainable need for stock market,\n63:32: which wasn't taught in school. So with her it was a thing of\n63:36: she's getting to learn about something, but she also wants\n63:39: to teach more people about it because she realizes that people are not\n63:43: knowledgeable in that aspect, me and Bill included as well.\n63:47: We wish we learned a lot about stuff in\n63:51: school, high school, university, wherever, before we actually\n63:54: came to fellowship programs. That way it would be way easier\n63:57: to understand sustainability stuff because we actually learned about it.\n64:01: So that's where her story came\n64:05: from. She wanted to Understand the problem as well.\n64:08: I hope I said it well. Yeah. And we're gonna figure\n64:11: that out now, Bill.\n64:14: And who was the other partner?\n64:19: Hello.\n64:22: You can write it in the chat. Bill. Did she get it?\n64:26: Yes, she did. People in\n64:30: sub Saharan Africa really don't have access to safe drinking\n64:34: water. And especially people in the\n64:37: rural areas, they drink from these open water\n64:41: sources, which are always so contaminated and they usually\n64:46: have to walk such long distances to get safe drinking water.\n64:51: So we wanted to help alleviate\n64:54: the financial burden of having to use chemicals to\n64:57: disinfect their water and having to go through the hassle of boiling\n65:02: and purchasing bottled water by using solar,\n65:05: which is available everywhere, to give them safe drinking\n65:09: water. And what we saw was\n65:13: it may not seem like such a big problem for us who are living in\n65:16: the urban areas, because water is almost everywhere.\n65:20: But when you do go to the rural areas and you find out that\n65:23: people walk almost every 5 kilometers just to fetch\n65:27: a 20 liter, 5 liter jerry can of unsafe drinking\n65:31: water, that is when you know it's really a problem.\n65:35: Yeah. I'm curious as someone, it sounds like you're saying that you\n65:39: live in an urban area. I, I understand, you know,\n65:43: if I imagine somebody walking that distance and I,\n65:47: I think about the problem of people getting sick from,\n65:50: from contaminated water, I can, I can feel something. But I'm\n65:54: wondering, how did it touch you to begin with? There's a lot of\n65:57: problems in the world, you know. You know, and why\n66:01: this one in particular? What was motivating,\n66:05: what actually motivated me was I was also getting\n66:09: sick from drinking tap water.\n66:14: But I got a volunteer job where we are, where we\n66:17: worked with refugees. And that's why I got\n66:20: to meet some of these people. They really struggled,\n66:23: especially when they were in transit. So I\n66:27: think I put those two experiences together and I thought,\n66:30: like, why can't we give them a sustainable way to have safe\n66:34: drinking water?\n66:37: Yeah, beautiful. Okay. So I'm writing down some principles in the chat\n66:41: based on the, the stories that I'm hearing and based on\n66:44: the, the, the things that really have been motivating\n66:48: you. And does anybody, Is anybody else finding\n66:52: other principles? You can feel free to put them in the chat.\n66:55: Bhavan. Yeah,\n66:59: So I met the person Lozi from South Africa.\n67:03: So that person, she was, I was able to relate\n67:07: to her because she also come from that rural background\n67:11: and the marginalized community. And I also come\n67:15: from that marginalized community. And my project is more or\n67:18: less with small and marginal farmers. And she,\n67:22: interestingly, was, was solving the problem of\n67:26: the the employment, youth employment by\n67:30: promoting the tourism, ecotourism.\n67:33: I think the, the value that it was, it was the empathetic.\n67:37: You know, she was feeling the problem of the community and she was\n67:41: as I was feeling. I was when she was telling about her story because she\n67:44: was the person who spoke first. But I was imagining myself\n67:49: being in that position. What I have been in that.\n67:52: Yeah. You know, the,\n67:54: the. The role of being very\n67:59: empathetic. Right. So understand the community first and the\n68:02: experiences she had. I think when she was telling,\n68:06: I. I thought. I literally thought that she also gone through that problem\n68:09: of, you know, shifting from rural to urban and what are the problems that youth\n68:12: face in this globalized, in the competitive world. And she really\n68:16: want to do something, you know, creating the employment, self employment,\n68:19: local level. And I think she is more passionate\n68:23: about. And looking at her, I felt that she is actually doing something really\n68:27: amazing in the community. So I think she holds\n68:30: the value of this empathetic and she, she can literally feel what she's going\n68:33: with the community. And she, she said that\n68:37: she's working as freelancer, you know, she edits, she writes and\n68:40: stuff. I think that she's an amazing person. She wonderful\n68:44: thing and. Yeah, all right. Wonderful.\n68:47: Does. Did. Did he get it,\n68:52: your partner? 100%. Thank you,\n68:55: Bhavan. That, that was really great.\n69:00: Well, when I just want to correct the ecotourism,\n69:03: it's community based tourism.\n69:08: Yeah. So I, I really appreciate\n69:12: him telling the story because he summarized it perfectly.\n69:16: Like my story was so long I didn't think he was gonna be\n69:20: able to get it. So. Yeah.\n69:23: And with me I also related\n69:27: to what he said about coming from\n69:31: a rural background where you know, you need\n69:34: to be the one who takes action. He said something like\n69:38: using local action for a global cause.\n69:42: And that really stood up, stood out for me and I'm\n69:46: really gonna use that in from now on\n69:50: going forward. Beautiful. Using local action.\n69:57: Okay, wonderful. I wanted to share a little bit\n70:01: actually. I don't know if Nihal wants to share this story, but of\n70:04: Proto village and Kalyan, do you want to tell his story a little\n70:08: bit? Because I feel like, you know, starting with the.\n70:11: The farmer and the two years, we can take a lot of principles from that\n70:15: that might be interesting and inspiring.\n70:19: Sure. I think some of these guys are aware of that.\n70:23: There's a. Oh yeah, some of them have even been there.\n70:28: Kalyan's daughter is a fellow as well and a couple of other folks from\n70:31: Proto. But in a nutshell, for those of you\n70:34: who don't know. A friend of ours,\n70:37: Kalyan, was. He came from a very\n70:40: small, impoverished village, one of the driest places in all\n70:45: of India, where you get very little rainfall,\n70:49: agriculture is very hard to do.\n70:51: And he was, and he was told as he\n70:55: was growing up that there's nothing for you here. Your future lies\n70:58: in the city. So educate yourself and go there. And when he went to the\n71:01: city and got a job in a tech company, he felt so empty\n71:06: and he was so frustrated that he was forced to leave his village for better\n71:09: opportunities. Opportunities and that for,\n71:12: for millennia, for centuries, villages used to\n71:16: be like a space for resilience,\n71:19: a space for abundance. But it has changed now and he wanted\n71:24: to bring that back. So one day he left everything behind and\n71:28: traveled for two and a half years across the lengths and breadths of India\n71:32: to tribal communities, to villages all over,\n71:36: just and without any money, without anything,\n71:39: just relying on their generosity and just sitting there and learning from\n71:42: them. And he comes back and he builds his own village based on\n71:46: his learnings. And this is what it is. And we\n71:50: have a few fellows as well who are, who live here and who\n71:53: are working to build this or make this community stronger.\n71:58: Yeah, and one of the things, I think, you know, we heard the word truth\n72:01: pop up a couple of times. Do you guys remember that?\n72:05: Like, somebody mentioned the idea of truth. And it's\n72:08: one of the things that I'm really proud of Kelly on for is\n72:13: he will sit with something and stick to\n72:17: something until the true\n72:21: and right thing to do appears.\n72:25: And he will iterate and he will change and he will\n72:29: let things go and do things over and over until\n72:32: the right thing appears. And I think that this\n72:36: example for those in India, if you haven't been to Proto Village,\n72:41: it's, it's a great example of what happens.\n72:45: And one of the other, what happens when, when you\n72:48: really listen deeply. So the, the way I remember his story is\n72:52: that he found the poorest farmer and\n72:56: he lived with him for two whole years to\n73:00: see, you know, instead of coming up with the idea because, you know,\n73:03: he came from a technical background, I think he was working for Oracle\n73:06: or some large tech company. And the\n73:11: initial idea potentially could have been, oh, you know what, let's use\n73:14: solar panels and modern technology and let's just solve all\n73:17: of the problems and, you know, let's get some,\n73:21: some better results from this poor farmer's land.\n73:24: And poor farmer, you know, he has all these problems, but he lived with him,\n73:27: he actually lived on the land with this farmer for two whole\n73:31: years and worked together in\n73:35: a collaborative approach to, I think,\n73:38: take his produce. He was the poorest farmer in the village\n73:42: and became the, the most abundant farmer in\n73:45: the village because they married the\n73:50: knowledge and the wisdom and the, the heritage that the farmer had\n73:53: with the, the ideas and the experience and the ability\n73:57: to use Google that Kelly on had, I'm sure,\n74:00: more than just that, but that, that led him\n74:04: to then see. So the idea is, you know,\n74:07: instead of saying, I want to set up this Proto village where, you know,\n74:11: villagers don't have to leave their homes, where they can take pride and, and solve\n74:14: the problem that he was feeling deeply, he spent,\n74:17: spent years validating his\n74:21: idea that there's this, you know,\n74:24: marriage between history and heritage\n74:28: and appropriate technology that can\n74:32: be truly beneficial in a way that it's accepted deeply\n74:36: within a community. So I really love Kelly on and I\n74:39: love learning from him all the time. And they're still at it\n74:43: and it's now onto the Next generation. I was calling him the other week and\n74:47: one of the things that he was mentioning to me was how\n74:51: they always try to have their learning for the young people in Proto\n74:54: Village be connected to something needed\n74:58: or valued. And so\n75:02: he was telling me how young people were learning some of the principles\n75:06: of thermodynamics. And then they\n75:10: started developing these thermally insulated bottles\n75:14: with just very, very basic and simple materials from like Coke cans\n75:18: or something because they realized that some of the people that\n75:21: were leaving had\n75:25: a problem like maintaining the heat inside of their food and their beverages\n75:29: when they would go out into the fields. And so the young people are,\n75:33: it's so cool to see, like, you do something in a\n75:36: good and beautiful way and it kind of inspires others.\n75:40: And it's like the next generation of people are kind of taking\n75:43: this, this approach forward. So I\n75:47: really love Proto Village. I really believe that they're doing some,\n75:50: some wonderful work. And I'm curious if\n75:54: anybody here has had a,\n75:58: a story like that where they had to do something\n76:01: different. I heard somebody in the chat talking about a pivot similar\n76:05: to how, you know, Kalyan was living in his corporate life and\n76:09: he pivoted and he like took his feelings seriously\n76:13: and did this deep exploration. Who here has a story about a\n76:17: pivot or a change from something to potentially\n76:20: what you're doing now?\n76:30: And if there's no pivot, let's hope that there is going to be\n76:33: one in the next few months. We'll see. Or even after the days. Oh,\n76:36: it's fadland. Alexander.\n76:40: I just remembered, after my bachelor in\n76:44: architecture, I worked in a big firm on some\n76:48: giant projects in China and Saudi Arabia.\n76:52: And it was that moment where I asked myself, like,\n76:55: is this really what I want to do as an architect?\n76:58: Like, make architecture just as a symbol of power\n77:02: and wealth without any meaning? Like, at the time, we were\n77:06: designing a racetrack in the middle of the desert.\n77:10: So it was mainly like a playground for rich people.\n77:15: And then at the same time,\n77:18: Francisque, an architect that I really enjoy from\n77:22: West Africa, won the Pritzker Award. And then his work,\n77:26: which is so linked to his culture and in\n77:30: his simplicity, also really innovative, really touched me.\n77:33: And I was like, that's like, so much more meaningful. I mean,\n77:37: maybe it's like a simple and small structure, but I felt like\n77:40: it touched me so much more than whatever shiny,\n77:44: giant building. And for me, this was like a pivotal\n77:48: moment where I was like, no, what I'm doing right now is not the right\n77:51: way. I. I have to change something.\n77:54: Yeah, beautiful.\n77:57: Okay, so we're going to do everyone type at the\n78:00: same time thing. I'm realizing that your story\n78:05: has another really important element of\n78:08: inspiration from somebody else that shows us that we can do things differently.\n78:12: So, for instance, Kalayan was a big inspiration\n78:16: for me. And actually the reason why I moved to Lebanon is because of this\n78:19: guy, this guy named Father Greg Boyle. I was trying\n78:23: to figure out, like, why should I do anything? You know, like, what's.\n78:26: Why am I solving problems? There's a million problems. How do I pick a\n78:30: problem to solve if. If it's just, you know, there's water, there's energy,\n78:34: there's clean air, there's all the SDGs. How can I actually\n78:39: know what the right thing to do is? And I was kind of questioning my\n78:42: intentions. In the Muslim tradition, it says everything you\n78:45: do is by their intentions and only by their intentions.\n78:49: So I wanted to make sure I had good intentions,\n78:52: but I didn't know how to do that. Father Greg Boyle, once upon\n78:56: a time, somebody asked him, yo, Yo, Greg. Yo, Mr.\n78:59: Boyle. What he does is he has something called Homeboy\n79:03: and Homegirl Industries, where he works with the,\n79:07: you know, recently incarcerated, they're now freed. They're not in prison anymore.\n79:11: But they might have a lot of tattoos. They might have a whole\n79:14: life history. They might have the gangs that they used to be a part of\n79:18: that, that they're still connected\n79:22: to. And actually, some of his. The people that he was\n79:25: working with were killed by\n79:28: the gangs that they had left. And he tried to find Job\n79:32: opportunities for them. He helped them with tattoo removals. He was just always there for\n79:35: them. And, you know, he's a white guy, and he didn't have\n79:38: to be in LA working with this population. He could have been anywhere else,\n79:43: much, you know, less challenged. He didn't have to go through the grief of\n79:47: the murders that some of the people that he was working with,\n79:51: you know, lived. And when they asked him why\n79:54: he did it, he didn't say, because it's\n79:58: the right thing. He's a Christian, he's a priest. It's the right thing to do.\n80:02: God told me to do this. He didn't say any of\n80:06: these things. He said something that changed my life. And what he\n80:10: said was, because they are my friends,\n80:13: he called them his homies. But he said, because they're my homies,\n80:17: they're my friends. I realized that when\n80:21: you are putting yourself into a relationship with\n80:24: people based on, like, friendship and love, good action happens.\n80:28: So Kalayan lives in this village. These are his people,\n80:32: These are his now family. It's his extended family.\n80:36: It's not that Kalyan is working for\n80:40: another, and he has to think about, like, what's a good intention or what's the\n80:43: right thing to do, or what would the UN fund\n80:47: in terms of a project. If it's related to, like, women and green and,\n80:51: you know, under the water, under the land or, you know, whatever. It's. It's not\n80:55: so rational, although it's good. It's beautiful to work on projects that support\n80:59: women and employment and all of these things. But if the.\n81:02: If it's more of the story, and now we're moving a little bit\n81:06: deeper, I'm trying to move away from just the narrative and, like, what's good to\n81:09: do to talk about this relationship building.\n81:13: And in the notes, you can see we talked about a\n81:16: couple of principles, right? Getting close, working with\n81:20: a problem that you faced. So. So I forget who I was talking to.\n81:24: Was it Hillary? I'm not sure about. About water.\n81:27: And initially we heard the story of,\n81:30: like, yeah, people in villages and rural, rural areas, they walk so far.\n81:34: It's really painful. It's really bad. And then I heard, like, oh, yeah, I got\n81:37: sick. And then I saw them and I realized that they were like me and\n81:40: we could solve the same problem. And then it became something that's way closer\n81:44: to home. And so I'm actually curious\n81:48: if we don't have to go through all the stories right now. But I just\n81:51: want. I believe that probably everyone\n81:55: here has somebody that has supported them,\n81:58: inspired them, encouraged them. And I'd love\n82:02: just to see that name and just for us to take a moment of,\n82:05: like, gratitude for the people that brought us\n82:09: this. This kind of inspiration or this showing\n82:13: us a different way of doing things that we're now trying to follow in\n82:18: their footsteps. So for me, it would be Father Greg Boyle.\n82:22: You can, you know, I want to see some names\n82:26: in the chat. And we have already moms,\n82:30: of course. It's beautiful. My mom as well. My mom is a\n82:34: very curious person, a lovely woman who loves to learn and\n82:39: yeah, thank you for reminding me of her. Francis,\n82:42: Cara, Emilio Clark, Any other goats,\n82:46: Greatest of all time. People that have inspired,\n82:50: especially around this, like, what you're doing. Right.\n82:54: Maybe somebody that even encouraged you. Or it could\n82:58: be the, you know, the people that you're building relationship with.\n83:01: You know, for me, Saleh is a big source of my inspiration.\n83:04: When I was living in Lebanon and we started this. This house together.\n83:08: Alana, Gerald. Thank you,\n83:12: Charlotte. Thank you, Tony Robbins. Absolutely.\n83:15: It could be people that you've read, people that you've seen online.\n83:18: I've never met Father Greg Boyle in person, but I heard a podcast\n83:22: by him, and literally after that podcast, I bought a plane ticket and moved to\n83:26: Lebanon because I realized that I couldn't do my work hypothetically\n83:29: anymore. I had to be grounded in person. And I was living in\n83:33: San Francisco and I was traveling a lot, and I really\n83:37: changed my life after this one podcast. Abaja Johnson\n83:41: Sisters. Okay, what I'm gonna do is if\n83:45: someone wants to gush and tell us\n83:49: why this person is such an important and transformative person in their life,\n83:53: I'd love to hear one story and then take a. Take a bathroom or tea\n83:57: break. So who here really just wants\n84:01: to show some gratitude and tell a story about how this person\n84:05: was kind of a transformative figure and changed\n84:09: their life or led them to doing what they're doing today.\n84:13: We heard a lot from Ricardo. We could hear from Ricardo.\n84:16: Not a problem to hear from Ricardo. But no, no, don't lower your hand.\n84:19: I just want to see if there's anybody else. Okay. I don't think we've heard\n84:21: from Priya yet. Okay, Priya. And we. We can do both. We could do\n84:25: Priya, Ricardo, and then coffee break.\n84:28: Let's follow Priya.\n84:34: Should I start? Yes, please.\n84:37: So I talk about a person.\n84:41: So basically I met him in the regional\n84:44: hub, and so it's related to this\n84:48: program. And I was working on completely different project which,\n84:53: like, in the end of the Day that project was not having\n84:57: that credibility because we were talking about, you know,\n85:01: tracking the sustainable carbon footprint related to food industry.\n85:04: And then after having long, long conversation with him\n85:08: after like for a week, almost like because\n85:12: we are there for three, four days. And then every day we used to sit\n85:15: with that person and he used to tell us about what going in the\n85:18: market, how basically market react, what is the steps\n85:22: or the right way to approach a problem. And after that I figured\n85:26: out two things that artificial intelligence and sustainable energy\n85:30: is going to be something which is going to be the future\n85:34: sooner or later. And the way he told us about, you know,\n85:38: what is the major issues in India related\n85:42: to skill development, why industries are not that successful,\n85:46: why we are not able to deliver quality product. And he\n85:50: talked about, you know, how people are losing\n85:54: interest while doing things and you know, it is more\n85:59: kind of stress them out. So you know,\n86:02: he talked about inner child of\n86:06: people, like how they should be focused.\n86:10: Like you know, when we are kids we enjoy doing things,\n86:14: we. And we do not think about the failures.\n86:17: So somehow we have lost that inner child. So he\n86:21: like stressed about that, that we should not lose our inner child.\n86:25: We should enjoy what we are doing and we should be grateful. And it\n86:29: whole journey is kind of a process which.\n86:32: Hang on. And that person name is Nihal.\n86:36: He's present.\n86:39: Excuse me, sorry. Nihal was one of mine too.\n86:43: So we had some. So yeah, that person\n86:46: name is Nihal and he used to sit with us and he used\n86:50: to educate us, guide us and talk about the projects\n86:53: which he have done and how what is the right way to approach the\n86:57: problem. So this was very inspiring. And because\n87:01: of that I was able to understand the core\n87:04: problem and structured my whole project into a very different way.\n87:08: Now I'm working in sustainable energy. Like basically I'm\n87:12: working on recycling lithium batteries and\n87:15: how we can extract the rare minerals and how we can remanufacture\n87:20: using those minerals,\n87:23: new batteries. And apart from that I'm working how we can use\n87:26: artificial intelligence,\n87:29: streamline our supply chain and the operations\n87:33: and how we can, with the help of virtual reality, how we\n87:37: can retrain workers through multiple hours\n87:41: and how we can provide them right and specialized training.\n87:45: So beautiful. And I really like this, you know,\n87:49: the way that you told the story and you buried the lead until the end.\n87:53: It's. These are, these are great things. I think, you know, one of\n87:56: the subtle elements where we're connecting here,\n88:01: you know, is authentic leadership. We're not, we didn't use that\n88:04: word at all. But this idea of being able to\n88:07: really understand your values, the stories\n88:11: that inform you, the people that inspire you, the reason\n88:15: why you're doing your work, this is going to be really important for you for\n88:19: all of your projects as you're looking for partners, funders,\n88:22: teammates, all of these things. So hopefully this\n88:26: has been valuable and interesting. I'd love to\n88:30: take a coffee break if people want to stay. I'm open\n88:34: to hearing some more stories of\n88:38: gratitude. Gratitude is\n88:42: one of the world's best vitamins, if you're interested.\n88:46: Vitamin D, vitamin G. You know, you gotta\n88:50: have some vitamin G in your life. So I'm willing to stick around,\n88:55: get some water. But let's take.\n88:58: How long do you guys want? Five, ten minutes.\n89:03: Let's take a. Let's take seven.\n89:06: Nice in the middle. It's a compromise. We'll take about seven\n89:10: to 10 minutes. Get some tea, get a break.\n89:14: And you know what? Maybe just, like, really reflect on\n89:18: what you've just heard. The stories, the inspiration.\n89:22: Think about the stories that you heard and, like, what parts resonated\n89:26: for you. This is. This is really important.\n89:30: I think, you know, touching this really deep element\n89:34: of authentic leadership and really\n89:37: understanding a problem by caring and connecting deeply to the\n89:41: people you're trying to solve a problem for is going to be foundational. I'm focusing\n89:45: on it so much in the design process. It's the whole first\n89:48: day. Because after that, that stuff is\n89:52: practical. It's easier. It's more step by step. So take\n89:56: some time, reflect on it. Feel free to do some journaling, and I'll see you\n89:59: guys here in 10 minutes. Insha'Allah.\n90:09: Let's pause the recording. Recording stopped.\n90:14: Yeah.\n90:55: Oh, yeah. Good idea.\n91:03: The heart that you can\n91:08: let the music take\n91:14: you home Just\n91:19: another love song\n91:28: Six minutes left to\n91:54: make it feel all right you\n92:45: can feel still\n93:37: love Just\n93:45: another love Nam\n94:53: in your heart Let the music take you home\n94:59: Just another love music\n95:44: take you home Just another\n96:35: Just another.\n97:03: How was the pee break?\n97:07: Welcome back. All right,\n97:23: people feeling hydrated?\n97:30: People feeling ready\n97:34: to continue? Need some stretching?\n97:38: Actually, you know what? Like, one thing that people don't do\n97:41: enough on zoom calls is stretch. Can we play a little bit of any other\n97:45: song and what\n97:49: you guys did for your break? But I just sat. I just\n97:53: sat the whole time. And I think it would be nice\n97:57: to move and actually to connect it\n98:00: a little bit with some of the ideas of the\n98:05: design principles is we're\n98:08: going to get to a point where we want to not use words to\n98:12: share our projects. We want to be able to point at something\n98:16: and have people understand it. So right now just feel how\n98:20: you feel and then move. So let's play some songs, let some\n98:24: people return and let's just get some emotional\n98:28: visualization.\n98:45: Zubi, Zoo,\n98:50: zoo.\n99:21: All right.\n99:25: I feel like only the facilitators are dancing. Hopefully other people have had\n99:29: their breaks. Okay, I want to see\n99:32: some. Ricardo pulled some great moves. Yeah,\n99:36: Ricardo, definitely. Who else was there? I saw a little bit of bopping with Lucy.\n99:39: There was a little bit of this. Like let's move the hat around. Yeah,\n99:43: this hat needs to move. I don't need to move, just the hat.\n99:47: Maureen, sweet,\n99:49: wonderful. We're getting some people still coming back.\n99:54: Okay. You know, before I move on, I just want to gut check people.\n99:58: Feelings, how are things going? Recording in progress. Yeah.\n100:02: So as we are back from our short break, hopefully.\n100:06: Yeah, I kind of want to get a gut check. How are people feeling?\n100:10: How are things going? Did anybody have any insights,\n100:14: lessons learned, questions?\n100:20: Yeah, so feelings, insights, questions.\n100:29: There's a big smile. Okay, go ahead Priya. And then Hillary.\n100:36: So I'm feeling that it is really important to\n100:40: connect your story with emotions when you tell them and\n100:44: with your past experience because like\n100:48: you know how it all started, where, where do you see\n100:52: yourself? Like basically what's working, what's not working and how we can do it\n100:55: better. Like simplifying and three words. So it\n100:59: is really important to make someone understand. It should be an investor\n101:03: and the language should be so simple that a\n101:07: person, like even a five year old person like child should\n101:11: understand your story. Like you know what exactly you want to do.\n101:15: So the language is very important the way you communicate and\n101:19: whenever you are telling your story, you should be passionate about it and you\n101:23: should exactly feel so you should. So in your\n101:26: head it's, it's not that like I don't\n101:30: know I want to do it or not, but I'm just doing it. So you\n101:34: should be passionate about whatever you're doing. You should be enjoying that thing apart\n101:38: you should not think about money or like any fame. Like you should\n101:42: be connected to you then only it's going to create a\n101:46: greater impact from a small or to a larger level\n101:50: as they said. Very good line.\n101:54: Local to vocal. Like you know, from getting local to\n101:59: getting on the global level. So that should be what\n102:03: a leader should be like, like you know, do working\n102:06: on a ground level, creating impact on the global level.\n102:10: So yeah, I feel like it sort of feel like\n102:14: your share kind of touched almost all of the lessons learned.\n102:18: It's like, okay, you got to stay connected. You got to be local. You got\n102:21: to connect your emotions. You got. Anyway, it's really wonderful.\n102:25: It's almost a great summary of a lot of the takeaways that. That I.\n102:28: I also saw. Anybody see anything else or.\n102:31: Or want to share something or have a question?\n102:37: Maureen? Yeah.\n102:43: I don't know how you noticed me. I was not raising my hand. I was\n102:45: about to raise my hand when you mentioned my name. Spider sense. Wait,\n102:48: who's the. Who's Parker?\n102:51: I'm the one with spider sense. Okay, go for it.\n102:55: So mine\n102:59: is a bit of a question. So the\n103:03: problem that I'm trying to solve is targeting the marginalized\n103:06: community, and it's primarily on addressing hunger and food security in the region.\n103:10: Right. So the idea is to work with women to do\n103:14: farming in this community, and then we do value addition to come up with\n103:18: a product that can be sold in markets and supermarkets.\n103:21: So my question, which is tying me down, is to understand what should be my\n103:25: primary focus. I'm having a very hard time there. Should my\n103:28: primary focus be on empowering these women to do the farming,\n103:32: or should it be the value added product that we are bringing to the\n103:35: market? And that is what I will probably\n103:38: need some help with because I'm having a hard time doing my prototype because I\n103:42: don't know how to answer that question. Yeah, but they're all connected,\n103:45: though. Yeah. So this is. This is an amazing question.\n103:49: Later, when I'm your mentor, I'd love to think and talk with you about this.\n103:54: Well, you know what? Actually, one of the things that I wanted to bring into\n103:57: this room today is one of my principles that.\n104:01: Okay, let's answer this question, and then I'll answer your question.\n104:04: Who do you think the smartest person in this room is?\n104:09: It's not me. Just. By the way,\n104:16: I was gonna say you. No, absolutely not.\n104:19: There's Nihal. Are you gonna say me? Come on. Okay. Who's the smartest\n104:23: person in the room? And Joyce, of course. I'm sorry. Who do you\n104:26: think is the smartest person in anybody?\n104:31: Like, except for Nilam, because she knows the answer.\n104:37: That could be. It could be, like, technically, but there's.\n104:40: There's. There's a. A creative answer.\n104:46: I mean, I could also sacrifice myself and\n104:50: say that I think I'm smart. That's beautiful. I think self\n104:54: confidence and agency. Absolutely. The people that think they're smart\n104:57: wind up having more ideas. They allow themselves to\n105:01: say things and have ideas because they think they're smart. So definitely,\n105:05: by all means, it's very likely you're the smartest\n105:08: individual in the room. But. Exactly.\n105:10: Ricardo. Yeah. Jessica.\n105:13: Yeah. Nyasha. Everyone got it? Okay. We. Yes.\n105:16: Georgina. Okay, cool. Okay, awesome. Thank you.\n105:20: Wow. You guys. Okay, so obviously we are in a room full the smart people\n105:23: who figured out the smart answer, which is Everybody.\n105:26: Okay. The smartest person in the room\n105:30: is. I'm going to write it.\n105:34: It's. It's capitalized because it's a proper noun. It's the\n105:37: room. Okay. So what I would like to do is take your question\n105:42: and although it's not exactly related to the design,\n105:45: like step that I wanted to take right now, but I think I\n105:49: was in your room and I know that you know your story, I know that\n105:52: you're really passionate about it. So we don't need to get to the authentic leadership\n105:55: part in the storytelling. You're good on that. We can work on this problem for\n105:58: you. So what I would like to do is ask the room.\n106:02: So I'm going to also showcase maybe my,\n106:05: like, listening skills or my lack of listening skills and trying to share\n106:10: the problem for the room. The problem, as I hear it,\n106:13: is that there are people\n106:18: that don't have a lot of food and that they're. There's hunger\n106:23: and there's poverty, so they're poor. And you can either create food\n106:27: or you can create money, which turns into food. And what\n106:31: you are wanting to do is. I.\n106:34: My understanding. Let me just. Could be wrong. This is. My understanding is you\n106:38: want to support them in creating value\n106:41: added products, which means, I think you're trying\n106:45: to create money for them so that they can get food,\n106:48: not necessarily produce food with farming. And so the challenge\n106:52: that you're having is should you support the educational\n106:56: component where the women will develop the\n107:00: skills to produce whatever the\n107:04: input material is through the farm, or should you\n107:07: work on developing the markets and the connections with the shops that\n107:11: are going to hold this value added product? And it's a chicken and egg problem.\n107:15: And now I'm going to not share my thoughts, but I would love\n107:19: to hear the room. Did you understand the problem? And does anybody\n107:23: have an idea about how to help Maureen with her challenge?\n107:26: First of all, did I get the problem right clearly enough so that. Okay,\n107:30: good. So that's the. That's the problem. So it's a chicken and egg problem.\n107:33: Focus on teaching the farming or focus on developing the marketplace\n107:36: where the value added products can be sold.\n107:42: How would somebody here address this? And if you don't\n107:45: answer. I'm just going to pick somebody. Anybody.\n107:53: Remember, you're the smartest person in the room. It's the room we want to\n107:57: hear. You know, you could have a horrible\n108:00: idea that inspires somebody else to have a good idea. So whatever your idea is,\n108:04: it's valuable because this is how collective intelligence works. So please,\n108:09: what are your first thoughts?\n108:14: I have a similar issue. I'm sorry, I didn't\n108:18: read my.\n108:22: Between creating like a market in my project\n108:27: there is no market really. So I'll be opening the market.\n108:32: But I think the first\n108:37: step is knowing if there is potential for\n108:40: that market for the idea you have and if there is\n108:43: no potential in that market, what do you have to change to\n108:47: open the market now? Because you might have a great\n108:51: idea, great project that will help the maybe the soil\n108:55: or the food producing in your area.\n108:58: But if there is no way you can\n109:03: expand the project, eventually it will just lag\n109:07: behind other ideas or maybe the detriment,\n109:11: the problem will overwhelm your project.\n109:14: So I would say there is a\n109:19: potential market even though there is no real market yet. So find\n109:23: it and then shape the project around that potential\n109:26: market to open it in the future.\n109:30: Interesting. And, and it's\n109:33: really nice to know that there are other people with a similar problem.\n109:37: So potentially you guys should just stay in touch and you\n109:40: can. You can hear more about what how Ricardo is.\n109:44: Has been exploring his problem and maybe he can also learn from you as you\n109:47: go. Priya.\n109:50: Priya. Run. John. Awesome.\n109:53: Go for it. So basically what\n109:57: I used to do. So whenever I come across problem I\n110:01: used to note down everything like all the ideas,\n110:04: what is going around my head that the problem and all.\n110:07: Then I used to analyze everything like what\n110:11: are the. Like you know what's going to work like strength weaknesses,\n110:14: what can be the opportunities and what can\n110:17: be the threats. Like what can be the problems like government and all.\n110:21: Then we did in our one of the workshop like\n110:25: before means one of our module\n110:29: that how to because market is based on multiple things\n110:33: like there are we. In short it's not Pascal analysis.\n110:37: You can say where you talk about the politics\n110:41: organization and what other factors are associated with the market.\n110:44: After analyze that you when you start understanding\n110:48: you will come up like similar problems. Like you will come to some\n110:52: of the conclusion that okay, this thing I can work on after\n110:56: understanding that you can go for the people who has been already working\n111:00: into similar industries and who has like come across\n111:04: the similar problems because I did the similar thing.\n111:08: So you know you can Read about the papers or the news articles\n111:12: as the organization shares a lot of articles. So you can\n111:15: go across that, that okay in this area because\n111:19: there when you talk about you don't have soil, you don't have structure.\n111:22: So many people are going for like hydro farming.\n111:26: Many people are going for different types of farming.\n111:29: So we can start analyzing that. And there\n111:32: are as organized, there are multiple grants or\n111:36: multiple organization which support these initiatives. So you\n111:40: can think about coming across them like how\n111:44: you can talk to them and maybe you can\n111:48: run a similar project which is already going on like one of\n111:52: b visionary fellow run plastic for food or\n111:56: plastic for waste in Mumbai. So basically that\n111:59: original company, it started in Germany and he is thinking\n112:03: very similar something. So if someone is already\n112:06: doing something, you can, you know, take help and you can work on a\n112:09: very similar way. And so that you the\n112:13: half of the things like you save time into\n112:17: the research into these things because when there are multiple\n112:21: heads, you get multiple ideas, multiple solutions and then you\n112:24: can narrow down according to your requirement and\n112:28: then you can pursue it. It's a like hypothetically,\n112:31: like I'm just telling what I felt. It's nothing to do, it's not\n112:35: very systematic. I can understand. Yeah, it's my opinion.\n112:39: I, I, I, I had a lot of ideas already just hearing the two.\n112:42: And so the next stage in the the room\n112:46: is we actually ask the other facilitators. So Joyce,\n112:50: Nihal, I don't know if there's anybody else from DO here. How would\n112:54: you respond to this question? It's like going up. Actually,\n112:57: I forgot the most important part which Maureen even mentioned. Sorry,\n113:01: Joyce and Nihal, keep, keep your, keep your thoughts with you.\n113:05: Maureen, the most important person\n113:08: to answer the question in this whole collective intelligence exercise\n113:12: starts with, with you, like you said.\n113:16: So what are your thoughts if you're gonna step away\n113:20: from Maureen? What was your nickname?\n113:26: Okay, so Maureen's is over here. Now here's Mo.\n113:29: What would Mo tell Maureen?\n113:33: How would you solve it? Yeah.\n113:37: So I feel like maybe\n113:41: what more will tell Maureen will probably be to incline 100%\n113:45: on what she's passionate about, because these are two separate\n113:50: aspects of her project. Aspect number one is\n113:53: if she decides to incline the humanitarian angle of it, which includes I'm\n113:57: empowering these women through farming, then I will tell her if\n114:01: she's passionate about that whole process of empowerment, then she'll stick to it.\n114:04: Or rather if she's passionate about bringing about a product\n114:08: in the industry, in the food industry that supports or supplements and makes\n114:13: Availability and accessibility of food to people more\n114:17: important to having. She should incline to eat more. So it's,\n114:20: it's. So I think I would advise her to try\n114:24: and pick a side that she's 100 passionate about.\n114:27: Either do business through the body added product or\n114:31: stick to the empowerment angle to it and empower the women.\n114:34: Yeah. Before we go to Joyce and Nihal, now you're Marine again,\n114:39: answer Mo's question. Which one are you more passionate about? Don't be 100.\n114:43: It's hard to be 100. But which one are you more passionate about?\n114:47: Well, I'm more passionate about the humanitarian angle. I've been through that\n114:51: space and mine is to mostly support.\n114:54: It's well, availing these products in the market will\n114:57: help the women through generating income for them.\n115:00: But what I would want more is to help them think\n115:04: beyond what they have been conformed into\n115:08: believing and see the possibilities of them doing\n115:12: better for themselves and using the resources that they have to help\n115:16: themselves. So I would normally incline to know\n115:19: the humanitarian angle of it through empowerment,\n115:22: but then I also understand that there\n115:27: is need to, to,\n115:30: to finance the project. There is need to find ways to support\n115:34: these women through this empowerment program. So having the product and selling the product to\n115:38: generate money and then convincing yourself,\n115:41: now it's okay. We just wanted to know which one you're more passionate about.\n115:44: We got it. And you can, you can go have\n115:48: a debate with Mo later. Joyce, Nial,\n115:55: quick feedback. I want to, I want to head back into the slide, so just\n115:58: feel free. Joyce, you can start.\n116:01: Well, the question is, what part of the solution directly impacts\n116:05: your beneficiary? What is your community? We are in\n116:09: a workshop about prototyping with an in marginal community.\n116:13: So what is this community? And your\n116:16: decision should center around that beautiful yell.\n116:21: Anyhow, exactly what Joyce\n116:25: is saying too.\n116:28: All that. You put them at the center,\n116:32: fall in love with the problem, keeping them as,\n116:36: as that core, and then everything will fall into\n116:40: place. Yeah. Yeah. That's beautiful. Okay, so now like\n116:44: this whole like pyramid thing we started with, we kind of put Maureen in the\n116:48: middle, but we're supposed to have started with Maureen. We asked your cohort,\n116:52: hopefully you feel that support, you feel that encouragement.\n116:55: And, and often like, like you mentioned the beginning,\n116:59: you kind of have that trust and like, wow, I can actually answer my own\n117:02: questions. Okay. I think that's a lesson for\n117:05: everybody here before you go off. I know that you guys have mentors,\n117:10: but really think about it. When you ask a question,\n117:14: answer it first and then go\n117:18: out and ask your cohort, ask Lucy,\n117:22: ask Zach, ask others, and then\n117:25: you'll start to see that the answers are out there.\n117:30: We just have to open the channels of this kind of collective. Collective creativity.\n117:35: Okay, anybody want to share something\n117:38: about this experience or would you like to move to the\n117:42: next phases?\n117:52: Hi, everyone. Hi.\n117:56: Well, as for me of Land site,\n117:59: our projects are interrelated.\n118:02: For example, Maureen is working with the marginalist communities.\n118:06: I'm also working with the marginalized communities, and I'm also\n118:09: from one of the marginalized communities back in Kenya.\n118:13: And so my project is about, like, period poverty,\n118:17: and Maureen's project is about, like, food insecurity\n118:20: and on. Honestly, I've witnessed that,\n118:24: for example, in my community, like, most of us, like, we tend\n118:27: to eat and drink just like, the milk and\n118:31: ugali, which is scarce. Like, we have to\n118:35: work, like, so many kilometers to have access to this\n118:39: food and all that, and it results to malnutrition and\n118:43: all those problems. So, like, I realized that if we\n118:46: share our projects with one another and get to,\n118:49: like, integrate our projects, for example,\n118:52: if Maureen is working with a modulus community back in\n118:56: Kenya on the issue of food security, and I'm also working on the issue of\n118:59: period poverty, like, we can always join hands and maybe\n119:03: help the community together. And instead of\n119:06: solving just one problem, we'll end up impacting so many people\n119:10: and solving a million problems. Yeah. And I just want to, like,\n119:13: tell you all you're doing amazing. Your projects are quite inspiring.\n119:17: And, yeah, I'm rooting for you all. Thank you.\n119:20: Beautiful. What a beautiful way of ending\n119:24: this collective intelligence practice.\n119:29: We. We start. We just before the break. We started with gratitude and,\n119:33: like, sharing the people that supported us from\n119:37: before. And now we're seeing the. The strength\n119:41: and the support and the willingness to collaborate and potentially,\n119:46: I heard, like, join forces or work together more closely somehow,\n119:49: especially for people with similar projects working on similar\n119:53: issues. Really beautiful. And I, from my side,\n119:57: I strongly encourage that we. What is it? You know,\n120:01: I can't use the word Ubuntu in a room full of Africans, so. But I\n120:05: guess I should. There's this idea of Ubuntu that\n120:09: we go far when we go together. And. And I'm,\n120:13: you know, in a small way, I'm a little part of it, and so is\n120:15: father Greg Boyle, and so is my mom. We're all going far together\n120:19: by sharing what we have with the people that we're\n120:22: connected to. So that's. That's really beautiful. Thank you so much. Lucy.\n120:26: That was, that was, that was really wonderful. What I want to do is actually\n120:31: go to what Lucy just shared\n120:35: and stop. Oh, sound share. Yes. I'm going to stop\n120:38: the sound share and I'm going to go over here. Are we,\n120:42: are we recording still or do we want to turn that on? Okay, great.\n120:46: So what exactly\n120:50: is marginalization and what are our resources?\n120:54: I want to just shift\n120:57: our mindsets a little bit. You know,\n121:00: when, when we go to school, we are so often\n121:04: told you are smart or you are dumb, and here is\n121:08: your, like, this is what you're worth.\n121:12: You got a B plus. Okay. It's not even showing anyway. Like, we're given grades\n121:16: and we're defined as individuals, but we're\n121:20: not actually individuals.\n121:23: We are fed through the\n121:26: hands of dozens and dozens and hundreds of people who\n121:29: work in places near and far.\n121:33: Like, our mothers cared for us so much when we\n121:36: were children to be able to bring us to this place. We have all likely\n121:40: a teacher or somebody that said just the right word at the right\n121:43: time. We're not exactly doing it on our own.\n121:46: Right. And the way that schools kind of make it out\n121:50: to be, if you're smart, you win and you should win at the\n121:54: expense of everyone else. This is traditional schools. You might have had better schools or\n121:57: better teachers. But I'm making a generalization for kind\n122:00: of traditional what one of\n122:04: Nihal and I's friends, Abhijit, calls colonial schools.\n122:09: And why do you think they give you grade letters? They give you a,\n122:12: B, C, D. Just like we have cuts of meat that are grade\n122:16: A, grade B, grade C, grade D. Or we have screws.\n122:20: You know, a grade A screw, screw means that it has no flaws.\n122:23: We're being graded because the idea is that we fit\n122:26: into a machine, but we are not.\n122:30: I really want to change this idea and I think we\n122:35: need to really rethink some of these ideas of not just intelligence and\n122:39: how the smartest person is the room and open our hearts to each other and\n122:42: support each other, but also like, what are our resources?\n122:45: And it's, it's really rethinking things rather than\n122:49: being like, okay, so maybe there are some funders out there\n122:53: that have resources or businesses or grant giving organizations or the\n122:56: UN and we must access that to be able to have this\n123:00: type of capital, to be able to start a business, to be able to solve\n123:03: a problem, to create more capital that will then return to the funders somehow\n123:07: they're investors or otherwise. But there are different things that we\n123:11: have access to. And so there's,\n123:15: this comes from my, my studies in permaculture,\n123:19: and this is from the Appleseed Collective's thinking.\n123:23: They have a whole article on the eight forms of currency. There may\n123:26: be more. They maybe you might debate some, you might think of them as less.\n123:30: But I want all of you with your challenges,\n123:34: with your problems, the things that you want to work on, think of the people,\n123:37: think of the community, think of you as well. This is one of the pieces\n123:41: of advice I would have given Maureen about her problem. Very similar to\n123:45: what she said is who are you really?\n123:48: Like, where, what, what are the things that\n123:52: are nearest to hand? Where are your strengths going to\n123:55: create that momentum so you can break that chicken and egg problem? You know,\n123:59: where's that most likely to happen first? And so maybe\n124:03: it's important to also think about these types\n124:06: of capital that you have when you bring them to bear on your projects.\n124:10: I'm curious, like, which one of these stands out to you?\n124:14: You know, think about your, your challenge area and then think\n124:17: about which of these types of capital you are the\n124:21: most rich in. How about we type it in? Like maybe\n124:25: pick, pick your top three most wealthy types of capital.\n124:29: So for instance, if you feel very, very well connected socially and you know so\n124:32: many people, many different places, you would put that as your first\n124:36: and then what is your second and what's your third? So let's take a moment,\n124:39: let's look at this and then. Hi, Rosemary, I'm glad you're here\n124:43: too. Thank you. And let's,\n124:46: let's think about like, breaking this idea of\n124:49: the dollar is king, the dollar is not king, nor is the lira or the\n124:53: euro or whatever. There's a lot of different kinds of capital that we overlook\n124:56: when we're trying to solve a problem. So write\n125:00: your top three. I'm going to do the same along with you and\n125:03: just put it in the chat. Let's see.\n125:13: Yeah, so it's not just with you and your life, it's in the context of\n125:16: your projects, what you have access to, to bear, to solving\n125:19: the problem. So if you have a farm,\n125:23: for instance, you would have living capital,\n125:26: intellectual capital.\n126:02: I'm also curious if Nihal would do it like what, what your\n126:06: top three are and then you as you as well. Joyce. I'm trying,\n126:09: I'm trying to think about it right now. It's, it's a little tough.\n126:14: So probably.\n126:27: Okay, this is probably my stuff for sure.\n126:34: Intellectual, cultural, very similar. I, I was debating between cultural\n126:38: and spiritual, actually. Social, experiential,\n126:41: cultural, this is kind of cool. You know, I was really thinking of taking\n126:46: the chat and you know, coming up with a Google Doc\n126:49: and gathering all the insights because we've put a lot of amazing\n126:53: stuff in here. We should not delete this. If anybody here is\n126:56: off camera and is not really, you know, able to participate with\n127:00: audio and wants to open a public Google Doc and start taking\n127:03: notes and like consolidate this stuff, I would really appreciate it. I hear\n127:06: that you guys have a forum. It would be really amazing at the end of\n127:09: this session for you to take your notes, your thoughts and just journal\n127:14: a little bit about what you learned, what you're taking away and what you're going\n127:16: to do about it and put it into the forum. I'll give that\n127:19: as an assignment at the end. So does\n127:23: anybody want to share their top three\n127:28: and then think out loud about how\n127:32: it touches their projects?\n127:36: There's a bit of live creative practice,\n127:43: so you can just start with telling the story of your top three.\n127:46: And I'd love to hear from somebody. Zach, I see that you got your camera\n127:49: on your Internet looks good. Would you be willing to share with us? I don't\n127:52: think we heard much from you today. Yeah, I'm happy\n127:56: to share that. Some of my largest capitals\n128:00: at this moment would be intellectual. I really know what I am\n128:04: doing. I have a background in what I'm doing. I have experienced it\n128:07: firsthand. So experiential capital comes in.\n128:10: Secondly, I have lived in context of my project,\n128:13: human world, conflict hotspots and worked in those for\n128:17: like four years now. And that one\n128:20: would be social capital. I have a bunch of social,\n128:24: a bunch of groups that I can reach out to bounce ideas,\n128:29: consult and also I would say that I have a community around me\n128:33: that's really supportive, listens, and the\n128:37: community that I'm working with is part of my social capital and they are\n128:40: the biggest asset to my project success. And I'm loving working\n128:44: with this current community. Wonderful. Looking at all of this,\n128:49: these ideas of capital, does it give you any ideas of how\n128:52: to bring any to bear in a new way\n128:56: or one that you didn't really think of as a type of value that might\n129:00: be supported, supportive for your project?\n129:04: Definitely, yeah. And this is the\n129:08: social element of it we've talked about. We've reflected back on\n129:12: some of the previous successful kind of projects\n129:16: or some of the things that inspire us and I feel like at this moment\n129:20: engaging with my current community, I feel like we could use\n129:25: a combined, I don't know how to put it, nexus of\n129:29: three of these or four of these. And that could bring us to\n129:33: a good starting point henceforth because\n129:38: this is real new content to me. This is not taught in\n129:41: school and you cannot pick this from any textbook that is outside there,\n129:45: wherever. And this is what we really need to push our ventures forward. And I\n129:48: feel like a combination of a couple of this would\n129:52: do magic for, for my venture and yeah,\n129:55: generally for. Very, very interesting.\n129:58: I think, I think it's so important to do this partially\n130:03: because of what we were hearing just earlier about\n130:07: how important it is to be be\n130:11: aware of your own intelligence. Because then,\n130:14: then you are more inspired to be intelligent. You are more inspired to actually\n130:18: use it. To actually think of yourself as a intelligent, this kind of positive feedback\n130:22: cycle. And when someone thinks of themselves as impoverished but\n130:27: is surrounded by love, right. But because they don't have like dollars\n130:30: in the bank, they feel poor. There's potentially a negative feedback\n130:34: cycle. And so I think that one of the things that this framework,\n130:38: this way of looking at our, our value\n130:42: is in realizing like wow, you know, I see some of\n130:46: the more rare ones are experiential. Actually, no, the last three are all\n130:49: have experiential, but there's just. We're rich,\n130:52: you know, we're wealthy beyond measure. Given all\n130:56: of the incredible experiences you were talking about working in conflict zones,\n131:00: I, I'd love to, to learn from you. I also, I have\n131:04: a recent experience in Muslim and Iraq post conflict\n131:08: reconstruction. And it's just we can learn\n131:11: and support each other so much. So when people were thanking\n131:16: each other for their mutual support with their ideas,\n131:20: we need to realize that that's just one of the kinds of capital that we\n131:23: have to be able to share with each other. Right. And we have so much\n131:26: more. And just opening up this framing\n131:30: I think can be really valuable. Does anybody else want to like,\n131:34: does anybody else have an aha moment that they want to share about\n131:38: how this might support their project? Yeah, I can share something actually.\n131:42: Yeah, sure. Mentioned idea as\n131:45: part of the, as part of the currency. And I just want and\n131:49: have a discussion about that. Because your idea is a seed.\n131:54: It's not a statue. Like it's not a\n131:57: form of fixed currency. Your greatest\n132:00: asset, maybe whoever typed idea. You simply mean your ability\n132:04: to come up with the idea. But I urge you to detach yourself from\n132:08: thinking of your greatest assets as your current idea.\n132:12: No, it's not. It's your insight into the problem and your commitment\n132:15: to solving it. Right. So I\n132:18: challenge you to consider your relationship with\n132:22: your idea as a flexible one that actually opens up\n132:25: better opportunities to other currencies. All right,\n132:29: beautiful. Yeah, I didn't, I didn't catch that.\n132:32: Yeah, maybe they were intending intellectual capital, but I think it's a very\n132:36: valid point. I think sometimes people can think of.\n132:39: There's actually a book called your ideas are your only currency,\n132:43: which I think you would really disagree with. But I\n132:48: think maybe the book's main point is your ability to\n132:51: generate ideas is your only currency, which is actually something that we can move to\n132:55: next. After this, I wanted to have some more like\n132:59: creative fun, fast paced ideation\n133:03: and creative problem solving stage. But I want to make\n133:06: sure that this really sinks in. And I'm curious if we\n133:10: have any other moments\n133:14: of inspiration or insight, like looking at your challenge and the problem that you\n133:17: want to solve and looking at your list of what\n133:20: you have to give it, what new ways\n133:24: potentially of solving it can you see?\n133:27: Yeah. Does that resonate with anybody or.\n133:39: It could be homework. Because I feel like this is actually a take\n133:43: 20 minutes to journal sort of question, but if anything pops up for people.\n134:10: All right, does anybody want me to pick\n134:14: somebody or anybody want to share or do you want. You guys want to move\n134:17: on? Actually, I'm curious. Don't even tell me an answer to\n134:20: that. To the question of like how to use these capitals for your projects.\n134:24: I just want to hear what you're thinking about. I'm seeing people looking at the\n134:28: screen. I have a feeling that you guys are like reflecting. Does anybody want\n134:31: to reflect out loud? Followed Ricardo.\n134:39: Well, I think this could be like,\n134:42: also interesting. Not necessarily,\n134:45: well, part of building your project, but as well,\n134:49: using it to the story building. Not directly,\n134:53: but also to take into account what resources we have.\n134:57: Maybe not said like, oh, my living capital is this,\n135:01: but know what your living capital is and integrate\n135:04: them to the storytelling as\n135:08: a valuable asset\n135:12: you have in your favor.\n135:15: Yeah, yeah, that's. That's a really important idea, the cultural capital.\n135:19: And I feel like this connects to some of this idea of like authentic leadership\n135:23: and being able to tell a story that moves people.\n135:27: Yeah, that's. That's a. I didn't actually see that connection between some of\n135:31: the stuff that we talked about earlier and that form of capital.\n135:35: Priya Ranjan.\n135:40: I think it can be used to structure\n135:45: your story in a better way. Like I\n135:48: can see how everything is important,\n135:52: like from, you know, your action idea,\n135:56: money, how you connect with connections. Then some\n136:00: people connected with a song like, you know, you, you say,\n136:04: I heard in like, in this song, there's a beautiful line. And then\n136:07: you connect your story up from that.\n136:10: So, like, what idea I'm getting out of it.\n136:13: So everything is, like, very interconnected and can be\n136:17: used in a structured way to tell your story passionately.\n136:21: And plus, you can mold your story\n136:25: according to the crowd. So which can\n136:29: I can. I can see and I can understand. Like, when you\n136:32: talk to spiritual leaders, you know, like,\n136:36: you can talk about karmas, like, if we are doing\n136:40: good for the world, then you connect with your environment, and then you\n136:43: connect with what exactly you are doing. So I feel like when you\n136:47: talk about a person who's a businessman, so you talk about money, so you\n136:50: talk about your problem statement, your knowledge. Why did you come up\n136:54: more in a systematic way? And then when you talk about\n136:57: kids, you talk more about, you know,\n137:00: impact, how this thing is going to change\n137:04: the world, how they will get a clean energy or,\n137:08: you know, fresh air, fresh water because\n137:12: of what we have done today. So,\n137:15: like, what. I got this point. It can be very systematically\n137:20: used and mold your story according to an individual\n137:24: person. That's. That's beautiful. That's. That's very interesting.\n137:27: As you're sharing, it kind of inspired\n137:31: me to think of this, you know, as you're talking about,\n137:34: like, the different stakeholders and the story that weaves the web.\n137:39: One of the things that made me think is, like, what if that new store.\n137:43: Let's talk about, like, business and investments. What if we came to the\n137:46: table and instead of saying, okay,\n137:50: the. The only investment in this business is going to be\n137:53: valued in the 1 out of 8 of\n137:58: the Capitals that we have, which is financial capital, and everything else is irrelevant.\n138:01: What if we had, you know, even shares allocated for people bringing\n138:05: different types of capital? And. And I think one of the interesting\n138:09: things that you. You said that kind of inspired\n138:13: me into thinking about this is making\n138:16: the. It's. I feel like maybe this framework\n138:22: really is important for.\n138:24: For everybody because. And especially people\n138:28: that fixate on one type of capital.\n138:32: And I. I always felt like when I\n138:36: was younger that if I just did the right thing\n138:39: and I did things that I thought were beautiful, that life would always work\n138:43: out and, you know, I would be rich at some\n138:47: point. You know, I just. I would be well off. I wouldn't have to worry\n138:50: about, like, money anymore. It turned out it was\n138:54: true, but not in the way that I thought. And for some time, I was\n138:57: kind of disappointed. I was like, I did everything, you know, like, I'm trying to\n139:01: be in service. I'm Solving real problems, like,\n139:04: where's the wealth? And then I, I realized, like, wow, I have Nihal and now\n139:08: Joyce and like all of you in this room. And I have all\n139:11: this experience that I can share from my life about like building robots\n139:15: and working in mus and architecture, and I can connect with\n139:18: Alexander about that. And like, I never really realized that I was rich\n139:22: until I started. I don't like using this word because of some\n139:26: reasons, but it's. It's sometimes the best word to use. But like,\n139:29: decolonizing this thing and like, what it thinks\n139:33: money and value is. Okay, I hope this was interesting. I hope it was helpful.\n139:37: And I want you to keep these in mind when we\n139:41: get into solving the problem. Just like, you know,\n139:45: if you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, right?\n139:49: Once we get into the problem solving and the creative elements,\n139:53: this kind of opens up a whole different range\n139:56: of possibilities of, you know, instead of thinking of your.\n140:00: The people that you're supporting and solving problem for as impoverished.\n140:05: What. What do they have? Right? Which one of these\n140:08: eight different kinds of capital do they have? And how can they become\n140:13: seen as. As valuable contributors? And instead of, you know,\n140:17: solving a problem for them? I think that when you start thinking about all these\n140:20: forms of capital, it'll help you think about how to solve problems with them.\n140:24: What are they bringing to the table? And, you know, maybe you do need\n140:27: to make a map. Like, we heard about\n140:30: the SWOT analysis. You know, maybe we do need\n140:34: to make these maps, actually draw it out. Like, okay, so what do I have?\n140:37: Social capital, material capital, who else is in my community? What do they have?\n140:40: And then what are the problem we're trying to solve? How do they actually touch\n140:43: it? And then just, you know, think about it. I know,\n140:46: like, I asked the question, trying to do something that is actually pretty big,\n140:49: and I think it might require some contemplation and connection and\n140:53: time and all the other things and the principles that we had connection to\n140:56: community. But I really hope this framework is helpful for you.\n141:00: And we're going to work on an\n141:03: element right now in experiential and intellectual\n141:07: capital. Okay, how are we going to\n141:11: do this transition? I wanted initially to.\n141:16: Yeah, you know, let's just go straight into it. Where is that?\n141:21: Okay. Okay, does everyone have.\n141:25: Put your fingers on your keyboards. Get the chat thing open. You guys got your\n141:28: chat thing open. You got your keyboard open.\n141:32: Okay, so this is going to go from really\n141:39: thinking about your problem, feeling your problem,\n141:42: remembering the people getting into the story,\n141:45: feeling your value and your emotions. And now\n141:49: we're going to move from that and into. And then even understanding\n141:52: different kinds of capital, how we can think\n141:56: of the. Open up the problem space a little bit more even.\n141:59: Now we're going to get into some action. So I'm\n142:03: going to put one minute timer here and\n142:06: I want people to not press enter. You can just put commas.\n142:10: Okay. I want you to write as many uses for this thing\n142:14: as you can in one minute. You got\n142:17: it? Keyboard's open. Everyone ready? One minute.\n142:22: I'm not gonna join you. Don't be cheating. But I'm gonna do it on a\n142:26: paper. Okay. Three, two, one. You guys ready? Clear.\n142:29: You know what this is? It's a paperclip.\n142:33: As many uses as you can. The minute has started. Bismillah.\n142:36: Yallah.\n142:39: Joyce, you can. You can do the exercise. Can play some music.\n142:51: Okay.\n142:55: Yeah. Don't press enter until you're done. You can just put commas.\n142:59: Marine. Keep going. You have 30, 30 seconds left.\n143:06: It.\n143:41: Okay, Boom. Stop. Everyone stop. Okay,\n143:45: now you can press enter. Let's see what we got. Let's see your creativity.\n143:49: Look at this. Okay, so holding people together.\n143:53: Very good. Earrings. Wow.\n143:56: Hang objects. Hanging marker\n144:01: for book lovers. Awesome. We learned something about Deborah. Hi,\n144:04: Deborah. Haven't heard your voice, but it's lovely to hear you write or see\n144:08: you write hair\n144:11: clips. I feel like somebody has definitely used this as a hair clip.\n144:15: Is this like from personal experience? Is that experiential capital up in her?\n144:19: It sounds like it. Okay. Holding buttons for clothes.\n144:21: I love that one. Okay.\n144:25: We talked a little bit about education. Education is\n144:31: sometimes the enemy of creativity. So this exercise,\n144:35: when you give it to people that are six years old,\n144:39: they have tons of answers.\n144:42: They have many, many more. I forget the exact statistics, but they actually write a\n144:46: lot more. And once people get to fourth grade and fifth grade,\n144:50: maybe they're like 10, 11, 12, 13.\n144:53: The number of answers they get starts declining. Does anybody have\n144:57: a guess why that's the case?\n145:07: Listen, I don't like the sound of my voice, honestly. Like, I would love\n145:10: to hear some from some from some others. I know you\n145:14: guys are here, you guys are writing. Okay, you can write the answer. I don't\n145:17: mind. Why do you think? Okay, it's for that Bill.\n145:21: Why do you think that people reduce the number\n145:25: as they get older and they go through more schooling?\n145:28: I feel like people reduce as they get older because\n145:32: they become more self conscious. They are more\n145:36: aware of right and wrong, and they\n145:39: tend to think before the act. When you're very young, you're kind of sort\n145:43: of of more impulsive and out there.\n145:47: But as you get older, you get a bit more reserved and you\n145:51: wonder, like, what will people think if I say this and this?\n145:55: What will people assume? So,\n145:58: but as a kid, you just do. You just do it instantly.\n146:02: Like the moment you think about it, it's done. Yeah,\n146:06: just like that. Beautiful. I think you, you had a lot of\n146:10: the important elements. Zach,\n146:14: did you have anything in addition? Anybody else have anything in addition?\n146:22: Alexander, I think,\n146:26: I mean, the order you get and the more educated you get, you know\n146:30: more about the intended purpose of things.\n146:33: Which of course limits you in a way of seeing\n146:37: all the other possibilities this thing offers, which you\n146:41: originally still have, because you don't originally do know the\n146:45: intended purpose. So you just think, okay, what can I use it for?\n146:49: Yeah, we saw a lot of people, first thing they put was hold the paper\n146:52: together, which is great. I actually, I really like that. I like that. Because you\n146:56: didn't censor yourself. You're like, this is too obvious. But no, you just went\n146:59: for it. So you're actually on the right track here.\n147:02: Deborah says our creativity is eroded once we're exposed to structured information.\n147:06: Creative side works best when there's no limit to how much it can explore.\n147:10: Beautiful. Okay, there's another\n147:14: element that I remember, which is they\n147:18: don't limit the thing\n147:21: to the thing itself. They also imagine they have their creativity\n147:26: still alive. So they imagine, what if it was a hundred\n147:29: feet tall, Right. What if it was made out\n147:33: of chocolate? I could eat it, right? That's an answer.\n147:36: It's a paperclip made out of chocolate. You could eat it. Of course it's an\n147:39: answer. Okay, so with all of these things,\n147:43: we're going to try to bring about our\n147:46: six year old child self. Remember your nickname,\n147:49: Bulbul? I was called Bulbul back when I was six.\n147:52: Okay, we've got Parker over here. We got. I forget a\n147:55: lot of this. Other nicknames have. We got all that guy is still around,\n147:58: that girl is still around, the young person's still here.\n148:01: So remember, let's put on this attitude of like, no right,\n148:05: no wrong. What else did we hear from Bill? No right, no wrong.\n148:10: It could be made out of different materials. It could be really\n148:13: big, it could be really small, it could be scaled, it could be changed.\n148:17: There's no judgment. We all are here to support each other.\n148:20: Okay, so we do go until another half hour, right,\n148:23: Nihal? It's just some people have to go early.\n148:26: Yeah, we have Another half an hour. Okay. Okay. So put\n148:30: all that stuff aside. Let's make this an exercise\n148:34: in writing speed. Okay? Just. I'm going\n148:38: to get the timer. Don't think of ideas yet. Okay? This is not about\n148:41: thinking about ideas. It's about letting go of thinking and letting\n148:45: yourself write without holding yourself\n148:49: back. Okay, you guys ready to try it one more time? Remember,\n148:52: comma, comma, comma. So no, don't press enter. You're going to put a minute on\n148:56: the timer. Write as many uses for\n149:00: this thing as possible in the one minute that we have. Everyone,\n149:03: fingers on keyboard. Ready, steady,\n149:06: and go, you six year olds.\n149:10: All right, here we go. It.\n149:40: Sorry.\n150:21: Okay, that's it. That's our minute. So three,\n150:25: two, one.\n150:29: Okay. Some of these are pretty long. Seems like we got\n150:33: some longer time. We can also explore the quality of\n150:36: the creativity. Wow. Interesting.\n150:40: Yeah, definitely. I'm seeing a lot more creativity\n150:44: here. Does anybody want to share,\n150:47: like, what it was like between the first time and the second time? Did you\n150:50: guys have more fun? Was it. How was it any different?\n150:56: Ooh, weapon to prick friends with Zach. I don't\n150:59: know if I want to be friends with you.\n151:07: Yeah. How was it for you guys? Like, I'd love to hear somebody\n151:11: first to the second, and maybe I'll just pick someone who I know\n151:14: is here but hasn't spoken much like. Chetan. I think he's here.\n151:18: Chetan. What was it like between the first and the second time?\n151:23: He's here. Yeah, hi.\n151:28: Go ahead. Yeah,\n151:31: it's about, like, you. You think about\n151:35: things which are around you. Like, in my case,\n151:38: I thought about things around me. Say, one guitar.\n151:42: Then I thought about, why can't we, you know, place this there? It's about\n151:47: the things which are around me and taking this thing to fix that.\n151:51: That's it. Beautiful. So I\n151:55: actually kind of like that as a creativity enhancer.\n151:58: They say a lot of creative people have messy desks. And it's\n152:02: really interesting because it allows you to make connections with different stuff.\n152:05: Right. Like, you can see it and you're like, okay, paperclip and,\n152:08: you know, the, like locking the door or paperclip and\n152:12: xyz. So I like this idea of, like, looking around you and making\n152:16: those connections. Nyasha.\n152:22: I would say this time around, this was the real me typing.\n152:26: And it was a competition to get the smartest answers.\n152:30: So I really enjoyed the second time.\n152:34: I think that's. That's beautiful.\n152:39: Yeah. That you felt like more yourself. I feel\n152:43: like this. We heard about children twice today. Right.\n152:47: Once when we were talking about, you know,\n152:51: we were hearing from. Who are we hearing from? Was talking about children.\n152:58: Yeah. Sharing about Nihal's stories and, and how we\n153:03: can, we can learn from bringing a more childlike perspective.\n153:09: Yeah. Interesting. You're laughing while doing it.\n153:12: Okay, so what does the world need more of?\n153:19: Children. Children, people who've come alive.\n153:23: And I think that, you know, oftentimes,\n153:27: you know, when we are in,\n153:30: I don't know, I can just imagine myself really in\n153:34: a classroom, doodling, waiting to\n153:38: get out versus children, like exploring\n153:41: and playing and creating. And we can, we. We have those\n153:45: parts of us, they're still alive. And we can reconnect with\n153:48: those again. And we can reconnect with them again to\n153:52: do something that means something for us, that creativity\n153:56: can be put into service. So I'm really glad that you had\n154:00: a good time doing this. I'm going to share one.\n154:04: One more little bit of creativity\n154:08: inspiration. I'm going to just get this\n154:12: picture and I'm going to put it over here.\n154:16: One moment. Oh, no, I closed it.\n154:19: I just closed the dab. Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to\n154:21: put it in the chat. So can\n154:25: everyone see the, the thing in the chat? Actually,\n154:29: it's. We're done here, right? It's. I can share my screen again.\n154:33: I'll just do this like this.\n154:38: Okay, so this\n154:43: is a.\n154:45: Another test. Let me share my screen. Where's the screen share?\n154:52: Okay,\n154:56: wait a second. I made a mistake. I forget now.\n155:00: I remember now how to do it. So I want people to\n155:04: do the comma test again, but this time I want\n155:08: you guys to actually.\n155:11: Don't do commas, just do enter. Just write white\n155:15: things. You know, get in the chat, open it up,\n155:18: start writing white objects.\n155:28: I don't see any rice. Good.\n155:34: Okay, good.\n155:37: Okay, we got a good clip here.\n155:41: Now start writing white objects\n155:44: that are inside of a refrigerator.\n155:53: Okay, so.\n155:56: Okay. Okay. Do you, do you.\n156:00: I don't know if you guys can see the difference, but the first time I\n156:03: asked for white objects, it started off in this slow trickle\n156:07: and then started going quickly. But once I said stuff\n156:10: that is white, that's in the fridge. Look at this. We, we keep getting stuff.\n156:15: It just started to flow. Okay, you. You guys can stop now.\n156:19: Does anybody want to kind of reflect on this\n156:23: element and what it might have to do with creativity?\n156:26: Like, why would we do something like this and, and think about what\n156:29: it felt like to write random white stuff versus white stuff in the fridge?\n156:33: What Was what\n156:42: was your mind doing when you're thinking of random white stuff?\n156:46: I'm glad you're liking it, Bill.\n156:49: 12.\n157:00: Very broad. And we've got many, many ideas\n157:04: and sometimes we just need to, to limit it to a certain thing for us\n157:07: to give the right answers. Like at first we're just giving random answers like\n157:11: rice. And you don't really find that in a fridge unless it's cooked.\n157:14: But then once you say what white stuff is in the fridge?\n157:18: Now the mind is not reorganized, but it's\n157:22: restructured to now answer things accordingly. That's beautiful.\n157:26: I'm so glad I didn't mess it up enough that the point didn't come across.\n157:31: You know, I. Yeah, the idea of sharing the\n157:35: fridge, I hope it didn't spoil the creative,\n157:38: like fun, spontaneous surprise, but absolutely right.\n157:41: Did anybody else notice that? That when you limited it,\n157:45: it was smoother somehow?\n157:49: Okay, we got some nods, we got some yeses. Joyce says yes.\n157:52: So how do, how do we think about these two things?\n157:56: Right? Like the first one was kind of like no limits,\n157:59: right? Would it be a child? Like, no, it could be a\n158:03: beta chocolate. And then the second one was some limits,\n158:08: right? What do you guys, how do you guys\n158:12: reconcile that and creativity?\n158:20: It was more difficult on the second task. That's interesting.\n158:26: Yeah. You know, we don't have a lot of time. You know, the experience\n158:30: is really important for you guys to feel that, okay.\n158:33: Because you need to think of you in\n158:37: service of your mission, right? You have a problem, you have people you care about,\n158:40: you want to solve something that makes a real difference.\n158:43: And you need to think of your creative\n158:46: capital, your. All the capital that you have, have your\n158:50: intellectual abilities, your ability to solve problems, to be creative\n158:54: as tools in service of something. Remember we talked like in the\n158:57: Muslim tradition that everything is by its intention. It's less\n159:01: important for your solution to be super creative than it is to solve\n159:05: the problem. So do you need to limit things\n159:09: and set boundaries or do you need to open it up\n159:13: and open new spaces and new opportunities? I think it's\n159:16: really important to think of your creativity not as like, oh,\n159:19: I'm a creative person or I'm not a creative person. You're a human being.\n159:21: You're creative. That's the point. That's. It's a given. You just got to go back\n159:25: to being 6 years old. But now as an adult, how do you take that\n159:28: amazing creativity, the six year old, and put it in service to something that inspires\n159:32: you, right. That lights you up, that brings you to life that supports the\n159:36: people you want to support, that touches the\n159:39: thing that moves you, that connects to your values. Right.\n159:42: So I do these two creative exercises to\n159:46: show you the way that you can actually set\n159:50: the stage in here to open\n159:53: up and to narrow.\n159:57: And these are two fundamental elements of design thinking.\n160:00: Has anybody ever done a design thinking course?\n160:04: Okay, we have some yeses. So what, what is one\n160:08: of like the thing, what do you think I'm talking about? Like, like the opening\n160:11: up, the narrowing. Do you remember the design thinking course?\n160:14: Like what are those principles?\n160:19: Go ahead.\n160:23: Sorry. I did the rare course\n160:28: that the evisioner shared with us and\n160:32: they talked about first looking at\n160:36: the actual context of the situation, of what you think\n160:39: about it. And that's how you narrow the problems, like how\n160:43: it is really affecting the community. You're reaching\n160:47: out. So that instead of thinking\n160:50: like, well, they might have water problems,\n160:54: soil problems or contamination of water problems or something like\n160:58: that, it all goes down to okay, they actually only have like no\n161:03: management of the land and that's why they have issues with their crops,\n161:07: to say an example. So that's a way you narrow down the,\n161:11: the situation and what you need to really focus\n161:14: on. Yeah,\n161:18: yeah. So let me share this slide\n161:21: over here. And this\n161:24: is the design thinking sort of process.\n161:28: It starts with a challenge and\n161:32: then it goes to understanding, defining, ideating, prototyping,\n161:36: testing. And there's a loop that goes all the way to the start. Again,\n161:40: what I am wanting to point out\n161:44: is this diverge and converge. You basically have these two\n161:48: loops of going broad and trying to\n161:51: feedback and ideas and thoughts as possible and then another moment of\n161:56: converging. We're going to go through this process tomorrow with your,\n162:00: with your problems. I just wanted to give this\n162:04: here right after the creativity exercise because\n162:08: of the diverge and the converge and the idea of the\n162:12: different spaces that we're going to be working in and to have\n162:16: that be kind of in your mind, like how do we move from\n162:20: the story, the carrying the problem, understanding it,\n162:23: to moving into a design thinking or, or co design process.\n162:28: And this is, this is that transition here.\n162:32: I need a\n162:36: two minute break. So what I'm going to do is\n162:40: I'm going to put it onto the counterintuitive\n162:45: principles. And I want you guys to\n162:48: like, I won't be gone long but please look\n162:52: through these four principles and see\n162:56: if you can identify what\n163:00: I'm getting at. Like what is. So these are, these are creativity\n163:04: principles.\n163:08: How do these creativity principles emerge?\n163:12: What are they? And if you can come up with an example, that would be\n163:15: great. I'm going to just. And if you can play just a little bit of\n163:18: music. I just have to step out for one second and I'll be right back.\n163:21: Just hold one moment.\n163:25: How do I pause? Can we pause the recording as\n163:28: well? Recording stopped.\n163:32: All right. Just one second.\n163:42: All right. I will also share the screenshot to\n163:46: the chat and\n164:24: let me know if you need any clarity on any\n164:27: of these three. I mean, these four,\n164:30: for example, because you\n164:35: might even recognize some. Because I think, like, the Omid Macrine\n164:39: was mentioned in one of the ESL models.\n164:48: I was just wondering about what does Sikh beauty means?\n164:53: Yes. So there's this beautiful quote\n164:58: by this. This architect and.\n165:02: Sorry. By Buckminster Fuller, who's this amazing innovator.\n165:06: He says that when you seek beauty, you will automatically\n165:11: make design for design\n165:15: that lasts or designed for the people.\n165:18: Because when you inherently go after beauty, you also\n165:22: understand how it's. So there's this thing\n165:26: called fl. Form follows function. So if you\n165:29: can. If you just seek beauty, if you wanted to create\n165:33: anything out in the world. And Bilal will explain this beautifully from his\n165:36: personal examples, too. But if you go after\n165:41: building something, building something beautiful,\n165:45: it'll automatically add a lot of invisible elements to\n165:49: making the design or to making the environment\n165:53: a lot more hospitable. For instance,\n165:56: when we look at. All right, guys,\n166:00: I was fasting today, and I just had\n166:04: to break my fast. It became night,\n166:08: and we. We fast from dawn to\n166:11: dusk sometimes. And so I just had to get some. Some dates. Thank you for.\n166:14: For understanding. And, yeah, if you want, we can\n166:18: get a record. Oh, yeah, recording. Recording in progress.\n166:22: And we can continue Bismillah. Okay,\n166:26: so while Bilal, while you also do that,\n166:29: maybe talk a little bit about beauty and your role in beauty. I. I really\n166:32: love your perspective in.\n166:35: Especially on that part. Oh, goodness. Okay.\n166:39: I wonder how we can connect this. I mean, beauty is\n166:42: here, and you can see that beauty. Beauty is a part of\n166:47: the creativity principles.\n166:50: And, you know, I kind of think that there's a relationship here between\n166:54: beauty. If people know what biomimicry means,\n166:57: it means taking inspiration from nature and learning from how nature\n167:01: does things. And for me, I've always really\n167:06: had beauty to be a guide, especially when\n167:09: I'm having a really difficult, difficult time.\n167:12: And just over my life, I've found\n167:15: that when there are multiple options,\n167:18: choosing the one that makes my heart sing and the one that I think is\n167:22: beautiful, both aesthetically beautiful in\n167:25: its ethics, beautiful in its Perfection or\n167:29: good qualities. I've never been misled,\n167:32: right? And it's, it's helped\n167:35: me find my wife, it's helped me find my work, it's helped me have\n167:39: alhamdulillah, like a beautiful little baby boy. And even in\n167:46: physics, like very rational,\n167:49: technical fields, there are many\n167:52: examples of people who, when they're trying\n167:56: to come up with an answer to an equation or the structure of\n168:00: an equation, they choose before they know,\n168:04: they choose the one that looks the most beautiful or seems\n168:08: the most beautiful to them. And it also happens to\n168:11: be the elegant and true and beautiful\n168:15: solution. And so bringing beauty\n168:19: into our, our thought\n168:22: process around, like solving problems around this\n168:27: is like, I don't think about helping people as much as\n168:31: creating situations of beauty because it\n168:35: changes things from helper and helpy to\n168:40: a shared experience. A place where,\n168:43: you know, for sure there's hunger and people are working on\n168:46: really, really important issues. And you know, what's beautiful,\n168:50: sharing a meal with people, you know,\n168:54: and I kind of think will change some of\n168:57: the way that we see our work from. Maybe more. We talked\n169:01: about this word decolon, decolonize, do,\n169:03: decolonization from like, you know, market forces and\n169:07: solving problems and people with needs and all of this to thinking like,\n169:10: why am I doing this? You know, why do we talk about values? Why do\n169:13: we talk. Why did I try to get you guys to talk so much that\n169:16: you had an emotion and feeling? Because this is, this is\n169:19: for me, what I find to be the most inspirational. Inspirational is\n169:24: to have people say like, what is the most beautiful world?\n169:27: And to be working towards that out\n169:31: of longing and love rather than, oh my God,\n169:34: like climate collapse and I don't know what. And you never know,\n169:37: like there's people, you know, going to,\n169:41: you know, how does it go? Sometimes I think how\n169:46: we do anything is how we do everything\n169:50: right. And if we are running around in fear\n169:53: and putting out fires and hustle culture and solving the\n169:57: world's problems, but, but creating a horrible life\n170:00: for us, I don't think it's not going to rub off\n170:04: on the good that we're trying to do. Right? Elon Musk,\n170:08: God bless him, he says, like,\n170:12: you don't want to be me, but I'm gonna save humanity by taking us\n170:16: to Mars. You don't want to be me. My life is\n170:19: painful and difficult and hard. I don't want to be me, but I'm going\n170:23: to save everyone by making sure that consciousness survives on Mars. And I don't\n170:27: think that personally, like, like, I Like some of what he\n170:30: does, and it's great. But I do think that,\n170:34: you know, let's get even just practical for one second.\n170:38: If you are following this sense of beauty, you will never\n170:42: forget yourself in the cause of the cause you're working on.\n170:45: Right. You. Insha'Allah. I hope that as you guys are solving these\n170:49: problems and doing this great work, you are putting yourself\n170:53: into that relationship rather than this kind of outside observer\n170:56: being like, okay, here's a system that's broken, and here's how\n171:00: I can intervene and play with it to, as an outside observer,\n171:03: figure out how to make something better in an abstract sense\n171:07: rather than an experience that you, you know, like,\n171:10: let's say Father Greg Boyle is in the cafe and he's seeing\n171:14: some of the prisoners that are his homies, his friends, and they just\n171:17: got their first job and they bring in a cake and they're\n171:21: celebrating, and you're a part of it and you're seeing that and you just love\n171:23: it. And you're like, this is good work. This is my life, you know,\n171:27: and, yeah, I don't know. This is.\n171:30: I don't know if what Nihal expected me to share or why\n171:34: he wanted me to point out this beauty stuff, but I do think it's actually\n171:38: really important for change makers. I'm a part of this thing. Oh, it's f.\n171:42: No, no, absolutely. It's. Even with Noor.\n171:45: Right. And with. There. There is a little bit of\n171:49: intentional beauty in everything that you do, and I think\n171:52: that's important because sometimes we just focus on the function\n171:56: and getting something done. Yeah. But when you add beauty,\n172:00: there's so much invisible values that you add\n172:03: people who've created beauty 200, 300 years ago just with\n172:08: homes, and we're still cherishing it,\n172:11: we're still savoring it. Whereas now,\n172:14: when many of the homes are designed for functionality,\n172:18: it's not something that we remember. It's not.\n172:21: It doesn't bring us solace. So that invisible element is\n172:26: critical as we start to build up projects. It also\n172:29: makes us fall in love with what we're doing a little bit more.\n172:34: Yeah, absolutely. I think you. You brought\n172:38: in the word love, and I'm going to bring in a third word.\n172:41: Can wait. Before I do that, can anyone guess what the third word is going\n172:44: to be? We talked about it a couple times in this talk so far in\n172:47: this session.\n172:51: Beauty. Love. What would a third word that would kind of be friends with\n172:54: all those other words? You can put it in the chat if you're shy.\n172:59: What do we got here? Beauty, contemplation, observation,\n173:03: creativity. Beautiful. Very nice choice.\n173:06: Community. I like that one, too. Anybody else? So we got.\n173:10: We got beauty here, we got love and then something.\n173:15: How would you. How would you add to this trifecta? What would be creativity?\n173:19: I like it.\n173:26: One of my teachers says beauty is\n173:29: this. Oh, okay. Joy. Anybody else\n173:33: I'm liking? We're getting some momentum over here. We got creativity, we got joy,\n173:37: we got beauty, we got love. This sounds like something good.\n173:42: Oh, joy.\n173:46: Boom. That's it. Boom. Double boom.\n173:49: Yes. Close. Boom. Faith is similar. I. I think faith need\n173:53: is connected to truth for me. Awesome. Okay. Lucy and\n173:56: Charity. Absolutely. We talked about truth.\n173:59: We talked about truth here. And we talked about, like, listening to people\n174:03: and hearing their truth. You know, when you say, like, share your truth,\n174:07: right? And you hear someone's truth, you. And this is when they're opening their hearts\n174:11: to you. There's love, there's beauty, there's truth, and they're all\n174:14: connected. One of my teachers says that\n174:18: beauty is the splendor of truth. That kind\n174:21: of. When there is truth and you can see it as truth and accept\n174:25: it as truth, there's beauty there. And so when\n174:29: we are listening to hear people's stories, what else do we say about truth and\n174:32: stories? Where is that quote? We have a nice quote over here.\n174:36: Yeah. The shortest distance between\n174:40: truth and a human being is a story. And shortening\n174:44: a distance is what beauty does because beauty is like a flower. It draws\n174:48: people to it. Right. And that drawing, you can call that love.\n174:51: Right. So there are these relationships between these\n174:55: three things. And I think, however you\n174:59: like, what does it go? It's like there's a. In the\n175:02: Muslim tradition, it's says there's nothing.\n175:06: That gentleness doesn't beautify it.\n175:09: Right. And so how can this\n175:13: be connected to solving this problem, you know,\n175:17: that you want to work on, as we talked about, like, authentic leadership\n175:21: and caring and connecting to the emotion and the feeling and the care that\n175:25: brings people together through love, that helps people see each\n175:29: other through truth. Right. That then when you create\n175:32: the problem, the baby of it has to be beauty.\n175:35: Right? How can it be a beautiful thing?\n175:38: And I think this is a great question. I don't\n175:42: think I have time to go through these alternative,\n175:46: like creativity, like these counterintuitive creativity\n175:49: things. And maybe I don't need to, because sometimes\n175:53: I think it's better to focus on principles and then let people figure\n175:57: out the rest. And I think these three,\n176:01: you know, truth, beauty, and Love as\n176:04: a, you know, I think this\n176:08: is very beautiful. Like, I don't know about you guys, where did I put it?\n176:13: We talked about the eight forms of capital, right? Suddenly one\n176:17: of the things that I think is beautiful is all of these marginalized people are\n176:21: suddenly richer than I am. Right? In experience,\n176:25: like in, in spiritual capital. Of course. Like there's\n176:29: people out there that are probably very impoverished, maybe chosen a life\n176:32: of poverty, but their spiritual capital is vast.\n176:36: And to me, looking at other people through this\n176:40: lens of like, what wealth do I have to benefit\n176:45: from their company? That's a beautiful thing. Thing,\n176:47: right? And maybe hidden\n176:51: underneath a lot of our talk today about care\n176:55: and trying to connect to a true story and love,\n176:59: like the principles have always been there. I could have started my talk\n177:02: and been like, okay, love, beauty and truth, go for it.\n177:06: And it would have taken you maybe a lifetime to,\n177:09: to figure out how these all connect to social enterprises and\n177:13: solving problems and creating solutions for people. But hopefully\n177:17: going through it in these both directions, kind of like going through it\n177:20: through the personal experience of your story,\n177:23: learning about the people's truths, sharing your stories,\n177:27: connecting to the emotions, connecting to the values, and then\n177:31: looking through a different lens at what people have to offer.\n177:35: I hope this like really has shifted some thoughts\n177:39: about. Rather than seeing a problem as some\n177:43: practical like systems think where, I don't\n177:46: know, we're going to create a decentralized autonomous organization and an artificially\n177:50: intelligent, hyper efficient machine that will find the needs\n177:54: and the resources internationally and make sure that\n177:58: the food waste and Europe is, you know,\n178:01: on an underground maglev train\n178:05: to the places that need it so that there's no energy wasted and everyone is\n178:09: fed and everyone is satisfied versus\n178:12: realizing that we have an opportunity to create\n178:18: work of art with our lives connecting with people and creating\n178:21: moments of beauty where you don't want to rush it.\n178:25: If you see a problem and you think of it as a system, you want\n178:28: to go as quickly as possible to the solution. And there's a different way\n178:32: of doing things where you actually want to stay with it your whole life.\n178:35: And I really hope this is the beginning of a lifelong adventure of.\n178:39: We call it social entrepreneurship, call it like a work\n178:43: of art, of a piece of life as a work of art.\n178:47: But I think one of them is\n178:51: a, is a, is a, I don't know, is a label that I'm willing\n178:55: to put on me. And the other one, one is a label that,\n178:58: I don't know, it's just a label. You don't really\n179:01: Understand like what's behind it. It might have the beauty, might have the stories,\n179:05: might have all these other things like social enterprise or you know, impact business\n179:09: or something. But I really encourage you guys to do that because it'll\n179:14: light a fire within you for a life of. Of beauty.\n179:18: And I don't even want to say giving or contribution or solving problems or any\n179:20: of these things because that stuff happens, happens to be beautiful to do.\n179:24: Inshaallah. Okay. And with\n179:28: that, I think I'll leave a couple of moments for,\n179:31: I don't know, maybe just some. Some feedback, some reflection.\n179:35: And tomorrow we're gonna get back\n179:38: into like, let's say we got into this perspective now. We have a different mindset\n179:42: about how we want to move through solving this problem that we're\n179:46: carrying about so deeply. And we're going to go through some\n179:50: design processes and hopefully you'll think of yourselves\n179:54: as creative, as able to come up with a hundred ideas or not or\n179:58: set some limits and bounds and to. To do that in service\n180:01: of something that is worth being in service to truth,\n180:05: beauty and love. Inshaallah. So yeah,\n180:08: with that my. My main session is over. We're going to shift into\n180:12: the designy part tomorrow really\n180:15: hopefully staying true to our principles today.\n180:18: And I'm open for last few questions\n180:23: or comments or I want to hear other people talk instead of me.\n180:34: Thank you Bulbul. And I really appreciate the session\n180:37: today. It was very important, informative. I'm very\n180:41: happy to. To learn the last bit of it which is beauty,\n180:45: truth and what was the\n180:48: other one? I think I'm forgetting it, but I have it. The thing that draws\n180:51: you to beauty is love. Yes, love.\n180:55: Truth is when working on my project, I've always wanted to design\n180:59: it so beautiful that it draws people to it. The people may\n181:02: be using it in future. I did not know that it a component that's important\n181:06: in. In building a venture. And I really appreciate\n181:10: this last bit and also I'm happy to say that the session\n181:13: was really engaging, very informative and really fun. Thank you\n181:17: so much. See you tomorrow. Inshah. Y. Thanks Zach.\n181:27: Yo. Let's follow Ricardo. You can go by your nickname too.\n181:32: I'm sorry? You can go by your nickname too. I don't remember your nickname.\n181:35: Oh no, my. My father used to call me Changoleon, but I've\n181:39: had no nickname since I was six, so. Exactly.\n181:42: So Changa. Changoleon. Yeah,\n181:45: let me write it down.\n181:52: Like monkey lion in Spanish.\n181:55: I used to play trees and climb everywhere\n182:00: while I was younger. Just wanted to\n182:03: thank you. I think I got a lot of useful tools that\n182:07: I actually right now I'm building my business plan to go ask\n182:11: for a credit for my project. So I think I can get a\n182:15: lot of insight, a lot of useful insights\n182:20: from what I've got here and I'm really excited to see what\n182:24: I'll get tomorrow. Thank you very much.\n182:33: Glad it felt like a holiday, little mini\n182:36: holiday. Tell people it was fun. For the people that didn't show\n182:40: up and they were like, who is this guy? What is this?\n182:48: Okay, great. If you have the forum or a\n182:52: place to share some of these things really we learn through each other's eyes\n182:56: and I will learn from you. So tomorrow, you know, maybe I'll\n183:00: open up. Feel free actually. Yeah.\n183:03: What did you learn? What like what was an\n183:06: aha moment or a surprise or something insightful and\n183:10: what are you going to do about it? You know that\n183:13: could be your assignment. You can reflect\n183:18: and I will ask you tomorrow. Like I did a lot\n183:22: today. So for those who were in places with poor\n183:25: wi fi or on your phones, please be on your laptops. I'll try to make\n183:29: it as fun as possible for you and be prepared to participate. And I'm\n183:33: going to ask you for your reflections because that's how I learn. Otherwise,\n183:36: what did I get out of it? I just heard myself talk for three hours.\n183:41: So yeah, please.\n183:52: You could also offer constructive criticism. You can be like beauty,\n183:55: love and truth. I thought we were going to make stuff.\n184:06: Okay, any last words? Any less\n184:09: typing?\n184:13: Go ahead, Alexander. No, just in the\n184:16: last thing you said about like the criticism you\n184:20: say ah, I thought we're gonna make stuff. I mean of course it's\n184:23: like super important and sometimes I'm also thinking I would like to hear more practical\n184:27: things. But at the end all of these lessons also\n184:31: what you speak about, beauty, love and truth or\n184:35: like this feeling LED approach. I think it's\n184:40: so much so important especially at the beginning because this creates like\n184:43: the real base from which you will take\n184:48: all the energy and all the guidance. So sometimes\n184:52: we want to jump directly into like ah, this product. I want to do\n184:56: this, this and this. But as we often say it's\n184:59: more the problem and not a solution. And that's why I\n185:02: really enjoy these sessions as well. And I think they're,\n185:05: they're so important and for me just to say it already taking\n185:09: bit of headphones. Like my aha moment was just again the focus on the\n185:13: feelings. I also wrote myself down. Focus on the\n185:17: feelings. Yeah,\n185:20: that's my final point.\n185:24: Beautiful. Yeah. Your feelings are\n185:28: deeply connected to your values. It's the, it's the door to\n185:31: knowing yourself. So I think it's really, really wonderful that you\n185:34: wrote that down.\n185:41: You know, Listen, can't wait as well. Lucy. Tomorrow.\n185:44: See you. All right, one, two, team. Let Bilal go eat. I haven't\n185:48: eaten all day.\n185:53: I like this idea of the nicknames. I don't know how it came up,\n185:55: but. But it's pretty cute. And maybe,\n185:59: I don't know if we have like a forum or something like that. We just\n186:02: share the little story like the monkey lion about and\n186:06: we get to like learn a little bit about each other. Bulbul also\n186:09: means bird. My dad used to call me that when I was a kid.\n186:13: You know, in Arab families at least like parents always have pet\n186:17: names for their kids. So yeah,\n186:20: let's learn about each other because when we do that, then we see each other,\n186:24: we see each other's truths, we can love each other and then this is where,\n186:28: insha'allah, the community of support comes in.\n186:31: And we can really benefit from all of the different kinds of capital,\n186:35: wealth, knowledge, support.\n186:38: So yeah, let's come\n186:42: back tomorrow and move from these\n186:46: feelings and think about how to. To stay true to these\n186:49: principles and to this way of doing things, but move into a\n186:53: more action oriented process that lets\n186:57: you, I guess the word is operationalize what\n187:00: we started with today. Inshaallah. And to turn it into\n187:04: a thing to be able to share then with others if\n187:08: you feel. But you never speak, you never output. No one can\n187:12: know. So you can care about a problem, but there\n187:15: needs to be an output to too. Inshallah. Yallah guys,\n187:19: big hugs. I know for some people. Super late. Nihal. You're like,\n187:22: you've missed dinner and Isha and who knows what else. So thank you\n187:26: everybody and I'll see you tomorrow. Inshallah.\n187:32: Tomorrow. Thank you so much for participating with all your heart. And thank\n187:36: you so much, Bilal, for all your energy and love. I can't wait\n187:40: for tomorrow. Bye. Goodbye.\n187:45: Recording stopped. What's your nickname?\n187:48: Nihal Nahul. What do you call yourself?\n187:54: What? Sunny. Sunny?\n187:57: Really? And Joyce.\n188:02: Well, between Nihal and I am J. Lo and\n188:07: JLo and Lilo ni Hao. If we ever have a rap band, this is\n188:11: it. But my family calls me Nyung Nyong.\n188:14: Nyongyung. That's cute.\n188:18: The Chinese. Chinese for cheetah.\n188:21: Cheetah like cheetah as\n188:24: in like girls. Oh, okay. I thought it was cheetah. I was like,\n188:27: wondering, how fast are you? I was pretty\n188:31: fast. Oh, yeah. Not to that level. And Sunny.\n188:36: Yeah. What? Sunny. Apparently I have a\n188:40: vibe.\n188:43: That's great. That's great, Nilam.\n188:48: Well, unfortunately, I don't have any nickname since.\n188:51: Since your name is so cute as it is.\n188:55: Okay, thank you. Yeah.\n188:59: Okay, so we got Mo,\n189:02: Nyasha, Sunny as well. Sunny. Another Sunny.\n189:06: No, Sunny was the first project scene. Okay. Okay.\n189:10: Nyasha. Nyasha is also pretty cute. Doesn't need to be\n189:14: shortened or anything.\n189:18: Okay, Yellow guys. Oh, Bill was. What was\n189:21: Bill. Okay, Nyasha. What was your nickname, kid? Curious if\n189:24: you had one.\n189:28: I had many. The one that I had mentioned today\n189:32: was Salad. They used to call me the Salad Girl because.\n189:36: Yeah. For some reason, I'm always chewing, but I never\n189:40: grow and I never actually eat real food.\n189:43: Yeah, I love that. That's interesting.\n189:47: And I remember, Bill, you are young money, or. Who was\n189:51: Young Money? Young Money was some. Somebody else.\n189:56: Feed a child in Africa was the title.\n190:03: Yeah. Bill was Robot. Robot. I forget.\n190:08: Somebody was like, robot or something. All right.\n190:11: Lucy's still here. She's just, like, fascinated. She's like, what's going on? What are\n190:15: they gonna say? I can't possibly leave. I really.\n190:18: I really like the nicknames. I'm just laughing.\n190:21: Yeah. Yeah. Did we get yours? Did I forget it? Yeah,\n190:25: it's Parker. Parker. Oh, yeah. You're Parker.\n190:28: Okay. Next time, I'm gonna see you in your Spidey suit, all right?\n190:33: Yeah. What else could you do? What was. Superpowers. Really strong\n190:37: webs. Spidey sense. It's good\n190:40: enough. Nice hat.\n190:44: All right, guys, I'm actually going to go now. Bismillah.\n190:47: It was great. And I'll talk to you soon. Bye."

But, we hope to be able to improve their processes. \n\nCity Growers\nOver the past month, we’ve been working with local community organizers - City Growers to try to solve some of the problems they face in urban farming in Boston. City Growers is a great organization that works to convert unused lots into urban farms in order to grow local, nutritious food for the community.\n\nCity Growers’ mission is to transform vacant lots in Boston into intensive urban farms that are economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe combine the resources of community organizations, neighborhood associations and local markets for fresh produce to accomplish our major goals:\nCreating employment for community members at livable wages\nAddressing food security issues by increasing local agricultural production capacity\nIncreasing local access to affordable, nutrient-rich foods\nCity Growers is contributing to the new green economy in communities where economic revitalization is needed most.  In the coming years, we will create a checkerboard of productive green space in Boston’s inner city (more than twenty acres of 1/4 to 1-acre lots) where local growing talent thrives.\n\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\nSome of the challenges they presented were:\ndecreasing time spent on weeding\nreducing costs associated with seedlings\nincreasing crop yields\nimproving efficiency of wash station\nincreasing compost (access)\n\nThe ideas/desires Bobby and Nataka voiced included: \nGreenhouse \nBetter wash station\nImproved watering systems (appropriate for different vegetables, convenient)\nTools/devices to make composting, harvesting and weeding easier\nBike/harvesting/mobile farm stand\nVirtual farm tour\n\n\nProblem Framing\nUltimately, we prioritized three potential problems: \n\nDecreasing weeds\nImproving watering systems\nImproving washing stations\n\nIn further conversations with City Growers, we realized that the biggest problem, by a significant margin, was weed control. Out of this, our problem statement was born:  \n\nHow can we decrease the time spent weeding? \n\n\n\nOnce we arrived at the problem statement, we spent some time brainstorming methods of overcoming this - including whether a solution needed to focus more on preventing the growth of weeds or improving the weed removal process. After proposing a few ideas and talking with Bobby, we learned more about City Growers’ current process. They remove weeds manually and with hand tools. This process is slow and time-consuming. However, because the farm plots are so small (around ¼ acre, roughly twice the size of a basketball court), it is often easier to do things by hand than with machines.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the commercially available hand tools are not optimal for their processes. Ideally, they would have some double-headed tools and/or interchangeable tools to make the weeding process easier.  \n\nThrough discussions with City Growers, we realized that a potential solution is to design a workshop for the associated Urban Farming Institute program to teach urban farmers how to make their own tools. Such a workshop will not only allow for farmers to obtain customized tools but will also empower and provide these small scale farmers with skills to later prototype and build their own equipment. \n\nThese tools will address each of the following problems:\n\nErgonomics - Existing commercially available tools are fairly standard in size. As a result, they may not be optimal in weight, height, or shape/angle of the tool for best maneuverability.\nCustomizability - Small scale farmers often have limited land space, so crops are planted in very close proximity. As a result, many of the commercially available weeding tools are too large for their needs (they’re too large to fit between individual seedlings or rows). Additionally, they lack modularity. Farmers can potentially also innovate new designs for more rapid/efficient work. \nEconomics - A big factor for small scale farms is cost. The operating budget is relatively small, so any achievable savings will help. City Growers currently has fewer tools than they have workers, and more specialized tools can be expensive if purchased from a distributor\n\n\nInitial Ideas\nHandle\nAttachment Point\nHead\nWe first focused on interchangeable attachment points.  The advantages of having tools that are easily attached to and detached from their handles are (a) workers who are using multiple tools have less to carry around, and (b) each worker can use a handle length that’s appropriate for his/her needs.  We prototyped 4 models: \nScrew\nClamp\nPin\nSpring-tensioned\n\n\n\n\nUser Feedback\nAfter receiving feedback in favor of the pin option from Bobby and Trist, we narrowed our focus to the pin design and improving its usability. \n\nAdditionally, we did some cardboard prototyping with Bobby and Trist to create tool-heads. Four different tools were designed:\nNarrow Action Hoe\nDouble-headed Common Hoe and Cultivator\nDouble-headed Collinear Hoe and Spade\nSeeding Plate\n\n\nPrototyping\n\ninstagram.com/p/smaAQugnGN/\nWhat did you observe in Tainan Fablab workshops?\nI was a little nervous to start with Design Thinking as the topic. Because some people said that compared to Design Thinking, technical practice may be more attractive. But after the beginning of the course, I found that students can understand the importance of the reason behind a creation, and try to improve social problems through their works. I saw teams who are very creative and artistic, including a group called “Soul Box\"（魂 Box）. They noticed the low-wage issues of Taiwan and created a pressure relief mask. Users can enjoy screaming to release the pressure with head buried inside. The work is not just an idea, but also an observation of society. By the way, we did yoga before the start of the workshop. Perhaps it is nothing to do with their work, but everyone was very involved.\n\n\nTell your story.\u000bWhose problem are you solving.

City Growers is a great organization that works to convert unused lots into urban farms in order to grow local, nutritious food for the community.\n\nAs you might imagine, small scale farming can be quite challenging in Boston where land is expensive, many restrictions are in place, and winters are harsh. But, we hope to be able to improve their processes. \n\nWhat’s the big idea? How does this lead to design?\nUnderstand prototyping as a collaborative, inclusive process\nBuild empathy by sharing challenges and solutions from your community.\nPractice the Design Thinking process as a tool for community innovation.\n\nAlbert Einstein\nThe Problem\nIf I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.\n\nSteve Jobs\nIf you define the problem correctly, you almost have the solution.\n\nBreakouts\nGo into your breakouts and find a story that moves you that shares the people you’re designing for’s biggest challenge\n\nWhat is marginalization?\u000bWhat are our resources?\n\n\nHow can we get out of our problem and solution\nSource: \n\nPreview\n\nSome Counter-Intuitive Creativity Principles Introduction\nDo Nothing\nThe Problem is the Solution\nBiomimicry\nSeek Beauty\nSource: \n\nProblem and problem holder.

Because some people said that compared to Design Thinking, technical practice may be more attractive. But after the beginning of the course, I found that students can understand the importance of the reason behind a creation, and try to improve social problems through their works. I saw teams who are very creative and artistic, including a group called “Soul Box\"（魂 Box）. They noticed the low-wage issues of Taiwan and created a pressure relief mask. Users can enjoy screaming to release the pressure with head buried inside. The work is not just an idea, but also an observation of society. By the way, we did yoga before the start of the workshop. Perhaps it is nothing to do with their work, but everyone was very involved.\n\n\nDesign Thinking\nA few key principals:\nDiverge \n(lots of ideas!)\nConverge \n(test those ideas with your stakeholder!)\nThink with your hands\nUnderstand problem before you solve it\nRole play  / “Empathy”\nDiverse Teams\nHaving a process frees the mind to be creative (constraints)\nRole of space in design\n\n\nDesign Thinking Games / Ice breakers!\n30 Circles\nFridge\nBear VS Lion\n10 Ideas 2 min challenge\n\nDesign Thinking\nLet’s go through the whole process right now :)\n\n1. 4 min Each - Get Story!\nInterview partner, start with idea or theme.

City Growers is a great organization that works to convert unused lots into urban farms in order to grow local, nutritious food for the community.\n\nCity Growers’ mission is to transform vacant lots in Boston into intensive urban farms that are economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe combine the resources of community organizations, neighborhood associations and local markets for fresh produce to accomplish our major goals:\nCreating employment for community members at livable wages\nAddressing food security issues by increasing local agricultural production capacity\nIncreasing local access to affordable, nutrient-rich foods\nCity Growers is contributing to the new green economy in communities where economic revitalization is needed most.  In the coming years, we will create a checkerboard of productive green space in Boston’s inner city (more than twenty acres of 1/4 to 1-acre lots) where local growing talent thrives.\n\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\nSome of the challenges they presented were:\ndecreasing time spent on weeding\nreducing costs associated with seedlings\nincreasing crop yields\nimproving efficiency of wash station\nincreasing compost (access)\n\nThe ideas/desires Bobby and Nataka voiced included: \nGreenhouse \nBetter wash station\nImproved watering systems (appropriate for different vegetables, convenient)\nTools/devices to make composting, harvesting and weeding easier\nBike/harvesting/mobile farm stand\nVirtual farm tour\n\n\nProblem Framing\nUltimately, we prioritized three potential problems: \n\nDecreasing weeds\nImproving watering systems\nImproving washing stations\n\nIn further conversations with City Growers, we realized that the biggest problem, by a significant margin, was weed control. Out of this, our problem statement was born:  \n\nHow can we decrease the time spent weeding? \n\n\n\nOnce we arrived at the problem statement, we spent some time brainstorming methods of overcoming this - including whether a solution needed to focus more on preventing the growth of weeds or improving the weed removal process. After proposing a few ideas and talking with Bobby, we learned more about City Growers’ current process. They remove weeds manually and with hand tools. This process is slow and time-consuming. However, because the farm plots are so small (around ¼ acre, roughly twice the size of a basketball court), it is often easier to do things by hand than with machines.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the commercially available hand tools are not optimal for their processes. Ideally, they would have some double-headed tools and/or interchangeable tools to make the weeding process easier.  \n\nThrough discussions with City Growers, we realized that a potential solution is to design a workshop for the associated Urban Farming Institute program to teach urban farmers how to make their own tools. Such a workshop will not only allow for farmers to obtain customized tools but will also empower and provide these small scale farmers with skills to later prototype and build their own equipment. \n\nThese tools will address each of the following problems:\n\nErgonomics - Existing commercially available tools are fairly standard in size. As a result, they may not be optimal in weight, height, or shape/angle of the tool for best maneuverability.\nCustomizability - Small scale farmers often have limited land space, so crops are planted in very close proximity. As a result, many of the commercially available weeding tools are too large for their needs (they’re too large to fit between individual seedlings or rows). Additionally, they lack modularity. Farmers can potentially also innovate new designs for more rapid/efficient work. \nEconomics - A big factor for small scale farms is cost. The operating budget is relatively small, so any achievable savings will help. City Growers currently has fewer tools than they have workers, and more specialized tools can be expensive if purchased from a distributor\n\n\nInitial Ideas\nHandle\nAttachment Point\nHead\nWe first focused on interchangeable attachment points.  The advantages of having tools that are easily attached to and detached from their handles are (a) workers who are using multiple tools have less to carry around, and (b) each worker can use a handle length that’s appropriate for his/her needs.  We prototyped 4 models: \nScrew\nClamp\nPin\nSpring-tensioned\n\n\n\n\nUser Feedback\nAfter receiving feedback in favor of the pin option from Bobby and Trist, we narrowed our focus to the pin design and improving its usability. \n\nAdditionally, we did some cardboard prototyping with Bobby and Trist to create tool-heads. Four different tools were designed:\nNarrow Action Hoe\nDouble-headed Common Hoe and Cultivator\nDouble-headed Collinear Hoe and Spade\nSeeding Plate\n\n\nPrototyping\n\ninstagram.com/p/smaAQugnGN/\nWhat did you observe in Tainan Fablab workshops?\nI was a little nervous to start with Design Thinking as the topic. Because some people said that compared to Design Thinking, technical practice may be more attractive. But after the beginning of the course, I found that students can understand the importance of the reason behind a creation, and try to improve social problems through their works. I saw teams who are very creative and artistic, including a group called “Soul Box\"（魂 Box）. They noticed the low-wage issues of Taiwan and created a pressure relief mask. Users can enjoy screaming to release the pressure with head buried inside. The work is not just an idea, but also an observation of society. By the way, we did yoga before the start of the workshop. Perhaps it is nothing to do with their work, but everyone was very involved.\n\n\nTell your story.\u000bWhose problem are you solving.

Because some people said that compared to Design Thinking, technical practice may be more attractive. But after the beginning of the course, I found that students can understand the importance of the reason behind a creation, and try to improve social problems through their works. I saw teams who are very creative and artistic, including a group called “Soul Box\"（魂 Box）. They noticed the low-wage issues of Taiwan and created a pressure relief mask. Users can enjoy screaming to release the pressure with head buried inside. The work is not just an idea, but also an observation of society. By the way, we did yoga before the start of the workshop. Perhaps it is nothing to do with their work, but everyone was very involved.\n\n\nDesign Thinking\nA few key principals:\nDiverge \n(lots of ideas!)\nConverge \n(test those ideas with your stakeholder!)\nThink with your hands\nUnderstand problem before you solve it\nRole play  / “Empathy”\nDiverse Teams\nHaving a process frees the mind to be creative (constraints)\nRole of space in design\n\n\nDesign Thinking Games / Ice breakers!\n30 Circles\nFridge\nBear VS Lion\n10 Ideas 2 min challenge\n\nDesign Thinking\nLet’s go through the whole process right now :)\n\n1. 4 min Each - Get Story!\nInterview partner, start with idea or theme.

Give everyone paper and drawing tools\n2. Step 1 (2 mins): \"Draw a house quickly\"\n3. Step 2 (3 mins): \"Now draw a house without lifting your pen from the paper\"\n4. Step 3 (5 mins): \"Draw a house that expresses joy\"\n5. Share in pairs (5 mins)\n6. Group reflection (5 mins):\n- How did constraints change your creativity?\n- What happened when emotion entered the process?\n\n### Design Thinking Core (45 mins)\n\n#### From Stories to Solutions Framework\nShow participant insight: \"I think working with marginalized communities can sometimes turn the usual challenges of prototyping exponential, you may meet more resistance, or realize there are more factors you weren't able to see at first\"\n\nPresent three approaches:\n1. Beauty as Solution\n2. Problem as Solution  \n3. Minimal Intervention\n\n#### Interactive Exercise: Solution Mapping (30 mins)\nHave groups map their challenge across different capital types shared yesterday:\n- Social Capital\n- Cultural Capital\n- Experiential Capital \n- Spiritual Capital\n- Intellectual Capital\n\n### Prototyping Session (45 mins)\n\n#### Quick Visualization Rules\n1. No words allowed - only drawings\n2. 2 minutes per sketch\n3. Quantity over quality\n4. Build on others' ideas\n\n#### Breakout Process\n1. Share challenge (2 mins each)\n2. Silent sketching round (5 mins)\n3. Present sketches without speaking (2 mins each)\n4. Group builds on favorite elements (10 mins)\n5. Rapid prototype with available materials (15 mins)\n\n### Closing Integration (30 mins)\n\n#### Gallery Walk (15 mins)\n- Post prototypes \n- Silent observation\n- Written feedback\n\n#### Final Reflection (15 mins)\nPrompt with Day 1 quote: \"Don't ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive\"\n- What makes your prototype come alive?\n- What truth does it serve?\n- What beauty does it hold?\n\n### Facilitation Notes\n- Keep energy high with movement between sections\n- Use music during transitions\n- Make space for laughter and play\n- Connect everything back to Day 1 principles\n- Watch for signs of judgment or self-consciousness\n- Help participants trust the process\n",

The creative side works best when there's no limit to how much it can explore\" - Deborah\n\n> \"The first one was more like thinking smart like a 'grown-up', the second was like go wild and I was just laughing while doing it\" - Georgina\n\n#### On Connection:\n> \"I am because we are\" - Zak-Zacharia\n\n#### On Community:\n> \"Creating different narratives from the same story depending on who you want to engage with\" - Ricardo\n\n### Your Forms of Capital\n\nYou shared these as your strongest currencies:\n- Social Capital\n- Experiential Capital\n- Cultural Capital\n- Intellectual Capital\n- Spiritual Capital\n\n## Today's Journey: From Stories to Solutions\n\n### Our Guiding Principles\nBeauty → Truth → Love\n\nAs you noted:\n> \"Experiencing the problem yourself is so important\" - Rosemary\n\n### Design Process \nBuilding on your insight:\n> \"Less creativity because we are taught something has a specific use so we dont think about it more\" - Georgina\n\nToday we'll:\n1. Draw to unlock creativity\n2. Map multiple solutions\n3. Prototype with joy\n\n### Remember:\n> \"When I look at the title of the workshop, I think of prototyping in a community having people that are kinda limited in terms of access to technology, water, electricity, and other services\" - Nabatanzi\n\nThis reminds us to:\n- Stay humble\n- Listen deeply\n- Think broadly\n- Act with care\n\n### Let's Begin!\n\"Letting go of what you know so that you can listen enough before understanding how things can be different.\"",

City Growers is a great organization that works to convert unused lots into urban farms in order to grow local, nutritious food for the community.\n\nCity Growers’ mission is to transform vacant lots in Boston into intensive urban farms that are economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe combine the resources of community organizations, neighborhood associations and local markets for fresh produce to accomplish our major goals:\nCreating employment for community members at livable wages\nAddressing food security issues by increasing local agricultural production capacity\nIncreasing local access to affordable, nutrient-rich foods\nCity Growers is contributing to the new green economy in communities where economic revitalization is needed most.  In the coming years, we will create a checkerboard of productive green space in Boston’s inner city (more than twenty acres of 1/4 to 1-acre lots) where local growing talent thrives.\n\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\nSome of the challenges they presented were:\ndecreasing time spent on weeding\nreducing costs associated with seedlings\nincreasing crop yields\nimproving efficiency of wash station\nincreasing compost (access)\n\nThe ideas/desires Bobby and Nataka voiced included: \nGreenhouse \nBetter wash station\nImproved watering systems (appropriate for different vegetables, convenient)\nTools/devices to make composting, harvesting and weeding easier\nBike/harvesting/mobile farm stand\nVirtual farm tour\n\n\nProblem Framing\nUltimately, we prioritized three potential problems: \n\nDecreasing weeds\nImproving watering systems\nImproving washing stations\n\nIn further conversations with City Growers, we realized that the biggest problem, by a significant margin, was weed control. Out of this, our problem statement was born:  \n\nHow can we decrease the time spent weeding? \n\n\n\nOnce we arrived at the problem statement, we spent some time brainstorming methods of overcoming this - including whether a solution needed to focus more on preventing the growth of weeds or improving the weed removal process. After proposing a few ideas and talking with Bobby, we learned more about City Growers’ current process. They remove weeds manually and with hand tools. This process is slow and time-consuming. However, because the farm plots are so small (around ¼ acre, roughly twice the size of a basketball court), it is often easier to do things by hand than with machines.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the commercially available hand tools are not optimal for their processes. Ideally, they would have some double-headed tools and/or interchangeable tools to make the weeding process easier.  \n\nThrough discussions with City Growers, we realized that a potential solution is to design a workshop for the associated Urban Farming Institute program to teach urban farmers how to make their own tools. Such a workshop will not only allow for farmers to obtain customized tools but will also empower and provide these small scale farmers with skills to later prototype and build their own equipment. \n\nThese tools will address each of the following problems:\n\nErgonomics - Existing commercially available tools are fairly standard in size. As a result, they may not be optimal in weight, height, or shape/angle of the tool for best maneuverability.\nCustomizability - Small scale farmers often have limited land space, so crops are planted in very close proximity. As a result, many of the commercially available weeding tools are too large for their needs (they’re too large to fit between individual seedlings or rows). Additionally, they lack modularity. Farmers can potentially also innovate new designs for more rapid/efficient work. \nEconomics - A big factor for small scale farms is cost. The operating budget is relatively small, so any achievable savings will help. City Growers currently has fewer tools than they have workers, and more specialized tools can be expensive if purchased from a distributor\n\n\nInitial Ideas\nHandle\nAttachment Point\nHead\nWe first focused on interchangeable attachment points.  The advantages of having tools that are easily attached to and detached from their handles are (a) workers who are using multiple tools have less to carry around, and (b) each worker can use a handle length that’s appropriate for his/her needs.  We prototyped 4 models: \nScrew\nClamp\nPin\nSpring-tensioned\n\n\n\n\nUser Feedback\nAfter receiving feedback in favor of the pin option from Bobby and Trist, we narrowed our focus to the pin design and improving its usability. \n\nAdditionally, we did some cardboard prototyping with Bobby and Trist to create tool-heads. Four different tools were designed:\nNarrow Action Hoe\nDouble-headed Common Hoe and Cultivator\nDouble-headed Collinear Hoe and Spade\nSeeding Plate\n\n\nPrototyping\n\ninstagram.com/p/smaAQugnGN/\nWhat did you observe in Tainan Fablab workshops?\nI was a little nervous to start with Design Thinking as the topic. Because some people said that compared to Design Thinking, technical practice may be more attractive. But after the beginning of the course, I found that students can understand the importance of the reason behind a creation, and try to improve social problems through their works. I saw teams who are very creative and artistic, including a group called “Soul Box\"（魂 Box）. They noticed the low-wage issues of Taiwan and created a pressure relief mask. Users can enjoy screaming to release the pressure with head buried inside. The work is not just an idea, but also an observation of society. By the way, we did yoga before the start of the workshop. Perhaps it is nothing to do with their work, but everyone was very involved.\n\n\nTell your story.\u000bWhose problem are you solving.

            "extracted_content": "Below is a guide to updating your Day 2 workshop slides and facilitation approach. This incorporates insights from the meeting chat, participant responses, memorable quotes, and lessons learned from Day 1. At the end, you’ll see a slide-by-slide suggestion for how to refine your current slides with better pacing, more integration of the 8 forms of capital, pithy quotes, breakout sessions, and considerations for both idea-stage and revenue-generating participants.\n\nKey Themes from the Chat & Session Feedback:\n\nEmotional Resonance & Simplicity: Participants loved the exercises that helped them relax, laugh, and let go of preconceived notions. The paperclip and fridge test were hits—keep them and highlight them as creativity warm-ups.\nQuotes as Anchors: Attendees reacted positively to quotes like “The shortest distance between truth and a human being is a story” and “Don’t ask what the world needs...”. Integrating these quotes more consistently at transitions will keep the energy and provide memorable takeaways.\n8 Forms of Capital & Community Wisdom: Participants liked the idea of looking beyond financial capital. Incorporate prompts that explicitly ask them which forms of capital their solution leverages.\nDifferentiated Approach for Idea-Stage vs. Revenue-Stage: Some participants are just ideating, others already have prototypes or revenue. Offer track options or prompts for each stage so everyone feels included.\nMore Breakouts & Peer Feedback: Participants enjoyed breakouts. Add short, focused breakouts after introducing new concepts to let them apply ideas immediately.\nJoy, Fun & Constraints: The chat showed participants appreciating the humor and playful mindset. Keep the playful constraints (e.g., setting boundaries for creativity exercises) and encourage laughter and openness.\nInspiration from the Chat: “I am because we are,” “Local action for global cause,” “We become scared to expand our thoughts in fear of being judged,” are participant-generated insights that can become embedded “community quotes” in your slides.\nWhere Facilitation Fell Flat and How to Improve:\nOver-Explaining vs. Doing: Some segments were heavily instructional. Move quicker into application. After a brief concept intro, send them into breakouts to discuss and apply.\nNot Explicitly Mentioning the Forms of Capital in Activities: You introduced valuable concepts on Day 1, but Day 2’s slides can make references more explicit. For example, when introducing HMW questions, prompt participants to pick which forms of capital their idea uses.\nStoryboard vs. Digital Tools: The original storyboard might not translate well on Zoom. Replace it with a shared Google Doc/Jamboard user journey map. Clearly guide them through using these tools.\nCatering to Mixed Stages: Some participants are at the idea stage, others have revenue. Offer parallel prompts: one slide for idea-stage (e.g., “Define your problem and forms of capital”) and one for revenue-stage (e.g., “Refine your model by adding new forms of capital”).\nWhere Facilitation Was Great and How to Highlight It:\nQuotes & Emotional Hooks: Keep using quotes at transitions. Slides that start a new section should have a relevant, punchy quote.\nInvolving the Participants’ Voices: You did well asking participants for feedback and stories. On Day 2, explicitly reference “As someone said yesterday…” using a snippet from the chat (e.g., “One participant said: ‘We become scared to expand our thoughts in fear of being judged.’ Today we’ll break that fear with structured creativity!”).\nPlayful Exercises (Paperclip, Fridge Test): These were well-received. Keep them and add a brief slide before starting them to frame why these exercises help.\nAcknowledge Cultural References & Nicknames: Participants enjoyed nicknames and personal anecdotes. Include a slide early on Day 2 celebrating community quirks (“We have Parker, Salad, Mango, Young Money, Changoleon... Remember that creativity emerges when we embrace our uniqueness!”).\nRevised Day 2 Structure with Slide-by-Slide Suggestions:\nSlide 1: Day 2 Title Slide\n\nTitle: “Day 2: Turning Insights into Action”\nSubtitle: “From Stories & Values to Prototypes & Community-Driven Solutions”\nAdd a quote: “Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.”\nNote to self: Acknowledge yesterday’s energy and remind them of today’s goal: practical prototypes guided by values and the forms of capital.\nSlide 2: Recap & Anchor Quote\n\nShow an impactful quote participants loved: “Don’t ask what the world needs… ask what makes you come alive.” – Howard Thurman.\nBriefly mention Day 1 highlights: Stories, Values, Multiple Forms of Capital, Counterintuitive Principles.\nAcknowledge participants’ enthusiasm: “As someone said yesterday, ‘I sense many collaborations after this!’ Let’s build on that energy.”\nSlide 3: Integrating the 8 Forms of Capital\n\nAdd a quick definition bullet for each capital.\nInclude a participant’s insight: “We are not impoverished—our wealth lies hidden in forms we have yet to recognize.”\nInstructions: “As you ideate today, pick at least one non-financial form of capital to integrate into your solution.”\nSlide 4: Idea-Stage vs. Revenue-Stage Tracks\n\nTwo columns:\nIdea Stage: “Focus on defining community needs, selecting relevant forms of capital, and generating rough concepts.”\nRevenue Stage: “Focus on improving existing solutions, diversifying the forms of capital leveraged, and refining your value proposition.”\nQuote: “Local action for a global cause.” – from participant chat.\nSlide 5: “How Might We” Questions (HMW)\n\nRemind them: “A good HMW question integrates community values and capital.”\nExample: “How might we reduce water scarcity by leveraging social and experiential capital?”\nBreakout instruction: “In breakouts, share your HMW question and get feedback. Idea-stage: Check if question aligns with community values & capital. Revenue-stage: Check if it expands your current model with new capital.”\nSlide 6: Counterintuitive Creativity Principles\n\nBriefly list: Do Nothing, Problem=Solution, Biomimicry, Seek Beauty\nQuote: “Beauty is the splendor of truth.”\nAfter explaining each principle, run a quick breakout: “Pick one principle and brainstorm how it applies to your HMW question. You have 5 minutes, then we’ll reconvene.”\nSlide 7: Rapid Ideation With Constraints\n\nRemind them of yesterday’s paperclip and fridge tests.\nQuote from participants: “We become scared to expand our thoughts in fear of being judged.”\nInstructions: Give them 5 minutes to write down 5–10 quick solution ideas. Idea-stage: focus on entirely new concepts. Revenue-stage: focus on variations of your current solution tapping into different capitals.\nSlide 8: Visualizing the Journey (Replacing Storyboard)\n\nIntroduce a shared Jamboard/Google Doc template link.\nShow a simple example: “User Journey Map” with steps: Before → Engagement → Outcome.\nQuote: “Think with your hands.” – to emphasize a low-fidelity, rough approach.\nBreakout: Participants create their user journey map in the shared doc for 10 minutes.\nSlide 9: Peer Feedback Session\n\nInstructions: In breakouts, partners view each other’s user journey map and identify where multiple forms of capital appear. Suggest improvements.\nPrompt: “Where can you incorporate spiritual or cultural capital? Where can you do less and achieve more?”\nQuote: “The shortest distance between truth and a human being is a story.” – Use it here to emphasize user journey as a story.\nSlide 10: Refine and Iterate\n\nGive them 5 minutes to iterate after feedback.\nQuote: “I am because we are.” – Remind them community collaboration is key.\nIdea-stage: Add clarity to their concept. Revenue-stage: Add a testable enhancement to their product line.\nSlide 11: Reflection & Next Steps\n\nAsk them to reflect in chat: “Which forms of capital did you highlight? What’s one small test you can run next?”\nShow a quote from participant insights: “Experiencing the problem yourself is so important.”\nEncourage them to plan a quick test or conversation with community members.\nSlide 12: Closing & Encouragement\n\nHighlight a final quote: “We come alive when we create what we truly value.”\nRemind them about tomorrow or next steps (if any).\nEncourage them to share a favorite quote or takeaway in the chat as a last activity.\nAdditional Facilitation Tips\nKeep it Interactive: After every 1–2 slides of theory, involve participants in a quick chat prompt or breakout. The chat proved participants love contributing.\nUse Participant-Generated Insights as Mini-Quotes: Slide transitions can have small text boxes with quotes from participants. For example, near a break, add: “As one participant said: ‘I totally enjoyed the session—it felt like a mini fun holiday!’” to acknowledge their enthusiasm.\nAcknowledge Where Things Fell Flat: If some areas lacked clarity yesterday (e.g., not enough time for feedback), now explicitly state “This time we’ll keep feedback tighter: 5 minutes only, so we can learn by doing.”\nCelebrate Nicknames & Cultural References: Early slide: “We have Parker, Salad, Mango, Changoleon… Let’s keep childlike creativity alive as we build solutions!”\nBy following these revised instructions, you’ll transform your Day 2 slides into a more engaging, participatory, and memorable experience. You’ll incorporate the positive participant feedback, address previous shortcomings, integrate meaningful quotes, and highlight the multiple forms of capital and the unique perspectives that participants bring.\n\n11:28\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nCan you create a few slides integrated with feedback/quotes/insights from the chat and what participants said yesterday. i'd love to show them what they learned through their eyes\n11:29\nChatGPT\n\nThought about sharing participant insights for a couple of seconds\nBelow is a sample set of slides (in text form) that you can integrate into your Day 2 workshop. They showcase participant quotes, insights, and themes from the previous day’s session. The idea is to help participants see that their own words and reflections guided the learning. You can adapt the visual style once you create the actual slides, adding participant names or avatars if appropriate and using branding elements consistent with your presentation.\n\nSlide 1 (Title & Recap)\nTitle: “Reflections from Day 1: In Your Own Words”\nSubtitle: “Insights & Inspiration from Our Shared Experience”\nVisual: A collage of chat bubbles or sticky notes to represent participant voices.\nText: Yesterday, we journeyed together through stories, values, and community strengths. Let’s revisit what we discovered—through your own words and insights.\n\nSlide 2 (Values & Inspiration)\nHeader: “What Makes Us Come Alive”\nQuote: “Don’t ask what the world needs; ask what makes you come alive.” – Howard Thurman (reacted positively by many participants)\nParticipant Reflection:\n\n“The quote on ‘what the world needs is more people who have come alive’ really touched me. It’s what I’ve been seeking.” – Participant from chat\nCallout: You recognized the power of aligning your work with what truly moves you—and learned that communities need you at your most authentic, alive self.\nSlide 3 (Stories & Empathy)\nHeader: “The Power of Storytelling”\nQuotes from Participants:\n\n“Experiencing the problem yourself is so important.”\n“The shortest distance between truth and a human being is a story.” – Anthony de Mello (participants reacted with hearts)\nInsight: You saw how personal stories create empathy and trust, helping you understand real needs. Through your stories, we learned that listening deeply can reveal hidden community resources and values.\nSlide 4 (Creativity & Letting Go)\nHeader: “Embracing Childlike Creativity”\nParticipant Comments:\n\n“We become scared to expand our thoughts in fear of being judged.”\n“Toy, eating instrument, tyre puncher, weapon to fight thugs—We laughed while doing it!” (From the Paperclip & Fridge tests)\nInsight: When you let go of “right and wrong,” you unlocked playful ideation. Constraints and silliness helped you see beyond the obvious. You learned that laughter and openness are keys to deeper creativity.\nSlide 5 (Community & Collaboration)\nHeader: “I Am Because We Are”\nParticipant Voices:\n\n“I sense many collaborations after this!”\n“I am really glad I joined this session.”\n“I am because we are.”\nInsight: You recognized that innovation thrives when we share, connect, and build on each other’s strengths. Collective intelligence (“The smartest person in the room is the room.”) emerged as a core principle for co-creation.\nSlide 6 (Forms of Capital & Resourcefulness)\nHeader: “Discovering Hidden Wealth”\nParticipant Takeaways:\n\n“We are not impoverished—our wealth lies hidden in forms we have yet to recognize.” (Adapted from your discussions)\nMany identified “Intellectual, Social, Experiential” capital as their top three forms of wealth.\nInsight: You learned to see beyond financial resources. Social bonds, cultural heritage, experiences, and creativity are valuable currencies to shape sustainable community-driven solutions.\nSlide 7 (Courage & Iteration)\nHeader: “Listening, Pivoting, and Letting Go”\nParticipant Reflection:\n\n“Letting go of what you know so that you can listen enough before understanding how things can be different.”\n“The only permanent thing in the world is change.” – Participant quoting from the chat\nInsight: You acknowledged cognitive biases (like sunk cost fallacy) and the need to keep listening, testing, and changing course. Courage to adapt emerged as an essential quality in your design journey.\nSlide 8 (Beauty, Truth & Love)\nHeader: “Beauty as a Guiding Principle”\nParticipant Quotes & Reactions:\n\n“Beauty is the splendor of truth.” (Participants showered hearts)\n“We come alive when we create what we truly value.”\nInsight: By seeking beauty—in empathy, simplicity, and nature—you found that truthful and loving interventions can emerge naturally. Design isn’t just about problem-solving; it’s about creating something meaningful and uplifting.\nSlide 9 (Looking Ahead)\nHeader: “Building On Yesterday’s Insights”\nText: Today, we’ll transform these values, stories, and abundant forms of capital into tangible prototypes. Remember the encouragement, playfulness, and wisdom you shared with each other. Your voices will continue to guide us—together, we’ll keep discovering new possibilities.\nFinal Quote on Slide: “I never liked eating but I was always chewing something. I was a sustainable baby.” – A participant’s playful reminder that even our quirks can inspire fresh perspectives!\n\nThese slides use actual participant insights and quotes discovered in the transcript to remind everyone how much they contributed and what they learned as a group. Adjust wording or add participant names if you have permission and feel it would increase authenticity.\n\n11:29\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI like this process can we incorporate it into the activities while still keeping the love truth and beauty principles - also we have a few other principles in the slides I gave you on lenses to look at the challenge and also let’s include looking at the resources available that might not be seen to find ways to incorporate it from the 8 forms of capital. I want to follow a principles approach and do things so they are coherent and organized and easy to remember and easy to do and easy to have lots of feedback. More important than lots of frameworks.\nHere’s the content: the following is a summary of the article “Designing for Growth: A Tool Kit for Managers” that appeared in the Rotman Magazine. the article and the book is authored by  Jeanne Liedtka and Tim Ogilvie.\nthe article explores the key question, what takes a manager to think like a designer. and the answer is, it takes empathy, invention, and iteration.\n\t▪\t#empathy: is outlined as treating customers as real humans with real problems and understanding their needs and wants, at an emotional and rational level.\n\t▪\t#invention: is clarified by examining scientists and designers. while scientists analyze activities of today or past to discover explanations, designers create things for future use.\n\t▪\t#iteration: the path to solution is not a linear process but an iterative one. it involves learning at every step through experimentation to empathize better with the customer.\nthe toolkit, designing for growth, is a simple process that focuses on answering the following 4 questions – what is? what if? what wows? what works? this simple process leads us from defining the problem to achieving the solution. (refer picture below) at every step the “convergent” and “divergent” bands represent expanding the field of vision in the initial stages but narrowing down to most promising options during later stages.\n\n\n￼\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto answer what is, we need to explore current reality. we need to observe/understand current activities to identify problems and to find opportunity for solution. try to find out what customers don’t like about today by using tools such as:\n\t▪\t#1) visualization – identify, organize and communicate with visuals to bring ideas to life. very useful tool across all phases of the process.\n\t▪\t#2) journey mapping – a tool to assess an ideas’ potential for value creation. “follow customers home” to understand their struggles.\n\t▪\t#3) value chain analysis – deep dive into the value chain when this idea will be implemented. it allows us to identify capabilities and resources of the stakeholders, customers, competitors and find/collaborate with the right partner.\n\t▪\t#4) mind-mapping – mine and organize all the information gathered in the research stage to draw insights about qualities of the innovation needed. this helps in generating ideas in the what if stage.\nby answering what if, we get to envision a new future. after identifying emerging patterns, we develop hypotheses about what a future might look like. we transition from data-based exploratory what is phase to creativity focused what if phase. in this phase of ideation, we ignore constraints and explore possibilities by using tools such as:\n\t▪\t#5) brainstorming – allows us to formulate hypotheses about new possibilities. key is not to evaluate and filter out ideas.\n\t▪\t#6) concept development –  organize ideas generated out of brainstorming into coherent clusters, and translate most compelling clusters into concepts\nanswering what wows, leads us to make choices. it helps us to prioritize concepts and figure out what wows. in this phase we are not proving the idea, but assessing how business case might look like by using tools such as :\n\t▪\t#7) assumption testing – evaluating the assumptions underneath the hypotheses. concepts that pass the test, could turn into real experiments in the marketplace.\n\t▪\t#8) rapid prototyping – create visual or experiential prototypes out of concepts, to enable meaningful conversation with all stakeholders and to collect feedback.\nand to establish what works, we take the solution to the market place. it is time to launch and learn. to iterate towards a refined solution by using tools such as:\n\t▪\t#9) customer co-creation – engaging customers in an active and hands-on manner to refine the solution.\n\t▪\t#10) learning-launch – learn by piloting the concepts into the field and identifying disconfirming data that disproves our hypotheses. conduct low cost experiments, with quick iterative cycles.\nabove all, while designing for growth there is bound to be a tension between creating the new and preserving the best of the present. the key is to manage this tension, as we iteratively progress towards the solution.\nCan you update the day two part of our workshop only based kn all the content you have - I want to start as well with a creativity and drawing practice so we get the hang of drawing f and sharing  together as an ice breaker \n11:48\nChatGPT\n\n**Thought about workshop structure and principles** for 8 seconds\nBelow is a revised Day 2 outline integrating the “Designing for Growth” principles (empathy, invention, iteration), the love-truth-beauty lens, the 8 forms of capital, and insights from participants’ previous responses. The goal is to provide a coherent, principles-based approach that is easy to remember, easy to act on, and encourages continuous feedback. We’ll also start with a creativity and drawing practice as an ice breaker.\n\nPrinciples to Reinforce on Day 2:\n\nEmpathy: Treating community members as real people with real needs (aligns with “love” and seeing the truth of their situation).\nInvention: Generating creative possibilities, inspired by “beauty” and using forms of capital to unlock hidden resources.\nIteration: Adopting a non-linear, feedback-driven loop (honoring complexity and remaining faithful to truth as we refine).\n8 Forms of Capital: Recognizing and leveraging non-financial resources to broaden solution sets.\nLove, Truth, Beauty: As an underlying compass guiding each phase, ensuring we design interventions that resonate deeply, reflect reality, and inspire uplift.\nDesigning for Growth 4-Question Cycle as Day 2 Framework:\n\nWhat Is? – Understand current reality with empathy, identify hidden assets (forms of capital), and clarify the challenge.\nWhat If? – Imagine new possibilities (invention), incorporate principles like “problem is the solution” or “seek beauty,” and use multiple forms of capital.\nWhat Wows? – Narrow down ideas to those that align with community values and resources, test assumptions quickly (iteration).\nWhat Works? – Plan small experiments (co-creation, learning launches) for real-world feedback.\nDetailed Day 2 Agenda (2.5–3 hours)\n0:00–0:15 – Warm-Up & Creativity Ice Breaker\n\nPrinciple Emphasis: Start with “Invention” and “Beauty” through a playful lens.\nActivity: Drawing & Sharing:\nGive everyone a simple prompt: “Draw your challenge as a creature and show how it interacts with one form of capital (e.g., social capital as friendly neighbors, cultural capital as stories woven into the creature’s fur).”\nSet a 5-minute timer to doodle. Remind them that rough sketches are perfect; authenticity trumps perfection.\nIn quick breakout pairs (5 mins), share your creature and identify one value or insight.\nPurpose: Loosen up, practice visual thinking (a “what is” visualization tool), connect to creativity, and celebrate the community spirit. This also references the previous day’s feedback where participants enjoyed laughter and childlike creativity.\n0:15–0:35 – Re-Introducing the Principles & Yesterday’s Insights\n\nShow participant quotes from Day 1 that emphasize empathy (“Experiencing the problem yourself is so important”), creativity (“We become scared to expand thoughts in fear of being judged”), and collaboration (“I sense many collaborations after this!”).\nIntroduce the 4-question cycle (What Is → What If → What Wows → What Works) as our Day 2 roadmap.\nConnect empathy (love & truth), invention (beauty), iteration, and the 8 forms of capital.\nHighlight that today we’ll move through these steps quickly, getting feedback at each stage.\n0:35–1:00 – What Is? (Empathy & Understanding Current Reality)\n\nTools: Journey Mapping & Mind-Mapping\nInstructions:\nPick your community challenge from Day 1.\nCreate a quick journey map of a community member experiencing the problem. Identify pain points and note down at least two forms of capital they unknowingly rely on or could tap into (e.g., social support, cultural traditions).\nUse a mind-map to organize your observations: place the challenge at the center, branch out to issues, emotions, and available capitals.\nBreakout (5–7 mins): Share your journey map with a small group and gather quick feedback. Ask: “What hidden capital did I miss? Which emotion should I focus on more?”\nReflection: Participants realize that looking closely (love, truth) at the present uncovers opportunities.\n1:00–1:30 – What If? (Invention & Expanding Possibilities)\n\nPrinciples: Embrace “Do Nothing,” “Problem=Solution,” or “Seek Beauty” lenses to spark new ideas.\nActivity:\nBrainstorm at least 5 bold “What If” scenarios without constraints. For each scenario, note which form(s) of capital you’re using. For example: “What if we turn waste into building materials?” (Problem=Solution + material capital).\nUse a quick concept development step: cluster similar ideas and pick one concept that feels most beautiful, truthful, and loving to the community.\nBreakout (5–7 mins): Show your concept to a partner. They give one positive reflection and one improvement suggestion focusing on how to better integrate capital or principles (e.g., Could you add spiritual capital by incorporating local rituals? Could doing less achieve more simplicity?).\nReflection: Idea-stage participants develop fresh concepts; revenue-stage participants adapt existing solutions to new capital forms or principles.\n1:30–1:50 – What Wows? (Testing Assumptions & Rapid Feedback)\n\nTools: Assumption Testing & Rapid Prototyping (digital or sketch)\nActivity:\nIdentify the top 2–3 assumptions in your concept. Which must hold true for this to succeed?\nCreate a quick, rough prototype: a simple diagram, a snippet of a user scenario, or a low-fidelity digital mock-up (use Jamboard or Google Docs).\nShare prototype in breakouts (5 mins per concept). Listeners provide quick feedback: “What’s compelling and resonates with our values?”, “Which assumption needs more proof?”\nReflection: Narrow down to one refined concept that feels both imaginative and plausible. Align with forms of capital that make it feasible and beautiful.\n1:50–2:10 – What Works? (Planning Real-World Tests & Iteration)\n\nTools: Customer Co-Creation & Learning Launch Planning\nActivity:\nDesign a small “learning launch” experiment. How can you quickly test this concept in the real world or with a small group of community members?\nIdentify one form of capital you’ll use to facilitate this test (e.g., cultural: host a small community story circle, or social: ask local leaders for quick feedback).\nWrite down 2–3 questions you’ll ask during your mini-pilot and one metric for success.\nBreakout (5 mins): Share your testing plan. Others provide suggestions on making it simpler, more aligned with community reality, and more iterative.\nReflection: Emphasize iteration: “The only permanent thing is change.” Encourage participants to keep refining, using empathy and love as guidance, truth and capital as fuel, and beauty as a goal.\n2:10–2:30 – Wrap-Up & Next Steps\n\nReinforce the idea that this 4-question cycle is iterative. Show a quote from Day 1: “We come alive when we create what we truly value.”\nAsk participants to reflect in chat: “What principle (empathy, invention, iteration, love/truth/beauty, forms of capital) will you carry forward?”\nCongratulate them on turning challenges into prototypes guided by principles and real feedback. Invite them to continue testing and refining beyond the workshop.\nKey Takeaways in the Revised Day 2:\n\nStart with a creativity/drawing ice breaker to embody invention and playfulness.\nProgress through What Is → What If → What Wows → What Works steps, each reinforced by empathy, invention, iteration, love/truth/beauty, and forms of capital.\nKeep activities short, interactive, and feedback-rich. Breakouts after each step ensure continuous peer input.\nIntegrate participant quotes and day one insights to maintain coherence and familiarity.\nConclude with a clear next step for testing and learning in the real world.\nThis revised Day 2 is simpler, principle-driven, interactive, and closely aligned with the “Designing for Growth” framework, enriched by the love-truth-beauty lens and the 8 forms of capital.\n\n11:48\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nMaybe we can do something a little bit different, like the double-diamond approach or something like that. It's a little bit easier in some terms. Like, for example, I'm a bridge diver, and I kind of want to quantify the performance of small crabs to allow them to properly develop their own design thinking framework, and maybe even show them how they can use these techniques that are out there, and how, you know, that's like another one of the challenges of following the framework and thinking about it. And I think it's important to follow frameworks, not only to do things, but also to quantify them. You know, you can do small things, and really, like, one of these principle frameworks, you know, if you love, you don't just build something random, you build something out of care, right? And if you are seeking the truth, this is where we can get to these ideas of, like, what's the real problem here? Where am I really solving this problem? And this idea that there is and validating it for its life and all of that, and all of that comes with the truth. You can do this, you can do that, right? Like, you can equal that, and on top, you can do this, right? That, right? It's the God, experience, knowledge, and you're trying to create, right? And then, you know, like, there are also values, and there are values if and when things are beautiful to you, to others. You know, beauty is also something that saves. We can talk about how, you know, this Paris Burning has this documentary, a story about the German soldier who was ordered to blow up a big portion of Paris, and he just couldn't get himself to do it because it was just so beautiful. And if only we can expand people, people's eyes to see how beautiful nature is, you know, and to, through that, build love, and from love, there's the action, right? The action part of the doing needs some emotion and feeling, and it's sort of unfolds, right? I mean, a lot of the challenges for a lot of the world's problems are often obscurity, in a sense, and it'd be good to share some of these ideas and incorporate them, if you can help me figure out how to do that well and streamline in a smooth way, that would be great. So, bye.\n11:48\nChatGPT\n\n**Thought about integrating frameworks and beauty** for 7 seconds\nBelow is a streamlined approach that integrates the double-diamond design framework with the principles of love, truth, and beauty, as well as references to nature’s richness, the importance of values, and methods for quantifying and validating outcomes. This outline can guide a workshop or a project process. It’s adaptable to many contexts—from helping “small crabs” (a playful metaphor for emerging designers or small initiatives) develop their own design thinking framework, to helping participants understand how love, truth, and beauty fuel meaningful innovation.\n\nCore Idea:\nThe Double Diamond approach has two main phases:\n\nFirst Diamond: Discover and Define the problem (emphasizing love and truth)\nSecond Diamond: Develop and Deliver the solution (emphasizing beauty and validation)\nThroughout, you incorporate frameworks, measure progress, and connect participants emotionally to what they create.\n\nGuiding Principles Integrated Into the Double Diamond\nLove: Start from care and empathy. See the community or the environment as precious and valuable. This principle ensures that we are building from a place of genuine concern for real humans, creatures, and ecosystems—not just abstract users.\n\nTruth: Seek the real underlying problem. Avoid the temptation to jump straight to solutions. Use research, data, and honest observation. Quantify what you can (e.g., measure small indicators of success or the performance of those “small crabs”) and validate assumptions. Truth keeps you anchored in actual needs, constraints, and verifiable outcomes.\n\nBeauty: Aspire to create solutions that aren’t just functional, but also inspiring. Beauty can prevent destruction (as in the story of the soldier who refused to destroy a beautiful city) and motivate preservation. It can spark love and evoke deeper values. Integrate the 8 forms of capital (social, cultural, spiritual, experiential, etc.) to recognize and amplify hidden wealth and potential. Beauty helps participants see solutions as more than transactions—they’re transformations.\n\nDouble Diamond Process with Principles and Examples\nPhase 1: Discover & Define (Emphasizing Love & Truth)\n\nDiscover (Empathy and Exploration):\n\nActivity: Begin by observing the current scenario. For example, if we consider “small crabs” as a metaphor for new projects or budding designers, what are their struggles? Where do they get stuck?\nIncorporate Love: Encourage participants to connect emotionally with the beings or communities they serve. Ask: “What do you love about this ecosystem? What values shine through these stories?”\nIncorporate Truth: Gather data and evidence. Ask participants to quantify a simple metric. For instance, measure how often a certain problem occurs, or track user frustration levels. Also consider mapping resources (8 forms of capital): Which intangible forms of capital are present but underused?\nDefine (Clarifying the Real Problem):\n\nActivity: Synthesize observations into a clear, validated problem statement.\nIncorporate Love: Frame the problem in human, heartfelt terms (“Communities struggle to appreciate the beauty of their environment because they lack a simple way to see its hidden wealth”).\nIncorporate Truth: Test assumptions. Use a simple scorecard or logic check to confirm that what you believe to be the root cause actually aligns with observed data. For instance, if you thought time scarcity was the main issue, verify it by checking schedules or surveys. Narrow down the problem to a challenge that is both meaningful and measurable.\nBy the end of the first diamond, you have a well-defined challenge that resonates emotionally (love) and is grounded in factual understanding (truth).\n\nPhase 2: Develop & Deliver (Emphasizing Beauty & Validation)\n\nDevelop (Invention and Ideation):\n\nActivity: Brainstorm solutions that address the root problem. Consider the principle of “problem is the solution”: can you transform a waste product into a resource? Draw inspiration from nature’s beauty—like the soldier who saved Paris, let the recognition of beauty guide respectful, elegant interventions.\nIncorporate Beauty: Don’t just list features; envision how the solution looks, feels, and even sounds. Consider minimal intervention (“do nothing”) or use biomimicry—how would nature solve this? Introduce the 8 forms of capital here: can cultural capital (local stories, traditions) inspire a more meaningful solution?\nAdd Quantification and Validation: From each idea, pick a few indicators you could measure later. For example, if the solution is an educational tool, how will you measure understanding or appreciation afterward?\nDeliver (Prototyping, Testing, Iteration):\n\nActivity: Rapidly prototype one or two promising ideas. These can be simple sketches, role-plays, or quick digital mocks. Involve the community or the “small crabs” themselves in quick tests.\nIncorporate Truth via Feedback: Ask for candid input. Quantify responses when possible—e.g., a quick rating scale on how beautiful or helpful they find the prototype. Seek disconfirming evidence to ensure you’re not just hearing what you want.\nIncorporate Beauty in Refinement: If feedback suggests parts are confusing or ugly (metaphorically or literally), iterate. Strive for simpler, more elegant solutions that resonate deeply.\nMeasure Love and Value: Though love and beauty are intangible, you can track engagement levels, the frequency of positive comments, or the presence of spontaneous contributions from users. This is a form of validating the emotional impact.\nBy the end of the second diamond, you have a tested prototype that’s informed by deep empathy (love), grounded in factual insights (truth), and enriched by a quest for meaningful, uplifting experiences (beauty).\n\nAdditional Tips to Streamline and Integrate\nReference Nature’s Inspiration: Highlight examples like the soldier and Paris or natural ecosystems to remind participants that beauty and love can override destructive impulses. This can encourage them to create solutions that protect and celebrate resources.\n\nTie Back to Principles at Each Step: At each diamond stage, briefly restate the guiding principles:\n\nDiscover/Define: “Are we being honest about what’s really happening (truth)? Are we seeing the community’s problem through a lens of care (love)?”\nDevelop/Deliver: “Are we making something inspiring (beauty)? Are we validating our assumptions and measuring outcomes (truth)? Are we acting with respect and empathy (love)?”\nUse Simple Metrics and Tools: Encourage participants to pick one or two things they can quantify easily. This makes the process more tangible and helps them feel confident that they’re tracking progress. For example, measure before/after levels of satisfaction, count how many community members voluntarily engage, or record how many alternative capital forms are being leveraged.\n\nKeep it Light, Keep it Human: Frameworks like the double diamond shouldn’t feel rigid. Remind participants that these steps help them navigate complexity but are not strict rules. The principles of love, truth, and beauty should inform their judgment and keep them grounded in purpose.\n\nBy incorporating the double diamond approach and weaving in love, truth, and beauty at every stage—alongside quantifiable measures and referencing the richness of nature and cultural capital—you create a smooth, memorable, and impactful workflow. Participants learn that frameworks aren’t just abstract tools; they’re pathways to more caring, authentic, and inspiring designs."

At the end, there’s a concise “If you only have 30 minutes” list.\n\nOverall Approach for Day 2 Slides\nYour Day 2 slides currently jump straight into design thinking activities. To make them clearer and more participant-friendly, we will:\n\nStart with a short, simple creativity warm-up that involves drawing.\nIntroduce a single slide that explains the guiding principles (love, truth, beauty) and how the double diamond approach helps them move from problem understanding to prototyping.\nAdd short guiding notes at the top or bottom of existing activity slides that tie each activity to a phase of the double diamond and the core principles.\nKeep instructions simple and direct. Avoid clutter or lengthy text.\nStep-by-Step Slide Updates\nA) Opening Day 2: Creativity Drawing Practice Slide\n\nFirst Slide of Day 2 (Currently “Day 2: Design Thinking”):\n\nChange the title to: \"Day 2: From Insight to Prototype\"\nSubtitle: \"Warming up our Creativity with a Quick Drawing Exercise\"\nSecond Slide: Drawing Warm-Up Activity\n\nTitle: \"5-Minute Drawing Warm-Up\"\nInstructions (simple bullets):\n“Grab paper & pen.”\n“In 2 minutes, quickly draw a simple version of your problem as a creature. It could be a ‘Weed Monster’ or ‘Time-Eating Bird’—be playful!”\n“No art skills needed. Just doodle to free your mind.”\nAdd a note: “This helps you get comfortable with drawing so later you can sketch ideas quickly.”\nThird Slide: Share & Reflect\n\nTitle: \"Quick Share & Reflect\"\nInstructions: “In pairs (breakouts), show your doodle (30 seconds each). Notice how drawing made it easier to think freely.”\nNote: “We’re building comfort with visual thinking—this will help during prototyping.”\nB) Introducing the Principles & Double Diamond Slide\n\nFourth Slide: Principles & Framework\n\nTitle: \"Our Roadmap: The Double Diamond + Core Principles\"\nContent:\nShort description of the double diamond (one line):\nDiscover & Define (First Diamond) = Understand real needs (Love & Truth)\nDevelop & Deliver (Second Diamond) = Create & test solutions (Beauty & Validation)\nThree simple sentences on principles:\nLove (Empathy): Start by caring about people’s real needs.\nTruth (Honesty): Check what’s real—understand the true problem before solving it.\nBeauty (Inspiration): Aim for solutions that uplift and inspire.\nAdd a small icon or simple arrow diagram for the double diamond (two diamonds side by side).\nFifth Slide: Today’s Flow\n\nTitle: \"Today’s Process\"\nBullets:\n“1. Revisit problem: Align with Love & Truth”\n“2. Generate Ideas: Explore with Beauty”\n“3. Prototype & Test: Validate your ideas quickly.”\nNote: “We’ll apply our creativity, do quick sketches, and get feedback to refine.”\nC) Adjust Existing Activity Slides\n\nFor each existing activity slide (like “How might we questions,” “Sketch Time!”, “Share Solutions/Capture Feedbacks”):\n\nAdd a Simple Context Line at the Top or Bottom:\n\nFor example, before “5. 5 mins - Sketch Time!” add a line at top: “(Develop Phase) Use your drawings to explore possible solutions. Don’t worry about perfection—just get ideas out!”\nBefore “6. 4 mins Each - Share Solutions…” add: “(Deliver Phase) Show your rough idea and get quick feedback—this helps ensure truth and beauty in your solution.”\nKeep Instructions Sparse and Clear:\nIf a slide has too many bullet points, simplify them into 2–3 short steps.\n\nD) End of Day 2 Slides\n\nAdd a Final Reflection Slide:\nTitle: \"Reflection & Next Steps\"\nBullets:\n“How did drawing help you think differently?”\n“Which principle (love, truth, beauty) resonated most today?”\n“What will you test next?”\nNote: Keep it short, encouraging participants to remember what they did and why it matters.\nIf You Only Have 30 Minutes to Improve Your Slides, Do This:\nAdd One Slide at Start of Day 2 introducing the 5-minute drawing warm-up. Keep instructions clear and simple.\nAdd One Principles & Double Diamond Slide right after the warm-up. Show how love, truth, and beauty guide them through discover-define and develop-deliver phases.\nAdd a One-Line Contextual Note at the top of each activity slide to remind participants which phase they’re in and which principle they’re applying. For example:\nAt the top of a brainstorming slide: “(Develop) Use creativity to generate possibilities—beauty and new ideas!”\nAt the top of the prototyping slide: “(Deliver) Quickly sketch your idea and get feedback—truth check!”\nSimplify Text Where Possible: If a slide is wordy, break it into shorter bullet points.\nAdd a Closing Reflection Slide: Just one slide at the end for participants to reflect on the process and the principles.\nDoing these minimal changes will make your Day 2 slides more coherent, engaging, and action-oriented without a major overhaul."

Welcome Back\n- Title: \"Welcome to Day 2!\"\n- Subtitle: \"From Stories to Solutions\"\n- Add participant quote: \"I totally enjoyed the session it felt like a mini fun holiday\"\n- Show some nicknames from yesterday: \"Parker, Salad, Mango...\"\n\n### 2. Yesterday's Journey\n- Quote: \"Letting go of what you know so that you can listen enough before understanding how things can be different\"\n- Brief highlights from Day 1\n- Forms of capital they identified\n\n### 3. Drawing Warmup\n- Title: \"Quick Drawing Practice\"\n- Instructions:\n  1. \"Grab paper & pen\"\n  2. \"Draw a tree (1 min)\"\n  3. \"Draw a house (1 min)\"\n  4. \"Draw your challenge as a creature (3 mins)\"\n- Note: \"No art skills needed - we're practicing visual thinking!\"\n\n### 4. Three Ways of Seeing\n- Title: \"Three Lenses for Solutions\"\n- Content:\n  1. Beauty as Solution\n     - Example: Salsabil fountains\n     - \"Makes the solution inherently valuable\"\n  2. Problem is Solution\n     - Example: Waste to resource\n     - \"Hidden value in challenges\"\n  3. Do Nothing\n     - Example: Natural farming\n     - \"Sometimes less is more\"\n\n## Modifications to Existing Slides\n\n### Current \"Design Thinking\" Slide\n- Remove complex frameworks\n- Add: \"Today we'll use drawing and prototyping to explore solutions\"\n- Keep it simple and clear\n\n### Current \"How Might We\" Slide\n- Add at top: \"(Discover Phase) Finding the real need\"\n- Simplify to 3 clear steps\n- Add example from yesterday's stories\n\n### Current \"Sketch Time\" Slide\n- Add at top: \"(Develop Phase) Exploring possibilities\"\n- Reduce text\n- Add simple visual example\n- Clear time limits\n\n### Current \"Feedback\" Slide\n- Add at top: \"(Test Phase) Learning together\"\n- Structure:\n  - \"I like...\"\n  - \"I wish...\"\n  - \"What if...\"\n\n### New Closing Slide\n- Title: \"Next Steps\"\n- Three simple prompts:\n  1. \"One small test to try\"\n  2. \"One person to talk to\"\n  3. \"One resource to use\"\n\n## Design Principles for All Slides\n1. Keep text minimal\n2. Use participant quotes where possible\n3. Include clear timeboxes\n4. Show examples when relevant\n5. Make instructions action-oriented\n\n## Notes for Key Transitions\n- From drawing to concepts: \"Now that we're warmed up...\"\n- From concepts to prototyping: \"Let's try these ideas...\"\n- From prototyping to feedback: \"Time to learn from each other...\"",
