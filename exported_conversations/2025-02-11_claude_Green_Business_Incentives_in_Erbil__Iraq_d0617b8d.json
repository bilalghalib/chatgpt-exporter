It is also reflect-\ned in the setting up of new organizations with\nmandates devoted to the environment, such as\nthe International Solar Alliance (ISA), and the\nintegration of environmental concerns in the\nstrategies of existing institutions. For the Inter-\nnational Labour Organization (ILO), this means\nbringing green jobs to the forefront of develop-\nment efforts as a driver of inclusive, sustainable\nand sustained growth.\nGreen businesses have a key role in this.\nAs green businesses save scarce resources,\nhelp to maintain healthy ecosystems, minimize\npollution and waste, limit greenhouse emis-\nsions, and provide green goods and services\nto enable more responsible consumption pat-\nterns, they are vital for a development model in\nwhich the planet is a priority.\nIn addition, green business acts as a catalyst\nfor entrepreneurs to make a considerable so-\ncio-economic contribution as these businesses\nsafeguard the health of consumers and commu-\nnities, generate jobs, and provide much-need-\ned green resources such as renewable energy to\nfuel other businesses, thereby stimulating the\ngrowth of the economy.\nEqually importantly, for the entrepreneur, green\nbusiness brings with it numerous advantages\nsuch as access to new markets as the demand\nfor green products is on the increase, reduced\ncosts thanks to greening measures in produc-\ntion processes, and improved staff productivity\nlinked to green workplaces.\nThe ILO thus sees green business as a win-\nwin solution to address current development\nchallenges.\nThe Green Business Booklet (GBB) aims to help\naspiring entrepreneurs to set up green busi-\nnesses and existing enterprises to go green. It\nwas developed as a joint initiative of the ILO’s\nDecent Work Team for South Asia (DWT-New\nDelhi), Small and Medium Enterprises (SME)\nUnit and Green Jobs Programme, and provides\nguidance on how to generate green business\nideas, how to design a green business plan,\nand how to green the processes of a business.\nWe trust that it will enable entrepreneurs to\nchoose a green pathway and to benefit from\nthe many advantages this brings while contrib-\nuting to a more sustainable future for all.\nVic Van Vuuren Panudda Boonpala\nDirector Director\nILO Enterprises Department ILO DWT/CO-New Delhi\nCONTENTS\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nACRONYMS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\nABOUT THE GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\nINTRODUCTION TO GREEN BUSINESS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nYOUR GREEN BUSINESS IDEA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\nYOUR GREEN BUSINESS PLAN. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\nGREENING YOUR PROCESSES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\nREFERENCES. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\nANNEX 1: Glossary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\nANNEX 2: Examples of Innovative Green Business Ideas . . . . 30\nANNEX 3: Green Certification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\nANNEX 4: Green Business and Decent Jobs . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe GBB is part of the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB)\nseries of products and of the Green Jobs Packages of the ILO.\nIIt draws on the materials on green business developed in recent\nyears by ILO initiatives in Africa and Asia, and was produced as\na collaborative venture of the ILO SME Unit, ILO Green Jobs Pro-\ngramme, the ILO Decent Work Team for South Asia and Country\nOffice for India, ILO Environment and Decent Work Asia-Pacific\nand the Society for Technology and Action for Rural Advancement\n(TARA).\nThe GBB was written by Eva Majurin with contributions from\nSibongile Sibanda and Manisha Mishra.\nThe review efforts and technical inputs of Merten Sievers and\nPranati Mehtha (ILO SME Unit), Moustapha Kamal Gueye and\nMarek Harsdorff (ILO Green Jobs Programme), Cristina Martinez\nand Lurraine Villacorta (ILO Environment and Decent Work Asia-\nPacific), Alice Vozza (ITC-ILO), Anjana Chellani, Anandan Menon\nand Diya Banerjee (ILO India Country Office) and Sohina Singh,\nArpita Goyal, Shrashtant Patara and Vijay Charturvedi (TARA) are\nsincerely appreciated.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 1\nACRONYMS\nCFL Compact Fluorescent Lamps\nGBB Green Business Booklet\nGYB Generate Your Business Idea\nEMS Environmental Management System\nEYB Expand Your Business\nILO International Labour Organization\nISA International Solar Alliance\nISO International Standards Organization\nIYB Improve Your Business\nLED Light Emitting Diodes\nSDGs Sustainable Development Goals\nSIYB Start and Improve Your Business\nSME Small and Medium Enterprise\nSWOT Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats\nSYB Start Your Business\nTARA Society for Technology and Action for Rural Advancement\n2 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nABOUT THE\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nThe Green Business Booklet (GBB) has been de-\nveloped by the International Labour Organization\n(ILO) to support the creation of green businesses\nand the greening of existing businesses.\nGreen business is vital in contributing to green\njobs, decent work and the development of sus-\ntainable solutions to climate change and other\nenvironmental challenges.\nFor entrepreneurs, going green should also\nmake business sense. Consumers are increas-\ningly interested in eco-friendly products due to\nethical, cost or health reasons so the demand\nfor green products is growing. At the same\ntime, “going green” can cut long-term costs\nas enterprises find new ways to make savings\nand increase profit margins by lowering ener-\ngy consumption, recycling materials or other\ngreening measures.\nThe manual is designed to be used in conjunc-\ntion with the ILO’s flagship Start and Improve\nYour Business (SIYB) programme. SIYB is a\nmanagement training programme that builds on\nmore than three decades of experience. It helps\nentrepreneurs to start and improve micro and\nsmall businesses as a strategy for creating more\nand better employment for women and men.\nThe GBB brings a green angle to the SIYB\nprogramme, enabling entrepreneurs to make\na positive contribution to the environment by\nsetting up and running profitable and sustain-\nable businesses. It helps potential entrepre-\nneurs to come up with a viable green business\nidea and to develop a business plan from a\ngreen perspective, and guides existing entre-\npreneurs on ways to green their business.\nHow does it link to the Start\nand Improve Your Business\nprogramme?\nThe SIYB programme consists of a set of four\ninter-related packages aimed at different lev-\nels of business maturity:\n•\nThe Generate Your Business Idea (GYB)\npackage helps potential entrepreneurs to\nassess their entrepreneurial characteristics\nand to come up with a viable business idea.\n•\nThe Start Your Business (SYB) package takes\nstarting entrepreneurs through the process\nof developing a business plan in order to get\nstarted.\n•\nThe Improve Your Business (IYB) package\nconsists of a set of modules to help already\nexisting entrepreneurs to improve various as-\npects of their business, such as marketing,\naccounting or planning.\n•\nThe Expand Your Business (EYB) package is\nfor growth-oriented entrepreneurs and helps\nthem to come up with a growth strategy in\norder to expand their business.\nThe GBB is intended to provide practical guid-\nance on green business for SIYB trainees in-\nterested to go green. To make it easy to use,\nthe GBB mirrors the structure of the SIYB pro-\ngramme, with its chapters addressing the issues\ncovered in the first three SIYB packages (GYB,\nSYB and IYB), but from a green perspective.\nThe GBB does not duplicate business manage-\nment concepts covered in the SIYB packages;\nfor optimal learning outcomes, the GBB should\ntherefore be used in conjunction with the SIYB\npackages which it complements.\nWho is it for?\nThe GBB is intended for persons interested\nin setting up a green business, or already\noperating a business that could be greened.\nAs it is primarily geared towards trainees of\nthe SIYB programme, basic business man-\nagement concepts that are covered in SIYB\nare not covered in the GBB, and we therefore\nencourage all readers of the GBB to also draw\non the SIYB materials.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 3\nStructure of the booklet\nThe GBB is designed to assist potential entre-\npreneurs to identify a suitable green business\nidea and to develop a business plan for their\nfuture green business, and to help entrepre-\nneurs who already have an enterprise to green\ntheir business. The booklet is structured as\nfollows:\n•\nReaders will learn about what is meant by\ngreen business and what its benefits are in\nChapter 1.\n•\nPotential entrepreneurs in search of busi-\nness ideas will be guided through ways of\ngenerating green business ideas and select-\ning an appropriate idea in Chapter 2.\n•\nPotential entrepreneurs preparing to start a\ngreen business will be assisted in the critical\nsteps needed for developing a business plan\nfor their green business in Chapter 3.\n•\nExisting entrepreneurs are introduced to\npractical steps for greening their business\nprocesses in Chapter 4.\nIt should be noted that though Chapter 2 is\nintended for starting entrepreneurs, it will also\nbe relevant for existing enterprises which may\nchoose to go green by adding a green prod-\nuct or service to their existing range. Similar-\nly, though Chapter 3 is primarily designed for\nstarting entrepreneurs and Chapter 4 for exist-\ning entrepreneurs, both starting and existing\nentrepreneurs will benefit from going through\nthe two chapters as some aspects will be rel-\nevant for both categories of readers. We there-\nfore recommend to work your way through the\nwhole booklet. We hope you will enjoy exploring\nand making use of green business opportuni-\nties through the GBB.\n•\nTIPS FOR USING THE GREEN\nBUSINESS BOOKLET IN AN\nENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY:\nPrint the manual only if you really need to.\nYou can view the electronic version on screen\nby downloading it from various ILO websites,\nincluding: www.ilo.org/siyb and www.ilo.org/\ngreenjobs\n4 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nIntroduction to\ngreen business\nYour green\nbusiness idea\nYour green\nbusiness plan\nGreening\nyour processes\nGoing green is good for the\nenvironment – and it’s good\nfor your business, too!\n•\n•\n•\nWhen printing, select the eco-friendly ver-\nsion with less graphics and colours\nOnce you have finished using the printed\nversion, pass it on to someone else who may\nneed it\nWhen it is really no longer needed, please\ngive it in for recycling - paper is recyclable\nup to 7 times!\n1\nINTRODUCTION TO\nGREEN BUSINESS\nWelcome to the world of green business, an\nexciting and rapidly expanding sector for en-\ntrepreneurs like you who want to create an\nimpact on the economic, environmental and\nsocial fronts.\nOur daily business activities can have a nega-\ntive effect on the environment through air and\nwater pollution, the disposal of waste, or the\noveruse of natural resources, among others.\nAt the same time, businesses depend on the\nenvironment to access different inputs, such\nas land, energy, or water. In instances where\nnatural disasters, pollution, climate change\nand resource depletion are experienced, busi-\nnesses are negatively affected.\nOn the one hand, going green has thus become\na necessity for running a successful and sus-\ntainable business, rather than an option.\nOn the other hand, businesses are also unique-\nly placed to contribute positively to the envi-\nronment.\nFinally, going green can be a good business\ndecision as we intend to show in this guide!\nBy producing environmentally friendly prod-\nucts or offering environmentally friendly ser-\nvices, or by ensuring that their processes are\n“green”, businesses can participate in the pro-\ntection of the environment while making a prof-\nit. Often, greener processes also lead to other\nbenefits such as cost savings and productivity\nincreases, meaning going green makes good\nbusiness sense.\nWe congratulate you on taking the decision to\nexplore green business opportunities through\nthis booklet.\nThis introductory chapter will provide an over-\nview of some of the current environmental\nchallenges and why we need to go green, ex-\nplain what is meant by green business and ex-\nplore what the benefits of green business are.\n1.1 Environmental challenges\nand how we can solve them\nSolar energy businesses are booming in South Asia. In India, many rural\nhouseholds are now able to access off-grid energy thanks to them, and in\naddition, they help to fuel other businesses and their growth.\nWhat environmental challenges\nexist?\nEnvironmental challenges that we are faced\nwith include the longer term challenge of cli-\nmate change, as well as the more immediate\nchallenges of air, water, soil and solid waste\npollution:\n•\nClimate change: The use of fossil fuels (coal,\npetrol and natural gas) releases large quanti-\nties of greenhouse gases, which in turn cause\na rise in temperature and global warming. This\nresults in a range of challenges such as a loss\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 5\nof biodiversity because of the extinction of\nspecies that are not able to tolerate the new\nenvironment; desertification; rises in sea levels\nthat will take over land in coastal areas; and\nextreme weather incidents such as droughts,\nfloods and storms.\n•\nAir, water, soil and solid waste pollution:\nAir pollution results from gases or hazardous\nsubstances entering the air, often from hu-\nman activities such as emissions from facto-\nries, vehicle exhausts, smoke from farmland\nburning or dust from construction. Water\npollution occurs when harmful substances\nenter clean water, including from domestic\nsewage, industrial sewage, or farmland sew-\nage with chemical pesticides, herbicides and\nfertilizers. Soil pollution is caused by pollut-\nants entering the soil through water or other\nmeans. Solid waste pollution includes solid\nwaste from domestic, agricultural or industri-\nal sources, such as organic waste, plastic, or\nmetal for example.\nHow do these environmental\nchallenges affect us?\nThese environmental problems affect us in\nmany ways. Two key impacts that are of ut-\nmost importance to our wellbeing are health\nand incomes:\n•\nEnvironmental problems cause health prob-\nlems. Air, soil and water pollution mean that\nwe breathe, eat and drink toxins that harm\nour health. Furthermore, changes in weath-\ner patterns can disturb food production and\njeopardize food security; droughts and un-\nseasonal rains, for instance, result in harvest\nlosses that can limit access to basic nutri-\ntion. Diseases also spread more easily follow-\ning extreme weather events such as floods,\nand temperature rises mean that heat-relat-\ned diseases, such as malaria, migrate to cold\nareas where they were not found earlier.\n•\nEnvironmental problems damage business\nactivity and livelihoods. If the resourc-\nes that people depend on are destroyed,\nbusiness and incomes suffer. For example,\nif water pollution causes fish to die or if\ntemperature changes mean that a particu-\nlar crop no longer grows where it used to,\nthis means business closures and livelihood\nlosses for the communities that depend on\nthese resources. In addition, environmen-\ntal problems can also affect the ability of\npeople to work. For example, workers in a\nfactory with a high level of indoor air pollu-\ntion may become sick and less productive\nat work, or may even need to discontinue\n6 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nwork altogether, which impacts both the\nworkers’ incomes as well as the operations\nof the factory.\nWhat can be done?\nGiven the negative consequences of these\nenvironmental problems, governments world-\nwide are taking action to tackle them, includ-\ning measures such as gradually shifting from\nthe use of fossil fuels like coal to alternative\nsources of energy like solar energy; developing\npublic transport systems that reduce urban air\npollution; and encouraging industries to cut\ntheir emissions.\nBut, action can and also needs to be taken\nat the level of private individuals, whether as\nconsumers or businesses. Here are some ex-\namples of action that can be taken:\n•\nIn terms of energy consumption, we can opt\nfor renewable sources which are clean such\nas the sun, wind or water flow instead of\nnon-renewable sources such as coal or die-\nsel. For water use, we can opt for renewable\nsources such as rainwater harvesting instead\nof groundwater pumping.\nWe can use the “3R” strategy of reducing,\nreusing and recycling: by reducing unneces-\nsary consumption, reusing things and recy-\ncling waste material to create new material,\nwe can increase efficiency, minimize waste\nand avoid the overexploitation of natural raw\nmaterials.\nWe can choose organic products instead of\nones that rely on synthetic, chemical sub-\nstances for their production.\nExercise:\nThink of the community you come from. What\nare the environmental problems it faces? How\ndo these affect community members as well as\nbusinesses in the community? What needs to\nbe done to solve them? Use the table below to\nsummarize your answer.\nHOW DOES\nIT AFFECT\nPEOPLE?\n•\n•\nWHAT\nIS THE\nPROBLEM?\nWHAT\nNEEDS TO\nBE DONE\nABOUT IT?\nCAN ADDRESSING\nTHE PROBLEM\nIMPROVE\nBUSINESS\nPERFORMANCE?\nThe GBB provides guidance on how busi-\nnesses can contribute to solving the above\nmentioned problems by going green through\nmeasures tackling environmental problems\nwhile tapping into growing markets and mak-\ning a profit.\n1.2\nWhat is green business?\nThe concept “green business” is composed of\ntwo elements – “green” and “business”. As\nall business, green business is about making\nmoney. But “green” means doing so while sus-\ntainably harnessing opportunities that nature\nholds, and without harming the environment.\nGreen business can be defined from two per-\nspectives: one relates to the output in the form\nof green products or services, while the other\nrelates to the process of an economic activity.\nThis means entrepreneurs can enter into the\n“green” business sector by either providing\nenvironmentally friendly products or services\nor through an environmentally friendly process\nor with the help of clean technologies which\nreduce any negative effects of the business.\nGreen\nProducts or\nServices\nGreen Business\nGreen\nProcess\nWhile a step-by-step approach of gradual\ngreening is usually most practical, ideally, as\nthe business matures, both its outputs as well\nas processes should become green.\nEXAMPLES OF GREEN BUSINESSES:\nGreen businesses may offer products or ser-\nvices that are explicitly green, often making\nuse of technological innovation…:\nWaste management business: A company\ninvolved in the collection and processing of\nwaste so it can be recycled, composted and\ndisposed of in a way that is as environmen-\ntally friendly as possible.\nRenewable energy company: A company in-\nvolved in the manufacturing, installation and\nservicing of solar panels to generate electric-\nity instead of generating it from non-renew-\nable sources.\n…Or, green businesses may operate in “stand-\nard” sectors offering mainstream products and\nservices, but may still be green because of the\noperational choices they have made:\nHair salon: A hair salon that uses dyes and styl-\ning products made of organic substances; has\ninstalled solar panels to provide electricity for\nthe operation of equipment; and has procured\nsecond-hand furniture and equipment.\nClothes manufacturer: A clothes manufactur-\ning company that uses organic cotton and dyes\nas raw material; that filters its waste-water in a\nway that it can be partly re-used for irrigation;\nand that has installed LED-lights.\nIn terms of greening processes, there are many\ndimensions of operations that should be con-\nsidered. The main pillars of greening process-\nes in businesses are outlined below:\nRECYCLING\nAND WASTE\nREDUCTION\nReduce • Reuse • Recycle\n• Separate waste •\nDispose in a suitable way\nENERGY\nAND WATER\nCONSERVATION\nSave heat and electricity •\nSave water • Use efficient\nequipment • Use only\nwhen needed • Source\nfrom renewable sources\nPOLLUTION\nPREVENTION\nUse low emission\nequipment • Operate\nefficiently • Use\ndegradable materials\nGREEN\nPROCUREMENT\nProcure environmentally\nsustainable and local\nmaterials/products •\nChoose suppliers that try\nto be environmentally\nfriendly\nGREEN\nDISTRIBUTION\nAvoid transport to far-\naway places • Use the\nmost sustainable method\nof transport • Choose\ndistributors that try to be\nenvironmentally friendly\nDECENT WORK\nProvide productive work,\na fair income, security\nin the workplace, social\nprotection, voice, and\nequality of opportunity\nand treatment\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 7\nYou will note that while the other pillars re-\nfer to the environmental dimensions of doing\nbusiness, the last pillar, “decent work”, re-\nfers to its social dimension. Because of their\ncontribution to broader development goals as\nwell as to guarantee business success, it is\nimportant that businesses consider both their\nenvironmental and social performance, as eco-\nnomic performance is linked to these. Green\nbusinesses therefore need to also provide “de-\ncent work”, that is, work that is productive and\ndelivers a fair income, social protection and\nvoice to workers; only that way will the busi-\nness function optimally.\nExercise:\nDecide whether the following businesses are\ngreen or not green. Then try to rank them in\nterms of greenness from most green (1) - to\nleast green (4).\nBUSINESS GREEN\nNOT\nGREEN\nNOT\nSURE\nGREEN-\nNESS\nRANK\nYOUR\nCOM-\nMENTS\nA bicycle\nmanufacturer\nthat uses\nsecond-hand\nparts to make\nthe bicycles\nA shoe man-\nufacturer that\nmakes shoes\nfor the export\nmarket\nA tourism\ncompany that\norganizes\njeep safaris\nin a nature\nreserve\nA juice-mak-\ning company\nthat has\nconverted to\nsolar energy\nNote: You will notice while doing the exercise\nthat it is not always easy to answer whether\na business is green or not, or to compare en-\nterprises in terms of their greenness. Often,\nbusinesses start with only a few changes that\nbegin their transformation into a greener busi-\nness than before, and they then continue to\nprogressively become greener. Initially, even a\nfew small changes are a step in the right di-\nrection!\n8 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n1.3 Why go green?\nThe benefits of green business\nThere is no doubt that green business is critical-\nly important for productive, healthy and sustain-\nable societies. As green businesses use limited\namounts of (or no) fossil fuels and have low (or no)\nemissions, they can play a key role in combating\nclimate change while contributing to growth and\nthe creation of decent and green jobs.\nBut apart from macro-level benefits, going green\nalso makes business sense for the entrepreneur.\nThe benefits of greener business include ac-\ncess to untapped markets, improved resource\nefficiency and cost savings, and improved pro-\nductivity of staff as a result of a cleaner and\nsafer working environment. These benefits are\nexplained in the section below.\nEXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS OF\nA GREEN BUSINESS:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nAccess to markets, as clients increasingly\ndemand environmentally friendly products\nbecause of increased eco-awareness, but\nalso because of health reasons (greater\nsafety of non-toxic products) or financial\nreasons (lower operating cost).\nCost savings, as water, energy and other\nbills go down and as resource-use becomes\nmore efficient.\nAccess to support, both financial and\nnon-financial, as governments place in-\ncreasingly high importance on environ-\nmental considerations.\nHigher productivity due to a healthier\nworkforce whose ability to work is not com-\npromised by health hazards such as toxins\nin the workplace.\nA healthier surrounding environment in\nwhich the resources needed by the busi-\nness now and in the future are preserved.\nA growing market and\nincreased demand\nThere is an increased demand for green prod-\nucts and services for several reasons.\nIn their choice of products and services, be-\ncause of ethical concerns, customers are in-\ncreasingly interested in clean production pro-\ncesses, environmentally friendly inputs and\nthe way businesses dispose of their waste.\nIn addition, because clients are aware of the\nreduced operation cost of highly efficient prod-\nucts, the market is increasingly demanding\nproducts and services which are highly materi-\nal and energy efficient as well as environmen-\ntally friendly. This is not only because of re-\nduced costs for users but because of the added\nbenefits: energy efficient light bulbs reduce the\nusers’ electricity bill and require less frequent\nchanges; solar lanterns provide better and\ncleaner light as compared to kerosene lanterns\nwhile they can also be re-charged for free; and\nhighly efficient cell phone batteries which last\nfor one week are far more convenient for clients\nthan those that last for only one day.\nOrganic products and nature tourism are in de-\nmand because of the perceived health and lei-\nsure benefits for the clients. Clients consider\nfood that is free from pesticides and synthet-\nic additives to be a safer and healthier option\nthan non-organic food. Similarly, relaxing in\na nature resort with beautiful scenery is pre-\nferred to staying in a concrete block in a pol-\nluted environment.\nGreen enterprises offer environmentally friend-\nly innovations that can tap into this growing\nmarket demand.\nIncreased business efficiency and\ncost savings\nGoing green can reduce costs and improve the\nbusiness’ productivity (meaning that with the\nsame amount of inputs, it can produce more),\nmaking it more competitive. A business that re-\nduces its material costs, energy costs, water costs\nas well as other costs that might be incurred by\nwastage becomes more efficient, less costly and\nmore productive. For example, if the business is\nable to reduce electricity costs through energy\nefficient equipment or techniques, and thereby\nreduce its overall production cost, its profit mar-\ngin may grow or it may be able to reduce its price\nto attract new customers.\nA healthier and more productive\nworkforce\nWorkers in a green business will usually have\nless health problems than those in businesses\nwhich engage in environmentally damaging pro-\ncesses. For example, in enterprises that use toxic\nchemicals, indoor air pollution in the facilities\ncan cause both immediate health problems such\nas nausea, headaches and dizziness as well as\nlong-term health impacts like lung damage. If\nthese issues are resolved, less people will be sick\nand firm production processes will not be inter-\nrupted. With less disruptions, the business will\nnot lose time and resources. Workers will also be\nmore productive because they will not be worried\nabout health hazards. The greening of processes\ncan thus lead to less absences in the form of sick\nleave or a lower rate of discontinuation of work\ndue to serious health problems, and higher on-\nthe-job productivity as workers are able to work\nin a healthy state.\nAccess to financial incentives and\nother support measures\nDifferent countries have developed measures\nand policies to create a shift towards an econ-\nomy that has a reduced negative effect on the\nenvironment. Policies, laws, and regulations\nhave been developed to discourage tradition-\nal enterprises from high energy consumption,\nhigh pollution and high greenhouse gas emis-\nsions. In some countries, polluting activi-\nties may be subject to fines, and taxes may\nbe imposed on fuels such as petrol or diesel;\nshifting away from these thus makes financial\nsense. But more importantly, positive incen-\ntives are also increasingly being introduced to\nencourage greener business processes and to\nstimulate emerging green industries such as\nrenewable energy, eco-agriculture, and green\ntourism among others. Because of this, busi-\nnesses which go green are often able to benefit\nfrom a range of measures designed to encour-\nage the growth of the green business sector.\nThese may include, for example, tax reduc-\ntions, access to attractive financial products\nsuch as low-interest loans for green business,\nsubsidies for switching to new environmen-\ntally friendly technologies, or various types of\nnon-financial assistance such as training pro-\ngrammes.\nExercise:\nTry to brainstorm incentives and support meas-\nures that are available in your context for green\nbusinesses:\nTYPE OF\nINCENTIVE/\nSUPPORT\nAVAILABLE:\nWHO\nPROVIDES IT?\nWHO CAN\nACCESS IT?\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 9\nA better business environment\nBusinesses not only have a responsibility but also\na self-interest to ensure a healthy environment.\nBusinesses depend on the resources in their\ncommunities, and often, an environmentally\nfriendly choice in terms of resources is a sound\nbusiness choice too: for example, fossil fuels\nare depleting and becoming more and more ex-\npensive to procure. If your business continues\nto rely on a fossil fuel and does not diversify\nenergy usage to renewable natural resources, it\nmight run the danger of suffering losses when\nthe fossil fuel is no longer available.\nAlso, the impact of a business on the surround-\ning environment affects the enterprise itself,\nother enterprises, and communities at large,\nparticularly children who suffer the most from\nwater and air pollution. For example, a textile\ncompany that dumps waste materials such\nas dying or bleaching chemicals into a near-\nby river pollutes freshwater which many poor\nfamilies use for cooking and drinking, and may\nkill the fish upon which communities depend\nfor food and livelihoods. Similarly, a farm that\nuses pesticides that are toxic to humans or a\nbrick kiln emitting polluting smoke may affect\nthe health of the surrounding community, in-\ncluding those who work for these businesses as\nwell as other community members. Protecting\nthe resources within the surrounding environ-\nment is therefore both an ethical responsibility\nof the business as well as a sensible business\nstrategy to ensure continued access to these\nresources.\nBeyond these immediate effects, green busi-\nnesses can also contribute to slowing down\nclimate change in the long term, and have an\ninterest to do so. Agro-enterprises, for exam-\nple, suffer from the changing weather patterns\nand extreme events such as floods or droughts.\nBy greening their businesses, entrepreneurs\ncontribute to the maintenance of an environ-\nment in which they can continue to operate on\na profitable basis also in the future.\n10 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nExercise:\nTest whether you have read everything in this\nchapter carefully and reflected on the various\nbenefits!

These characteristics\n(passion; goal-orientation; decision-making;\nrisk-taking; ability to handle stress; ability\nto access to social support; financial endow-\nment; business management skills) are dis-\ncussed in detail in the GYB manual.\nIn addition to these general characteristics,\ngreen entrepreneurs need to think about the\nplanet and its people along with profit, so\nsome further characteristics are required.\nWhen completing the assessment in the\nGYB manual, we recommend you also re-\nflect on whether you have these additional\ncharacteristics.\nA GREEN ENTREPRENEUR NEEDS TO BE:\n•\n•\n•\nAnalytical – As the green sector is rela-\ntively new, entrepreneurs venturing into it\nneed to be able to analyze the potential for\nsuccess and failure and plan accordingly.\nInnovative – Green entrepreneurs need\nto be able to “think outside the box” and\ncome up with new solutions to address en-\nvironmental problems.\nCommitted to ethical standards – A green\nentrepreneur needs to think about profit,\nbut also about people and the planet (the\n3 “P”s) when making business decisions.\nWhen developing green business ideas, consider your future market and\nresources that can be availed.

If your business idea\nis not economically viable, it cannot succeed,\nno matter how noble the idea may be. So you\nneed a sound business idea to be able to help\nthe environment!\n14 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n3\nYOUR GREEN\nBUSINESS PLAN\nAs you now know, a green business may be a\nbusiness that sells green products or services,\nor which operates according to green princi-\nples. Green businesses therefore contribute\nto solving environmental problems and have a\nminimal negative impact on the environment.\nIn order to launch your business, you need to\ndevelop a business plan. The Start Your Busi-\nness (SYB) package has a detailed step-by-\nstep process for developing a business plan.\nThe business plan for your green business\nneeds to be adapted to include key elements\nthat are critical in starting a green business. In\naddition to coming up with a viable green busi-\nness idea (see Chapter 2 for guidance), as you\nThe founder of Lemonbar decided to start a business that serves organic\ndrinks to a health-oriented clientele. To get started with your green business,\na first step is the development of a business plan.\nplan for starting your green business it is im-\nportant to also look at the business processes\nand workplace behaviours and practices with\nthe objective of increasing resource efficiency,\nclean production and reducing any possible\nnegative impacts on the environment.\nThis section of the GBB highlights some im-\nportant green aspects to include in the busi-\nness plan.\nA more in-depth overview of how to green your\nprocesses by setting up an environmental\nmanagement system (EMS), also important for\nyour business plan, is provided in the following\nchapter, as it is applicable not only to starting\nenterprises, but also existing ones.\n3.1 The green dimensions of\nyour business plan\nWriting a green business plan is one of the\nmost important steps for starting up a green\nbusiness. The development of the plan is not\nan overnight process and may take several\nweeks to complete. The business plan for your\ngreen business should cover all the aspects to\nbe considered before starting the business.\nThe main components of a business plan are\noutlined in this chapter. For all the compo-\nnents of your business plan, you need to make\nsure that you add any green dimensions that\nare relevant.\nThese green dimensions may relate to:\n•\nHow the environment is affected by the par-\nticular business plan component: for exam-\nple, in terms of marketing, when consider-\ning distribution, long-distance transport will\nbe more damaging to the environment than\nshort distances.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 15\n•\nHow each of the business plan components\nis affected by the green characteristic of your\nproduct/service: for example, when consider-\ning the price, you may be able to charge more\nthan your competitors because customers may\nbe willing to pay more for a green product, and\nyou may thereby enjoy a higher profit margin.\nYou will note that the business plan also in-\ncludes a section on greening your business.\nGreening is a cross-cutting issue that will come\nup in most other sections of your business plan.\nHowever, it is useful to give greening specific\nattention through a section specifically devoted\nto summarising all the required measures.\nBUSINESS PLAN\nCOMPONENT\nPURPOSE &\nGREEN DIMENSION\nExecutive summary The executive summary is an outline of your green business idea. In addition to\nthe generic issues covered in a business plan, the summary should highlight its\ngreen dimensions.\nYour business idea All business plans are based on an idea. In describing your idea, you need to high-\nlight what makes it unique as a green business (in terms of the product/service or\nprocess).\nThe marketing plan Your marketing plan needs to be based on a solid understanding of the market.\nOnce you know your market, you then need to develop a marketing plan based\non the 7 “P”s: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, People, Process, and Physical\nEvidence. Consider the environmental dimension of these 7 “P”s when developing\nthe plan (for example, for “Price”, whether you can charge a premium price).\nStaff You will need to decide what your business’ staffing needs are based on what tasks\nneed to be performed. When assessing what staff you need, consider whether any\nadditional technical skills are needed for your green product/service.\nOrganization and\nmanagement\nLike any entrepreneur, you will need to decide on the form of business. A green\nbusiness can take one of many forms, including a sole proprietorship, a partner-\nship, or a cooperative, for example. You should weigh the pros and cons of each\nbefore choosing the best form.\nYou will also need to consider all required taxes and permits and select an appro-\npriate insurance policy; make sure to include environmental taxes and environ-\nmental permits when doing so.\nBuying for your\nbusiness\nYour business will need to buy before you make or sell your products/services.\nWhen buying for your business, consider how environmentally friendly the materi-\nals or equipment you buy are.\nGreening your\nprocesses\nGreening your processes covers a range of elements, starting from how environ-\nmentally friendly your raw materials are to how you get your product to your final\nconsumers. To ensure the environmental-friendliness of your enterprise, you should\nset up an environmental management system (EMS). This system will help you\ntrack and improve your performance in key areas such as procurement, energy and\nwater consumption, pollution prevention, distribution and waste management.\nCosting To be able to set your price and make a financial plan, you will need to calculate\nthe cost of your products. Keep in mind that you may incur some additional costs\nat the outset for green investments relating to equipment, premises or skills, but\nalso that you will most likely make savings thanks to green practices such a re-\nduced consumption of electricity or water, resulting in reduced utility bills.\nFinancial planning You need to be able to plan and monitor the financial situation of your business\nusing tools such as the profit plan and a cash flow plan. Like any other business,\nyour green business needs to perform financially, otherwise you will not be able to\nkeep it going!\nRequired start-up\ncapital\nWhen estimating the required start-up capital, you will need to assess your needs\nin terms of capital investment and working capital. Consider the elements required\nfor your business to be green while estimating this cost, and be realistic when\ndoing so.\nSources of start-up\ncapital\nThe most important types of start-up capital are owner’s equity and loans. Keep in\nmind that there are also a number of institutions with special funding opportuni-\nties for green businesses.\n16 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n3.1.1 Your business idea\nAll business plans are based on an idea. In\nthe previous chapter, you will have discovered\nways of identifying and selecting a suitable\nbusiness idea. In describing your business\nidea, you need to highlight what makes it\ngreen. The description should explain which\nenvironmental challenge your business idea\nis addressing and/or how the process makes it\nenvironmentally friendly.\n3.1.2 Marketing plan\nYour marketing plan needs to be based on a\nsolid understanding of the market. By doing\nmarket research you will be able to identify the\nneeds of potential customers and find out how\nyour future competitors have been satisfying\nthose needs. While carrying out the research,\nbe sure to assess:\n•\nWhether your future customers want to buy a\nproduct/service with green added value; and\n•\nWhether they are willing to pay a premium\nprice for this.\nYou will then need to develop your marketing\nplan based on the 7 “P”s of the marketing\nmix. As explained in the SYB manual, the 7\n“P”s are:\n•\nProduct - the goods or services you are going\nto offer to satisfy the customers’ needs.\n•\nPrice - how much you are going to charge\nyour customers for your goods or services.\n•\nPlace - how and where you are going to reach\nyour customers.\n•\nPromotion - how you will inform customers\nabout your goods or services and attract\nthem to make a purchase.\n•\nPeople - who will develop the unique charac-\nteristics of your business that differentiates\nyour business from others.\n•\nProcess - the various mechanisms and proce-\ndures to get the product to your customers.\n•\nPhysical evidence - the overall appearance\nof your good, service or company.\nWhen developing your plan, consider the envi-\nronmental dimension of each of these 7 “P”s.\nSome examples are provided below. Depending\non your specific business, more may emerge.\nEXAMPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nIN THE MARKETING MIX:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n“Product”: By offering a green product that\naddresses an environmental challenge or\ndoes not harm the environment thanks its\nrecyclability/reusability, its green produc-\ntion process and its green packaging, for\nexample, you will be able to attract cus-\ntomers who place importance on environ-\nmental, social and health issues. This will\ndifferentiate you from others and will give\nyou a competitive advantage. You may also\nwish to consider having your product cer-\ntified by a reputable organization to show\nthat it meets the green standards that have\nbeen set.\n“Price”: Green products and services or\ngreen production processes might help\nthe business to reduce costs. As you may\ncharge the same price as your competitors\nwhile producing at a lower cost, this can\nenable you to have a larger profit margin.\nSometimes, green products or services\nmight be more expensive, if suppose the\ncost of the green technology used is high-\ner. But you can still attract customers by\nexplaining the benefits of the products or\nservices so that they see the value added\nand are convinced to pay a higher price.\n“Place”: When deciding on the location of\nyour business, try to minimize distances\nto raw materials as well as to the market.\nNot only will this help the environment,\nbut it will also help the business to reduce\nthe cost of transport and result in less\ntime-losses due to travel. To appeal to a\nhealth-oriented clientele, such as the cus-\ntomers of a beauty shop, you may wish to\nchoose a naturally beautiful location which\nis clean and has trees.\n“Promotion”: When deciding on how to\npromote the product, consider ways of re-\nducing resource use and the generation of\nwaste/pollution. For example, go paperless\nand make use of electronic media, or, if\nusing print material such as leaflets, opt\nfor recycled paper and non-toxic inks.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 17\nExercise:\nThink of as many as possible green elements\nfor each of the 7 “P”s:\n“P”s OF\nMARKETING GREEN ELEMENTS\nProduct\nPrice\nPlace\nPromotion\nPeople\nProcess\nPhysical\nevidence\n3.1.3 Staff\nYou will need to decide what your business’\nstaffing needs are based on what tasks need\nto be performed and what you can or cannot\ndo yourself.\nWhen assessing what staff you need, consider\nwhether any additional technical skills are needed\nfor your green product/service. Think about the fol-\nlowing questions: Do you need to hire extra staff?\nOr can you train existing staff? If this is needed,\nwhat types of training are available, which institu-\ntions offer such trainings, and at what cost? Or, al-\nternatively, could you rely on short-term expertise\nfrom outside of your business?\n3.1.4 Organization and management\nLike any entrepreneur, you will need to decide\non the form of business. A green business can\ntake any of the legal forms available in your\ncountry, such as a sole proprietorship, a part-\nnership, a cooperative or a limited company, for\nexample. You should familiarize yourself with\neach form and weigh the pros and cons before\nchoosing the most appropriate form.\nYou will also need to consider the taxes that\nyour business has to pay, licenses and permits\nit needs to obtain, and insurance that it needs\nto take out. Keep in mind that:\n•\nOn top of other generic taxes, in some coun-\ntries businesses may need to pay additional\ntaxes that are related to the environment,\nsuch as pollution tax; depending on the\n18 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\ngreen choices you make, you may be able\nto lower the tax amounts you pay or even be\ncompletely exempt.\n•\nEnvironmental permits may be included in\nthe regulations of your country, and in order\nto obtain a permit, you may need to submit\nan environmental impact assessment report\nor other documentation to show how you in-\ntend to assess and address environmental\nissues in your business.\n3.1.5 Buying for your business\nYour business will need to buy before you make\nor sell your products/services. When buying for\nyour business, consider:\n•\nHow environmentally friendly the equipment\nand materials you buy are. Are the products\ncertified through a recognized label?\n•\nIf sourcing natural resources such as wood,\ncharcoal, fish, water etc., whether these\nare sustainably produced or overexploited,\nwhich is a risk not only for the environment\nbut also for your business future.\n•\nWhether the materials and equipment are\navailable locally or as close as possible to\nyour business to avoid long-distance trans-\nport. This will also help the business to re-\nduce the cost of transport. Reduced travel\ntime will mean quicker access to the mate-\nrials needed for production or the provision\nof services.\n3.1.6 Greening your processes\nGreening your processes covers a range of el-\nements, starting from how environmentally\nfriendly your raw materials are to how you get\nyour product to your clients.\nTo ensure the environmental-friendliness of\nyour enterprise, you should set up an envi-\nronmental management system (EMS). This\nsystem will help you track and improve your\nperformance in key areas such as:\n•\nProcurement: using environmentally friendly\nand locally available materials.\n•\nEnergy and water consumption: using energy\nand water from renewable sources and sav-\ning energy and water where possible.\n•\nPollution prevention in production/service\nprovision: using low-emission equipment\nand techniques.\n•\nDistribution: using environmentally friendly\ntransport methods and avoiding long distances.\n•\nWaste management: reducing, reusing and\nrecycling where possible and disposing what\nneeds to be disposed of in a responsible way.\nThe setting up of this system is discussed in\nmore detail in the next chapter; please refer to\nit in order to develop yours!\n3.1.7 Costing\nTo be able to set your price and make a finan-\ncial plan, you will need to calculate the cost of\nyour products.\nWhen costing your green goods and services,\nkeep in mind that:\n•\nSome additional investments may be need-\ned in terms of equipment, premises, skills or\nother areas. This will entail additional costs\nat the outset. Specialized equipment may\nbe needed to make the green product/deliv-\ner the green service, or, instead of standard\nequipment, you may wish to opt for more\nefficient equipment which you may need to\nbuy. You may also make green choices for\nyour premises (such as the installation of\nLED lights) or for your sources of energy (for\nexample, solar energy) which will have a cost\nimplication.\n•\nBut, you can also make savings through these\ninvestments in terms of operation cost. For\nexample, the use of solar panels will cut your\nbill in terms of regular electricity.\n•\nOther green choices that you may make,\nsuch as buying second-hand equipment or\nfurniture for your business may also help you\nto lower the cost of your product.\nWhen costing, consider also the cost of an\nenvironmental impact assessment, an envi-\nronmental certification if you opt for one, and\nother similar costs. These will give you an add-\ned marketing advantage later, but their cost\nneeds to be included when doing your initial\ncosting.\n3.1.8 Financial planning\nYou need to be able to plan and monitor the\nfinancial situation of your business. You can\ndo so by making a profit plan and a cash flow\nplan and checking the actual performance of\nthe business against these plans.\nLike any other business, your green business\nneeds to perform financially, otherwise you will\nnot be able to keep it going, no matter how\nnoble its objective. Therefore, make sure to be\nthorough in your financial planning.\n•\n•\n•\n•\n3.1.9 Required start-up capital\nWhen estimating the required start-up capital,\nyou will need to assess your needs in terms of:\nCapital investment: business premises,\nequipment, and furniture.\nWorking capital: the stock of raw materials\nand finished products, marketing costs, sal-\naries, rent, insurance and other costs.\nConsider the elements required for your busi-\nness to be green while estimating this cost. In\nparticular, keep in mind that:\n•\nSome green investments will entail addition-\nal costs at the outset, as mentioned in the\nsection on costing, above.\nHowever, these green investments will usu-\nally pay off in the long term thanks to lower\noperating costs.\nFurthermore, other green choices that you\nmay make, such as buying second-hand fur-\nniture for your business, may also help you\nto lower the start-up capital that is required.\nIn terms of other costs, consider also wheth-\ner you have to budget for an environmental\nimpact assessment, an environmental certifi-\ncation if you opt for one, and other costs that\nmay arise such as contracting an energy ex-\npert. As mentioned in the section on costing\nabove, these will be beneficial for your busi-\nness, but their cost needs to be kept in mind\nwhile budgeting.\nIn estimating the required start-up capital,\nbe realistic in assessing the capital needed to\nsustain your green business up to a time when\nyou make enough money to cover your expens-\nes and make a profit.\nExercise:\nThink about the additional costs and savings\nresulting from greening your processes.

Chap-\nter 2 on green business ideas will provide use-\nful tips for doing so.\nBut even when continuing to offer convention-\nal products or services, existing enterprises\ncan also go green by making their processes\nenvironmentally friendly.\nThis chapter is related to this second strategy.\nIt explains what is meant by the greening of\nprocesses, and provides practical guidance on\nhow to do so.\nThough this chapter is intended for existing\nentrepreneurs, it will also be relevant for those\nwho are in the process of starting a business,\nas the environmental management system cov-\nered in it complements the business plan for\nstarting entrepreneurs from the Chapter 3. In\na similar way, existing entrepreneurs should\nalso refer to Chapter 3 as revisiting certain el-\nements of their already established business\nplan from an environmental angle will be use-\nful when going green.\n4.1 What is greening and\nhow can you green your\nprocesses?\nGood waste management practices help businesses to reduce costs, and\nsometimes even enables them to make extra money as recyclables are\nsought-after material.\nYou will recall from Chapter 1 that a business\ncan be a green business in two different ways:\n•\n•\nBy offering products or services that are en-\nvironmentally friendly.\nThrough environmentally friendly business/\nproduction processes, even when offering\nconventional products or services.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 21\nGreening your processes refers to the transfor-\nmation of the business/production processes\nof your enterprise in order for it to become a\ngreen business.\nEvery enterprise can green its operations and\nprocesses. There are two dimensions to this.\nOn the one hand, it concerns the inputs re-\nquired and on the other hand, it concerns the\nunintended output or waste and pollution. So,\ngreening your processes aims both at:\n•\nIncreasing the efficiency of inputs used in\nthe enterprise, i.e. reducing the use of en-\n•\nergy, material and water while increasing or\nmaintaining the same level of product or ser-\nvice delivery;\nReducing the amount of unintended output,\ni.e. reducing waste, pollution and the exces-\nsive destruction of natural resources.\nExercise:\nRead the case study below and think of the in-\nputs and outputs of the business, and whether\nthey could be greener.\nGreening the Cutting Edge Clothes (CEC) company*\nCutting Edge Clothes (CEC) is a T-shirt manufacturer with 30 workers in a small town in Bangladesh.\nThey buy cotton imported from India, dye it with dyes imported from China, and cut and sew it\ninto its final shape.\nThey operate in a building that was previously a school class room and which had the advantage\nof already being connected to the city’s electricity grid and sewage system.\nThe T-shirts are sent to the capital city, 500 km away, in a rented truck in lots of 20-50 T-shirts\nseveral times a month depending on the requirements of their 3 buyers.\nINPUT (RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY,\nIS THE INPUT GREEN?

Here are some further tips\non how to go green:\n•\n•\n•\n•\nPay attention to your raw materials: When\nselecting your raw materials, think sustaina-\nble. This may mean organic, biodegradable,\nrecyclable or renewable. Organic agricultur-\nal products, biodegradable plastic, or wood\nfrom sustainable forestry are examples of\nraw materials that make your business foot-\nprint greener.\nGreen your energy and water consumption:\nYour business is likely to require energy and/\nor water. You can go green by using energy\nfrom renewable sources such as solar energy,\nand by using harvested rainwater, for exam-\nple. You can also reduce your energy con-\nsumption by making use of more energy-ef-\nficient equipment. Energy and water usage\ncan also be minimised by technologies that\nhelp you to use as little as possible, such\nas light switches or taps with sensors. These\nchanges are good for the environment, but\nthey are also good for your business: the less\nyou use, the less you spend!\nMinimise your emissions: Switch to fuels\nthat are as green as possible and use equip-\nment that produces the smallest amount\nof emissions possible. Sometimes a switch\nfrom a diesel generator to an electric ma-\nchine reduces costs while cleaning the local\nair. In case of any remaining emissions, look\ninto appropriate filtration technologies.\nReduce, reuse and recycle waste: Reduce by\nusing as little as possible. Could your product\nbe packaged with less material, for example?\nReuse whatever can be reused. Your raw ma-\nterials may be supplied to you in packaging\nthat you can in turn reuse for packaging your\nown product. For waste that you can’t reuse\nyourself or provide to others for reuse, give\nit in for recycling. In many cities, waste col-\nlectors will pay for your recyclables, so don’t\nmiss the opportunity! Finally, for waste that\ncannot be reused or recycled, dispose of it in\na responsible way.\n•\n•\nTransport responsibly: Minimise distances\nused for transport, reduce weight and vol-\nume through efficient packaging options,\navoid less than full loads, plan efficient\njourneys, and when transporting, choose the\nleast environmentally harmful options avail-\nable. Also think of sharing transport with\nothers when possible.\nThink outside of the box: Use your creativity\nto make a profit while helping the environ-\nment. Eco-entrepreneurs tend to be inno-\nvators. Sometimes, sophisticated technolo-\ngies, scientific expertise or a large amount\nof money are needed to make an innovative\nidea a reality. But sometimes you can also\nuse resources that are already available in\nyour community and transform them to\nmake a profit. You may have heard of inno-\nvative ideas such as eco-coolers made from\ndiscarded plastic bottles, or cups and plates\nmade from coffee grinds, or even of entre-\npreneurs creating services from products:\nbecause a consumer is often interested in\nthe quality of the service (e.g. light) rather\nthan the product itself (e.g. a lantern), entre-\npreneurs have started selling light by charg-\ning solar lanterns during the day and bring-\ning them fully-charged to households in the\nevening. Be creative in your thinking and you\nmay become an eco-innovator too!\nEASY WAYS TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND\nYOUR BUSINESS: THE 3R STRATEGY\nIf you manage your waste using the 3R\nstrategy, you can help the environment:\n•\nReduce: The creation of waste can be min-\nimized by reducing our consumption. We\ncan buy less, and we can buy more durable\nproducts that last longer, meaning less new\nproducts and less waste.\n•\n•\nReuse: We can also reuse things in another\nway to diminish the amount of waste we pro-\nduce. Old objects can be re-used in a differ-\nent way instead of being thrown away.\nRecycle: When reduction or reuse are not\npossible, recycling can be used to produce\nnew raw materials from waste; in this way,\nwaste is not simply disposed of, and in\naddition, raw materials do not need to be\nextracted from the natural environment for\nthe creation of new products.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 23\nThough the above are the most commonly used\nbasic 3 “R”s, even more “R”s can be added\nto the strategy: “Rot” is sometimes added to\nbring in composting as a way of dealing with or-\nganic waste, and “Repair” is a useful means of\nextending the life of many products if broken.\nAll these “R”s have a positive business implica-\ntion. You can save money by reducing the amount\nof inputs you are using, and by reusing whatever\ncan be reused. In some countries, the disposal of\nwaste also results in taxes/fines which a proper\nseparation of waste can avoid. Finally, not only\ncan you save money this way, but by selling your\nwaste to those who are in the business of recy-\ncling or equipment you no longer need to others\nwho are looking for the same type of equipment,\nsometimes you can even make money!\nSAVING THROUGH GREENING\nDid you know you can save money by being\nenvironmentally friendly? Here are a few ex-\namples of how you can help the environment\nand cut costs at the same time:\n•\n•\nReduce usage. Cutting costs and reducing\nbills can be as easy as only using electricity\nand water when you really need it. Installing\ntaps with sensors or automatic light switches\nhelps you do this.\nGo for efficient choices. For example, in\nterms of energy use, by choosing energy-ef-\nficient lighting options such as LED and\nCFL lights instead of the more traditional in-\ncandescent light bulbs, you can reduce the\namount of energy you use by 50 percent or\nmore because of their efficiency. In monetary\nterms, replacing a traditional light bulb with\na CFL of the same brightness will save you\nabout USD 7 per year, or USD 87 over the\nlifetime of the bulb. Think of this when set-\nting up your business premises and choosing\nequipment!\n•\nSwitch sources. For example, start using\nsolar energy instead of regular energy.\nYou’ll need to pay for the installation of\nsolar panels, but once you’ve done this,\nyou’ll have access to a source of energy\nthat is free.\nThink about how much you could save if\nyou would implement some of these meas-\nures in your business!\nSources: http://yourenergysavings.gov.au/ ; http://\nwww.energysavingtrust.org.uk/home-energy-effi-\nciency/lighting\n24 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n4.3 Greening in practice:\nYour environmental\nmanagement system\nIn order to green your business, it is helpful to\ndevelop a simple environmental management\nsystem.\nTo do this, you can follow the steps below:\n•\n•\n•\nAssess your current situation.

These phenomena in-\nclude increased temperature trends (global\nwarming), sea level rises, ice mass losses, and\nextreme weather events.\nDecent work/jobs: Decent work involves op-\nportunities for work that is productive and\nprovides a fair income, security in the work-\nplace and social protection for families, free-\ndom for workers to participate in the decisions\nthat affect them, and equality for women and\nmen. Green businesses should provide decent,\ngreen jobs.\nEnvironmental protection: Environmental pro-\ntection is a practice of protecting the natural\nenvironment on individual, organisational or\ngovernmental levels, for the benefit of both the\nenvironment and humans. It aims to conserve\nnatural resources, preserve the current state of\nthe environment and to reverse its degradation\nwhere possible.\nFossil fuels: Fossil fuels are fuels such as coal,\ncrude oil, and natural gas that were formed\nfrom the buried remains of plants and animals\nthat lived millions of years ago. They are con-\nsidered to be harmful to the environment be-\ncause their use creates greenhouse gases such\nas carbon dioxide or methane which cause\nglobal warming.\nGlobal warming: Global warming refers to the\nincrease in temperature across the Earth due\nto the increase in greenhouse gas emissions\nresulting from the burning of fossil fuels.\nGreen business: A green business is a busi-\nness that produces/provides an environmen-\ntally friendly product/service or uses an envi-\nronmentally friendly process, or both. Green\nbusinesses thus help to protect and restore\nthe environment, while generating profit for\nthe owner.\nGreenhouse effect: The greenhouse effect is\na natural process that warms the Earth’s sur-\nface. When energy from the sun reaches the\nEarth’s atmosphere, greenhouse gases such\nas carbon dioxide act like a roof, absorbing\nand re-radiating some of this warmth. This\nis a vital, natural process that allows life on\nEarth to exist. However, because human ac-\ntivities such as the burning of fossil fuels in-\ncrease the concentration of these gases, we\nare now facing a problem of global warming.\nGreenhouse gases: Greenhouse gases are gases\nsuch as carbon dioxide or methane that trap\nheat and make the planet warmer. A large\nshare of these gases are produced through hu-\nman activities such as the burning of fossil fu-\nels for electricity or for transport, for example.\nGreen jobs: Green jobs are decent jobs that\ncontribute to preserving or restoring the en-\nvironment. Green jobs can be found in tradi-\ntional sectors such as manufacturing and con-\nstruction, or in new, emerging green sectors\nsuch as renewable energy and energy efficien-\ncy. Green businesses are essential providers of\ngreen jobs.\nPollution: Pollution is the introduction of un-\nsafe or toxic substances that are harmful for\nliving organisms into the environment (the\nsoil, the air and water). Pollution is caused by\nhuman activities, such as the spilling of oil,\nthe emission of harmful gases from cars or fac-\ntories, or the disposal of industrial waste.\nRenewable resources: Renewable resources are\nresources that can be replenished naturally,\nusually in a short period of time. For example,\nsolar energy is a renewable energy source be-\ncause it replenishes naturally in a short period\nof time, while crude oil, natural gas, coal and\nuranium (nuclear energy) are non-renewable\nsources of energy as they do not form or re-\nplenish naturally in a short period of time.\n3 R: This is a strategy for dealing with waste,\ninvolving reducing consumption before waste\nis generated in the first place; reusing rather\nthan throwing away items for which new uses\ncan be found; and recycling waste by extract-\ning materials from it and transforming them\ninto new products.\nSources:\nhttp://www.ilo.org/global/topics/green-jobs/lang--en/index.htm\nhttp://www.ilo.org/global/topics/decent-work/lang--en/index.htm\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming/\nhttps://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\nhttp://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science/\ngreenhouse-effect\nhttps://www.epa.gov/recycle\nhttps://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=nonrenewable_home\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 29\nANNEX 2\nExamples of Innovative Green Business Ideas1\nThe Solar Radio\n•\nSimply converting to a solar powered bag can\nhelp save money when we need to charge\ncell phones or other electronics.\nThis is a very creative innovation for people liv-\ning in areas that have little or no electricity but\nlots of sunlight.

Certifications or\neco-labels are issued by governmental agen-\ncies, industry associations, non-governmental\norganizations and commercial environmental\nauditors, among others.\nCertification has several advantages. It helps\nyou to do a more thorough job of greening,\nmeaning more efficiency and greater cost\nsavings for your business. It also provides a\ncompetitive marketing advantage through in-\ncreased recognition by media and trust by con-\nsumers, which can result in increased sales\nand overall improved business performance.\nFor example, the ISO 14000 certification\nstandard involves a voluntary environmental\nmanagement system which can help to im-\nprove business performance while providing an\nobjective basis for verifying a business’ claims\nabout its environmental performance.\nHowever, given the number of certifications\navailable, choosing the most appropriate one\nmay be confusing. Moreover, keep in mind\nthat obtaining and maintaining certification\nstatus may have implications in terms of\nmoney and time.\nCheck what certifications are available in your\ncountry and what is required in order to obtain\nthem. If one of them is a realistic option for\nyou and one that would help your business,\nyou may benefit from giving it a go!\nBelow are a few examples of international en-\nvironmental certifications and standards:\nCertified Emission Reductions (CER) and\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) Gold\nStandard\nDemeter\nFair Trade\nForest Stewardship Council (FSC)\nGlobal Organic Textile Standard\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI)\nGreen Globe Certification\nInternational Federation of Organic Agriculture\nMovements (IFOAM)\nInternational Standards Organisation (ISO)\nOeko-Tex\nRainforest Alliance\nSoil Association\nSustainable Travel International\nUTZ\n2 Adapted from Green Africa Directory website: http://www.greenafricadirectory.org/resources/green-certifications/\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 31\nFigure: Examples of eco-lables3\n3 Selected eco-labels reproduced from ILO (Oliver Ortis and Janti Gunawan), Start Your Green Business - Phase I: Start Up, ILO-IJEP project, Jakarta, 2013.\n32 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nANNEX 4\nGreen Business and Decent Jobs\nJobs are green when they help reduce nega-\ntive environmental impact, ultimately leading\nto environmentally, economically and socially\nsustainable businesses and economies, and\nwhen they are decent.\nDecent work is defined by the ILO as work that,\namong others:\n•\nIs productive and delivers a fair income,\n•\nProvides security in the workplace and social\nprotection for families,\n•\nBrings with it better prospects for personal\ndevelopment and social integration,\n•\nGives people the freedom to express their\nconcerns, organize and participate in the de-\ncisions that affect their lives, and\n•\nEnsures equality of opportunity and treat-\nment for all women and men.\nGreen businesses create work that is decent,\ncontributes to poverty reduction and leads to\nsocial inclusion.\nFor example, if we look at the energy sector,\nvarious reports show that renewable energy\nbusinesses provide more green jobs than fossil\nfuel energy businesses.\nBy participating in the green economy, your\nbusiness contributes towards reducing unem-\nployment by creating green jobs and decent\nwork.\nBut, going green can also help your business,\ngiven that it can provide a marketing advan-\ntage, and results in cost savings and increased\nefficiency and productivity. In many cases it\nalso enables you to access new types of sup-\nport for green businesses.\nSo, greening your business is a win-win situation!\nPLANET\nEnvironment\nQuality\nGREEN\nBUSINESS\nPEOPLE\nSocial\nEquality\nPROFITS\nEconomic\nEfficiency\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 33]]]"

Many modules map to multiple BMC components\n2. Some green elements appear repeatedly across different modules\n3. The curriculum provides particularly strong coverage of marketing and strategic aspects of sustainability\n4. There could be opportunities to strengthen operational and technical environmental content\n5. The Green Business Booklet recommendations complement and extend the original curriculum's green elements\n\nWould you like me to analyze any particular patterns or relationships in more detail?",

            "extracted_content": "Below is an updated version of your consolidated curriculum document. It integrates insights from the ILO’s “Green Business Guide” (2022) and addresses the five key gaps around leadership, supply chain, ethics/triple bottom line, networking, and continuous innovation. We have minimized explicit references to other frameworks (e.g., GreenComp) in favor of focusing on ILO sources (notably the Green Business Guide and the SIYB approach), while still maintaining the core structure of your existing clusters and worksheets.\n\nAt the end, we provide proposed slide text to help you present these updates effectively.\n\nGreen & Climate-Resilient Business Curriculum\n(Incorporating Key Insights from the ILO’s Green Business Guide)\nI. Introduction & Work So Far\nWe’ve been updating the Five One Labs Curriculum to ensure that environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, and climate resilience are integrated into every stage of a startup’s journey. Rather than building a separate “green accelerator,” our aim is to show entrepreneurs that going green is a smart, forward-thinking business strategy—improving ROI, mitigating risks, and ensuring long-term growth.\n\nKey Updates & Gaps Addressed\nGreen Leadership, Management & Team-Building\n\nWe will add a cross-cutting emphasis on cultivating a sustainability-oriented culture, nurturing “internal sustainability champions,” and highlighting how to lead teams toward greener practices.\nSupply Chain & Operations\n\nWe now explicitly include material sourcing, packaging, disposal, and life cycle thinking in our “Market & Model” cluster, referencing ILO’s Resource Efficiency & Cleaner Production (RECP) approaches.\nEthics & Triple Bottom Line\n\nWithin our “Finance & Impact” cluster, we now underscore how to balance people, planet, and profit, referencing the Green Business Guide on measuring environmental impacts and ensuring social fairness.\nNetworking & Partnerships\n\n“Green” networks and partnerships appear in “Communications & Sales,” helping entrepreneurs find financing, knowledge, and B2B linkages for green solutions.\nContinuous Innovation & Mindsets\n\nWe highlight iterative, long-term innovation to embed sustainability into product/service design, referencing the Green Business Guide on “eco-innovation” and “circular economy” opportunities.\nBy weaving these elements throughout the curriculum, we ensure that participants learn practical tools for building greener businesses, stay compliant with upcoming environmental regulations, and tap into emerging green markets (public procurement, B2B supply chains, consumer eco-awareness).\n\nII. Our Strategy\nOur overarching strategy is to embed sustainability as a business advantage. This aligns with the ILO’s position that “green business is good business,” as explained in the Green Business Guide. We focus on:\n\nMarket & Model: Helping ventures discover green opportunities and integrate them into their core business model and supply chain.\nFinance & Impact: Demonstrating the financial ROI of sustainability, measuring impacts (including triple bottom line), and managing risks.\nCommunication & Sales: Showcasing environmental benefits as unique selling points that build trust with customers, partners, and investors.\nGuiding Principles\nBusiness-First: Every sustainability recommendation must enhance competitiveness, reduce costs, or open new markets.\nAction-Oriented Tools: We provide frameworks, checklists, and worksheets (including references to Green Business Guide tools such as RECP steps and life cycle thinking).\nMeasurable Impact: We emphasize tracking resource usage, cost savings, and environmental outcomes to prove real-world value.\nLeadership & Team Culture: We encourage entrepreneurs to adopt “green leadership,” empowering teams with knowledge and enthusiasm for sustainability.\nReference: ILO’s Green Business Guide suggests that small businesses can “do well by doing good,” leveraging resource efficiency, reduced waste, and better brand reputation to achieve growth.\n\nIII.

It includes:\n\nUpdated Clusters (reflecting a multi-month accelerator, not just a 9-day pilot).\nA Master Alignment Table mapping each client module to your clusters, showing direct quotes/recommendations, and indicating which worksheets or improvements apply.\nProposed Presentation Slides (an outline) you can use to walk the client through your updates.\nFive Key Questions to further refine your work.\nFeel free to copy-paste and adapt any parts of this text into your own presentation materials.\n\n1. Updated Clusters for a Multi-Month Accelerator\nInstead of framing content into “Days 1-9,” we’ve updated the three clusters to reflect your ongoing program. Each cluster can be revisited throughout the accelerator’s duration as teams progress.\n\nCluster A: Market, Model & Supply Chain\n\nFocus: Identifying future-proof market opportunities, integrating resource efficiency and climate resilience into the business model, and considering upstream (supply chain) and downstream (packaging, disposal) greening opportunities.\nExample Modules: Design Thinking, Market Research, BMC (with green metrics), Supply Chain & Operations, Ideation, Reframe, Prototyping.\nCluster B: Finance, Impact & Risk\n\nFocus: Conducting ROI calculations on green investments, measuring operational efficiency, tracking sustainability metrics (including triple bottom line), managing climate/environmental risks, and exploring green financing opportunities.\nExample Modules: Cost Model, Revenue Model, Record Keeping, Risk & Crisis Management, Business Ethics, Financing Alternatives.\nCluster C: Green Communications, Sales & Partnerships\n\nFocus: Crafting compelling value propositions and marketing messages that highlight environmental benefits, building green brands, and forming partnerships with sustainability networks or eco-conscious stakeholders.\nExample Modules: Marketing Strategy, The Pitch, Communication, Sales, Branding, Networking & Partnerships, Continuous Innovation.\nCross-Cutting Themes\nLeadership & Team Building: Incorporating sustainability culture, leadership styles, and hiring for green competencies (ties into all clusters).\nTriple Bottom Line & Ethics: Ensuring the “3P” framework (people, planet, profit) is woven throughout.\nContinuous Innovation & Mindset: Making sure greening isn’t a one-time tweak, but an ongoing strategic advantage.\n2. Master Alignment Table\nBelow is an example of how you might structure a condensed alignment table. You can expand it as needed for all modules.

For each module, show the exact paragraph or bullet from their suggestions, and the corresponding adaptation in your updated curriculum.\n\n3. Proposed Slides for Presentation\nBelow is an outline of slide headings and talking points you can use to walk the client through the updated approach.\n\nSlide 1: Title & Objectives\nTitle: “Integrating Green & Climate-Resilient Practices: Curriculum Adaptation for [Program Name]”\nObjectives:\nDemonstrate how we’ve incorporated the client’s sustainability feedback.\nPresent updated clusters and resources.\nDiscuss next steps for implementation.\nSlide 2: Why Sustainability Matters\nKey Points:\n“Green is not just a moral imperative—it's a business advantage.”\nLocal relevance: reference Iraqi climate challenges (e.g., water scarcity, energy).\nROI and resilience benefits.\nSlide 3: Updated Clusters Overview\nClusters:\nMarket, Model & Supply Chain\nFinance, Impact & Risk\nGreen Communications, Sales & Partnerships\nEmphasize that these clusters run across the program months (not just a 9-day pilot).\nSlide 4: Mapping Client Modules to Clusters\nShow a simplified version of the alignment table.\nHighlight a few key modules as examples (e.g., BMC, Cost Model, Risk Management).\nSlide 5: Worksheet & Tools (Sample Snapshots)\nBriefly showcase 1–2 worksheets from each cluster (e.g., “Sustainable BMC,” “Environmental Cost-Benefit Analysis,” “Strategic Messaging Framework”).\nEmphasize their practical, business-focused design.\nSlide 6: Changes Based on Client Feedback\nDirectly quote or show call-outs from the client’s suggestions.\nE.g., “You mentioned including climate considerations in Reframe (#5). Here is how we did that…”\nSlide 7: Implementation Timeline\nDemonstrate a multi-month timeline for how these modules will be delivered.\nShow how you’ll integrate sustainability consistently (e.g., monthly follow-ups, milestone tracking).\nSlide 8: Expected Outcomes\nQuantitative: Reduced energy costs, improved ROI, decreased waste.\nQualitative: Enhanced brand credibility, investor interest, strong leadership on sustainability.\nSlide 9: Next Steps & Requests\nSummarize immediate actions (e.g., finalizing resources, scheduling training sessions).\nInvite client feedback on any remaining details.\nSlide 10: Questions & Discussion\nEncourage open dialogue and further suggestions.\n4. Five Key Questions to Improve Your Work\nHow deeply does the client want us to explore local regulatory/incentive frameworks?\nShould we include a dedicated session on Iraqi (or MENA) green regulations and funding sources?\nAre there specific sectors (e.g., agriculture, tech, manufacturing) where the client wants deeper sustainability toolkits?\nSo we can create sector-specific examples or worksheets.\nHow can we incorporate ongoing mentorship or coaching on sustainability after each workshop?\nShould we plan follow-up 1:1 sessions to track each startup’s progress?\nWould the client like to feature local success stories or invite guest speakers who have successfully implemented green solutions?\nThis could bolster credibility and motivation.\nWhat metrics are most important for the client to showcase program success—financial savings, environmental impact, or participant satisfaction?\nThis will guide our final monitoring & evaluation framework.\nHow to Use This Deliverable\nIn Your Presentation: Copy the slides outline, integrate the alignment table (or a simplified version), and point to the cluster/worksheet expansions.\nIn Written Reports: Insert the alignment table as an appendix showing detailed mapping from the client’s PDF to your new clusters, ensuring they see their feedback has been thoroughly addressed.\nBy organizing your presentation around these updated clusters, the alignment table, and concrete worksheets, you’ll demonstrate that you’ve listened closely to the client’s requests—and have systematically woven their suggestions into a coherent, business-driven sustainability curriculum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you incorporate elements from the greencomp competency framework here:\n[[[1. Introduction\nEnsuring a fair and decent livelihood for all people,\nregenerating nature and enabling biodiversity to\nthrive, have never been more important. It is one of\nthe most pressing duties that humanity faces. This\nrequires shifting away from unsustainable practices\nand placing value on the environment on which our\nfuture as a species and our planet’s future depend.\nThis systemic change cannot be achieved only\nthrough political agreements, financial incentives or\ntechnological innovations, important and necessary\nthough they are. Long-lasting change requires life-\nlong learning1\n.\nCreating opportunities to enable learning for envi-\nronmental sustainability has therefore become cru-\ncial for the present and the future of our planet. The\necological crisis affects everyone and all aspects of\nsociety. Having a common understanding can be\na catalyst for action and for a shared strategy on\nlearning for environmental sustainability so that we\ncan understand, act on and resolve this crisis to-\ngether. Timely strategic action is necessary to help\nEuropeans participate fully in the green transition\nof our economy and society, rather than simply re-\nacting to it. Learning for environmental sustainabil-\nity is part of this strategic action.\nA competence-based education that helps learners\ndevelop sustainability skills based on knowledge\nand attitudes can help promote responsible action\nand stimulate willingness to take or demand action\nat local, national and global level. Becoming com-\npetent in sustainability issues will enable learners\novercome the cognitive dissonance that comes\nfrom knowing about an issue but lacking the agen-\ncy to act.\nThe European Commission is committed to meeting\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)ii, and\nquality education (SDG 4) is key to achieve all SDGs.\nIn line with the critical role of lifelong learning2, de-\nveloping sustainability competences through edu-\ncation and training has become a policy objective\nfor the EU and its Member States. Sustainability is\none of the European Commission’s key priorities in\neducation and training for 2019 – 20243\n.\nThe European Green Deal (2019)4, the European\nSkills Agenda for Sustainable Competitiveness, So-\ncial Fairness and Resilience (2020)5, and Achieving\nthe European Education Area by 2025 (2020)6 have\nunderscored the need to develop a European com-\npetence framework on sustainability. The EU bio-\ndiversity strategy for 2030: ‘Bringing Nature Back\ninto our Lives’ (2020)7 also highlights the important\nrole education and training have for Europe to be-\ncome a climate-neutral continent by 2050.\nThe European Commission has developed Green-\nComp as a reference framework on sustainability\ncompetences at EU level. It provides a common\nground to learners and guidance to educators, pro-\nviding an agreed definition of what sustainability as\na competence entails. Such a shared understanding\ncan act as a catalyst for learning for environmental\nsustainability by supporting education and training\ninstitutions to develop, review and adapt their vision\nand practices with regard to teaching and learning\nfor sustainability.\nii https://sdgs.un.org/goals.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n6\n1.1 Aims\n1.2 Methodology\nGreenComp can support education and training sys-\ntems in shaping systemic and critical thinkers who\ncare about our planet’s present and its future. All 12\ncompetences of the framework are applicable to all\nlearners, irrespective of their age and their educa-\ntion level and in any education settings – formal,\nnon-formal and informal. The proposed model can\ncomplement and strengthen existing international,\nnational, regional and local efforts to capture sus-\ntainability competences. Its added value is that it\nprovides:\n-\na model of sustainability competence ar-\neas and competences;\n-\na common reference that everyone working\nin education and training for environmental sustain-\nability can use, share and refer to;\n-\nan initial list of competence components,\nnamely knowledge, skills and attitudesiii, as exam-\nples of how to put the competences into practice;\n-\na common reference basis for dialogue, ex-\nchange of practices and peer learning among edu-\ncators involved in lifelong learning across the EU;\n-\na contribution to help make the compe-\ntences portable and promote mobility in the EU for\na full participation in European society.\nThe European sustainability competence framework\nis the result of consensus building based on a mixed\nmethod research processiv. This process has led to\nthe gradual and progressive refinement of Green-\nComp and, ultimately, the consolidated framework\nset out in this report. To achieve this, a diverse\ngroup of approximately 75 experts and stakehold-\ners was consulted at different stages to obtain their\nfeedback and progressively reach a consensus. The\ngroup included experts on sustainability education\nand lifelong learning from academia and research\ninstitutions, youth representatives, educators, policy\nrepresentatives from EU Member States and NGOs.\nThe steps taken to develop the GreenComp frame-\nwork are shown in Figure 1.\niii We adopt the definition of competence following the 2018\nCouncil Recommendation on Key Competences for lifelong learning,\nwhereby a competence is “a dynamic combination of the knowledge,\nskills and attitudes” (p.12). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/\nEN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2018.189.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=O-\nJ:C:2018:189:TOC\niv A similar method was used successfully in adopting other\nEuropean competence frameworks developed by the Commission,\nsuch as DigComp; the European framework for digital competence\nEntreComp , the European framework for entrepreneurship compe-\ntence; and LifeComp , the European framework for ‘Personal, social\nand learning to learn’. They form part of the eight competences of the\n2018 Council Recommendation on lifelong learning.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n7\nFigure 1. Main steps to develop GreenComp.\nThe framework was developed through the follow-\ning steps.\n-\nScoping studies were conducted, which in-\ncluded a literature review by Guia Bianchi (2020)8\nand a complementary study by Chiara Scalabrino\n(2021, forthcoming).\n-\nFour competence areas including a list of\ncompetences and their components were identified\nand put forward, constituting a draft proposal for\nthe framework.\n-\nAn expert workshop was held, where the\npreliminary material was presented and discussed\nby experts on sustainability education and lifelong\nlearningv\n.\nKey takeaways from the first expert work-\nshop: Experts endorsed the initiative of building a\nsustainability competence framework for lifelong\nlearning to complement existing sustainability\nframeworks which mainly target higher education.\nIt was argued that this framework should focus\non specific competences for sustainability, while it\nshould be left to other frameworks (including those\nalready developed by the Commission) to describe\ncross-cutting or generic competences which may be\nrelevant, but not exclusive, to sustainability.\nRegarding competence areas, experts highlight-\ned the importance of sustainability values in re-\nlation to other competences. They highlighted the\nneed to change vocabulary for the area focused on\nproblem solving and finding solutions, in favour of\naction-based competences and the acknowledge-\nment that ‘wicked’ sustainability problems, i.e. high-\nly complex and ill-structured problems9, cannot,\nstrictly speaking, be solved.\nFurthermore, experts suggested using the word\n‘sustainability’ rather than ‘environmental sustain-\nability’ to acknowledge the multidimensionality of\nthis concept.\nv A background document was sent to experts ahead of that\nworkshop and a debrief was drafted as a result.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n8\n-\nThe framework was consolidated in a re-\nvised draft proposal, comprising four competence\nareas and 12 competences. Its consolidation was\nbased on feedback collected during the workshop\nand afterwards by engaging in an ongoing dialogue\nwith experts.\n-\nAn update of the proposal was enabled\nthanks to a set of knowledge-skill-attitude (KSA)\nstatements being developed for each competence,\nwhich helped refine their scope and update the\ncompetence framework. These statements can be\nfound in Appendix 1.\n-\nA second expert workshop was held to re-\nfine the frameworkvi\n.\nname GreenComp, on its phonetics and simplicity in\nterms of the alternatives proposed earlier. Green-\nComp was accepted in its current version.\nAll stakeholders agreed that individual competence\nframeworks needed to be presented as part of a\ncomprehensive vision, where learner outcomes are\ndeveloped across the board. In addition, follow-up\nactivities were discussed.\n-\nGreenComp is published together with the\nCommission’s proposal for a Council recommen-\ndation on learning for environmental sustainability\nand the accompanying staff working document.\nKey takeaways from the second expert\nworkshop: Experts endorsed the framework pre-\nsented in September 2021, with the possibility to\nadopt minor revisions suggested before its finalisa-\ntion.\nMost experts felt that the scope of some KSA state-\nments needed refining, while the language used in\nthese statements needed simplifying. These state-\nments should be all-encompassing but at the same\ntime user-friendly and applicable to different edu-\ncation levels.\nExperts advised that competences should be re-\nfined by better aligning their descriptions to their\nareas. In addition, they encouraged a metaphor and\nnarrative to be developed around the framework.\n1.3 Limitations\n-\nThe conceptual framework was refined\nbased on comments received during or shortly after\nthe second workshop.\n-\nA third workshop was held with stakehold-\ners from Member States to validate the conceptual\nframeworkvii\n.\nKey takeaways from the third workshop\nheld with stakeholders: Stakeholders broadly\nendorsed GreenComp in its current version as well\nas its accompanying metaphor. They agreed on the\nvi A background document was sent to experts together with\na spreadsheet for feedback.\nvii A background document was sent to invited stakeholders\nand a debrief was drafted as a result.\nAlthough widely endorsed by subject-matter ex-\nperts and representative of different stakeholder\ngroups, the framework has not yet been tested in\na real setting. Putting GreenComp into practice, by\nrolling it out and evaluating it in a specific context,\ncould and should lead to amending and refining it\nbased on feedback from practitioners and end us-\ners. The framework should thus be treated as a liv-\ning document.\nAnother challenge is the wide scope of this frame-\nwork, targeting all people, from young children to\nadults, thus touching upon different educational set-\ntings. Moreover, due to the vast and rapidly evolving\nnature of the sustainability concept, this framework\ndepicts competences necessary for sustainability\nas an overarching topic. Therefore, subfields are not\ndirectly addressed in this context. Some examples\nof these competences include but are not limited\nto, responsible production and consumption, com-\npetences for the circular economy, or competences\nfor specific education levels. Future developments\nin these directions can very well be envisaged on\nthe basis of GreenComp.\nLearning for environmental sustainability is essential\nto achieve a sustainability mindset and trigger the\nwillingness to act for a sustainable future. However,\neducation and training, including this competence\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n9\nframework, only form part of the puzzle. Systemic\nchange towards sustainability is a global necessity\nand a shared responsibility. Investments in research\nand innovation, laws and regulations, technological\neco-innovations, transparency and accountability\nby companies and global value chains are required\nto achieve a comprehensive change. Individual be-\nhaviour should be supported by enabling measures\nand contexts that are all designed by, with, and for\nthe people and the planet.\n1.4 Structure of the report\nFollowing the introduction, Chapter 2 introduces\nthe terminology and concepts that form the basis\nof GreenComp, namely its definition; an overview of\nhow people learn for environmental sustainability;\nand the definition of a sustainability competence.\nChapter 3 introduces GreenComp, with its four\ncompetence areas, 12 sustainability competences\nand related descriptors. Section 3.1 introduces the\nmetaphor used to illustrate GreenComp.\nChapter 4 provides descriptions of the competence\nareas and the sustainability competences. This is\nfollowed by how they are applied in practice.\nChapter 5 describes options for further develop-\nment.\nAppendix 1 presents use cases, which aim to show\nhow the 12 sustainability competences are equally\nimportant and interrelated when it comes to think-\ning, planning, and acting to achieve sustainabil-\nity. Appendix 2 contains the list of competence\ncomponents, namely knowledge, skill and attitude\nstatements developed to define and refine the sus-\ntainability competences.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n10\n2. Defining sustainability\n2.1 A working definition of\nsustainability\nThere is broad consensus that sustainability themes\nneed to be embedded in lifelong learning. However,\nsustainability is a complex concept to define and is\nvery ambiguous10\n.\nSustainability means different things to different\ngroups of people at different times11. Often,\nsustainability and sustainable developmentviii are\nused interchangeably, despite their conceptual\ndifference. As claimed by UNESCO12, sustainability\nis best described as a long-term goal, such\nas attaining a more sustainable world, while\nviii As expressed in the UN’s ‘Our Common Future’ (or\nBrundtland Report), 1987.\nFigure 2.

Reprinted with permission from AAAS.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n11\nsustainable development, like the word suggests,\nrefers to the many processes and pathways used\nto stimulate development, or achieve progress,\nin sustainable ways. For example, the SDGsix are\nglobal goals encouraging all countries and sectors\nto work in collaboration to eventually achieve\nsustainability by addressing challenges related to\nsustainable development.\nIn this report, we use the following working defini-\ntion for sustainability:\nSustainability means prioritising the needs of\nall life forms and of the planet by ensuring that\nhuman activity does not exceed planetary bound-\naries.\nPlanetary boundaries describe how human activi-\nties, based on fossil fuel use, cause or accelerate\ndetrimental changes to the planet. Scientists have\nidentified nine Earth system processes that need to\nbe monitored and not crossed13, such as (Figure 2):\ni) biosphere integrity, ii) land-use change, iii) climate\nchange, iv) freshwater use, v) ocean acidification,\nvi) biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phospho-\nrus cycles), vii) atmospheric aerosol pollution, viii)\nstratospheric ozone depletion, and ix) release of\nnovel chemicals.\n2.2 Sustainability compe-\ntences\nlearning programmes remains up to individual insti-\ntutions and local educational leaders. Furthermore,\nresearch conducted so far has tended to be at the\nhigher education level, focusing on what compe-\ntences young graduates and professionals need to\npossess in order to contribute to sustainability chal-\nlenges and opportunities16\n.\nGreenComp maps sustainability as a competence\nrelevant to all ages. The sustainability competence\ndefined by GreenComp unfolds into a set of sub-el-\nements that we refer to as competences for sus-\ntainability.\nGreenComp has adopted the following statement\nto define a sustainability competence:\nA sustainability competence empowers\nlearners to embody sustainability values, and\nembrace complex systems, in order to take or\nrequest action that restores and maintains eco-\nsystem health and enhances justice, generating\nvisions for sustainable futures.\nThis definition focuses on developing sustainability\nknowledge, skills and attitudes for learners so they\ncan think, plan and act with sustainability in mind,\nto live in tune with the planet. All types of learning\n– formal, non-formal, and informal – are considered\nas vectors for developing this competence in early\nchildhood, through harvesting it as young kids and\nteenagers, to putting it into context as young adults\nand continuously nurturing it as adults. Sustainabil-\nity as a competence applies to all spheres of life,\nboth on personal and collective levels.\nIn the early 2000s, several European countries\nstarted to shift their education and training systems\nfrom a knowledge- to a more competence-based\napproach in their national curricula.\nWith such a shift, experts in higher education start-\ned to map the specific competences on sustainabil-\nity for students and professionals so they could be-\ncome agents of change for sustainability. While in\nthe literature there is widespread agreement over\nwhat the necessary competences for sustainability\nare14,15, adopting and embedding them in lifelong\n2.3 Teaching and learning\nsustainability competences\nSince emerging in the 1960s, sustainability educa-\ntion and related conceptsx has often been associ-\nated with transformative learning17, as it aims to\nix SDGs can be consulted here: https://sdgs.un.org/goals\nx Sustainability education is used as an umbrella term for\ndifferent related concepts such as environmental education, education\nfor sustainable development, education for sustainability, and ecologi-\ncal education, and so forth.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n12\nprofoundly change our perspectives, beliefs and\nbehaviour through reflecting on what we know and\ndo not know. It encourages us to question how we\ninterpret our surroundings and the role we play in\nthem18. Sustainability education aims to provide\nlearners with sustainability competences in order\nto reflect and embrace sustainability in their daily\nlives as students, consumers, producers, profession-\nals, activists, policymakers, neighbours, employees,\nteachers and trainers, organisations, communities,\nand society at large.\nThe platform provided by UN Decade of Education\nfor Sustainable Development (DESD, 2005-2014)\nhelped highlight this message at the global level.\nThis led to education for sustainable developmentxi\nbeing embedded in Target 4.7 of SDG 4, whose\nobjective is to “ensure that all learners acquire the\ncompetences, such as knowledge and skills needed\nto promote sustainable development”. SDG 4 is un-\nderstood to be a critical goal that must be achieved\nin order for the other 16 SDGs to be achieved.\nIn view of this, education is intrinsically intertwined\nwith sustainability at all levels through competences\nembedded across the curriculum. It recognises how\nsustainability aspects (environmental, social, cul-\ntural and economic) are interrelated and how they\nare interlinked and embedded within disciplines and\nsubjects. Sustainability education is then viewed in\nthe same light as transformative learning as its aim\nis to change the person and the social institution\nthrough a holistic approach19. In this report, we re-\nfer to the pillars and principles of sustainability edu-\ncation through the term learning for environmental\nsustainability in line with what has been set out in\nthe Commission’s proposal for a Council recommen-\ndation on learning for environmental sustainability.\nLearning encompasses both education and training.\nWe define it as the following:\nLearning for environmental sustainability\naims to nurture a sustainability mindset from\nchildhood to adulthood with the understanding\nthat humans are part of and depend on nature.\nLearners are equipped with knowledge, skills\nand attitudes that help them become agents of\nchange and contribute individually and collectively\nto shaping futures within planetary boundaries.\nLearning for environmental sustainability has the\npotential to be a catalyst for change among young\nand adult generations, through the acquisition of\nsustainability competences.\nxi See Bianchi, 2020, for an overview on the evolution and\nconceptualisation of sustainability education and education for sus-\ntainable development.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n13\n3. The European sustainability competence framework\nGreenComp consists of four competence ‘areas’\nthat correspond to the definition of sustainabili-\nty; and the 12 ‘competences’ that, taken together,\nmake up the building blocks of the sustainability\ncompetence for all people.\nThe two dimensions are listed in Table 1. Each com-\npetence is accompanied by a descriptor that best\nrepresents its main aspects.\nTable 1. GreenComp areas, competences, and descriptors.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n14\nAREA COMPETENCE DESCRIPTOR\n1. Embodying sustainability\nvalues\n1.1 Valuing\nsustainability\nTo reflect on personal values; identify and explain\nhow values vary among people and over time, while\ncritically evaluating how they align with sustainability\nvalues.\n1.2 Supporting\nfairness\nTo support equity and justice for current and future\ngenerations and learn from previous generations for\nsustainability.\n1.3 Promoting\nnature\nTo acknowledge that humans are part of nature; and\nto respect the needs and rights of other species and\nof nature itself in order to restore and regenerate\nhealthy and resilient ecosystems.\n2. Embracing complexity in\nsustainability\n2.1 Systems\nthinking\nTo approach a sustainability problem from all\nsides; to consider time, space and context in order\nto understand how elements interact within and\nbetween systems.\n2.2 Critical\nthinking\nTo assess information and arguments, identify\nassumptions, challenge the status quo, and reflect\non how personal, social and cultural backgrounds\ninfluence thinking and conclusions.\n2.3 Problem\nframing\nTo formulate current or potential challenges as a\nsustainability problem in terms of difficulty, people\ninvolved, time and geographical scope, in order to\nidentify suitable approaches to anticipating and\npreventing problems, and to mitigating and adapting\nto already existing problems.\nAREA COMPETENCE DESCRIPTOR\n3. Envisioning sustainable\nfutures\n3.1 Futures lit-\neracy\nTo envision alternative sustainable futures by im-\nagining and developing alternative scenarios and\nidentifying the steps needed to achieve a preferred\nsustainable future.\n3.2 Adaptability\nTo manage transitions and challenges in complex\nsustainability situations and make decisions related\nto the future in the face of uncertainty, ambiguity\nand risk.\n3.3 Exploratory\nthinking\nTo adopt a relational way of thinking by exploring\nand linking different disciplines, using creativity and\nexperimentation with novel ideas or methods.\n4. Acting for sustainability\n4.1 Political\nagency\nTo navigate the political system, identify political\nresponsibility and accountability for unsustainable\nbehaviour, and demand effective policies for sustain-\nability.\n4.2 Collective\naction To act for change in collaboration with others.\n4.3 Individual\ninitiative\nTo identify own potential for sustainability and to ac-\ntively contribute to improving prospects for the com-\nmunity and the planet.\nIn Table 1, competence areas and competences are\nnumbered for ease of reference. However this does\nnot imply a sequence of acquisition nor a hierarchy.\nAll 12 competences are equally important: learners\nare encouraged to develop all of them.\nThe four competence areas are tightly interrelated:\nshould be treated as parts of a whole. While we\nencourage learners to acquire the 12 competenc-\nes, they do not need to acquire the highest level of\nproficiency in all 12, nor have the same proficiency\nacross all of them. Indeed, GreenComp implies that\nsustainability as a competence is made of 12 build-\nTable 1. GreenComp areas, competences, and descriptors.\ning blocks.\nsustainability as a competence encompasses all\nfour taken together. The 12 sustainability compe-\ntences are also interrelated and interconnected, and\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n15\n3.1 Visualisation\nFigure 3 provides a visual representation of\nGreenComp. It builds on bee pollination as a\nmetaphor for the framework where bees, flowers,\nnectar and beehives represent the four areas of\nthe framework. As a simile of a highly-developed\nnatural system, the metaphor highlights the\ninterplay and dynamics between the four areas and\n12 competences of GreenComp.\nBees represent the competences related to the\narea ‘acting for sustainability’: political agency, col-\nlective action, and individual initiative. Bees act as\nboth individuals and a collective organism. Each bee\nplays a vital role to ensure that the colony functions\nwhile they all work together to achieve the same\ngoal.\nFlowers represent the competences related to the\narea ‘envisioning sustainable futures’: futures liter-\nacy, adaptability, and exploratory thinking. Flowers\ngenerate fruits and fruits generate seeds so life can\ncontinue.\nThe beehive represents the competences related\nto the area ‘embodying sustainability values’: valu-\ning sustainability, supporting fairness, and promot-\ning nature. The beehive protects and sustains the\nbees.\nPollen and nectar represent the competences\nrelated to the area ‘embracing complexity in sus-\ntainability’: systems thinking, critical thinking, and\nproblem framing. Pollen and nectar attract bees to\nflowers, and bees transport the pollen from flower\nto flower while harvesting food for their colony. The\ninterdependencies between pollen, bees and flow-\ners ensure the survival of both plants and bees.\nFigure 3. Visual representation of GreenComp.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n16\n4. Competence areas and competences\n4.1 Embodying\nsustainability values\nThe competence area ‘Embodying sustainability\nvalues’ encourages us to reflect on and challenge\nour own personal values and world-views in terms\nof unsustainability, and sustainability values and\nworld-views. This area advocates equity and justice\nfor current and future generationsxii, while support-\ning the view that humans are a part of nature.\nSocioecological problems are wicked problems, be-\ncause they involve interlinked complex systems,\nsuch as the natural systems and the social systems\nincluding technological, political and economic sys-\ntems. Our understanding of such complex problems\nlies, at least in part, in normative assumptions of\nthe world, and in how we interpret social, political\nand ethical decisions20\n.\nKnowledge is often seen as value-free21, which is\nbased on the idea that it only stems from rigorous\nevidence-based processes that lead to objectivi-\nty, precision, acceptability and universality22. Yet,\nour rationality is limited as our values and world-\nviews shape our perception and understanding of\nthe world at all times, including our perception and\nunderstanding of sustainability problems23. While\ndescriptive knowledge explains reality through\nfacts, normative knowledge on sustainability aims\nto identify how the world should look24\n.\nSustainability competences such as systems think-\ning and futures literacy are useful when linked to\nsustainability values, as otherwise such compe-\ntences could be used for unsustainable actions25,26\n.\nBy fostering sustainability values such as equity\nand justice for current and future generations and\npreservation and restoration of nature27, learning\nfor environmental sustainability can help shape a\nmore sustainable future for communities and so-\ncieties.\nWhen learners are encouraged to reflect and ques-\ntion knowledge acquisition, assimilate it, and put it\ninto practice, transformative learning takes place28\n.\nSuch learning involves cognitive (head), psychomo-\ntor (hands) and affective (heart) domains29 and en-\ncourages reflection, questioning and action. Trans-\nformative learning is learner-centred, therefore\npromoting student agency30\n.\n4.1.1 Valuing sustainability\nDescriptor (1.1): To reflect on personal values;\nidentify and explain how values vary among peo-\nple and over time, while critically evaluating how\nthey align with sustainability values\nValuing sustainability aims to foster reflection on\nvalues and perspectives in relation to concerns for\nsustainability. In this context, learners can articulate\ntheir values and consider their alignment with sus-\ntainability as the common goal.\nValuing sustainability could be defined as a meta-\ncompetence, since its primary aim is not to teach\nspecific values, but make learners realise that\nvalues are constructs and people can choose which\nvalues to prioritise in their lives31\n.\nValuing sustainability enables learners to reflect on\ntheir way of thinking, their plans, and their actions.\nIt asks them whether these cause any harm and are\nin line with sustainability values and thus contribute\nto sustainability. It offers learners an opportunity\nto discuss and reflect on values, their variety and\nxii Intra- and intergenerational equity and justice.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n17\nculture-dependence.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows the main views on sustainability:\nanthropocentrism (human-centric), technocen-\ntrism (technological solutions to ecological prob-\nlems) and ecocentrism (nature-centred), and how\nthey influence assumptions and arguments;\nS: can articulate and negotiate sustainabil-\nity values, principles and objectives while recog-\nnising different viewpoints;\nA: is prone to acting in line with values and\nprinciples for sustainability.\nFor example: Given the apparent tensions be-\ntween sustainability and consumerism based on\nthe use of natural resources, everybody should be\nable to contemplate what impact buying fast fash-\nion or taking a flight for a weekend getaway would\nhave at system level (SDG 12).\nimportance of preserving nature for future genera-\ntions and for nature itself.\nSupporting fairness as a competence can be fos-\ntered by promoting responsibility in collaborative\nactivities and teamwork, while acknowledging and\nrespecting other view points34\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows that ethical concepts and justice\nfor current and future generations are related to\nprotecting nature;\nS: can apply equity and justice for current\nand future generations as criteria for environ-\nmental preservation and the use of natural re-\nsources;\nA: is committed to respecting the interests\nof future generations.\nFor example: The ‘Stop Ecocide Foundation’ ini-\ntiative has been drafting a law on offences against\nthe environment, or ecocide, which is defined as\n‘unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowl-\nedge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe\nand widespread or long-term damage to the envi-\nronment being caused by those acts’xiii (SDGs 14,\n15, 16). Examples of ecocide include deforestation\nof the Amazon or the killing of protected species.\n4.1.2 Supporting fairness\nDescriptor (1.2): To support equity and justice\nfor current and future generations and learn from\nprevious generations for sustainability\nSupporting fairness is about promoting equity and\njustice among present and future generations, while\nlearning from past traditions and actions. Starting\nfrom the premise that human health is intrinsical-\nly linked to planetary health, this competence can\nhelp learners understand that environmental qual-\nity is linked to equity and justice32. Access to green\nspaces can reduce health-related socio-economic\ninequalities33. Environmental equity and justice im-\nply, therefore, human equity and justice.\nYet supporting fairness is not only about promoting\nenvironmental justice and equity to improve human\nhealth. In line with the competence ‘promoting na-\nture’, supporting fairness is also about taking into\naccount the interests and capabilities of other spe-\ncies and environmental ecosystems, as well as the\n4.1.3 Promoting nature\nDescriptor (1.3): To acknowledge that\nhumans are part of nature; and to respect\nthe needs and rights of other species\nand of nature itself in order to restore\nand regenerate healthy and resilient\necosystems\nPromoting nature is about developing\nempathy towards the planet and show-\ning care for other species. This requires\nknowledge about the main parts of the\nxiii https://www.stopecocide.earth/legal-definition\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n18\nnatural environment (geosphere, biosphere,\nhydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere)\nand the close links and interdependence\nbetween living organisms and non-living\ncomponents. Knowledge about natural\nphenomena can spur us on to more closely\nconnect with nature, which in turn can motivate\nfurther learning for sustainability.\nPromoting nature fosters a healthy relationship\nwith the natural environment and aims to ignite in\npeople a feeling of connectedness that can help\ncontrast the psychological distress and negative\nemotions that children and young people world-\nwide experience because of climate change35 and\ncan help improve their mood and mental health36\n.\nThe ‘nature deficit disorder’ conveys the human\ncosts of alienation from nature: i) decreased use of\nthe senses, ii) attention difficulties, iii) higher rates\nof physical and emotional illnesses, iv) a rising rate\nof myopia, v) increased child and adult obesity, and\nvi) increased vitamin D deficiency37. Research indi-\ncates that to overcome the ‘nature deficit disorder’\nnot only do we need to be in contact with nature,\nbut we also need to feel connected to nature38\n.\nWhile the former involves physical interaction with\nthe natural environment mainly at surface level,\nthe latter concerns our feelings and views resulting\nfrom meaningful relationships being developed and\nthe internalisation of our experiences in the natu-\nral environment, e.g. with animals, plants or places.\nSuch internalisation can, in the long term, promote\nrestoration of nature39\n.\nFor example: The Nature Conservancy – a global\nenvironmental non-profit organisation – believes\nthat helping young people build relationships with\nnature (SDG 4) is critical to ensure a more sustain-\nable future (SDGs 15, 3, 11). The Nature Lab, the\nNature Conservancy’s youth curriculum platform,\nprovides educational resources for different age\ngroups to teach them how nature works and how\nyoung people can contribute to its conservationxiv\n.\n4.2 Embracing complexity\nin sustainability\nThe competence area ‘Embracing complexity in\nsustainability’ is about:\n-\nempowering learners with systemic and\ncritical thinking, and encouraging them to reflect on\nhow to better assess information and challenge un-\nsustainability;\n-\nscanning systems by identifying intercon-\nnections and feedback; and\n-\nframing challenges as sustainability\nproblems which helps us learn about the scale\nof a situation while identifying everyone\ninvolved.\nTechnological change, digitisation, and\nglobalisation have increased our society’s\ncomplexity and accelerated socioecological prob-\nlems such as climate change and loss of biodiver-\nsity. Environmental challenges are interconnected\nand interlinked to economic activities and societal\nlifestyles40. The operation of our economy, con-\ntained within our society (see Figure 4), depends on\nour planet which has limited resources and bound-\naries41\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows that our wellbeing, health and se-\ncurity depend on the wellbeing of nature;\nS: can assess own impact on nature and\nconsider the protection of nature an essential\ntask for every individual;\nA: cares about a harmonious relationship\nexisting between nature and humans.\nxiv The Nature Conservancy educational resources that pro-\nmote nature are available at https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/\nwho-we-are/how-we-work/youth-engagement/nature-lab/\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n19\nEnvironment\nSociety\nEconomy\nFigure 4.

However, minority groups and families\nwith a lower income are often exposed to polluted\nenvironments, which in turns affects their health\nand wellbeing. Identifying the connections between\nenvironmental issues and income inequality, which\nmay look unrelated at first superficially, can help us\ncorrectly frame such challenges as a sustainability\nproblem and take preventive or mitigating actions.\nunderstand reality in relation to other contexts (lo-\ncal, nation, global) and fields (environment, social,\neconomic, cultural). It is critical for advancing sus-\ntainability. Thinking in systems enables learners to\nidentify feedback mechanisms, intervention points\nand interactive trajectories. Systems thinking can\nbe understood as a tool for evaluating options, de-\ncision-making and taking action43. It is based on the\nassumption that parts of a system act differently\nwhen taken apart from the system. In fact, contrary\nto this, fragmentary thinking, i.e. analysing parts in\nisolation, instead of the whole interconnected sys-\ntem, increases short-termism and could led to an\noversimplification of sustainability problems which\nmay not correspond to reality.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows that every human action has envi-\nronmental, social, cultural and economic impacts;\nS: can describe sustainability as a holistic\nconcept that includes environmental, economic,\nsocial, and cultural issues;\nA: is concerned about the short- and long-\nterm impacts of personal actions on others and\nthe planet.\nFor example: Green technologies often promise\npositive outcomes for sustainability, yet they may\nhave unintended consequences when scaled up to\nthe system level (e.g. loss of biodiversity and in-\ncreased competition for land due to biofuel produc-\ntion)44. Without a comprehensive understanding\nof complex problems and potential solutions, such\nconsequences could be difficult to identify (multiple\nSDGs).\n4.2.1 Systems thinking\nDescriptor (2.1): To approach a sustainability\nproblem from all sides; to consider time, space\nand context in order to understand how elements\ninteract within and between systems\nEquipping learners with systems thinking is neces-\nsary to understand complex sustainability problems\nand their evolution.

Critical thinking is\na high-level cognitive process, which includes\nseveral skills needed for evaluating and under-\nstanding information regarding sustainability prob-\nlems. This enables learners to broaden their views\nwithout taking information and information sources\nfor granted. Eventually, learners should be comfort-\nable when acquiring and integrating information\nfrom different disciplines46. A critical outlook allows\nlearners to challenge, and change, their values, per-\nspectives and understanding of the world47\n.\nCritical thinking can help empower learners to be-\ncome more responsible and actively cooperate in\ncreating a sustainable world. More specifically,\nstepping up critical thinking will help them go be-\nyond just passively understanding sustainability\nconcepts48. It will help them develop the ability to\nreflect and assess theories and assumptions.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows sustainability claims without ro-\nbust evidence are often mere communication\nstrategies, also known as greenwashing;\nS: can analyse and assess arguments, ideas,\nactions and scenarios to determine whether they\nare in line with evidence and values in terms of\nsustainability;\nA: trusts science even when lacking some of\nthe knowledge required to fully understand scien-\ntific claims.\nFor example: A critical understanding of how fast\nfashion (SDG 12), poor labour conditions (SDGs 8,\n10), solid waste accumulation (SDGs 11, 12) and\npollution (multiple SDGs) are interrelated and un-\nderpin each other can help learners i) define the\nclass of problems they need to deal with, ii) identify\nthose involved, iii) adopt different perspectives, and\niv) identify paths for possible solutions.\n4.2.3 Problem framing\nDescriptor (2.3): To formulate current or po-\ntential challenges as a sustainability problem\nin terms of difficulty, people involved, time and\ngeographical scope, in order to identify suitable\napproaches to anticipating and preventing prob-\nlems, and to mitigating and adapting to already\nexisting problems\nProblem framing is the process of identifying actual\nor potential sustainability problems. It involves de-\nfining and structuring sustainability problems based\non their complexity and those mainly involved. Un-\nderstanding the nature of the actual or potential\nproblems we are trying to define, e.g. from simple\nto wicked problems, can be a major obstacle.\nExperts have identified four types of problems,\nbased on how well defined both the problem and\nsolution to address it are49 (see Figure 5). Differenti-\nating between these four types of problem can help\nidentify appropriate solutions.\nThis process also entails determining whether the\ncurrent situation is already a problem or has the po-\ntential to become one in the future.\nMost fundamentally, problem framing defines what\nis challenging about a given situation and identifies\nthe best action to address it, which involves systems\nthinking. In essence, problem framing helps define\ngoals and the direction the problem solving process\nshould take50. While sustainability problems are\ncomplex and often cannot be solved, appropriate\nsteps can be taken either to anticipate and prevent\nthem, or to mitigate and adapt them to an already\nexisting problem.\nProblem framing can help identify situations and\nframe them as current or potential problems for\nsustainability in a given context. This requires a crit-\nical understanding of socioecological systems. In\nturn, problem framing can help contextualise and\ndefine a sustainability problem in a given geograph-\nical and temporal context.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n21\nFigure 5. Problem characterisation and change required. Source: Glasser, 2018.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows that to identify fair and inclusive\nactions, it is necessary to look at sustainability\nproblems from different stakeholder perspectives;\nS: can establish a transdisciplinary ap-\nproach to framing current and potential sustain-\nability challenges;\nA: listens actively and shows empathy when\ncollaborating with others to frame current and\npotential sustainability challenges.\nFor example: The decline of bees and other pol-\nlinating insects can, for instance, be framed as a\nproblem related to food production security requir-\ning technical solutions in terms of agricultural man-\nagement (SDG 12) as opposed to a problem with\nmaintaining the renewal of nature threatened by\nthe overuse of its resources (SDGs 15, 12).\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n22\n4.3 Envisioning\nsustainable futures\nii. that it is impossible to know what will hap-\npen and thus the idea of trying to control what will\nhappen will be rejected;\niii. that they need to identify probable, alter-\nnative, and preferred futures;\niv. that they need to influence and shape the\ntrajectory towards a (collective) preferred future.\nThe competence area ‘Envisioning sustainabil-\nity futures’ enables learners to visualise alterna-\ntive future scenarios and identify actions to achieve\na sustainable future. It is essential that learners ac-\nquire the competence of ‘adaptability’ while coping\nwith uncertainty about the futures and trade-offs\nin sustainability. Applying creative and transdisci-\nplinary approaches to our way of thinking can fos-\nter a circular society and encourage learners to use\ntheir imagination when thinking about the future.\nLearning for environmental sustainability encourag-\nes people to move away from looking for certainties\nbut rather think about possibilities. It is fundamen-\ntal that learners understand the future as open and\nsomething that can be shaped collectively. This re-\nquires the ability to analyse the present time and\nunderstand that it comprises complex systems in-\nteracting and influencing current and future trajec-\ntories, which in turn are influenced by our values,\nworld-views and experiences.\nCreativity, imagination and being aware of our\nemotions and intuitions can inform our ability\nto envision alternative futures51. Learners are\nencouraged to use a combination of ‘logical\nanalysis and disciplined imagination’52. Information\nfrom several disciplines and traditions has the\npotential to help people make more informed\nplans and decisions in a complex society53. This\ncan help learners identify steps and explore plans\nto collectively shape a resilient and regenerative\nplanet.\nTherefore, learners are advised to think of a wide\nrange of possible future outcomes and envision\nalternative future scenarios for sustainability. By\nbecoming comfortable with the notion of multiple\nfutures, learners can acknowledge:\ni. the uncertainty about the future as a given,\nrather than assuming or denying it;\n4.3.1 Futures literacy\nDescriptor (3.1): To envision alternative sus-\ntainable futures by imagining and developing\nalternative scenarios and identifying the steps\nneeded to achieve a preferred sustainable future\nFutures literacy empowers learners to create their\nvisions for a sustainable future by providing them\nwith the knowledge, skills and attitudes to under-\nstand the futures as a variety of alternatives. Re-\nsearch commonly differentiates between three ap-\nproaches in order to understand the futures:\n-\nexpected future, i.e. what we expect to\nhappen based on what it is happening today and\nwhat we know, e.g. business as usual;\n-\nalternative future(s), i.e. what will happen\nmay differ from expectations, e.g. creation of green\njobs that currently do not exist;\n-\npreferred future, i.e. we may envision a\nsustainable future for us, our community and our\nplanet, and identify the steps and actions needed\nto achieve that future54, e.g. a circular economy.\nThrough futures literacy, learners can anticipate,\nprepare and invent as changes occur55\n. Futures lit-\neracy encourages learners to i) use their imagina-\ntion when thinking about the future, ii) tap into their\nintuitions and creativity, and iii) assess the possible\nsteps needed to achieve their preferred future. By\nusing real-life experiences, learners can be taught\nin futures methodologies that adopt qualitative\nand/or quantitative research methods.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n23\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows the difference between expected,\npreferred and alternative futures for sustainabili-\nty scenarios;\nS: can envisage alternative futures for sus-\ntainability that are grounded in science, creativity\nand values for sustainability;\nA: is aware that the projected consequences\non self and community may influence preferenc-\nes for certain scenarios above others.\nFor example: Prompting ‘futures literacy’ as a life\nskill for students and educators (SDG 4) is the mis-\nsion of the global non-profit organisation Teach the\nFuture. Thanks to their resources for lifelong learn-\ning, learners can imagine more sustainable futures,\nwhere, for example, communities have access to\nclean water, clean energy and healthy food (multi-\nple SDGs including 6, 7, 2).\ntions58. For cognitive adaptabil-\nity, this might involve better\nteaching people about the\nsignificance of a changing cli-\nmate. For behavioural adapt-\nability, this might involve promoting\npositive and constructive actions among\nyoung people that support and sustain\nthe environment, such as saving energy, re-\ncycling, harnessing clean energy, controlling water\nuse, and encouraging others at home and at school\nto do the same things.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows that human actions may have un-\npredictable, uncertain and complex consequenc-\nes for the environment;\nS: can take into account local circumstanc-\nes when dealing with sustainability issues and\nopportunities;\nA: is willing to discontinue unsustainable\npractices and try alternative solutions.\nFor example: Young people play a central role\nin driving the adaptation agenda. On 22 Janu-\nary 2021, young people from over 115 countries\nlaunched ‘Adapt for our Future’ a global youth call\nto action on adaptation. This initiative aims to pre-\npare younger generations for the transition towards\ngreen and climate resilient developmentxvi (SDG\n13).\n4.3.2 Adaptability\nDescriptor (3.2): To manage transitions and\nchallenges in complex sustainability situations\nand make decisions related to the future in the\nface of uncertainty, ambiguity and risk\nAdaptability is about being flexible and able to\nadapt to new situations and adjust in order to ac-\ncommodate changes in our complex world56. It is\nessential that learners be able to cope with uncer-\ntainty about the future and the ambiguity of wicked\nsustainability problems and how they may evolve.\nAdaptability should provide learners with the ability\nto cope with trade-offs in sustainability e.g. envi-\nronmental impacts and social outcomes as well as\neconomic aspects. Moreover, learners should feel\nempowered to consider options and make decisions\neven when facing contradictions and risks in terms\nof the future57\n.\nPeople can learn in order to acquire knowledge,\nwhich may result in them changing their opinions\nand behaviour, and learning to manage their emo-\nxvi 4.3.3 Exploratory thinking\nDescriptor (3.3): To adopt a relational\nway of thinking by exploring and linking different\ndisciplines, using creativity and experimentation\nwith novel ideas or methods\nExploratory thinking aims to foster creativity in\norder to envision alternative futures. By tapping\nThe call for action is available at https://klimaatadap-\ntatiegroningen.nl/en/young-people-call-on-world-leaders-to-adapt-\nfor-the-future\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n24\ninto different disciplines, traditions\nand cultures in a transdisciplinary\nmanner, exploratory thinking can help\nlearners create future visions for a circular econ-\nomy (SDG 12) and society (SDG 11). To move\naway from linear production and consumption\npatterns to circular ones, we need a combination\nof creative thinking and experimentation with new\nideas and new approaches.\nAs innovations that help achieve a circular econo-\nmy will change our society, they will also entail new\nways of social interaction and new cultural prac-\ntices. For example, online platforms for people to\nswap their clothes and share their cars, and avoid\nfood waste.\nExploratory thinking therefore requires cognitive\nprocesses and for people to use their intuition. The\nissues covered and the pedagogical approach-\nes taken in education on sustainability encourage\nlearners to develop abilities in creative thinking,\naccording to assertions emphasising the close links\nbetween the two59\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows that sustainability problems must\nbe tackled by combining different disciplines,\nknowledge cultures and divergent views to initi-\nate systemic change;\nS: can synthesise sustainability-related in-\nformation and data from different disciplines;\nA: angles.\nis committed to considering sustainabil-\nity challenges and opportunities from different\nFor example: ‘Reduce, reuse, recycle’ is a well-\nknown concept for the circular economy, and an ex-\nploratory thinking approach can help turn waste into\na precious resource. The Eco-Schools programme\nhas developed a number of trash hack ideas that\ncan help explore the issue of waste from different\nperspectivesxvii (SDG 12).\n4.4 Acting for\nsustainability\nActing for sustainability encourages learners to take\naction at individual and collective level to shape\nsustainable futures, to the extent possible. It also\ninvites learners to demand action from those re-\nsponsible to make change happen.\nThe last four decades have been warmer than any\npreceding one since 185060 and given the increase\nin human activities, this trend is unlikely to revert\nunless we take action to achieve systemic trans-\nformations.\nNecessary transformations for sustainability are\nnot only enabled by technological changes, but\nalso by cultural and social changes, as well as\nbehavioural shifts and institutional reforms61\n.\nAs such, a plethora of stakeholders at local level\nmust be actively engaged to shape and achieve\nglobal transformations for a more sustainable\nplanet62,xviii. Individuals make everyday decisions,\nwhich have impacts and consequences for\nsustainability, whether they are, e.g. students,\nconsumers, producers, employees, policymakers, or\nrepresentatives of organisations or communities.\nAltogether, these individuals can work together\nto create new paradigms that can lead to global\nsustainability63 through their individual initiatives,\nengagement and collaboration at community or\nregional level, or through global partnerships to\nachieve the SDGs.\nA sustainable planet cannot be achieved by small,\none-off actions on their own; a consistent and long-\nterm approach is required64. For example, decisions\non which type of mobility (SDG 11) we use or\nabout what energy providers we use for our home\nand office buildings (SDG 7) will have an impact\non the environment. In particular, circular products\nare made to last longer and be easier to repair by\nxvii https://www.ecoschools.global/trash-hack-ideas\nxviii For example, the JRC is currently developing innovation\nstrategies for sustainability (S4), a new generation of development\nstrategies for cities, regions and countries building on and substantial-\nly extending the smart specialisation approach.

Furthermore, it\ncan help us increase our positive contributions to\nthe environment68. Learning for environmental sus-\ntainability can help equip all individuals with knowl-\nedge, skills and attitudes to think, plan, and take or\nrequest action for sustainability (SDG 4 target 4.7).\n4.4.1 Political agency\nDescriptor (4.1): To navigate the political\nsystem, identify political responsibility and ac-\ncountability for unsustainable behaviour, and de-\nmand effective policies for sustainability\nPolitical agency is the capacity to positively influ-\nence the collective future, by mobilising those at\npolitical level to take action for change. Political\nagency requires the capacity to analyse the context,\nspot possible avenues to move the sustainability\nagenda forward, and identify key stakeholders that\ncan be brought on board to help achieve sustain-\nability.\nPolitical agency can be focused towards advocat-\ning for a change in norms, rules,\nregulations, and institutional\ncommitment for sustainability. Howev-\ner, it can also be directed towards the market and\ncan push for green innovation or the promotion of\nlifestyle and behavioural changes. The green tran-\nsition is one of the EU’s top strategic priorities, and\nthe role of governments in meeting the associat-\ned challenges has become increasingly important.\nMany Europeans demand action to tackle sustain-\nability problems from those responsible for mak-\ning and implementing policies, who are ultimately\nresponsible for our future and that of future gener-\nations. When asked who is responsible for tackling\nclimate change, Europeans from 17 Member States\nranked national governments first, while those from\nfive Member States ranked business and industry\nfirst, and those from the other five Member States\nranked the EU itself first69\n.\nPolitical agency empowers learners to become\nagents of change and take part in a discussion that\naffects their futures. Furthermore, it shows learners\nthat small actions can have widespread global\nrepercussions and that by engaging others with\nideas and activities that trigger reflection, everyone\ncan contribute to political agency.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows policies that assign responsibility\nfor environmental damage (e.g. ‘polluter pays’);\nS: can identify relevant social, political and\neconomic stakeholders in one’s own community\nand region to address a sustainability problem;\nA: demands political accountability for\nunsustainable behaviour.\nFor example: Grassroots examples of young\npeople, who have been especially vocal in\ndemanding political action by governments, include\nthe Friday for Future movementxx and Extinction\nRebellionxxi (SDGs 13, 16).\nxix print.html\nPeople can calculate the environmental impacts of their\nconsumption patterns at https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ConsumerFoot-\nxx https://fridaysforfuture.org/\nxxi https://rebellion.global/\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n26\n4.4.2 Collective action\nDescriptor (4.2): To act for change in collab-\noration with others\nCollective action as a competence stems from rec-\nognising that the role communities and civil society\norganisations play in achieving sustainability is fun-\ndamental70\n. Collective action calls for coordination,\ncollaboration and cooperation among peers. By act-\ning together and working to achieve the same goal,\npeople can find opportunities and meet challenges\nto contribute effectively to solving sustainability\nproblems at the local level. Taken together, this will\nhave an impact at the global level.\nCollective action develops learners’ ‘ability and will\nto take part in democratic processes concerning\nman’s use of and dependence on natural resources\nin a critical way’71\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and\nattitudes (A):\nK: knows how to work with diverse partici-\npants to create inclusive visions for a more sus-\ntainable future;\nS: can create transparent, inclusive and\ncommunity-driven processes;\nA: is willing to engage with others to chal-\nlenge the status quo.\nFor example: Collective action in the digital age\nhas increased and is enabled through technology,\ne.g. the European Education for Climate Coalitionxxii\n,\na digital platform that enables members of a com-\nmunity of practice to decide collectively, act collab-\noratively, and co-create solutions for sustainability\n(SDG 13).\n4.4.3 Individual initiative\nimproving prospects for the community and the\nplanet\nIndividual initiative relies on someone knowing what\ntypes of action are possible, having confidence in\ntheir own potential to influence change (internal lo-\ncus of control), and being willing to act72\n.\nRecognising what types of action are possible and\nbeing aware of one’s own potential in terms of\nsustainability problems are the first steps some-\none needs to take in order to seize the initiative\nas an individual. However, individual initiative does\nnot only rely on opportunities for action and some-\none’s self-awareness and self-efficacy. It also has\na strong attitudinal aspect – the willingness to act.\nIndividual initiative nurtures the entrepreneurial\nmindset of individuals and empowers them take\nthe initiative in their lives73. By taking action in their\npersonal sphere, individuals can act as agents of\nchange and role models, inspiring their peers to try\nto achieve sustainability. This could also help de-\nbunk myths on behaviour related to sustainability,\ne.g. a sustainable lifestyle is more expensive than a\nnon-sustainable one, and of a lower quality.\nFurthermore, individual initiative encourages peo-\nple to take preventive action when certain actions\nor inaction may have damaging consequences for\nhuman health and all life forms (precautionary prin-\nciple)74. Rather than waiting for evidence in order to\nact, in case of uncertainty it may be advisable to act\nbecause it may be too harmful, or too late, to wait\nfor evidence to emerge75, 76\n.\nExamples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and at-\ntitudes (A):\nK: knows that preventive action should be\ntaken when certain actions or inaction may dam-\nage human health and all life forms (precaution-\nary principle);\nS: can act promptly, even in the face of un-\ncertainty and unforeseen events, keeping in mind\nthe precautionary principle;\nDescriptor (4.3): To identify own potential\nfor sustainability and to actively contribute to\nxxii https://education-for-climate.ec.europa.eu/community/\nhome\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n27\nA: is confident about anticipating and influ-\nencing sustainable changes.\nFor example: Courses, such as ‘Knowledge to\nAction’ as part of the International Master’s pro-\ngramme in Environmental and Sustainability at\nLund University, offer learners a hands-on opportu-\nnity to interact in real-world settings with those at\nsocietal level such as municipalities, organisations,\ncompanies and third sector organisations while tak-\ning part in a project that promotes sustainabilityxxiii\n(SDGs 16, 13).\nxxiii Projects developed in the ‘Knowledge to Action’ course\nare available at https://www.lumes.lu.se/article/2019-knowledge-ac-\ntion-projects and include information on different competences\ndeveloped in such an experiential learning activity.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n28\n5. Ways forward\nHigh-quality and inclusive education and training\ncan help improve social and environmental condi-\ntions. Socioecological problems, such as biodiversity\nloss, climate change, pollution and inequalities, can\nprevent access to education and employment. This\nin turn aggravates such socioecological issues in a\nvicious cycle77\n.\nSustainable lifestyles require a shift in mindset\nand behaviour. We must put equity and justice for\ncurrent and future generations at the heart of our\nsocieties. Our relationship with the environment\nmust be based on a sense of being connected with\nnature. Learning for environmental sustainability\nshould empower individuals to think holistically and\nquestion the world-views underpinning our current\neconomic system. At the same time, it should en-\ncourage them to take action individually and with\nothers to transform our society and shape sustain-\nable futures for everyone. Lifelong learning should\nincorporate sustainability competences across dis-\nciplines to train the systemic thinkers and ethical\nagents for change who are needed to promote a\nsustainable society78\n.\nGreenComp offers a definition of what it takes to\nthink and act sustainably, individually and collec-\ntively. The consulted stakeholders have noted that\nnot only policymakers and education and training\nproviders need such a definition, but also the pri-\nvate sector and employers at large.\nLike the other EU competence frameworks, Green-\nComp is non-prescriptive. It provides a conceptual\nreference model that everyone involved in lifelong\nlearning can use with various objectives in mind,\nsuch as:\n-\nraising awareness about the importance of\nlearning for environmental sustainability;\n-\ndesigning learning opportunities aimed at\ndeveloping sustainability competences; and\n-\nassessing where one stands in supporting\nlearners to develop sustainability skills.\nBased on the take-up of other EU competence\nframeworks, it can be expected that the below\nstakeholders may use GreenComp for various pur-\nposes:\n-\nNational, regional and local policymakers\nmay refer to GreenComp in their policies and work\nprogrammes aimed to advance learning for envi-\nronmental sustainability.\n-\nFormal and non-formal education and\ntraining providers may find GreenComp useful to\nshape their educational offer at general, vocational,\nhigher and adult education level.\n-\nInitial teacher training and continued pro-\nfessional development providers may refer to it\nwhen preparing teachers and educators to teach\nsuch sustainability competences.\n-\nAssessment and certification services could\ngenerate new certificates that acknowledge the\ncompetences described in GreenComp.\n-\nEmployers may find it relevant to incorpo-\nrate sustainability competences in their recruitment\nstrategies or talent development programmes.\n-\nThose monitoring human capital develop-\nment at national or international level for statisti-\ncal/measurement purposes may use it to refine cur-\nrent indicators or develop new ones.\n-\nResearch bodies may use GreenComp for\nempirical research on how frameworks affect edu-\ncational outcomes or to determine which pedago-\ngies are best suited for learners to develop Green-\nComp competences.\n-\nProviders of occupational descriptions or\nprofessional qualifications and standards may find\nGreenComp useful for updating job profiles or cre-\nating new ones.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n29\nThese are but examples of potential uses of Green-\nComp, which – like any other EU competence\nframework – is not binding. Its take-up will depend\non its relevance and usefulness for each potential\nstakeholder group.\nKey questions are which pedagogies to use and\nhow to incorporate the learning outcomes in them.\nExamples of pedagogical practices that can be ef-\nfective in developing the competences set out in\nGreenComp include:\n-\nactive learning;\n-\nstudent-centred, design-based, proj-\nect-based, transformative (situated) learning con-\ntexts;\n-\n-\ngamification;\nrole plays, experimental games and simu-\nlations;\n-\nanalysis of real-world case studies taken\nfrom the local context;\n-\nblended and online learning;\n-\nproject-based learning;\n-\noutdoor approaches; and\n-\ncollaborative approaches (cooperation with\nexternal partners).\nExperts and stakeholders consulted in this process\nhave stressed the need to factor in the context, such\nas the education level, the school environment, and\nthe local community. Teaching approaches can in-\ncorporate digital technologies to support people\nin acquiring competences. At the same time, they\nmust take into account the impact of digital tech-\nnologies on sustainability.\nExperiencing sustainability (experiential learning) is\nessential to stimulate a change in mindset. This can\nin turn promote a change in production and con-\nsumption patterns. A good example of this is pro-\nmoting good practice on reducing waste, reusing,\nrepairing or sharing among learners.\nA whole school approach should also be considered.\nTeaching and learning for sustainability during ev-\neryday activities and across disciplines is challeng-\ning. Schools could choose to develop a sustainability\nculture and support professional learning. A whole\nschool approach can make it easier for schools and\ncan support organisational change.\nThe take-up of GreenComp in lifelong learning for\nsustainability is highly encouraged. At the same\ntime, it is highly recommended to adapt the frame-\nwork to learners’ needs and backgrounds, and to the\ncontext.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence]]]\n\nI want an updated version of the document that i shared that has:An overview summary of our work so far\nOur strategy for integrating green and climate-resilient practices\nThe modules and how they’re clustered\nMaterials that need to be developed\nPriority areas for implementation\nAll the detailed worksheets so you can easily convert them into Google Docs.\nAnd a text description of what should go onto the slides, for example:\nslide 1: \nTitle: Our Strategy\n\nOur overarching strategy is to embed sustainability as a business advantage.

GreenComp identifies four main areas of sustainability competence:\n\nEmbodying sustainability values (values, fairness, promoting nature)\nEmbracing complexity in sustainability (systems thinking, critical thinking, problem framing)\nEnvisioning sustainable futures (futures literacy, adaptability, exploratory thinking)\nActing for sustainability (political agency, collective action, individual initiative)\nOur approach incorporates these areas throughout the curriculum—helping participants develop skills and mindsets for systemic thinking, ethical decision-making, creative problem-solving, and effective collective action.\n\nWhat We’ve Done So Far\nMapped each module of the curriculum to sustainability entry points based on the ILO’s Green Business Booklet, complementary resources, and now GreenComp.\nDeveloped clusters of modules where sustainability integration naturally aligns—tying them to GreenComp’s four competence areas and 12 sub-competences.\nCreated practical worksheets and frameworks so entrepreneurs can see the tangible business benefits of sustainability while building the core GreenComp skills.\nII. Our Strategy for Integrating Green & Climate-Resilient Practices\nOur overarching strategy is to embed sustainability as a business advantage. We focus on:\n\nMarket & Model: Helping ventures discover green opportunities and integrate them into their core business model.\nFinance & Impact: Demonstrating the financial ROI of sustainability and teaching impact measurement.\nCommunication & Sales: Showcasing environmental benefits as unique selling points that build trust with customers, partners, and investors.\nGuiding Principles\nBusiness-First: Every sustainability recommendation must enhance competitiveness, reduce costs, or open new markets.\nAction-Oriented Tools: Instead of abstract discussions, we provide frameworks, checklists, and worksheets that can be applied immediately.\nMeasurable Impact: We encourage tracking resource savings, financial gains, and risk reductions to prove the real-world value of going green.\nAligned with GreenComp: We foster values-based reflection (“Embodying sustainability values”), critical and systems thinking (“Embracing complexity”), futures-oriented innovation (“Envisioning sustainable futures”), and action-driven change (“Acting for sustainability”).\nIII. Updated Clusters & Alignment with GreenComp\nWe’ve reorganized the modules into three overarching clusters that run throughout the multi-month accelerator. Each cluster refers back to relevant GreenComp competences.\n\nCluster A: Market, Model & Supply Chain\nFocus:\n\nIdentifying future-proof market opportunities\nBuilding a robust business model that integrates resource efficiency and climate resilience\nExpanding into operational considerations like procurement, packaging, and supply chain\nRelevant GreenComp Alignment:\n\nEmbodying Sustainability Values: Encourage participants to explore fairness, environmental stewardship, and nature protection in their market strategy.\nEmbracing Complexity in Sustainability: Practice systems thinking and problem framing when analyzing market research and supply chains.\nEnvisioning Sustainable Futures: Use exploratory thinking to brainstorm green product innovations.\nExample Modules:\n\nDesign Thinking, Market Research, BMC Fundamentals, Ideation, Reframe, Prototyping, Supply Chain & Operations, Service Design\nCluster B: Finance, Impact & Risk\nFocus:\n\nConducting ROI calculations on green investments\nMeasuring operational efficiency and tracking sustainability metrics\nAddressing climate/environmental risks and exploring green financing options\nRelevant GreenComp Alignment:\n\nEmbodying Sustainability Values: Reflect on triple bottom line and ethical investment decisions.\nEmbracing Complexity in Sustainability: Employ critical thinking to assess financial data and manage sustainability trade-offs.\nEnvisioning Sustainable Futures: Encourage adaptability and futures literacy when planning financial scenarios under uncertainty.\nActing for Sustainability: Reinforce individual initiative in seeking green funds or demanding policy support for sustainability.\nExample Modules:\n\nCost Model, Revenue Model, Record Keeping, Balance Sheet, Business Ethics, Financing Alternatives, Risk & Crisis Management\nCluster C: Green Communications & Sales\nFocus:\n\nCrafting compelling value propositions and marketing messages that highlight environmental benefits\nBuilding a green brand, forging partnerships, and driving sales through sustainability narratives\nRelevant GreenComp Alignment:\n\nEmbodying Sustainability Values: Internalize how fairness and nature promotion can become a brand story.\nEmbracing Complexity in Sustainability: Use critical thinking to avoid “greenwashing” and ensure authentic communication.\nEnvisioning Sustainable Futures: Inspire customers with visions of a more sustainable tomorrow (futures literacy).\nActing for Sustainability: Collaborate collectively with stakeholders, exercise political agency to shape market norms, and take individual initiative in entrepreneurial storytelling.\nExample Modules:\n\nMarketing Strategy, The Pitch, Communication, Sales, Branding, Networking & Partnerships, Continuous Innovation\nIV. Priority Areas for Immediate Rollout\nWe’ve identified four priority areas where the program can quickly integrate sustainability (alongside its natural fit with GreenComp competences):\n\nEnhanced Business Model Canvas\n\nInfuse environmental and social metrics into each BMC segment.\nGreenComp Emphasis: “Embodying Sustainability Values” (valuing sustainability) and “Embracing Complexity” (systems thinking).\nMarket & Consumer Research\n\nTools for identifying green market trends, climate risks, and resource constraints.\nGreenComp Emphasis: “Embracing Complexity” (critical thinking, problem framing) and “Envisioning Sustainable Futures” (exploratory thinking).\nFinancial & Impact Calculations\n\nShow how green actions reduce costs, increase ROI, and unlock financing.\nGreenComp Emphasis: “Envisioning Sustainable Futures” (adaptability in long-term planning) and “Acting for Sustainability” (individual initiative in seeking better financing models).\nSales & Communication\n\nPosition sustainability as an innovation driver—making the pitch more powerful.\nGreenComp Emphasis: “Acting for Sustainability” (collective action, political agency) when shaping market norms, and “Embodying Sustainability Values” (promoting nature, fairness) in brand messaging.\nV. Materials to Be Developed\nAcross all three clusters, these are the key resources you’ll need:\n\nWorkshop Slide Decks\n\nCluster A Deck: Market research techniques, resource efficiency basics, Green BMC introduction.\nCluster B Deck: Cost-benefit analysis, ROI scenarios, impact dashboards, risk mapping.\nCluster C Deck: Crafting sustainable sales messages, storytelling for climate resilience, partnership strategies.\nFacilitator Guides\n\nStep-by-step session outlines, including timing, activities, discussion prompts, and reference to relevant worksheets.\nGuidance on weaving GreenComp (e.g., incorporating reflective exercises to highlight values, systems thinking, etc.).\nCase Studies & Examples\n\nReal-world stories from Iraqi and MENA startups that used sustainability for competitive advantage.\nEmphasize how they embodied the GreenComp competences (e.g., collective action, futures thinking).\nSector-Specific Adaptations\n\nAdditional modules or references for renewable energy, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.\nPlug-in frameworks that highlight systems thinking, circular economy, or water efficiency in local contexts.\nVI. Comprehensive Worksheets & Frameworks\nBelow you’ll find detailed worksheets for each cluster. You can copy-paste them into Google Docs directly. They are designed to reinforce GreenComp by prompting reflection on systems, encouraging moral/ethical consideration, imagining futures, and guiding participants to take meaningful action.\n\nCLUSTER A (Market, Model & Supply Chain)\n1.

But\nthe atmospheric CO2\nconcentration has\nincreased by 47% since the\n1800s, due to human\nactivities like the burning of\nfossil fuels and large-scale\ndeforestation. Due to its\nabundance, CO2 is the main\ncontributor to climate\nchange.\n___________________________\n— Circular economy\nA purely circular economy\nis an economy in which\nwaste does not exist and\nproducts and raw materials\nare reused as long as\npossible over and over\nagain.\n___________________________\n— Crowdfunding\nThe practice of funding a\nproject or venture by\nraising money from a large\nnumber of people who\neach contribute a relatively\nsmall amount, typically via\nthe internet.\n___________________________\n— Eco-innovation\nEco-innovation is any form of\ninnovation that aims to\nreduce the environmental\nimpact of the company’s\nproducts or services. Mostly,\neco-innovation is about the\nefficient and responsible use\nof natural resources,\nincluding energy and water.\n___________________________\n— Environmental\nManagement System\nAn Environmental\nManagement System (EMS) is\nan approach used by\nenterprises to integrate\nenvironmental concerns in\ntheir business processes in a\nplanned and systematic way.\n___________________________\n— Green business\nGreen businesses, also called\nsustainable businesses, seek\nto balance profit with the\nhealth of the planet. Green\nbusinesses incorporate\nprinciples of sustainability\ninto their business decisions\nin order to reduce their\nnegative impacts on the\nglobal or local environment.\nThey sell environmentally\nfriendly products or they\ngreen their practices to make\nthem more environmentally\nfriendly. In light of the\nimminent threat of climate\nchange to our planet, green\nbusinesses endeavour to\nreduce their CO2 emissions.\n___________________________\n— Eco-label\nAn eco-label is an official\nsymbol that shows that a\nproduct has been designed\nto do less harm to the\nenvironment than similar\nproducts. Eco-labels are\nvoluntary methods of\nenvironmental sustainability\ncertification.\n___________________________\n— Equity\nBusiness equity is the value\nof the business owners’\nassets after deducting the\nbusiness' liabilities. At the\nstart-up phase, equity is the\ninitial funding the owner(s)\ninvests in the company.\n___________________________\n— Green business value\nproposition\nA value proposition is a\nstatement that says how\nyour business will deliver\nvalue to its customers,\ntaking into account the\ncustomers’ problems, wants\nand needs. A green value\nproposition is a statement\nthat says specifically how\nyour business will deliver\nvalue to its customers,\ntaking into account the\ncustomers’ environmental\nproblems, wants and needs.\n___________________________\n— Green loan\nA green loan is a loan that\nenables enterprises to\nfinance projects that have a\npositive environmental\nimpact.\n___________________________\n6\n— Environmental\ncertification\nEnvironmental certification\nis a process whereby a\ncertifying agency provides a\nbusiness with an official\ndocument attesting that the\nbusiness complies with\npredefined processes or\nobjectives set forth by the\ncertification service. Eco-\nlabels, for instance, are\nvoluntary methods of\ncertifying the\nenvironmental\nsustainability of a product\nor service. Another\nexample is ISO 14000\ncertification, which certifies\nthat the business complies\nwith a certain quality in the\nenvironmental\nmanagement systems of\nthe organization.\n___________________________\n— Extended producer\nresponsibility\nExtended Producer\nResponsibility (EPR) is a\npolicy approach under\nwhich producers of certain\nproducts are given a\nsignificant responsibility –\nfinancial and/or physical –\nfor the take back, recycling\nand final disposal of the\nproduct.\n___________________________\n— Greenhouse gases\nGreenhouse gases are gases\nin the earth’s atmosphere\nthat that trap heat. They\ncause global warming and\nclimate change trough the\nso-called greenhouse effect.\nThe best-known greenhouse\ngases are carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane and nitrous\noxide, which all can be found\nnaturally in low\nconcentrations in the\natmosphere. However, their\nproportion has increased\nsignificantly since the\nbeginning of the last century\ndue to various man-made\nactivities.\n___________________________\n— Green service\nGreen services are services\nthat are designed and\noffered in such a manner as\nto minimize the adverse\nenvironmental impacts.\n___________________________\n— Industrial symbiosis\nIndustrial symbiosis is the\nprocess by which waste or\nby‐products of an industry or\nindustrial process become\nthe raw materials for\nanother. Application of this\nconcept allows materials to\nbe used in a more\nsustainable way and\ncontributes to the creation of\na circular economy.\n___________________________\n— Green sticker\nGreen stickers are stickers\naffixed to consumer\nproducts that signal to what\nextent the product is an\nenvironmentally responsible\nproduct.

For instance,\nthe use of energy\ncontributes to global\nwarming, the use of water\ncontributes to the depletion\nof freshwater resources,\nwhile water effluents\ncontribute to eco-toxicity.\n___________________________\n7\n— Green economy\nA green economy is an\neconomy that brings\nimproved human well-\nbeing and social equity,\nwhile significantly reducing\nenvironmental risks and\necological scarcities.\nAccording to the United\nNations Environmental\nProgramme, a green\neconomy is low carbon,\nresource efficient, and\nsocially inclusive.\n___________________________\n— ISO 14000 series\nISO 14000 is a family of\nstandards related to\nenvironmental\nmanagement that exists to\nhelp organizations (a)\nminimize how their\noperations negatively affect\nthe environment (i.e. cause\nadverse changes to air,\nwater, or land); (b) comply\nwith applicable laws,\nregulations, and other\nenvironmentally oriented\nrequirements; and (c)\ncontinually improve in the\nabove.\n___________________________\n— ISO 14001\nISO 14001: 2015 is the\ninternational standard that\nspecifies requirements for\nan Effective Environmental\nManagement System.\n___________________________\n— Life Cycle Assessment\nA Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)\nis the standardized method\nof calculating the impact of a\nproduct on the environment.\nIt is a systematic set of\nprocedures for compiling and\nexamining the inputs and\noutputs of materials and\nenergy and the associated\nenvironmental impacts\ndirectly attributable to the\nfunctioning of a product\nthroughout its life cycle.\n___________________________\n— Life Cycle Management\nLife Cycle Management is\nabout managing the\nenvironmental impacts\nlinked to the whole life cycle\nof a product or service, from\ninputs, manufacturing,\npackaging, transport and\ndistribution to consumption\nand final disposal. Life Cycle\nManagement is sometimes\ncalled the “cradle to grave”\napproach, as it looks at the\nenvironmental impact of\nproducts all the way from\nthe cradle (where do the\nraw materials come from) to\nthe grave (how is the\nproduct disposed of).\n___________________________\n— Sustainability\nSustainability means meeting\nour own needs without\ncompromising the ability of\nfuture generations to meet\ntheir own needs. In business,\nsustainability refers to doing\nbusiness without negatively\nimpacting the environment,\ncommunity, or society as a\nwhole.\n____________________________\n8\n— Resource efficiency\nResource efficiency means\nusing the earth's limited\nresources in a sustainable\nmanner while minimising\nimpacts on the\nenvironment.\n___________________________\n— Value chain\nThe value chain describes\nthe full range of actors and\neconomic activities that are\nnecessary to bring a\nproduct from its conception\nto its end use and beyond.\n___________________________\nCHAPTER ONE\nGetting started: green\nbusiness is good business\nGreen businesses, also called sustainable businesses, seek to balance profit with the health of the planet.\nGreen businesses incorporate principles of sustainability into their business decisions in order to reduce\ntheir negative impacts on the global or local environment. They do this by selling environmentally friendly\nproducts or by greening their processes to make them more environmentally sustainable. In light of the\nimminent threat of climate change to our planet, green businesses endeavour to reduce their greenhouse\ngas emissions.\nMore than 90% of CEOs say that sustainability is fundamental to success1. CEOs around the world are\npaying massive attention to environmental sustainability.\n/ But why should you as a small business owner care?\n/ Why should you integrate environmental concerns in your business?\n/ Is green business also good business?\nThis first chapter looks at the advantages that green business can bring. It also discusses what holds\nentrepreneurs back from going green.\n1 The Next Phase of Business Sustainability, Stanford Social Innovation Review\n9\n1.1 Access new markets\nThere is an increasing demand for green products and services worldwide. Global research shows a 71%\nrise in popularity of searches for sustainable goods over the 2016-2021 period, a trend that is accelerating\nin low and middle-income countries2. Green products and services represent previously untapped\nbusiness opportunities. Whether you are offering your products and services directly to consumers (B2C)\nor to other companies (B2B), environmental concerns are becoming more and more important.\n— Are you selling directly to consumers?\nIt is no longer just a few wealthy consumers in industrialized countries who are looking for green products\nand services. In developing countries, there is also increased demand for environmentally responsible\nproducts and services. As a green entrepreneur, you can develop solutions that meet this growing market\ndemand ahead of your competitors. Offering green products and services can enhance your business’\nreputation with customers and communities who are concerned about environmental sustainability.\nImage 1. A recycled cotton bag producer Image 2. An organic compost business\n— Are you selling to large companies?\nAn increasing number of large companies are incorporating sustainability requirements into their\nprocurement processes. This means that they will select their supplies based on sustainability criteria,\nchallenge their suppliers to become more sustainable and/or engage with their suppliers to improve the\nsustainability of their product and services. Enterprises that want to become suppliers to large companies\nwill often be required to certify that their products, services and processes meet certain environmental\ncriteria.\n— Are you selling to the Government?\nPublic procurement — the process by which governments purchase goods, services and works from the\nprivate sector — amounts to around 12% of global GDP. In many countries, national, provincial and\n2 An Eco-wakening Measuring global awareness, engagement and action for nature. Economic Intelligence Unit and WWF, 2021\n10\nmunicipal offices apply sustainable procurement practices, meaning that they favour sustainable products\nand services over products and services that score low on sustainability aspects.\n Case studies: Green public procurement\nThe City of Cape Town, South Africa, is showing leadership on Green Procurement,\nwith an action plan stating that all procurement decisions made by the City should aim\nto minimize the environmental impact from procured products and services.\nCompanies that want to sell their products to the City of Cape Town need to\ndemonstrate environmental sustainability along the life-cycle of a product or service,\ntaking into account the principles of resource efficiency and circularity.\nThe Republic of Korea has a policy to support the market for eco-labelled products\nthrough public procurement. The policy requires that all government agencies annually\nsubmit a Green Public Procurement implementation plan. More than 30,000 public\norganizations report that they buy more than USD 3 billion of green products annually.\nCheck if your country, province or municipality is buying green!\nImage 3. A green cleaning services company Image 4. An eco-tourism lodge\nIn some instances, green enterprises are able to sell their products and services at higher prices than\nnormal enterprises. For example, sustainable tourism lodges can charge higher prices to environmentally\nsensitive clients. Another example can be found in the eco agro-industry that sells products from organic\nagriculture with a price premium. A 2015 global survey revealed that 66% of global respondents were\n11\nwilling to pay more for sustainable goods. In Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, 23-29% of\nrespondents were willing to pay a premium for sustainable offerings3\n.\n1.2 Stay ahead of environmental regulation\nEnvironmental regulation is becoming more and more stringent. Green businesses can reap the benefits\nof staying ahead of environmental regulation. They have already innovated and tested the right materials,\ntechnologies and processes to meet environmental standards. In other words, they adapt their products\nand business processes before environmental regulation comes into place. This way they can avoid fines\nand the risk of business interruptions when new regulations enter into force. Staying ahead of regulation\nalso means that businesses can improve their reputation with clients and communities.\n— What kind of more stringent environmental regulation can we expect over the coming years?\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nMany governments are implementing policies to bring down their greenhouse gas emissions in line with\ntheir Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement. Some of these policies affect\nbusinesses directly, for instance when governments decide to phase out fossil fuel subsidies or when taxes\non electricity, gas or fuel prices increase.\nWaste\nIn order to manage growing amounts of waste and ensure proper recycling and reuse of materials, many\ncountries place the responsibility for managing waste on the businesses that manufactured the products\nin the first place. Under so-called Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, producers become\nresponsible to re-collect the products or packaging materials that they have brought on the market and/or\nto cover the cost of disposal.\nChemicals\nThere is increased regulation in the area of chemicals control, meaning that producers can either not make\nuse of certain chemicals or must be able to prove a limited use of certain chemicals. These regulations\nmostly affect businesses in agriculture, textile, manufacturing and electronics. Producers in developing or\nmiddle-income countries can also be affected by regulations in countries to which they export.\nWater conservation\nIn countries with water shortages, water use registration, licensing and auditing may become firmer for\nbusiness, while water usage restrictions when temporary shortages occur may affect business operations.\nIs it possible to stay ahead of environmental regulation? Let’s look at some examples of businesses that\nare clearly ahead.\n3 Neilsen (2015), The Sustainability Imperative: New Insights On Consumer Expectations.\n12\nImage 5. John’s organic compost business Image 6. An eco-tourism lodge\n13\n1.3 Access to finance\nGreen businesses may be able to attract certain types of financing options for their green business ideas\nthat are not be available for conventional business ideas. Banks and investors are increasingly focussing\non businesses that are environmentally sustainable. IFC estimates that the global volume of green loans\nin 2021 is around $33 billion and reports a rapid rise in the volume of green loans in developing countries4\n.\nSome banks have established specific loan products for green businesses and/or for eco-investments in\nbusinesses such as the installation of solar power panels or the purchase of eco-technology. There are\nalso some government-sponsored initiatives providing finance to businesses developing green products\nor services or investing in cleaner production.\nImage 7. The Brazilian bank “Banco do Brasil” offers green\nbusiness loans to small enterprises\nImage 8. A green cleaning services company\nAnother option to attract financing for green business ideas or eco-innovation is through crowdfunding.\nCrowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new\nbusiness venture. Worldwide there are about 11 crowdfunding platforms on which green businesses can\npresent their projects in order to look for investors.\n1.4 Reduce costs\nGreen businesses can considerably reduce costs through greener practices. These cost reductions\ngenerally arise from efficiency gains when less inputs are required to produce the same output. Many\ngreen enterprises use cleaner production strategies to reduce environmental pollution and\nsimultaneously reduce the consumption of resources. For instance, when companies find ways to save on\nwater, gas and electricity, they can also save on expenditures. Companies that manage to reduce the\n4 https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2021/10/04/what-you-need-to-know-about-green-loans\n14\nusage of raw materials or packaging materials through eco-innovation often report substantial costs\nsavings.\nThe majority of studies using firm-level data show a positive relationship between clean investments and\nfirms’ productivity, especially in the energy-intensive manufacturing sector.\n— Costs savings can be attained in different ways5:\nProcess efficiency\nBy optimizing production processes or introducing more efficient processes, enterprises minimize the\nrequired inputs and reduce their waste production.\nProduct design\nproduct’s utility.\nEnterprises can re-design their products in order to reduce the required inputs without sacrificing the\nWaste disposal\nIn addition to reducing waste by improving process efficiency, enterprises can reuse already generated\nwaste or pass it along to other companies in a process of industrial symbiosis. This reduces the cost of\nwaste disposal.\nSource of raw material\nEnterprises can reduce cost of raw materials by switching to recycled and recyclable materials, applying\ncircularity principles.\nEnergy efficiency\nEnterprises can generate savings associated with energy-efficiency lighting, building insulation, cooling\nand heating systems efficiency.\nPackaging and transportation\nEnterprises can reduce costs by reducing the volume of packaging material and by switching to local\nsuppliers, thereby decreasing shipping distances\n5 Adapted from: SMEs: Key drivers of green and inclusive growth, OECD Green Growth Papers, 2019\n15\nLet’s look at some examples of entrepreneurs that are saving costs.\nImage 9. An eco-lodge using renewable energy Image 10. A carpet producer using recycled materials\n1.5 Improve quality\nImplementing green measures can lead to quality improvements. Green products and services can\ntherefore improve the value proposition of the enterprise and improve its bottom line.\nIn manufacturing, there can be important synergies between designing and manufacturing an\nenvironmentally sustainable product and designing and manufacturing a better quality product. When\nbusinesses design and manufacture products with a lower environmental footprint, these same products\nmay have higher performance characteristics, i.e. a longer life, or a longer mean time between failures.\nThe same synergies can be pursued by enterprises in the services industry. Hairdressers that use less\nchemicals and more natural products are offering a better service to their clients’ hair. Restaurants that\nuse organic vegetables may also be offering more tasty dishes. Construction companies that use green\nbuilding design and smart thermal technologies, may at the same time offer housing solutions that bring\ngreater comfort.\n16\n1.6 What holds entrepreneurs back from going green?\nThere can be several reasons why businesses are hesitant to improve their environmental sustainability.\nGreening your business may entail investments in technology, innovation, market research, staff training\nand certification, amongst others. Many entrepreneurs do not see a direct demand from their clients to\nmake their products more environmentally sustainable. Therefore, they have doubts as to whether these\ninvestments will pay off. Green entrepreneurs often face various types of uncertainty:\nTechnical uncertainty\nEntrepreneurs may not be certain about the technical feasibility, usefulness or functionality of the\ninnovation that they would have to accomplish.\nMarket uncertainty\nMany green entrepreneurs are building market demand for a product or service that doesn’t exist yet and\nthey are not sure whether the market uptake will be as good as expected.\nPolicy uncertainty\nGreen entrepreneurs find it hard to foresee the types of environmental regulations that will come in place\nand the kind of policy support that will exist for green business in the medium term.\nStaff capacity and competencies\nSmall companies do not have dedicated staff to work on the environmental aspects of the company.\nWhereas large companies can have full-time sustainability experts, in small companies the responsibility\nfalls on people who can only spend a small amount of their time on it.\nEco-certification\nMany small businesses around the world struggle with eco-certification. Once they have developed their\nenvironmentally safe products or services and put in place environmentally safe business practices, they\nwant to obtain certification. Certification is important to communicate to the outside world that the\nproduct or service – or the company itself – is environmentally, socially and economically responsible. In\nmany countries, however, certification processes are time-consuming and expensive.\n17\nCHAPTER TWO\nGreen business: how to go\nabout it\nYou have just learnt why green business is important and why green business can be good business. But\nhow does one undertake to establish such a business? What does it actually mean for a business to go\ngreen or be sustainable?\nGreen businesses can create value and market opportunities by reducing the use of energy, water and\nmaterials, by minimizing pollution and waste, by limiting gas greenhouse emissions and providing goods\nand services that enable more responsible production and consumption patterns. But how do green\nbusinesses practically do that? Do they need to do all that at the same time?\nThe answer is that there is no single way for enterprises to go green. Entrepreneurs, depending on their\nstarting point, objectives and possibilities, chose different pathways. Some entrepreneurs create their\nenterprise having clearly in mind from the start-up phase that they want to become green entrepreneurs.\nOthers may be in business for many years prior to commencing the process of greening their business.\nThere are different approaches to greening a business, and some entrepreneurs may go step by step.\n18\n2.1 Four main elements of green business\nLet us see what the main and common practices of a green business are.\nFigure 1. Elements and common practices of a green business.\nGreen businesses use – as much as possible – environmentally sustainable inputs. They use for instance\nrenewable energy sources such as solar, wind and biogas, rather than energy coming from the burning of\nfossil fuels. They use organically produced inputs or materials, rather than inputs produced through the\nuse of chemicals. They use recycled materials, rather than materials taken directly from nature. Green\nbusinesses carefully look at their supply chain and try to source sustainable inputs, preferring\nenvironmentally certified supplies over others.\nGreen businesses make their production processes as environmentally sustainable as possible. They save\nenergy, water and other resources as much as they can. They apply the waste management hierarchy\npractices in their processes starting with waste prevention, reduction, re-use or recycling of materials as\nmuch as possible and resort to waste disposal as the last option. The may apply these practices within the\ncompany or in collaboration with other businesses or the municipality. They reduce the use of chemicals\nand, when required, only use sustainable chemicals. Through resource efficiency approaches and eco-\ninnovation they reach the same outputs with lower inputs, reducing their environmental impact, saving\ncosts and improving quality.\nGreen businesses produce products and services that enable sustainable consumption. For instance,\nthey improve the environmental impact of packaging materials or eliminate packaging altogether. They\n19\nproduce products that can be recycled, repaired, reused, or that simply have a longer lifespan. They allow\nconsumers to reduce their energy consumption, often also contributing to a healthier lifestyle.\nGreen businesses undertake marketing efforts that inform their clients about the environmental\nsustainability of their products or services. They use eco-labels and eco-certifications to communicate to\ntheir clients – either other companies in the value chain or final consumers – that their products are more\nenvironmentally sustainable than other products or services in the market.\nImage 11. Jane, the recycled cotton bag producer Image 12. John and Mary, organic compost producers\nImage 13. Uma’s bakery Image 14. A small clay brick factory\n20\n2.2 Approaches to green business\nEnterprises use different approaches to produce green products and services and to green their business\nprocesses. The most important approaches are:\n• Eco-innovation\n• Resource efficiency and cleaner production\n• Life cycle management\n• Circularity\nEco-innovation\nInnovation is about introducing something new to your business, whether it is a new product, a new\nmarket strategy, a new process or simply a new way of doing things. Eco-innovation is any form of\ninnovation that aims to reduce the environmental impact of your products or services. Mostly, eco-\ninnovation is about the efficient and responsible use of natural resources, including energy and water. An\nexample of eco-innovation is when you develop a new product or service that provides value to customers\nwith a reduced environmental impact compared to traditional products. For instance, a carpet producing\ncompany that starts to use recycled plastic to produce carpet pads.\nImage 15. A waste recycling business Image 16. A waste awareness workshop facilitator\nEco-innovation can help businesses access new or growing markets. It can increase productivity,\ncompetitiveness and profitability. Eco-innovation can also help businesses stay ahead of environmental\n21\nregulations and standards. Eco-innovation does not necessarily have to be expensive and in many\ncountries subsidies and technical support exists for businesses that want to eco-innovate.\nLife cycle management\nLife cycle management is about managing the environmental impacts linked to the whole life cycle of a\nproduct or service, from inputs, manufacturing, packaging, transport and distribution to consumption and\nfinal disposal. Life cycle management is sometimes called the “cradle to grave” approach, as it looks at the\nenvironmental impact of products all the way from the cradle (where do the raw materials come from) to\nthe grave (how is the product disposed of). Life cycle management is further discussed in chapter 4.\nResource efficiency and cleaner production\nGreen enterprises apply resource efficiency and cleaner production approaches to reduce the use of\nresources in their production processes. As such, they reduce environmental pollution and save costs.\nThis helps enterprises to increase productivity by applying preventive environmental practices on a\ncontinuous basis. Resource efficiency and cleaner production approaches are further discussed in Chapter\n5.\nCircularity\nCircularity is about ways to put products, components, and materials back into use and to avoid them\nbeing discarded or ending up in landfills. Green businesses, depending on the sector they are in, apply\ndifferent approaches to contribute to the circular economy. Usually these approaches are based on the\ncircular economy principles of “eliminate waste and pollution”, “keep products and materials in use” and\n“regenerate natural systems”.\nSmall businesses can apply circularity principles within the business, for instance by designing their\nproducts to use less resource inputs or to be more easily repairable. They can also apply circularity\nprinciples by working with others, for instance by making sure that the waste of one company is used as\nan input in another company or by ensuring that their waste is being recycled by other companies. Chapter\n7 will explore the possibilities for green enterprises to work with others on circularity.\n22\nImage 17. Different and complementary approaches to green business\n— Eco-innovation\nIntroducing an innovation in your business that\naims to reduce the environmental impact of your\nproducts or services. Most eco-innovations are\nabout the efficient and responsible use of natural\nresources, including energy and water.\n— Life cycle management\nManaging the environmental impacts linked to the\nwhole life cycle of your product or service, from\n“cradle to grave”. At the basis of life cycle\nmanagement is the “life cycle assessment”.\n— Resource efficiency and cleaner production\nA strategy for businesses to reduce environmental\npollution and simultaneously reduce the\nconsumption of resources through eight different\nRECP practices.\n23\n— Circularity\nStrategies that businesses use to put products,\ncomponents, and materials back into use and to\navoid them being thrown away or ending up in\nlandfills, mostly based on the principles of\n“eliminate waste and pollution”, “keep products\nand materials in use” and “regenerate natural\nsystems”.\n24\n2.3 Steps in creating a green business\nWhat are the steps in developing a green business? There are different pathways to green business and\nevery enterprise is unique. Some entrepreneurs may start a business that is green from the beginning,\noffering environmentally sustainable products or services straight from the start. Others may have started\na conventional business and then endeavour to green their processes, products or services as they go\nalong.\nLet us first of all look at the steps to develop a green business start-up. After that, we will describe the\nsteps for an existing business to green its products, services or processes.\n When you look at the next pages, keep in mind that the distinction between\n“developing a green business start-up” and “greening business processes” is of\ncourse a bit artificial. Green business start-ups, once they are operational, may have\nto make additional efforts over time to make their processes more environmentally\nfriendly, for instance when new materials or production technologies become\navailable. Businesses that have engaged in greening their processes, at the other\nhand, could decide to develop new green products and services, as part of or in\nconnection to their greening processes.\n— What are the steps for green business start-up?\nDo you want to start a business offering a green product or service? These are the proposed steps.\nFigure 2.Steps to start a business offering green products or services\n1. Scan your environment\nThe first step is to explore your business environment. Which green products and services are already\nbeing produced by enterprises in your area? For which green products and services could there be a\nmarket? What kind of green products and services are consumers looking for? What kind of green\nproducts and services are companies looking for?\n2. Develop and screen your business idea\nOnce you have scanned your environment, the next step is to develop your business idea. The\nInternational Labour Organization “Generate Your Business” manual6 provides guidance on different ways\nof coming up with business ideas. In order to put forward an idea for a green product(s) or service(s), you\nmay think about the environmental problems that need to be solved in your community and the resources\nin your community you could tap into.\nOnce you have produced a list of possible green products or services, you may do an initial screening of\nthese ideas, by trying to answer questions such as 1) Which need will the product(s) or service(s) fulfil, 2)\n6 https://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/lang--en/index.htm\n25\nWho will the business sell the product(s) or service(s) to? 3) How will the business sell its product(s) or\nservice(s)? What are the market requirements of the clients that would buy your product(s) or service(s)?\nWho could provide you with technical support in developing your product(s) or service(s)? Who could\nprovide you with the necessary financing? What technology exists and what are the costs? What are the\nenvironmental certification or eco-labels for the product(s) or service(s) you would like to develop?\n3. Develop your business plan\nOnce you have selected the most promising green product or service, you will need to develop a business\nplan. The business plan would include the following:\nTable 1. Components to include in a business plan\nBusiness plan component Purpose & green dimension\nExecutive summary The executive summary of your business plan gives the reader a\npreview of your company profile, vision, mission, strategic objectives,\nmain products, marketing channels and how the business is\norganized. In addition to the generic issues covered in a business\nplan, the summary should highlight its green dimensions.\nLegal format and\nownership\nLike any entrepreneur, you will need to decide on the legal format of\nthe business. A green business needs to choose the best legal format\nfor its situation and purpose, for instance a sole proprietorship, a\npartnership, a cooperative or a limited liability company. You should\nweigh the pros and cons of each format before choosing the best\noption.\nGreen business value\nproposition\nHere you describe the green business value proposition that you have\nand that makes your business different from what is offered by\ncompetitors.\nMarket analysis Your marketing plan needs to be based on a solid understanding of\nthe market. In your business plan, highlight the outcomes of the\nmarket research you have undertaken for each product or service\nyou are planning to bring on the market.\nMarketing strategy and\nplan\nOnce you know your market, you then need to develop a marketing\nplan based on the 7 “P”s: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, People,\nProcess, and Physical Evidence. Consider the environmental\ndimension of these 7 “P”s when developing the plan (for example, for\n“Price”, whether you can charge a premium price for your green\nproduct).\nProduction and sales plan In this section, you explain your production process and you estimate\nyour production and sales volumes, based on your market research.\nExplain how green your production processes is, for example in terms\nof the environmental sustainability of your raw materials or your\nresource efficiency and cleaner production strategies.\n26\nBusiness plan component Purpose & green dimension\nOrganization and staff You will need to decide what your business’ staffing needs are based\non what tasks need to be performed. When assessing what staff you\nneed, consider whether any additional technical skills are needed for\nyour green product(s) or service(s). Add an organogram showing how\nmanagement and employees are structured.\nRegulatory compliance In this section you describe the required taxes and permits and\nselected insurance policies. Make sure to include environmental\ntaxes and environmental permits when doing so.\nLife cycle assessment Your business may need to carry out a life cycle assessment to\nanalyse the environmental impact of your products and services from\ncradle to grave. Life cycle assessments can be relatively simple or very\ncomplex, depending on their exact purpose. A life cycle assessment\nhelps to communicate to clients and partners to what extent your\nproduct(s) or service(s) are environmentally responsible.\nEnvironmental certification\nor eco-labelling\nYou will need to inform your clients about the environmental\ncharacteristics of your product(s) or service(s). Can you get your\nproduct(s), service(s) or your business certified? What certification or\neco-labelling schemes would be adequate? Indicate the costs and the\nprocess of obtaining certification.\nCosting and pricing In this section you outline the costing for your goods and services.\nUse information from the other sections of the business plan to\nidentify costs that you will incur in producing and marketing your\nproducts and services.\nKeep in mind that you may incur some additional costs at the outset\nfor green investments relating to equipment, premises or skills, but\nalso that you will most likely make savings thanks to green practices\nsuch a reduced consumption of electricity or water, resulting in\nreduced utility bills.\nFinancial planning You need to be able to plan and monitor the financial situation of your\nbusiness using tools such as the profit plan and a cash flow plan. Like\nany other business, your green business needs to perform well\nfinancially, otherwise you will not be able to keep it going!\nRequired start-up capital When estimating the required start-up capital, you will need to assess\nyour needs in terms of capital investment and working capital.\nConsider the elements required for your business to be green while\nestimating this cost, and be realistic when doing so.\nSources of start-up capital The most important types of start-up capital are owner’s equity and\nloans. Keep in mind that there are also a number of institutions with\nspecial funding opportunities for green businesses.\nSource: Adapted from ILO Green Business Booklet, 2017\n27\nIn the development of your business plan, you may consult the ILO “Start Your Business” training manual7\n.\nA template for a green business plan is provided at the end of this guide.\nOnce you have developed your business plan, share it with trusted and experienced entrepreneurs or\ninvestors and ask them to provide you with critical feedback. You may, at this stage, also ask for the\nsupport of a business development service provider or a professional business consultant. The analysis\nthat you have to do in order to write your business plan, should provide you with the necessary\ninformation to decide whether to go ahead or not with your business idea. Keep in mind that a business\nplan is not a one-off document. Entrepreneurs need to continually update and improve their business\nplan.\n4. Approach partners\nOnce you have developed your business plan and you are convinced about the feasibility and the\nprofitability of your green product(s) or service(s), you will need to establish the necessary partnerships in\norder to start the business. This means you may need to present your business plan to a bank or investor.\nYou may need to get in touch with potential clients or retailers, as well as with input suppliers. At this\nstage, you may also need to collect information on how to register the business with the municipality, tax\noffice and social security institute and to check how to obtain any licenses you need in order to start\noperations.\n5. Start the business\nOnce all previous steps have been completed with success and the necessary start-up finance is in place,\nit is time to launch the business in accordance with the business plan. The ILO Improve Your Business\ntraining manuals8 can provide you with further guidance on marketing, staffing, costing and pricing, stock\nkeeping, human resources and accounting for your business.\n7 https://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/lang--en/index.htm\n8 https://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/lang--en/index.htm\n28\n— Steps for an existing business to green its processes\nDo you have an existing business and you want to make your processes greener? These are the proposed\nsteps.\nFigure 3. Steps to greening your business\n1. Create an environmental improvement committee\nSet up an environmental improvement committee or team within your business and inform staff of the\nenterprise’s intention to improve its environmental sustainability. The environmental improvement\ncommittee can be big or small, more or less formal, but it needs to have the right level of authority as well\nas the necessary financial and human resources to carry out the tasks and propose the necessary changes\nto management.\n2. Conduct a life-cycle assessment for your product(s) or service(s)\nA life cycle assessment will provide you with a good overview of the environmental impacts of your\nbusiness from cradle (inputs) to grave (final disposal of your products and services) and hence with a good\noverview of the changes you need to create to make your business processes more environmentally\nsustainable. Life cycle assessment can be relatively simple or very complex, depending on your ultimate\nobjective. Most businesses would hire an expert to carry out the life cycle assessment for their company.\n3. Complete a resource efficiency and cleaner production assessment\nA resource efficiency and cleaner production (RECP) assessment will provide you with the necessary\ninformation as to how the business can improve its resource efficiency and move towards cleaner\nproduction. Chapter 4 of this guide explains the approaches that businesses can use in this regard, and it\nexplains the steps to be undertaken. In practice, the business would have to carry out steps 1 (initial\nassessment) to 7 (feasibility analysis) of the RECP methodology as explained in this guide.\n Small businesses may not need to do both the life cycle assessment and the\nresource efficiency and cleaner production assessment. They would rather choose\nthe type of assessment and approach most relevant for their business.\n29\nImage 18. An eco-lodge opted for an RECP approach Image 19. Jane opted for a life cycle approach for her recycled cotton\nbags\n4. Develop an Action Plan\nOnce the business has undertaken the life cycle assessment and/or the resource efficiency and cleaner\nproduction assessment, it should have the necessary information to develop an Action Plan. The Action\nPlan should look at 1) actions for the business to buy more environmentally sustainable inputs, 2) actions\nto make the business’ production process as environmentally sustainable as possible, and 3) actions to\nensure that the business sells products and services that enable sustainable consumption. The action plan\nshould have clear objectives, indicators, measurement tools and it should define the responsibilities and\nresources available for the different actions.\n5. Assess the possibility of environmental certification\nBefore implementing the action plan, the business should assess the possibility, advantages and costs of\nenvironmental certification. Chapter 5 of this guide provides you with more information on the\nenvironmental certification of products and services as well as eco-labels.\n6. Implement the action plan\nThe next step is to implement the environmental action plan. During implementation, close monitoring is\nneeded to ensure the business will meet the stated objectives. Over time, adaptation of the action plan\nwill be needed to ensure the business goes through a process of continuous improvement.\n30\n7. Install an environmental management system\nOnce the business has obtained good experience with life cycle management, resource efficiency and\ncleaner production, it may consider setting up an environmental management system. This will ensure\nthat the business incorporates environmental sustainability in a consistent, rigorous and long-term\nmanner.\nChapter 6 of this manual provides more information on environmental management systems.\n2.4 Focus on greenhouse gas emission reduction\nOne of the key objectives of most green businesses is to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) as\ncompared to the emissions produced by conventional businesses. No matter what approach you choose\nfor your green business (life cycle management, resource efficiency and cleaner production, eco-\ninnovation, circular economy), the reduction of GHG emissions is almost always an important element of\nall of those approaches!\n— What are greenhouse gas emissions?\nGreenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and certain synthetic chemicals,\ntrap some of the earth's outgoing energy, thus retaining heat in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas\nemissions from human activities strengthen this greenhouse effect, causing climate change. If we want to\navoid extreme climate change, we need to urgently decrease our greenhouse gas emissions and carbon\nfootprint.\n— What is carbon footprint?\nThe carbon footprint of your business is a measurement of the greenhouse gases you generate through\nyour business activities. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most common greenhouse gas generated by burning\nfossil fuels such as coal, gas, petrol and diesel. Businesses produce greenhouse gases when they use\nelectricity or burn natural gas, when they buy inputs, transport products, and when they generate waste,\namongst others.\n— How to measure your business’ carbon footprint?\nReducing the carbon footprint of your business is an essential element of greening your business. By\nmeasuring your carbon footprint, you can understand the different ways your business is contributing to\nclimate change and identify ways to reduce it. A good way to start is by understanding where your\ngreenhouse gas emissions come from. You can calculate your enterprise’s carbon footprint using, for\ninstance, the Carbon Trust SME carbon footprint calculator or the carbon calculator of the SME Climate\nHub.\n31\nImage 20. A carbon calculator\nWhen you calculate your enterprise’s carbon footprint, you may immediately realize the difference\nbetween Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions as follows:\n• Your scope 1 emissions: Your direct emissions cause by the use of your vehicles, burning oil or\ngas and/or chemical leakage.\n• Your scope 2 emissions: Your indirect emissions, caused by buying electricity, cooling, heat and\nor steam.\n• Your scope 3 emissions: Indirect emissions that incur in the value chain of your business, such as\nemissions resulting from the raw materials you are buying or the transport you are using to bring\nthese raw materials to your workplace.\n— How to reduce your business’ carbon footprint?\nAll of the green business approaches mentioned in this guide (life cycle management, resource efficiency\nand cleaner production, eco-innovation, circular economy) help you to reduce your carbon footprint, but\nthey also help you to reduce other environmental impacts such as air pollution, eco-toxicity, acidification\nor depletion of freshwater resources.\n32\nImage 21. The RECP strategy of an eco-lodge Image 22. Jane’s life cycle approach for cotton bags\nDepending on the objectives of your green business, you may focus on the reduction of your carbon\nfootprint as your prime objective or you may take a broader approach looking at all your environmental\nimpact categories. When you make this choice, you may study the options for product certification\navailable to your business. Some product certification standards focus just on the low-carbon intensity of\nyour products and processes, while others also include your impacts on other environmental impact\ncategories.\n While carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important greenhouse gas, there are other\ngreenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and certain\nsynthetic chemicals that cause climate change. If your business is in the agricultural\nsector, just looking at carbon dioxide emissions may not be enough! You may need\nto look at methane emissions from livestock and nitrous oxide from mineral\nfertilizers. In the same way, businesses in the waste sector need to take into account\nthat emissions in this sector include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.\n33\nCHAPTER THREE\nLife cycle management\n34\n3.1 What is life cycle management?\nLife cycle management involves managing the environmental impacts linked to the whole life cycle of a\nproduct or service from inputs, production/manufacturing, packaging, transport and distribution to\nconsumption and final disposal. The underlying idea is that a product should not be considered green just\nbecause its manufacturing process is environmentally sustainable. A real green business also needs to\nassess the environmental impacts of the materials it buys, the transportation needed to bring raw\nmaterials into the production process and to bring products to their final consumers. It will even have to\nexplore the way consumers will dispose of the product at the end of its life cycle.\nFigure 4. Cradle to grave and cradle to cradle approaches\n3.2 Life cycle assessment\nBusinesses that want to practice life cycle management need to conduct a life cycle assessment for their\nproduct(s) or service(s). A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) evaluates the environmental impacts throughout a\nproduct’s life cycle from raw material acquisition, through production, use, end-of-life treatment, recycling\nand final disposal9\n.\nA Life Cycle Assessment helps businesses to determine areas of improvement in production processes as\nthe assessment reveals where in those processes the most negative environmental impacts will occur. It\ncan help businesses improve product development, by showing how certain design or material choices\naffect the sustainability of the product. It can also help in marketing, as it allows the business to\ncommunicate to consumers about how sustainable a product is. Finally, the assessment provides\nbusinesses with information on the sustainability of the products and services provided by its suppliers.\nThere are four stages in a life cycle assessment:\nFigure 5. Stages of a life cycle assessment\n9 ISO 14044: Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Requirements and guidelines\n35\nPhase I defines the objectives of the life cycle assessment. Is the business conducting the assessment\njust for its internal use or will the results be communicated to external partners (for instance in order to\nobtain an environmental certificate or to comply with the environmental requirements of a buyer)? Is the\nassessment just intended to help the business improve the environmental impact of a product or will the\nbusiness also use it to make certain claims such as “my chicken soup is more environmentally sustainable\nthan my neighbour’s chicken soup!”\nIf you are performing the life cycle assessment for internal purposes only, you can keep it relatively simple\nor more complex depending on the internal needs of the business. If you are doing the assessment in\norder to make certain claims or to obtain eco-certification, there are certain standards to follow!\nDepending on the objectives of the life cycle assessment, the business will then need to define the scope\nof the life cycle assessment. For which product(s) will the life cycle assessment be conducted? Here the\nbusiness needs to be specific. For instance:\nImage 23. Mary with a bag of 5 kilos of organic compost Image 24. Jane with an organic cotton colour-printed shopping bag\n36\nDepending again on the objectives of the life cycle assessment, the business also needs to define the\nboundaries of the assessment. Let’s take the example of the organic shopping bag. The value chain looks\nas follows:\nImage 25.Value chain of the organic shopping bag production\nIn this case, the business has decided to set certain boundaries. It is not going to analyse the\nenvironmental impacts of the cotton farm that produces the cotton. The business needs to be careful\nthough in ensuring that the deletion of stages, inputs or outputs does not significantly change the overall\nconclusions of the assessment. In the example of the organic shopping bags, this means that the shopping\nbag producer needs to obtain good reference data on the environmental impacts of the cotton it buys,\nso that it doesn’t have to dig deeper into environmental impacts of the cotton farm.\nOnce the objectives and the scope of the life cycle assessment are defined, it is time to make the life cycle\ninventory. The first step here is to describe the product system, which is usually done by means of a\nprocess flow diagram. It could look like this:\nFigure 6. A process flow diagram to describe the product system\n37\nOnce the product system has been modelled, the moment has come to do a life cycle inventory analysis.\nThis means identifying all inputs to and outputs from the processes within the system boundaries. Inputs\nwould usually include materials, energy and water. Outputs would usually include atmospheric emissions,\nwater effluents and solid waste. The process flow diagram could then look like this:\nFigure 7. A process flow diagram to identify inputs and outputs\nNow that the inputs and outputs have been identified, the next step would be to quantify them. Most\nbusinesses would use a data sheet that looks like this:\nTable 2. Template to quantify inputs\nUnit process Production of 100 organic cotton bags\nMaterial inputs Units Quantity Description of sampling procedures: Origin\nWater consumption Units Quantity Description of sampling procedures:\nEnergy inputs Units Quantity Description of sampling procedures: Origin\nMaterial outputs\nUnits Quantity Description of sampling procedures: Origin\n(including products)\nHowever, in a life cycle inventory, we cannot only look at inputs. We also have to look at outputs. A\ndifferent data sheet would be used for the emissions and releases. It could look as follows:\n38\nTable 3. Template to quantify outputs\nUnit process Production of 100 organic cotton bags\nEmissions to air Units Quantity Description of sampling procedures:\nEmissions to water Units Quantity Description of sampling procedures:\nEmissions to land Units Quantity Description of sampling procedures:\nOther releases Units Quantity Description of sampling procedures:\nTo complete the life cycle assessment, a business may use separate sheets to calculate the environmental\nimpacts of transport. This includes the transport of raw materials, internal transportation and\ntransportation of the products to where they are consumed. An example of the datasheet is illustrated\nTable 4.\nTable 4. Template to calculate the environmental impacts of transport\nName of intermediate\nDistance\nTruck capacity\nActual load\nEmpty return\nproduct\n(km)\n(tonnes)\n(tonnes)\n(Yes/No)\nWhile these datasheets may look relatively simple, there are unfortunately certain complexities. What do\nyou do, for instance, if your business makes more than one product? What does the organic shopping bag\nproducer do if, for instance, besides organic cotton shopping bags the business also produces organic\ncotton gardening bags? In such an example it is likely that you use water and electricity for both products.\nYou need to define a procedure for allocating water and electricity to the two different products.\n39\nImage 26. An entrepreneur shares views on input allocation\nThe next step is life cycle impact assessment. During this step, the business evaluates the (potential)\nenvironmental impacts of your products on certain “impact categories”. For example, you might want to\nmeasure the impact of your product on climate change. You would then need to measure the impacts\nstemming from the elementary flows (inputs, emissions and other releases) obtained in the life cycle\ninventory on climate change. Here it gets a little complicated, right?\nThese are the steps:\n1. 2. Select the relevant impact categories, such as global warming, acidification, air pollution, eco-\ntoxicity or depletion of freshwater resources.\nClassify: Assign the elementary flows (your inputs, emissions and other releases) to the impact\ncategories. For instance, the use of energy contributes to global warming, the use of water\ncontributes to the depletion of freshwater resources, while water effluents contribute to eco-\ntoxicity.\nFor each impact category, there is a category indicator. For example for the impact category “global\nwarming” the indicator is kg CO2-eq. For the impact category “depletion of freshwater resources” the\nindicator is the m3-eq. The last step is therefore to calculate the environmental impact of your product for\neach impact category.\n40\nImage 27. Jane reflects on the impacts of\nelectricity use on global warming\nImage 28. Jane reflects on the impacts of her\ninputs on different impact categories\nIn order to do these calculations, you need to use reliable reference data. You can use, for instance,\ndatabases that will tell you exactly how much CO2 emissions result from the use of 1 kWh in, say, New\nDelhi or Mexico City. There are other references that will give you the exact contribution of 1 metre of\norganic cotton to global warming, air pollution and other impact categories.\nThe final life cycle assessment for the impact category “global warming” could then look more or less like\nthis:\nTable 5. Result table of the life cycle assessment for the impact category “global warming”\n1 organic cotton bag of 30x 50 centimetres\nImpact category: global warming\n1.2 metres cotton fabric 4 kg CO2-eq\n0.7 kwh electricity 0.3 kg CO2-eq\n50 litres of water 0.02 kg CO2-eq\n0.1 M3 natural gas 0.1 kg CO2-eq\nTotal 4,42 kg C02-eq\n41\n3.3 Getting support on life cycle assessment\nDo I have to do all of this myself? Fortunately, you do not! There are experts around the world who can\nhelp you with your Life Cycle Assessment! LCA experts use specialized LCA software and they have access\nto reference data that make these assessments easier and more comparable. You may check for instance\nif there is a National Cleaner Production Centrei10 in your country that supports businesses with Life Cycle\nManagement.\nIf you are thinking of hiring a Life Cycle Assessment expert, make sure you think thoroughly about the\nobjectives of your business for conducting the assessment. If it is just for internal purposes, the Life Cycle\nAssessment can be relatively simple and cheap. If you need the Life Cycle Assessment to provide\ninformation on the impact of your products and services to buyers or consumers, then you need\nsomething more advanced. Some businesses do a Life Cycle Assessment just for the impact category\n“climate change” and not for other impact categories such as “air pollution” or “depletion of freshwater\nresources”. This may also simplify things considerably.\n10 National Cleaner Production Centres have been established and are supported in more than 40 countries by the United Nations\nIndustrial Development Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, in cooperation with the global network for\nResource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECPnet)\n42\nCHAPTER FOUR\nResource Efficiency and\nCleaner Production\n43\nResource Efficiency and Cleaner Production (RECP) is a strategy for businesses to reduce environmental\npollution and simultaneously reduce resource consumption. It helps the business to increase\nproductivity by applying preventive environmental practices on a continuous basis.\nBusinesses that apply the RECP strategies can reap the following benefits:\n/ Increased productivity and optimized investments\n/ Minimized environmental impacts, reduced business risks and compliance costs\n/ Compliance with international environmental standards for accessing new markets\n/ Secured long-term supply of production inputs\n/ Improved relationship with stakeholders (such as banks, consumers and local communities)\nResource Efficiency and Cleaner Production aims to contribute to:\n/ Resource efficiency through the optimization of the productive use of materials, water and energy\n/ Waste minimization by reducing both waste and emissions\n/ People’s well-being by reducing the environmental risks for workers, communities and consumers\n4.1 Eight RECP practices\nA business that applies Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Production, may apply one or more of the\nfollowing practices:\nFigure 8. Eight typical RECP practices\nTable 6. Eight typical RECP practices11\nType of practice - Typical solutions\n1 Good housekeeping: changes in\noperational procedures and workplace\nmanagement to reduce unnecessary\n'wastage\".\n- Switch off what is not in use\n- Conduct maintenance and repairs\n- Keep workplace organized and clean\n- Minimize and manage inventory\n- Keep staff motivated\n2 Input materials change: use of\nalternative input materials results in\nlower or less problematic waste and the\nusage of less harmful materials.\n- Use renewable energy\n- Use sustainably-sourced renewable materials\n- Use of secondary materials, water and energy\n11 UNEP, UNIDO, UNDP\n44\nType of practice 3 Better process control: Improve\ncontrol over processes and equipment\nso as to operate these continuously at\nhighest efficiency and lowest wastage.\n4 Equipment modification: Equipment\nmodification or new technology to avoid\nwastage and improve efficiency.\n5 Technology change: Replacement of\n(process) technology with more efficient\nand/or less wasteful technology.\n6 On-site reuse: Application of useful\nwaste (material, energy, water) within\nthe same company for similar or\nalternative purpose.\n7 Production of useful by-products:\nConvert waste products into input\nmaterials for another company.\n8 Production modification: Redesign\nproducts in order to reduce their\nenvironmental impact during\nproduction, use and/or disposal\n- Typical solutions\n- Reduce use of harmful chemical and biological\nsubstances\n- Source supplies from local sources\n- Monitoring of standard operating practices\nand processes\n- Undertake sub-metering for water, energy and\nmaterials\n- Implement automated or otherwise improved\ncontrols, including shut off etc.\n- Undertake preventive maintenance\n- Insulation (pipes, equipment, walls, windows)\n- Proper alignment of production line\n- Improve process temperature, pressure,\nspeed, mixing\n- Rationalize utilities and distribution systems\n- Combine process steps where applicable\n- Efficient boilers, motors, fans, compressors\netc.\n- Change of process, e.g. chemical to\nmechanical, multi- stage change of process\nchemistry, e.g. to catalytic or solvent free\n- Equipment with integrated recovery loops\n- Advanced separation processes\n- Solar process cooling/heating\n- Countercurrent energy or cascaded use of\nwater and energy\n- Provision of used cooling water for external\nheating or cooling purposes (buildings, fish\nfarms etc.)\n- Segregate recyclables for external recycling\nand resource recovery\n- Industrial symbiosis, e.g. use of inorganics in\ncement making, slags in construction, etc.\n- Design for optimal product lifetime\n- Design for minimum use of water, energy,\ncleaning etc.\n- Design for low-waste manufacturing\n- Design for refurbishment, recycling etc.\n45\n4.2 RECP: A step-by-step approach\nThese are the twelve steps in applying a resource efficiency and cleaner production approach.\nFigure 9. The twelve RECP steps\nMost businesses will apply a step-by-step approach as follows:\nStep 1 - Initial assessment\nThe business familiarizes itself with the RECP approach and assesses whether the approach is of interest.\nStep 2 – Secure management commitment\nSenior management commits to the RECP approach and to making the necessary human and financial\nresources available. Senior management communicates to its workers its intention to apply an RECP\nprocess.\nStep 3 - Create an RECP team\nThe business appoints workers from different functional units of the company (production, finance,\npurchasing, sale, etc.) to join the RECP team. The team should be led by a motivated leader who can\nmobilize the necessary support and make decisions during the process. The team needs to be trained and\nit needs to have a work plan.\nImage 29. Uma presents the RECP team of her bakery\n46\nStep 4 – Begin the assessment\nDuring this phase, the business looks at its production process and collects data on inputs and outputs. It\nusually collects data on annual volumes and costs at an annual basis, using the information available from\nthe last 12 months or the last fiscal year. Based on this information, the business identifies the priority\nareas with the highest potential for improvement. These can either be inputs (energy, water, materials)\nwith significant costs or outputs (emissions, waste, water effluents) with significant environmental\nimpacts. The business will – at least in first instance – focus its efforts on these low hanging fruits.\nStep 5 – Finish the diagnosis\nThe business quantifies input flows (materials, energy and water) as well as outputs (emissions, waste,\nwater effluents). The data collected will serve as baseline data for the process. During this phase it will\nalso identify inefficiencies and causes of pollution.\nStep 6 – Identify potential solutions\nThe RECP team will prepare a list of viable solutions. These solutions can be based on the abovementioned\neight RECP practices (good housekeeping, input material change, better process control, etc). The business\nwill prioritize preventive solutions (good housekeeping, process control etc) over pollution treatment\noptions (end-of-the-pipe solutions).\nImage 30. Jane presents her solution to reduce water\nImage 31. Jane compares her solution to other options\npollution\n47\nStep 7 – Perform feasibility analysis\nThe RECP team assesses the technical and economic feasibility of the different solutions. The team will\nmake a cost-benefit analysis, estimating the investments to be made and the savings that can be expected.\nThey may compare different technical solutions to certain problems. At this phase, the RECP team may\nneed expert advice to prepare the right recommendations to management.\nStep 8 – Develop an action plan\nBased on the work done by the RECP Team, management decides on an action plan. The action plan\nidentifies the technical solutions, the investment costs, responsibilities for implementation as well as the\ntimeframe for implementation. The action plan also defines indicators that the business will use to\nmeasure success. Management may decide for one action at the time or for a full set of actions. It makes\nthe necessary recourses available to implement the action plan.\nImage 32. Uma shares her strategy to measure success\nStep 9 – Establish a reliable information system\nThe business needs to make sure that a monitoring system is in place to measure the results of the RECP\npractices implemented. The business will measure impacts based on a set of indicators that look both at\nenvironmental and financial performance.\n48\nStep 10 - Implement the action plan\nFor the implementation of the action plan, it is necessary to include and train all workers that will be\ninvolved in the implementation of the solution.\nStep 11 – Conduct on-going monitoring and evaluation\nOnce the implementation is on-going, the business will make sure that it measures performance by\nlooking at the different input (materials, energy, water) and output (emissions, waste, water affluents)\nflows, in line with the indicators identified in the action plan.\nStep 12 – Commit to continuous improvement\nThe business will reflect on the experience, making sure that the good results are sustained over time. As\nRECP is, in essence, a process of continuous improvement, Management may decide to start looking at\nthe longer list of proposed improvements, going beyond the low-hanging fruit and continuing with more\ncomplex solutions.\nImage 33. Mary and John share their strategy to increase resource efficiency\nImage 34 is an example of a bakery in Nairobi that participated in a resource efficiency and cleaner\nproduction programme. As a result of the programme, the bakery made certain changes to its business\nmodel as presented in the image.\n49\nImage 34. Changes made by the bakery to improve its resource efficiency\n4.3 RECP monitoring\nBusinesses that apply Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Production strategies need to monitor to what\nextent the desired changes are achieved. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization\n(UNIDO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) propose a relatively simple set of six\nindicators, based on figure 10, that can be used to measure and monitor the business' performance\ntowards reducing resource use and pollution12\n.\nFigure 10. Simplified schema of a business’ input/output flows.\nSource: Enterprise-level indicators for resource productivity and pollution intensity. A primer for small and medium-sized enterprises\n12 https://www.recpnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Enterprise-Level-Indicators.pdf\n50\nThe indicators referring to resource use are:\n/ Energy use: Energy use of your business, measured in kilowatt hours, including energy content of\nfuels used (gas, oil, petrol, biomass, etc.) and electricity consumption;\n/ Materials use: total mass of materials used by your business, measured in tons, including raw\nmaterials; packaging and distribution materials, auxiliary materials, etc., but excluding the weight\nof fuels;\n/ Water use: total water consumption of your business, measured in kilolitres or cubic meters,\nincluding all sources (ground water, tap/drinking water, surface water) and all applications\n(process water, cooling water, sanitary water, etc.).\nThe indicators covering pollution are:\n/ Air emissions: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, measured in tons of equivalent emissions of\ncarbon dioxide (CO2). This includes on-site energy-related GHG emissions (use of fuels, gas etc.),\noff-site energy-related GHG emissions (in particular for electricity generation and distribution) and\nprocess-related GHG emissions (both CO2 and non-CO2, particularly CH4 and N2O);\n/ Waste water: The total volume of contaminated water leaving the enterprise, measured in\nkilolitres or cubic meters, regardless of the final disposal method (sewer, surface water), excluding\nwater streams discharged without chemical or biological load (thereby excluding cooling water);\n/ Waste: The total value of waste (solid or liquid) trucked or otherwise transported from the site or\ndisposed and stored on the site, measured in tons, regardless of the respective disposal methods\n(e.g. incineration, landfill, recycling, etc.).\nIn your business, you can either use absolute indicators (such as the kWh or energy used per month or\nper year) or relative indicators (such as your product output per kWh of energy used). If your product\noutput varies a lot over time, it may be better to use relative indicators.\n— Absolute indicators\nResource indicators Pollution indicators\n- tons material use/year\n- m3 fresh water /year\n- kWh energy/year\n- tons of solid waste/year\n- m3 wastewater/year\n- tons of greenhouse gas emissions/year\n— Relative indicators\nResource efficiency Pollution intensity\n- Product output per ton of material used\n- Product output per m3 fresh water used\n- Product output per kWh energy used\n- Waste generation per unit of product output\n- Waste-water generation per unit of product output\n- Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of product output;\n51\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTaking sustainability to the\nnext level: Environmental\nManagement Systems\n5.1 What are environmental management systems?\nIn chapters 3 and 4, we introduced strategies to make production processes more environmentally\nsustainable through a life cycle approach and through resource efficiency and cleaner production. In this\nchapter, environmental management is considered more broadly and Environmental Management\nSystem will be introduced.\nAn Environmental Management System (EMS) is an approach used by enterprises to integrate\nenvironmental concerns in their business processes in a planned and systematic way. Enterprises that\nimplement an Environmental Management System, improve their environmental performance by making\nsure that environmental concerns are systematically included in their organizational structure, roles and\nresponsibilities, planning, operations, and performance evaluation.\nWhereas the resource efficiency, cleaner production and life cycle approaches look primarily at production\nprocesses, an Environmental Management System looks mostly at management processes. An\n52\nEnvironmental Management System can be complementary to a life cycle approach or to a resource\nefficiency and cleaner production approach within the same business. In fact, an Environmental\nManagement System is a way of systematizing the use of a life cycle approach or a resource efficiency and\ncleaner production approach, or any other tool for increasing sustainability.\nAn Environmental Management System helps a business to determine and then achieve its environmental\ngoals. It \"forces\" the company to systematically assess and then improve its own conformity with\nenvironmental management requirements. This pertains to all management areas, including leadership,\ninteractions with stakeholders, the company's environmental policy, action planning, the availability of\nresources, to monitoring and evaluation.\nThe basic elements of an Environmental Management System are:\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Reviewing the enterprise’s environmental goals;\nAnalysing the enterprise’s environmental impacts;\nAnalysing the enterprise’s compliance obligations (or legal and other requirements);\nSetting environmental objectives and targets to reduce environmental impacts and conform with\ncompliance obligations;\nEstablishing programs to meet these objectives and targets;\nMonitoring and measuring progress in achieving the objectives and targets;\nEnsuring employees' environmental awareness and competence; and\nReviewing progress of the EMS and achieving improvements.\nThe most critical success factors for an Environmental Management System are:\n/ Leadership and commitment by top management;\n/ Selection of environmental initiatives that address significant environmental impacts and are\naligned with other business priorities; and\n/ Developing a proactive environmental culture throughout all levels and functions of the\nenterprise.\n5.2 Main elements of an environmental management system\nLet’s have a look at the most important elements of an Environmental Management System:\n— External considerations\nOne of the first steps is to study the\nrelationships between the business and its\nenvironment. Which environmental conditions\naffect the business? How does the business\naffect the environment? Are governments,\nclients or other stakeholders expecting or\nimposing environmental requirements on the\nbusiness?\nImage 35\n53\n— Stakeholder analysis\nA second step would be to identify both\ninternal and external stakeholders in the\ncompany's environmental performance. What\ndo environmental regulators expect from the\nenterprise today and in the near future? What\ndo workers expect - and possibly fear - from the\nenterprise’s environmental policies and\nbehaviour?\nImage 37\n— Environmental policy\nA key element of an enterprise’s Environmental\nManagement System is its environmental\npolicy. This document sets the direction,\nestablishes the objectives, outlines strategies\nand describes the expected results. It is\ncommunicated internally and externally and it\nis updated over time.\nImage 39\nImage 36\n— Leadership\nAn Environmental Management System\nestablishes, and then verifies, the leadership\nrole of the business owner or manager.\nCommitment and support are key factors to\nthe successful implementation of an\nEnvironmental Management System. Is\nmanagement accountable? Does it\ncommunicate the importance of the EMS and\nmake sure it is aligned with - and not\ncompeting with - other business strategies?\nImage 38\n— Roles and responsibilities\nIn relation to the company's environmental\npolicy, and Environmental Management\nSystem requires the establishment of clear\nroles and responsibilities. Who is responsible\nand, accountable for the correct\nimplementation of the environmental policy?\nWho needs to be consulted? Who needs to be\ninformed?\n54\n— Assessment of environmental impacts\nand risks\nAn essential part of an Environmental\nManagement System is the assessment of\nenvironmental impacts and risks. Impact and\nrisk assessment applies to all activities, facilities\nand infrastructure. It covers all environmental\naspects associated with the product life cycle.\nAll environmental impacts and risks need to be\ndocumented and the severity and probability\nof each risk needs to be assessed.\nImage 40\n— Action planning\nIn response to the evaluation of risks, an\nEnvironmental Management System comprises\ndetailed planning to manage environmental\nrisks. Action planning defines who needs to do\nwhat and by when. An action plan outlines the\nrelevant technological solutions, operational\nrequirements and financial and human\nresources needed.\nImage 41\n— Resource and support structures\nThe necessary resources need to be dedicated\nto establish and implement the Environmental\nManagement System. This includes internal\nstaff, expertise the enterprise needs to source\nexternally, information systems and financial\nresources for the necessary investments in\ntechnology and training. It also includes the\nnecessary resources for internal and external\ncommunication. Image 42\n— Operational controls and emergency\npreparedness\nEnterprises need to have the right systems in\nplace to ensure that the activities are\nperformed in line with established guidelines.\nIn its simplest form, this may be about checking\nwhether the electricity bill is going down as\nexpected. Some operations, however, may\nrequire sophisticated procedures and\nengineered control systems.\nImage 43\n55\n— Monitoring and evaluation\nMonitoring and evaluation is about collecting,\nprocessing and analyzing reliable data to\nassess whether the objectives are being met.\nTo this end, clear criteria need to be agreed\nupon and methods for regular monitoring and\nevaluation needs to be established. Monitoring\nand evaluation data need to be fed back into\npolicy setting and action planning.\nImage 44\nAs you may have realised, an Environmental Management System provides a holistic way to ensure\nsustainability is embedded throughout your business. While setting up an Environmental Management\nSystem involves costs and efforts, there are also economic benefits to be gained. Studies have shown that\nenterprises that have an Environmental Management System in place, enjoy savings on energy, material\nuse and water usage expenditures. Small businesses may want to start with a simple EMS that brings\naccessible improvements in management practices, rather than the introduction of a formal,\nadministratively complex EMS.\nAn Environmental Management System enables the enterprise to continuously monitor and improve its\nenvironmental performance. The system follows a repeating cycle (see figure 9). The enterprise\ncontinuously monitors its performance and uses the data to revisit the environmental policy and sets new\ntargets in a revised plan. The enterprise then implements the revised plan. The cycle repeats, and\ncontinuous improvement occurs.\nFigure 11. Steps of a continuous improvement process.\nISO 14001: 2015 is the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective Environmental\nManagement System13. It provides companies with a framework that they can follow. Companies that\nimplement the standard correctly can be “ISO 14001 certified”. This may give them a comparative\nadvantage in certain markets.\n13\nhttps://www.iso.org/standard/60857.html#:~:text=ISO%2014001%3A2015%20specifies%20the,to%20enhance%20its%20environm\nental%20performance.\n56\nCHAPTER SIX\nCommunicating with markets:\nEnvironmental certification\n6.1 Types of environmental certification\nAll is good and well if you have created a green business, but how do others know about it? Bringing an\nenvironmentally sustainable product or service on the market is nice, but how do your clients know that\nyour products and services are environmentally responsible? Making your production processes greener\nand installing an environmental management system is a great achievement, but how do you\ncommunicate your achievements to your clients and partners?\nSustainability certifications can improve your enterprise’s business reputation and/or elevate your brand\nby providing information to customers. We can make a distinction between “system certification” and\n“product certification”.\n57\nFigure 12. System and product certification\nSystem certification is a conformity assessment process, whereby an outside neutral body confirms that\nyour business has an effective environmental management system in place. An example of this is\nconformity with ISO 14001, which is the most recognized international standard for environmental\nmanagement systems. ISO 14001 exists to help organizations minimize how their operations negatively\naffect the environment; comply with applicable laws, regulations and other environmentally oriented\nrequirements and continually improve in these areas.\nProduct certification is a conformity assessment process, whereby an outside neutral body confirms\nthat your product complies with certain environmental sustainability standards. In order to obtain product\ncertification your product needs to be in conformity with the standard set for this particular type of\nproduct. For instance, A South African business that wants to certify that the construction materials it\nproduces and sells are environmentally responsible, can try to obtain the EcoStandard EcoProduct, which\nis a South African eco-label for building and construction materials.\nEcolabels are voluntary methods of environmental sustainability certification. They are a means\nof communicating to your clients that your product is environmentally responsible. Consumers and\ninstitutional purchasers quickly and easily identify those products that meet specific environmental\nperformance criteria and are therefore deemed environmentally preferable.\nSome ecolabels quantify pollution or energy consumption by way of index scores or units of\nmeasurement, while others assert compliance with a set of practices or minimum sustainability\nrequirements. Through a verification process, usually referred to as \"certification\", a business can show\nthat it complies with a standard and earn the right to sell its products with the corresponding ecolabel.\nEcolabels are not to be confused with Green Stickers, which are labelling systems for food and consumer\nproducts that are mandated by law. In many countries, certain consumer appliances, for instance, need\nto have a green sticker that informs the customer about the energy consumption of the fridge or the\nwashing machine.\n58\nISO 14000\nof their operations.\nISO 14000 is a set of standards created to help organizations minimize the environmental impact\nAdoption of ISO 14000 practices is voluntary. Enterprises that adopt ISO 14000 may obtain\ncertification that proves their compliance with environmentally friendly practices.\nThe core of the ISO 14000 standards is contained in ISO 14001, which lays out the guidelines for\nputting an environmental management system (EMS) in place. ISO 14004 offers additional insight\nand specialized standards for implementing an EMS.\nHere are the key standards included in ISO 14000:\n⋅ ISO 14001: Specification of Environmental Management Systems\n⋅ ISO 14004: Guideline Standard\n⋅ ISO 14010 – ISO 14015: Environmental Auditing and Related Activities\n⋅ ISO 14020 – ISO 14024: Environmental Labelling\n⋅ ISO 14031 and ISO 14032: Environmental Performance Evaluation\n⋅ ISO 14040 – ISO 14043: Life Cycle Assessment\n⋅ ISO 14050: Terms and Definitions\nMore than 300,000 organizations around the world have obtained ISO 14000 certification.\n6.2 Environmental certification: how does it work?\nEco-labels can be international, national or even local. An example of an international eco-label is the\nForest Stewardship Council (FSC) label, which certifies that products “come from responsibly managed\nforests that provide environmental, social and economic benefits”. The advantage of obtaining an\ninternational eco-label for your product or service is that this ecolabel can be recognized by buyers in\nglobal supply chains.\nMost countries have a National Standards Bureau, National Standards Organization or equivalent. These\norganizations coordinate the development of environmental standards in the country. They publish\nnational standards, amongst which many could be relevant for green businesses. Some standards\norganizations also help businesses to obtain environmental certification through training and capacity\nbuilding.\nMany private sustainability consultancies and certification companies offer support to businesses that\nwant to obtain environmental certification (both for system certification and product certification). In most\ncases, a consultant would help the business to complete an initial assessment and gap analysis, create a\nsustainability plan and implement the plan. At the completion of the project, an accredited auditor then\nassesses compliance with the standards, upon which sustainability certification is awarded. These\ncertification trajectories can be long and costly. In most instances, enterprises would need to go through\na re-assessment every couple of years, depending on the type of certification.\n59\n— What are the steps for obtaining certification?\n1. The first step is to figure out what kind of certification you want. Do you want to certify your\nenvironmental management system? Or do you want to obtain an eco-label for your product or\nservice? Do you need a national or an international ecolabel? During this step, have a look at the\nstandards published by the standards organization in your country and see which types of\ncertification could be relevant for your business. You may also want to consult the website of the\necolabel index14 to know which ecolabels can be obtained in your country.\n2. The second step is to identify the certification that would bring the highest value to your enterprise.\nAt this step, it is necessary to collect information on costs, requirements and the different steps in the\nprocess. You may want to contact the standards organization in your country and obtain information\nabout the certification process. You may want to talk to enterprises who have completed the process\nand ask them how they assess the costs and benefits of certification.\n3. Once you have made the choice for a certain certification, it is time to identify the organization that\ncan help you with the process. Choosing the right certification body can mean the difference between\nhaving auditors who are knowledgeable in your industry, and those who are not. Make sure to work\nwith an accredited certification body. Compare options, processes, prices and quality of services\nprovided.\n4. Once you have clarity about the costs and the process, prepare the enterprise as good as possible for\nthe initial assessment and gap analysis. The closer the enterprises practices and products are to the\nactual requirements for certification, the smoother the process will be. Keep in mind that during the\nfirst stage assessment, the enterprise will need to provide all relevant documentation.\n5. Make sure you have identified the human and financial resources necessary to complete the\ncertification process. This will require a budgeting exercise, staff training and data collection. Who will\nbe responsible within the enterprise for coordinating the certification process? Is everybody in the\ncompany aware of the process?\nOnce the enterprise is ready to undergo the assessment process, this is an example of the process you\ncan expect:\nFigure 13. An example of the assessment process\n14 https://www.ecolabelindex.com/\n60\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nWorking with others:\nGreen value chains and circularity\nGreen businesses, products and services will not thrive in isolation. For green entrepreneurs to be\nsuccessful, they need to scan their horizon for opportunities to work together with others and enhance\ntheir common strengths. Creating partnerships with other organizations that share your environment-\nbased values is an important step towards becoming effective in green business.\nFigure 14. Example of the opportunities you can seize by broadening your horizon\nGreen entrepreneurs should be constantly on the look-out for effective partnerships and collaborations\nwith suppliers, buyers, other companies, financial and business development support institutions that can\nhelp them in their efforts to eco-innovate and bring green products and services to end markets.\nIn this chapter we will look at the concept of green value chains, circular economy, green finance and\ngreen business support.\n61\n7.1 Green value chains\nCompanies striving to become more sustainable are increasingly looking beyond their own operations to\nthe environmental impacts of their supply chains. This means that more and more large companies are\nlooking for sustainable suppliers. As part of their “green purchasing programmes” they try to find suppliers\nwho can guarantee that the products and services they offer are environmentally responsible. This is a\ngreat opportunity for green entrepreneurs involved in B2B. It can also be a challenge, however, when\nthese companies require environmental certifications that can be costly to obtain.\nImage 45. An eco-lodge looking for a supplier of eco-\nfriendly guest amenities\nImage 46. A producer of eco-friendly guest amenities looking for a\nsupplier of sustainable aromatic oils\nOpportunities to become a green supplier exist in many value chains, ranging from agriculture to\nconstruction, tourism, textiles, renewable energy and personal services, amongst others.\nImage 47. A clay bricks manufacturer that supplies clay bricks to green building contractors\n62\nImage 48. A green building contractor that builds social housing complex\nInserting your green business in a green value chain can be an excellent strategy. But how do you find the\nright opportunity for your business? Below are four avenues for finding new opportunities:\nDirectories\nYou can use online directories to identify companies that are looking for green suppliers. Have a look at,\nfor instance, the Asia Official Green Business Directory15. Here you can find examples of green businesses\nin many sectors. Similar directories exist for other regions or countries.\nMatch-making services\nSome organizations are offering match-making services for small enterprises that want to become\nsuppliers to green value chains. You may, for instance, have a look at green matchmaking services offered\nby GreenCape South Africa. There are also green supplier support programmes that offer grants and\ntechnical support to lead companies and suppliers working together to offer sustainable products and\nservices. An example of this is Chile’s Suppliers for Sustainable Development Network16\n.\nTrade associations and business groups\nMany trade associations provide lists of businesses with sustainable practices that may be looking for\ngreen suppliers. You can look, for instance, at the work done by the Kenya Green Building Society17\n.\n15 Asia Green Business Directories: https://www.greendirectory.asia/\n16 shorturl.at/ftN49\n17 https://kgbs.co.ke/\n63\nTrade shows and trade fairs\nYou can meet potential buyers in person by attending trade fairs. Many exhibitions and events focus\nspecifically on sustainable, ethical and green businesses, either for a certain sector or in general.\nIf you become a supplier in a green value chain, the buyers of your products and services will to a large\nextent dictate the sustainability requirements they are looking for. It is therefore important to find out\nwhat exactly these sustainability requirements are and whether you are able to comply with them. Buyers\nin green value chains may ask for product or process certification. They may also request that their\nsuppliers carry out a Life Cycle Assessment and share the results.\nIn some cases, buyers may use supplier scorecards to evaluate the environmental performance of their\n(potential) suppliers. These scorecards are traditionally used to measure things such as product quality or\ndelivery time, but they can also be used to rate a supplier's sustainability. Supplier scorecards that focus\non sustainability push B2B enterprises to demonstrate the environmental sustainability of their products\nor services. Here it is in your enterprise's best interest to highlight and clearly communicate the greener\nfeatures of your products.\nIn some green value chains, buyers offer support to their suppliers in meeting their sustainability\nrequirements. These programmes are called “supplier sustainability programmes”. Sometimes buyers\nalso provide their suppliers with “supplier sustainability tools”. Participating in a supplier’s sustainability\nprogramme can be quite a commitment and time investment, but also a great opportunity to establish\nyour business in a green value chain and increase sales.\n64\n7.2 Circular economy\nAs explained in Annex 1 “Green business: Key concepts”, a purely circular economy is an economy in which\nwaste does not exist and products and raw materials are reused as long as possible over and over again.\nWaste is the new raw material. If a product is broken, it will be repaired. And if that is no longer possible,\nnew products are made from it.\nFor enterprises there are many opportunities (and challenges) in the circular economy. A circular economy\nneeds to have effective systems and business linkages in place for re-use, repair and recycling. Can you\nfind a place for your business in the circular economy?\nImage 49. A household appliances repair shop Image 50. A bicycle tube repair shop\nIn every sector of the economy, enterprises can find\nopportunities related to the principles of the circular\neconomy. Many small enterprises, for instance, are\nengaged in recycling. Others are finding ways to reuse\ncertain products or they repair products. You can also\nthink of businesses that collect the waste of one type of\nbusiness and turn this waste into the raw materials for\nanother type of business.\nThere are business opportunities in the circular\neconomy that you may not think of immediately.\n65\nImage 51. An entrepreneur in the circular economy Image 52. An entrepreneur in the circular economy\nWhile the business opportunities in the circular economy are plentiful, becoming a “circular economy\nenterprise” requires good preparation. For many business opportunities in the circular economy there are\ncertain regulations to follow. Markets, technologies and prices tend to change rapidly. Above all,\nenterprises in the circular economy need to carefully select their suppliers, buyers and partners.\nBefore you start your circular economy business, make sure you check the following:\n/ In which circular system are you planning to work? Try to visualize your circular economy\nproject and map out who are the essential suppliers, buyers and partners.\n/ How are you going to add value? What are your costs and what are your projected incomes?\n/ Who are your competitors? Are there other enterprises that are doing something similar in\ndifferent provinces? How are they faring?\n/ What are the relevant governmental regulations? There may be certain environmental\nregulations but also occupational safety and health regulations to take into account.\n/ Are there reasons to believe that the market characteristics for your circular economy product\nor service may change?\n66\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nFurther support for\nyour green business\nGreen entrepreneurs need support during the different phases of designing their green products and\nservices and greening the processes. They often also need help in doing life cycle assessments, engage in\ncleaner production and get their products or processes certified.\nIn many countries, fortunately, green business support services are available. We can distinguish between\nthe following types of support services.\nGreen business development services\nTraining and advisory services for entrepreneurs that want to create green businesses or green their\nprocesses.\nGreen business finance\nLoans or equity investment services that target green entrepreneurs and/or that help businesses make\nthe necessary green investments.\nGreen incubation\nGreen incubators help green entrepreneurs with eco-innovation and often support them in the process\nof bringing their green products or services on the market.\n67\nCleaner production centres\nCleaner production centres provide capacity building programmes on Resource Efficiency and Cleaner\nProduction, Life Cycle Management, Energy Efficiency and sometimes also on sustainable finance.\nNational standards organizations / national standards associations\nNational standards organizations coordinate standard setting, publicize standards and provide\ninformation and capacity building on standards and certification processes. In many countries this\nincludes environmental standards and certification processes.\nKeep in mind that there are also many business development services providers in your country or\nprovince that offer training, advisory services and information services targeting businesses in general,\nwithout specific focus on green business development. These business development services providers\ncan help you with the development of your business plan, your marketing plan and the financial aspects\nof running a business. Many business development service providers offer business management training\nusing the methodologies of the ILO Start and Improve Your Business Programme.\nSome support services for green business development are costly, while others may be (partially)\nsubsidized by the Government and/or by development partners. To get an idea of the services available,\ntalk to business development service providers and financial institutions. Try also to collect information\nfrom their clients before you take out a green loan or contract the services of a green business\ndevelopment services provider.\n68\nANNEX ONE\nGreen business: key concepts\nIn this Annexure you will learn more about the key concepts related to green economy and green business.\nKnowledge about these concepts will help you to understand the increasing importance of environmental\nissues in business and society.\n— What are the sustainable development goals?\nIn 2015, all 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted a plan for achieving a better future for all\n— laying out a path over the next 15 years to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and\nprotect our planet. At the heart of “Agenda 2030” are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which\nclearly define the world we want — applying to all countries and leaving no one behind.\n— How are the SDGs relevant for business?\nBusinesses play a very important role in the process to reach the SDGs. The United Nations calls on\nbusinesses everywhere to advance sustainable development through the investments they make, the\nsolutions they develop, and the business practices they adopt. The SDGs encourage businesses to reduce\ntheir negative impacts while enhancing their positive contribution to the sustainable development agenda.\nThe degree and speed with which businesses around the world develop more sustainable and inclusive\nbusiness models will play a large role in the success of achieving the SDGs. In turn, all businesses are\nimpacted by the challenges that the SDGs address.\nGOAL 1: No Poverty GOAL 10: Reduced Inequality\nGOAL 2: Zero Hunger GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities\nGOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\nGOAL 4: Quality Education GOAL 13: Climate Action\nGOAL 5: Gender Equality GOAL 14: Life Below Water\nGOAL 6: Clean Water and Sanitation GOAL 15: Life on Land\nGOAL 7: Affordable and Clean Energy GOAL 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions\nGOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth GOAL 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal\nGOAL 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure\n— What is the green economy?\nA green economy is an economy that brings improved human well-being and social equity, while\nsignificantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. According to the United Nations\nEnvironmental Programme, a green economy is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive.\nGreen economic growth is driven by economic activities that allow reduced CO2 emissions and pollution,\nenhanced energy and resource efficiency, and prevention of the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem\nservices.\n— How is the green economy relevant for business?\nGreen businesses drive the green economy. Businesses around the world are already providing innovative\nsolutions in response to local social, environmental and economic challenges. Businesses also bring the\nnecessary innovations that are necessary to maintain human well-being and equality and at the same time\nreduce the environmental impact of production and consumption. Green businesses thrive better in\ncountries that make serious efforts to green up the economy. They benefit from the policies and support\nprogrammes that help businesses to go green.\n69\n— What is a circular economy?\nIn a circular economy, waste does not exist and products and raw materials are reused as long as possible\nover and over again. Waste is the new raw material. If a product is broken, it will be repaired. And if that\nis no longer possible, new products are made from it. There is no longer the line: produce, consume and\nthen throw it away. This saves raw materials, the environment and reduces CO2 emissions. It stimulates\ninnovation, new business activity and employment. The three circular economy principles are “eliminate\nwaste and pollution”, “keep products and materials in use” and “regenerate natural systems”.\n— How is the circular economy relevant for business?\nIn a circular economy, businesses design products to be reusable. For example, electrical devices are\ndesigned in such a way that they are easier to repair. Products and raw materials are also reused as much\nas possible. For example, by recycling plastic into pellets for making new plastic products. For businesses\nthere are both opportunities and challenges in the circular economy. One of the main opportunities is the\ncosts saving that can be made when materials are re-used. Challenges arrive when environmental\nregulations oblige businesses to follow a circular economy model while enterprises are not ready for it.\n— What is carbon footprint?\nThe carbon footprint of your business is a measurement of the greenhouse gases you generate through\nyour business activities. Carbon dioxide is the most common greenhouse gas generated by burning fossil\nfuels such as coal, gas, petrol and diesel. Businesses produce greenhouse gases when they use electricity\nor burn natural gas, when they use water, when they transport products and when they generate waste,\namongst others.\n— Why is your carbon footprint relevant for business?\nReducing the carbon footprint of your business is an essential element of greening your business. By\nmeasuring your carbon footprint, you can understand the different ways your business is contributing to\nclimate change and identify ways to reduce it. A good way to start, therefore is by calculating your carbon\nfootprint. You can, for instance, use the Carbon Trust SME carbon footprint calculator.\n— Just transition\nWhen countries move to a greener economy, we have to make sure that everybody benefits and nobody\nis left behind. A just transition is about environmental sustainability, but it is also about decent work, social\ninclusion and poverty eradication. For instance, when coal mines are closed and small companies\nsupporting coal mining activities lose their clients, we need to make sure that there are other economic\nopportunities or social protection mechanisms for coal mining communities.\n— Why is the just transition relevant for business?\nBusiness play an important role in the green economy. But they also need to make sure that their green\neconomy and green business strategies are good for workers. If a business decides to stop making\nenvironmentally polluting products and replaces them with environmentally safe products, the business\nneeds to make sure that workers are properly trained. Workers need to be consulted in change-processes\nto make sure that the environment gains and that the workers gain as well.\n70\nANNEX TWO\nFurther reading\nBelow you will find a selection of interesting sources of further reading.\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation works to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. The Foundation\nwork with business, academia, policymakers, and institutions to mobilise systems solutions. It has\ninteresting publications and training materials on its website.\nThe UNEP Sustainable Consumption and Production Hotspot Analysis Tool (SCP-HAT) is an online\napplication that analyses the environmental and socio-economic performance of 171 countries over the\npast 25 years to provide scientific evidence of areas where improvement can be made.\nThe GIZ Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Production Navigator informs development professionals about\nthe relevance of resource efficiency and cleaner production (RECP) and about existing instruments to\nsupport it, with focus on SMEs.\nThe ILO Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) programme is a management training programme with a\nfocus on starting and improving small businesses as a strategy for creating more and better employment\nfor women and men, particularly in developing economies.\nISO 14001 is a family of standards related to environmental management that exists to help organizations\nminimize how their operations negatively affect the environment; comply with applicable laws,\nregulations, and other environmentally oriented requirements; and continually improve in the above.\nThe Global Network for Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECPnet) is a network of organizations\nthat offer resource efficient and cleaner production services to industries and businesses in developing\nand transition economies. The network has published many toolkits, training documents, manuals,\nguidelines and case studies.\n71\nANNEX THREE\nGreen business plan template\nCompany information and contact details\n(Company Logo)\nName of business\nYear established Company Registration Number\nPrepared by\nAddress\nEmail\nMobile number\nWebsite\n72\n1. Executive summary\nComplete this section when you’ve filled in the other parts of the business plan.\nAn executive summary gives the reader a preview of your company profile, vision, mission and strategic\ngoals, how your business is organised, the products it offers, how they are marketed, and your overall\nfinancial plan. In addition to these generic issues, the summary should highlight the green dimensions of\nyour business.\nIn short, it sums up the whole business plan. Make sure to write a good summary, as it will serve as your\ncompany’s presentation, and make sure to clearly state in bold the parts listed in the preceding paragraph.\n2. Legal format and ownership\nHere you can describe how your business is organised and registered.\nA green business can take different forms, such as a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a cooperative or\na limited liability company. Explain who owns the company.\n3. Green business value proposition\nIn this section briefly describe the green business value proposition that you have and that makes it\ndifferent from what offered by competitors by completing the table “business idea description”.\nYou may include a SWOT analysis. Write down your strengths (aspects that give you a competitive\nadvantage, your weaknesses (aspects you don’t do very well), your opportunities (potential developments\nfor your business), and your threats (external events that may negatively affect your business).\nThis will help you reflect and create a better green business value proposition.\n— SWOT analysis\nSTRENGHTS WEAKNESSES\nSWOT\nOPPORTUNTIES THREATS\n73\nBusiness idea description\nName of Business Year Established:\nType of Business Manufacturer Service Operator Retailer Wholesaler Other: ________________\nThe business produces/provides the following\nproducts/service\nProducts and services respond to the needs for\n(include both consumer-related and\nenvironmental aspect):\nThe business ensures its production and selling\nprocesses are green by:\nThe customers are:\nThe business sells to customers in the following\nways (distribution avenues):\nThe business satisfies the following needs for\nthe customers and the environment:\nI plan to grow my business in the following\nways:\nHow many jobs will your business create?\n74\n4. Market analysis\nYour marketing plan needs to be based on a solid understanding of the market. By doing market research you will be able to identify the needs of potential customers and\nfind out how your future competitors have been satisfying those needs.\nWhile carrying out the research, be sure to assess whether your future customers want to buy a product/service with a green added value; and whether they are willing to\npay a premium for this.\nMarket research table\nWhen and how often does the\nWhat customers like about our\nWho are our competitors and facts\nOur Products Our customers/\npotential customers\ncustomer segment buy the products\nOur price\nproducts and services (our\nabout them (strengths and\nand services\nadded value)\nweaknesses)\nProduct 1:\nProduct 2:\nProduct 3:\n75\n5. Marketing strategy and plan\nWhile creating your business plan, you will also have to create a marketing plan.\nMake sure that you add green components to green your marketing plan. It needs to focus on the ideal marketing mix that can help your green business to\nachieve maximum profits, while benefiting environment and society.\nRemember that one of the greatest advantages of having green products is the opportunity to use marketing tools as ways to talk about your product/service’s\nenvironmental and social benefits. If you do this creatively, it will be enough to attract more customers, to increase sales, and to have your green business\nflourish.\nDefine your overall marketing strategy by answering the following questions:\n• Market analysis for each product/service (main customers and competitors, pricing strategy, estimated market share and size, trends),\n• Describe your sales and marketing strategy,\n• Describe your existing market access channels, and\n• Describe your selling capacity (qualification and skills available.\nComplete the table below, which will help you identify marketing strategies for your marketing mix by looking at each of the 7 Ps of marketing: Product, Price,\nPlace, Promotion, People, Physical Evidence, and Process.\n76\nProduct Price Place Promotion People Physical evidence Process\nWhat green goods or\nservices you are going to\nsell?\nHow will you create an\nadvocacy plan for your\ngreen products?\nWhat price\nare you going to charge?\nHow and where are you\ngoing to reach your\ncustomers?\nWill you decorate the\nplace so that it will\nreflect green business\nprinciples?\nHow will you inform your\ncustomers about your\ngreen products, and how\nwill you convince them\nto buy them?\nHow will you ensure\nyour staff understand\ngreen business\nprinciples and protect\nthe environment as they\nwork?\nHow will you brand your\nbusiness to ensure that\ngreen elements are\nvisible? Will they\nadvocate for a more\nresponsible process of\nrunning a business and\nproducing green\nproducts?\nHow will you source raw\nmaterials in ways that\nminimise use of\nresources? How will you\nprocess them efficiently?\nHow will you dispose of\nyou waste in a\nresponsible way? Will\nyou recycle, reuse, and\nreduce consumption of\nresources?\nMeet customers’\nenvironmental needs.\nDevelop products to\naddress these needs; or\ndevelop environmentally\nresponsible products to\nhave lesser negative\nimpact than competitors.\nYou should follow your\nproduct life cycle\napproach to better price\nyour green products.\nAlways introduce your\ngreen products in the\nmarketplace where\ncustomers can easily\naccess them. The place\nmust be consistent with\nthe image that your\ngreen business wants to\nproject for e.g. by using\nrecycled materials to\nemphasize\nenvironmental and other\nbenefits.\nReplace traditional\nmarketing methods with\ne-marketing.\nAny printed materials\nmust be produced using\nrecycled materials and\nefficient processes such\nas waterless printing\nUse paperless\npromotional tools\nwherever possible.\nStaff environmental\nneeds, health, decent\nwork, skills, and\ncompetencies\nBrand your products and\nlabel them to ensure\ncustomers have\nadequate information on\nthe value of your\nproduct.\nPrepare a resource\nefficient business\nprocess map that\nincreases your value\nproposition to your\ncustomers.\nYou can also adopt green marketing channels and tools that involve using less paper and reducing carbon footprint during marketing. Choose green promotional tools to reduce the impact on\nenvironment, such as:\n• Paperless communication, flyers on recyclable paper\n• Online and social media marketing\no Website and online shopping with marketing and promotional plans\no Social media campaigns (like Facebook and Twitter) and blogs\n• Radio advertisement\n77\nGreen Components for your Marketing Plan\nGREEN MARKETING\nELEMENTS\nProduct Price Place Promotion People Physical evidence Process\nDescription\nWhat your green business\nmust do?\nGreen marketing tools\n78\n6.

Define the skills that\nyour business needs, including technical skills, selling skills and management skills.\nOrganizational structure and list of employees\nTasks and responsibilities Responsible person and position Relevant skills and experience\n82\n8. Regulatory compliance\nIn your business plan, you will need to consider the taxes that your business has to pay, licenses and\npermits it needs to obtain, and insurance that it needs to take out.\nKeep in mind that in addition to other generic taxes, businesses may need to pay additional taxes that\nare related to the environment in some countries, such as pollution tax. Depending on the green choices\nyou make, you may be able to lower the taxes you pay, or even be completely exempt.\nYou may need to obtain environmental licences in accordance with the regulations (e.g. water use\nlicence, environmental authorizations for certain activities, waste management licence, atmospheric\nemission licence).\nTo do this, you may need to submit an environmental impact assessment report or other documentation\nto show how you intend to address environmental issues in your business.\nLegal responsibilities and insurance\nThe following taxes apply to the business:\n1.__________________________________ __________________________________\n2.__________________________________ __________________________________\n3._________________________________ __________________________________\nThe following regulations apply to the employees:\n1.__________________________________ __________________________________\n2.__________________________________ __________________________________\n3.__________________________________ __________________________________\nThe following licenses and permits apply:\n1.__________________________________ __________________________________\n2.__________________________________ __________________________________\nThe following insure products are needed:\n1.___________________________________ __________________________________\n2.___________________________________ __________________________________\n3.___________________________________ __________________________________\n83\n9. Life cycle management\nIf possible, include in your business plan a summary of the life cycle analysis you have undertaken. Describe your production process in the shape of a flow\ndiagram and describe the raw materials, energy and water usage, water effluents and solid waste. Describe also the environmental impact of you product\nduring the phase of consumption and disposal. As much as possible, try to quantify the inputs, outputs and environmental impacts.\nENERGY\nWATER\nYOUR PRODUCTION PROCESS\nRAW MATERIALS: CONSUMPTION DISPOSAL\nWATER\nEFFLUENTS\nSOLID WASTE\n84\n10. Environmental certification or eco-labelling\nDescribe the actions that you have undertaken to obtain environmental certification for your business or\nfor your product or service.\nDo you have an environmental management system in place? What kind of process or product certification\ncould your business be eligible for and what are the steps to be undertaken in order to obtain certification?\nHow would certification further enhance your business’ marketing strategy?\n85\n11. Costing and pricing\nThis is the point where you outline the costing for your goods and services. Use information from the\nother sections of the business plan to identify costs that you will incur in producing and marketing your\nproducts and services.\nCosts is all the money your business spends to make and sell your goods or services, and it can be broadly\nclassified into direct and indirect costs. Review your records to identify the different costs you are incurring\nin your business to guide your costing process.\nRetailers and wholesalers buy and sell finished goods, while manufacturers and service providers buy raw\nmaterials to produce goods or provide a service. If you are a manufacturer complete the “product costing\nform for manufacturers and service operators” and if you are a retailer complete the “product costing\nform for retailers and wholesalers”.\nFor more detailed instructions on costing and pricing, consult the International Labour Organization “Start\nand Improve Your Business” training programme.\n86\nManufacturer or service provider costing form\nPRODUCT COSTING FORM FOR MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE OPERATORS\nPRODUCT:\n1.

Financial planning\nYou need to be able to plan and monitor the financial situation of your business. You can do so by making\na profit plan and a cash flow plan, and by checking the actual performance of the business against these\nplans.\nLike any other business, your green business needs to perform well financially, otherwise you will not be\nable to keep it going, no matter how noble its objective. Therefore, make sure to be thorough in your\nfinancial planning.\nProfit plan\nA profit plan shows the profit your business is likely to have each month. Your sales plan and the costs\nyou expect to incur help you to prepare your profit plan.\nPROFIT PLAN (Unit: Rand)\nDETAILS JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC TOTAL\nSales\nMaterial\nCosts\nDirect Labour\nCosts\nGross Profit\nIndirect\nExpenses\nNet Profit\n90\nCash flow plan\nA Cash flow Plan is a forecast of how much cash you expect to come into and go out of your business each month. It helps you to make sure your business does not run\nout of cash. This is important because your business sometimes does not receive cash for sales. Some clients might have delayed payment terms. In some instances,\nyour business might need to make advance payments, such as for licenses. Also, when you invest in equipment your business might need to pay large sums of money\nCASH FLOW PLAN (Unit: Rand) Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec\n1.

Required capital and sources of capital\nIn this section you can indicate how much money you need to implement the business plan. Part of this\nmoney could be available from your earnings. When estimating the required start-up capital, you will\nneed to assess your needs in terms of:\n• Capital investment: business premises, equipment and furniture.\n• Working capital: the stock of raw materials and finished products, marketing costs, salaries,\nrent, insurance, and other costs. It is important to calculate working capital for at least three\nmonths in advance to ensure that your business does not run out of cash to run its business.\nConsider the elements required for your business to be green while estimating this cost. In particular,\nkeep in mind that:\n/ Some green investments will entail additional costs at the beginning, as mentioned above.\n/ These investments, however, will pay off in the long term thanks to lower operating costs.\n/ Other green choices that you may make, such as buying second-hand furniture for your business,\nmay also help you to lower the start-up capital you require.\n/ In terms of other costs, consider also whether you have to budget for an environmental impact\nassessment, an environmental certification if you choose to get one, and other costs that may\narise, such as contracting an energy expert. These will be beneficial for your business, but their\ncost needs to be kept in mind while budgeting.\n14. Estimating required support\nOnce you have estimated the start-up capital you require, indicate how much capital is available to\nfinance your plan and how much needs to be financed from external sources.\nAlso indicate requirements for non-financial needs such as training, access to information and access to\nskilled labour among others including a proposed plan to access the resources.\n92\nList of acronyms\nB2B Business-to-business\nB2C Business-to-consumer\nCO2 Carbon dioxide\nCSIR Council for Scientific and Industrial Research\nEMS Environmental Management System\nEPR Extended Producer Responsibility\nFSC Forest Stewardship Council\nGHG Greenhouse Gas emissions\nLCA Life Cycle Assessment\nRECP Resource Efficiency and Clean Production\nSCP-HAT UNEP Sustainable Consumption and Production Hotspot Analysis Tool\nSDGs Sustainable Development Goals\nSIYB ILO UNIDO United Nations Industrial Development Organization\nUNEP United Nations Environment Programme\nStart and Improve Your Business\nList of tables\nTable 1.

Emphasizing green leadership as a thematic thread, while gently integrating crucial GreenComp references.\n\nCrafting alignment\n\nPiecing together sections on just transition, life cycle management, and green partnerships. Green leadership guides strategy, with minimal GreenComp references, blending seamlessly into a coherent updated document.\n\nBelow is an updated version of your consolidated curriculum document. It integrates insights from the ILO’s “Green Business Guide” (2022) and addresses the five key gaps around leadership, supply chain, ethics/triple bottom line, networking, and continuous innovation. We have minimized explicit references to other frameworks (e.g., GreenComp) in favor of focusing on ILO sources (notably the Green Business Guide and the SIYB approach), while still maintaining the core structure of your existing clusters and worksheets.\n\nAt the end, we provide proposed slide text to help you present these updates effectively.\n\nGreen & Climate-Resilient Business Curriculum\n(Incorporating Key Insights from the ILO’s Green Business Guide)\nI. Introduction & Work So Far\nWe’ve been updating the Five One Labs Curriculum to ensure that environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, and climate resilience are integrated into every stage of a startup’s journey. Rather than building a separate “green accelerator,” our aim is to show entrepreneurs that going green is a smart, forward-thinking business strategy—improving ROI, mitigating risks, and ensuring long-term growth.\n\nKey Updates & Gaps Addressed\nGreen Leadership, Management & Team-Building\n\nWe will add a cross-cutting emphasis on cultivating a sustainability-oriented culture, nurturing “internal sustainability champions,” and highlighting how to lead teams toward greener practices.\nSupply Chain & Operations\n\nWe now explicitly include material sourcing, packaging, disposal, and life cycle thinking in our “Market & Model” cluster, referencing ILO’s Resource Efficiency & Cleaner Production (RECP) approaches.\nEthics & Triple Bottom Line\n\nWithin our “Finance & Impact” cluster, we now underscore how to balance people, planet, and profit, referencing the Green Business Guide on measuring environmental impacts and ensuring social fairness.\nNetworking & Partnerships\n\n“Green” networks and partnerships appear in “Communications & Sales,” helping entrepreneurs find financing, knowledge, and B2B linkages for green solutions.\nContinuous Innovation & Mindsets\n\nWe highlight iterative, long-term innovation to embed sustainability into product/service design, referencing the Green Business Guide on “eco-innovation” and “circular economy” opportunities.\nBy weaving these elements throughout the curriculum, we ensure that participants learn practical tools for building greener businesses, stay compliant with upcoming environmental regulations, and tap into emerging green markets (public procurement, B2B supply chains, consumer eco-awareness).\n\nII. Our Strategy\nOur overarching strategy is to embed sustainability as a business advantage. This aligns with the ILO’s position that “green business is good business,” as explained in the Green Business Guide. We focus on:\n\nMarket & Model: Helping ventures discover green opportunities and integrate them into their core business model and supply chain.\nFinance & Impact: Demonstrating the financial ROI of sustainability, measuring impacts (including triple bottom line), and managing risks.\nCommunication & Sales: Showcasing environmental benefits as unique selling points that build trust with customers, partners, and investors.\nGuiding Principles\nBusiness-First: Every sustainability recommendation must enhance competitiveness, reduce costs, or open new markets.\nAction-Oriented Tools: We provide frameworks, checklists, and worksheets (including references to Green Business Guide tools such as RECP steps and life cycle thinking).\nMeasurable Impact: We emphasize tracking resource usage, cost savings, and environmental outcomes to prove real-world value.\nLeadership & Team Culture: We encourage entrepreneurs to adopt “green leadership,” empowering teams with knowledge and enthusiasm for sustainability.\nReference: ILO’s Green Business Guide suggests that small businesses can “do well by doing good,” leveraging resource efficiency, reduced waste, and better brand reputation to achieve growth.\n\nIII. Implementation Clusters\nWe propose three clusters that run throughout the multi-month accelerator, each referencing ILO best practices (e.g., Resource Efficiency & Cleaner Production, environmental management systems, life cycle management, and more).\n\nCluster A: Market, Model & Supply Chain\nFocus\n\nIdentifying future-proof market opportunities.\nBuilding a robust, sustainability-focused business model.\nIncorporating supply chain considerations: sustainable sourcing, packaging, distribution, and disposal.\nAdopting life cycle management (from cradle to grave) to reduce environmental impacts.\nRelevant ILO Insights\n\nGreen Business Guide, Chapters 1 & 2: “Green business is good business” and “Four main elements of green business” (eco-innovation, RECP, life cycle, circularity).\nGreen Leadership: Encourage entrepreneurs to empower team members as internal sustainability champions, from product design to operations.\nExamples:\nDesigning packaging for reuse or compostability.\nPartnering with local suppliers that have eco-certifications.\nExample Modules\n\nDesign Thinking, Market Research, BMC Fundamentals (now a “Green BMC”), Ideation, Supply Chain & Operations, Service Design.\nCluster B: Finance, Impact & Risk\nFocus\n\nConducting ROI calculations on green investments, measuring operational efficiency, and tracking sustainability metrics.\nAddressing climate/environmental risks (regulatory, supply chain disruptions) and exploring green financing.\nIncorporating triple bottom line (people, planet, profit) in financial models and ensuring business ethics.\nRelevant ILO Insights\n\nGreen Business Guide, Chapters 3–5: “Life cycle management,” “Resource efficiency and cleaner production,” and “Environmental management systems.”\nTriple Bottom Line: Using TBL metrics to measure social and environmental impacts alongside profit.\nResource Efficiency & Cleaner Production (RECP): A step-by-step approach to reduce costs via water/energy/material savings.\nGreen Loans & Public Procurement: Possibility to tap specialized green financing or new markets with governments focusing on sustainable procurement.\nExample Modules\n\nCost Model, Revenue Model, Record Keeping, Balance Sheet, Business Ethics, Financing Alternatives, Risk & Crisis Management.\nCluster C: Green Communications & Sales\nFocus\n\nCrafting compelling, authentic marketing messages highlighting environmental benefits.\nBuilding a credible green brand that resonates with customers.\nForming partnerships and networks that amplify your impact.\nPositioning sustainability as both a moral and commercial advantage.\nRelevant ILO Insights\n\nGreen Business Guide, Chapters 6–7: “Communicating with markets: Environmental certification,” “Working with others: Green value chains and circularity.”\nNetworking & Partnerships: Tapping local/international green networks, forging alliances with like-minded businesses, and entering green supply chains.\nContinuous Innovation: Maintaining a mindset that green solutions evolve over time to meet changing regulations, technologies, and consumer demands.\nExample Modules\n\nMarketing Strategy, The Pitch, Communication, Sales, Branding, Networking & Partnerships, Continuous Innovation.\nIV. Priority Areas & Addressing the Five Gaps\nBelow are our four priority areas for immediate integration, alongside how they address the gaps mentioned by the client:\n\nEnhanced Business Model Canvas\n\nGreen Leadership: Encourage leaders to integrate sustainability dimensions (input sourcing, resource efficiency, triple bottom line) in each BMC segment.\nILO Resource: The Green Business Guide includes a “Green Business Plan Template” (Annex 3) that complements the BMC approach.\nMarket & Consumer Research\n\nSupply Chain & Operations: Evaluate which suppliers have eco-certifications, how materials can be reused (circular economy approach).\nILO Resource: Green Business Guide, Ch. 2 on how to “Scan your environment” for green market demands.\nFinancial & Impact Calculations\n\nEthics & Triple Bottom Line: Make sure cost-benefit analyses include TBL.\nILO Resource: Step-by-step resource efficiency (Ch. 4) and cost-saving tips, showing green investments lead to long-term returns.\nSales & Communication\n\nNetworking & Partnerships: Aligns with ILO emphasis on forging “Green Value Chains.”\nContinuous Innovation: Keep refining brand narratives, stay updated on new eco-labels, certifications, or local policy changes.\nBy highlighting these areas, we show how the client’s suggestions around leadership, supply chain, ethics, partnerships, and innovation are embedded.\n\nV.

It is also reflect-\ned in the setting up of new organizations with\nmandates devoted to the environment, such as\nthe International Solar Alliance (ISA), and the\nintegration of environmental concerns in the\nstrategies of existing institutions. For the Inter-\nnational Labour Organization (ILO), this means\nbringing green jobs to the forefront of develop-\nment efforts as a driver of inclusive, sustainable\nand sustained growth.\nGreen businesses have a key role in this.\nAs green businesses save scarce resources,\nhelp to maintain healthy ecosystems, minimize\npollution and waste, limit greenhouse emis-\nsions, and provide green goods and services\nto enable more responsible consumption pat-\nterns, they are vital for a development model in\nwhich the planet is a priority.\nIn addition, green business acts as a catalyst\nfor entrepreneurs to make a considerable so-\ncio-economic contribution as these businesses\nsafeguard the health of consumers and commu-\nnities, generate jobs, and provide much-need-\ned green resources such as renewable energy to\nfuel other businesses, thereby stimulating the\ngrowth of the economy.\nEqually importantly, for the entrepreneur, green\nbusiness brings with it numerous advantages\nsuch as access to new markets as the demand\nfor green products is on the increase, reduced\ncosts thanks to greening measures in produc-\ntion processes, and improved staff productivity\nlinked to green workplaces.\nThe ILO thus sees green business as a win-\nwin solution to address current development\nchallenges.\nThe Green Business Booklet (GBB) aims to help\naspiring entrepreneurs to set up green busi-\nnesses and existing enterprises to go green. It\nwas developed as a joint initiative of the ILO’s\nDecent Work Team for South Asia (DWT-New\nDelhi), Small and Medium Enterprises (SME)\nUnit and Green Jobs Programme, and provides\nguidance on how to generate green business\nideas, how to design a green business plan,\nand how to green the processes of a business.\nWe trust that it will enable entrepreneurs to\nchoose a green pathway and to benefit from\nthe many advantages this brings while contrib-\nuting to a more sustainable future for all.\nVic Van Vuuren Panudda Boonpala\nDirector Director\nILO Enterprises Department ILO DWT/CO-New Delhi\nCONTENTS\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nACRONYMS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\nABOUT THE GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\nINTRODUCTION TO GREEN BUSINESS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nYOUR GREEN BUSINESS IDEA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\nYOUR GREEN BUSINESS PLAN. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\nGREENING YOUR PROCESSES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\nREFERENCES. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\nANNEX 1: Glossary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\nANNEX 2: Examples of Innovative Green Business Ideas . . . . 30\nANNEX 3: Green Certification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\nANNEX 4: Green Business and Decent Jobs . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe GBB is part of the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB)\nseries of products and of the Green Jobs Packages of the ILO.\nIIt draws on the materials on green business developed in recent\nyears by ILO initiatives in Africa and Asia, and was produced as\na collaborative venture of the ILO SME Unit, ILO Green Jobs Pro-\ngramme, the ILO Decent Work Team for South Asia and Country\nOffice for India, ILO Environment and Decent Work Asia-Pacific\nand the Society for Technology and Action for Rural Advancement\n(TARA).\nThe GBB was written by Eva Majurin with contributions from\nSibongile Sibanda and Manisha Mishra.\nThe review efforts and technical inputs of Merten Sievers and\nPranati Mehtha (ILO SME Unit), Moustapha Kamal Gueye and\nMarek Harsdorff (ILO Green Jobs Programme), Cristina Martinez\nand Lurraine Villacorta (ILO Environment and Decent Work Asia-\nPacific), Alice Vozza (ITC-ILO), Anjana Chellani, Anandan Menon\nand Diya Banerjee (ILO India Country Office) and Sohina Singh,\nArpita Goyal, Shrashtant Patara and Vijay Charturvedi (TARA) are\nsincerely appreciated.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 1\nACRONYMS\nCFL Compact Fluorescent Lamps\nGBB Green Business Booklet\nGYB Generate Your Business Idea\nEMS Environmental Management System\nEYB Expand Your Business\nILO International Labour Organization\nISA International Solar Alliance\nISO International Standards Organization\nIYB Improve Your Business\nLED Light Emitting Diodes\nSDGs Sustainable Development Goals\nSIYB Start and Improve Your Business\nSME Small and Medium Enterprise\nSWOT Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats\nSYB Start Your Business\nTARA Society for Technology and Action for Rural Advancement\n2 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nABOUT THE\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nThe Green Business Booklet (GBB) has been de-\nveloped by the International Labour Organization\n(ILO) to support the creation of green businesses\nand the greening of existing businesses.\nGreen business is vital in contributing to green\njobs, decent work and the development of sus-\ntainable solutions to climate change and other\nenvironmental challenges.\nFor entrepreneurs, going green should also\nmake business sense. Consumers are increas-\ningly interested in eco-friendly products due to\nethical, cost or health reasons so the demand\nfor green products is growing. At the same\ntime, “going green” can cut long-term costs\nas enterprises find new ways to make savings\nand increase profit margins by lowering ener-\ngy consumption, recycling materials or other\ngreening measures.\nThe manual is designed to be used in conjunc-\ntion with the ILO’s flagship Start and Improve\nYour Business (SIYB) programme. SIYB is a\nmanagement training programme that builds on\nmore than three decades of experience. It helps\nentrepreneurs to start and improve micro and\nsmall businesses as a strategy for creating more\nand better employment for women and men.\nThe GBB brings a green angle to the SIYB\nprogramme, enabling entrepreneurs to make\na positive contribution to the environment by\nsetting up and running profitable and sustain-\nable businesses. It helps potential entrepre-\nneurs to come up with a viable green business\nidea and to develop a business plan from a\ngreen perspective, and guides existing entre-\npreneurs on ways to green their business.\nHow does it link to the Start\nand Improve Your Business\nprogramme?\nThe SIYB programme consists of a set of four\ninter-related packages aimed at different lev-\nels of business maturity:\n•\nThe Generate Your Business Idea (GYB)\npackage helps potential entrepreneurs to\nassess their entrepreneurial characteristics\nand to come up with a viable business idea.\n•\nThe Start Your Business (SYB) package takes\nstarting entrepreneurs through the process\nof developing a business plan in order to get\nstarted.\n•\nThe Improve Your Business (IYB) package\nconsists of a set of modules to help already\nexisting entrepreneurs to improve various as-\npects of their business, such as marketing,\naccounting or planning.\n•\nThe Expand Your Business (EYB) package is\nfor growth-oriented entrepreneurs and helps\nthem to come up with a growth strategy in\norder to expand their business.\nThe GBB is intended to provide practical guid-\nance on green business for SIYB trainees in-\nterested to go green. To make it easy to use,\nthe GBB mirrors the structure of the SIYB pro-\ngramme, with its chapters addressing the issues\ncovered in the first three SIYB packages (GYB,\nSYB and IYB), but from a green perspective.\nThe GBB does not duplicate business manage-\nment concepts covered in the SIYB packages;\nfor optimal learning outcomes, the GBB should\ntherefore be used in conjunction with the SIYB\npackages which it complements.\nWho is it for?\nThe GBB is intended for persons interested\nin setting up a green business, or already\noperating a business that could be greened.\nAs it is primarily geared towards trainees of\nthe SIYB programme, basic business man-\nagement concepts that are covered in SIYB\nare not covered in the GBB, and we therefore\nencourage all readers of the GBB to also draw\non the SIYB materials.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 3\nStructure of the booklet\nThe GBB is designed to assist potential entre-\npreneurs to identify a suitable green business\nidea and to develop a business plan for their\nfuture green business, and to help entrepre-\nneurs who already have an enterprise to green\ntheir business. The booklet is structured as\nfollows:\n•\nReaders will learn about what is meant by\ngreen business and what its benefits are in\nChapter 1.\n•\nPotential entrepreneurs in search of busi-\nness ideas will be guided through ways of\ngenerating green business ideas and select-\ning an appropriate idea in Chapter 2.\n•\nPotential entrepreneurs preparing to start a\ngreen business will be assisted in the critical\nsteps needed for developing a business plan\nfor their green business in Chapter 3.\n•\nExisting entrepreneurs are introduced to\npractical steps for greening their business\nprocesses in Chapter 4.\nIt should be noted that though Chapter 2 is\nintended for starting entrepreneurs, it will also\nbe relevant for existing enterprises which may\nchoose to go green by adding a green prod-\nuct or service to their existing range. Similar-\nly, though Chapter 3 is primarily designed for\nstarting entrepreneurs and Chapter 4 for exist-\ning entrepreneurs, both starting and existing\nentrepreneurs will benefit from going through\nthe two chapters as some aspects will be rel-\nevant for both categories of readers. We there-\nfore recommend to work your way through the\nwhole booklet. We hope you will enjoy exploring\nand making use of green business opportuni-\nties through the GBB.\n•\nTIPS FOR USING THE GREEN\nBUSINESS BOOKLET IN AN\nENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY:\nPrint the manual only if you really need to.\nYou can view the electronic version on screen\nby downloading it from various ILO websites,\nincluding: www.ilo.org/siyb and www.ilo.org/\ngreenjobs\n4 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nIntroduction to\ngreen business\nYour green\nbusiness idea\nYour green\nbusiness plan\nGreening\nyour processes\nGoing green is good for the\nenvironment – and it’s good\nfor your business, too!\n•\n•\n•\nWhen printing, select the eco-friendly ver-\nsion with less graphics and colours\nOnce you have finished using the printed\nversion, pass it on to someone else who may\nneed it\nWhen it is really no longer needed, please\ngive it in for recycling - paper is recyclable\nup to 7 times!\n1\nINTRODUCTION TO\nGREEN BUSINESS\nWelcome to the world of green business, an\nexciting and rapidly expanding sector for en-\ntrepreneurs like you who want to create an\nimpact on the economic, environmental and\nsocial fronts.\nOur daily business activities can have a nega-\ntive effect on the environment through air and\nwater pollution, the disposal of waste, or the\noveruse of natural resources, among others.\nAt the same time, businesses depend on the\nenvironment to access different inputs, such\nas land, energy, or water. In instances where\nnatural disasters, pollution, climate change\nand resource depletion are experienced, busi-\nnesses are negatively affected.\nOn the one hand, going green has thus become\na necessity for running a successful and sus-\ntainable business, rather than an option.\nOn the other hand, businesses are also unique-\nly placed to contribute positively to the envi-\nronment.\nFinally, going green can be a good business\ndecision as we intend to show in this guide!\nBy producing environmentally friendly prod-\nucts or offering environmentally friendly ser-\nvices, or by ensuring that their processes are\n“green”, businesses can participate in the pro-\ntection of the environment while making a prof-\nit. Often, greener processes also lead to other\nbenefits such as cost savings and productivity\nincreases, meaning going green makes good\nbusiness sense.\nWe congratulate you on taking the decision to\nexplore green business opportunities through\nthis booklet.\nThis introductory chapter will provide an over-\nview of some of the current environmental\nchallenges and why we need to go green, ex-\nplain what is meant by green business and ex-\nplore what the benefits of green business are.\n1.1 Environmental challenges\nand how we can solve them\nSolar energy businesses are booming in South Asia. In India, many rural\nhouseholds are now able to access off-grid energy thanks to them, and in\naddition, they help to fuel other businesses and their growth.\nWhat environmental challenges\nexist?\nEnvironmental challenges that we are faced\nwith include the longer term challenge of cli-\nmate change, as well as the more immediate\nchallenges of air, water, soil and solid waste\npollution:\n•\nClimate change: The use of fossil fuels (coal,\npetrol and natural gas) releases large quanti-\nties of greenhouse gases, which in turn cause\na rise in temperature and global warming. This\nresults in a range of challenges such as a loss\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 5\nof biodiversity because of the extinction of\nspecies that are not able to tolerate the new\nenvironment; desertification; rises in sea levels\nthat will take over land in coastal areas; and\nextreme weather incidents such as droughts,\nfloods and storms.\n•\nAir, water, soil and solid waste pollution:\nAir pollution results from gases or hazardous\nsubstances entering the air, often from hu-\nman activities such as emissions from facto-\nries, vehicle exhausts, smoke from farmland\nburning or dust from construction. Water\npollution occurs when harmful substances\nenter clean water, including from domestic\nsewage, industrial sewage, or farmland sew-\nage with chemical pesticides, herbicides and\nfertilizers. Soil pollution is caused by pollut-\nants entering the soil through water or other\nmeans. Solid waste pollution includes solid\nwaste from domestic, agricultural or industri-\nal sources, such as organic waste, plastic, or\nmetal for example.\nHow do these environmental\nchallenges affect us?\nThese environmental problems affect us in\nmany ways. Two key impacts that are of ut-\nmost importance to our wellbeing are health\nand incomes:\n•\nEnvironmental problems cause health prob-\nlems. Air, soil and water pollution mean that\nwe breathe, eat and drink toxins that harm\nour health. Furthermore, changes in weath-\ner patterns can disturb food production and\njeopardize food security; droughts and un-\nseasonal rains, for instance, result in harvest\nlosses that can limit access to basic nutri-\ntion. Diseases also spread more easily follow-\ning extreme weather events such as floods,\nand temperature rises mean that heat-relat-\ned diseases, such as malaria, migrate to cold\nareas where they were not found earlier.\n•\nEnvironmental problems damage business\nactivity and livelihoods. If the resourc-\nes that people depend on are destroyed,\nbusiness and incomes suffer. For example,\nif water pollution causes fish to die or if\ntemperature changes mean that a particu-\nlar crop no longer grows where it used to,\nthis means business closures and livelihood\nlosses for the communities that depend on\nthese resources. In addition, environmen-\ntal problems can also affect the ability of\npeople to work. For example, workers in a\nfactory with a high level of indoor air pollu-\ntion may become sick and less productive\nat work, or may even need to discontinue\n6 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nwork altogether, which impacts both the\nworkers’ incomes as well as the operations\nof the factory.\nWhat can be done?\nGiven the negative consequences of these\nenvironmental problems, governments world-\nwide are taking action to tackle them, includ-\ning measures such as gradually shifting from\nthe use of fossil fuels like coal to alternative\nsources of energy like solar energy; developing\npublic transport systems that reduce urban air\npollution; and encouraging industries to cut\ntheir emissions.\nBut, action can and also needs to be taken\nat the level of private individuals, whether as\nconsumers or businesses. Here are some ex-\namples of action that can be taken:\n•\nIn terms of energy consumption, we can opt\nfor renewable sources which are clean such\nas the sun, wind or water flow instead of\nnon-renewable sources such as coal or die-\nsel. For water use, we can opt for renewable\nsources such as rainwater harvesting instead\nof groundwater pumping.\nWe can use the “3R” strategy of reducing,\nreusing and recycling: by reducing unneces-\nsary consumption, reusing things and recy-\ncling waste material to create new material,\nwe can increase efficiency, minimize waste\nand avoid the overexploitation of natural raw\nmaterials.\nWe can choose organic products instead of\nones that rely on synthetic, chemical sub-\nstances for their production.\nExercise:\nThink of the community you come from. What\nare the environmental problems it faces? How\ndo these affect community members as well as\nbusinesses in the community? What needs to\nbe done to solve them? Use the table below to\nsummarize your answer.\nHOW DOES\nIT AFFECT\nPEOPLE?\n•\n•\nWHAT\nIS THE\nPROBLEM?\nWHAT\nNEEDS TO\nBE DONE\nABOUT IT?\nCAN ADDRESSING\nTHE PROBLEM\nIMPROVE\nBUSINESS\nPERFORMANCE?\nThe GBB provides guidance on how busi-\nnesses can contribute to solving the above\nmentioned problems by going green through\nmeasures tackling environmental problems\nwhile tapping into growing markets and mak-\ning a profit.\n1.2\nWhat is green business?\nThe concept “green business” is composed of\ntwo elements – “green” and “business”. As\nall business, green business is about making\nmoney. But “green” means doing so while sus-\ntainably harnessing opportunities that nature\nholds, and without harming the environment.\nGreen business can be defined from two per-\nspectives: one relates to the output in the form\nof green products or services, while the other\nrelates to the process of an economic activity.\nThis means entrepreneurs can enter into the\n“green” business sector by either providing\nenvironmentally friendly products or services\nor through an environmentally friendly process\nor with the help of clean technologies which\nreduce any negative effects of the business.\nGreen\nProducts or\nServices\nGreen Business\nGreen\nProcess\nWhile a step-by-step approach of gradual\ngreening is usually most practical, ideally, as\nthe business matures, both its outputs as well\nas processes should become green.\nEXAMPLES OF GREEN BUSINESSES:\nGreen businesses may offer products or ser-\nvices that are explicitly green, often making\nuse of technological innovation…:\nWaste management business: A company\ninvolved in the collection and processing of\nwaste so it can be recycled, composted and\ndisposed of in a way that is as environmen-\ntally friendly as possible.\nRenewable energy company: A company in-\nvolved in the manufacturing, installation and\nservicing of solar panels to generate electric-\nity instead of generating it from non-renew-\nable sources.\n…Or, green businesses may operate in “stand-\nard” sectors offering mainstream products and\nservices, but may still be green because of the\noperational choices they have made:\nHair salon: A hair salon that uses dyes and styl-\ning products made of organic substances; has\ninstalled solar panels to provide electricity for\nthe operation of equipment; and has procured\nsecond-hand furniture and equipment.\nClothes manufacturer: A clothes manufactur-\ning company that uses organic cotton and dyes\nas raw material; that filters its waste-water in a\nway that it can be partly re-used for irrigation;\nand that has installed LED-lights.\nIn terms of greening processes, there are many\ndimensions of operations that should be con-\nsidered. The main pillars of greening process-\nes in businesses are outlined below:\nRECYCLING\nAND WASTE\nREDUCTION\nReduce • Reuse • Recycle\n• Separate waste •\nDispose in a suitable way\nENERGY\nAND WATER\nCONSERVATION\nSave heat and electricity •\nSave water • Use efficient\nequipment • Use only\nwhen needed • Source\nfrom renewable sources\nPOLLUTION\nPREVENTION\nUse low emission\nequipment • Operate\nefficiently • Use\ndegradable materials\nGREEN\nPROCUREMENT\nProcure environmentally\nsustainable and local\nmaterials/products •\nChoose suppliers that try\nto be environmentally\nfriendly\nGREEN\nDISTRIBUTION\nAvoid transport to far-\naway places • Use the\nmost sustainable method\nof transport • Choose\ndistributors that try to be\nenvironmentally friendly\nDECENT WORK\nProvide productive work,\na fair income, security\nin the workplace, social\nprotection, voice, and\nequality of opportunity\nand treatment\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 7\nYou will note that while the other pillars re-\nfer to the environmental dimensions of doing\nbusiness, the last pillar, “decent work”, re-\nfers to its social dimension. Because of their\ncontribution to broader development goals as\nwell as to guarantee business success, it is\nimportant that businesses consider both their\nenvironmental and social performance, as eco-\nnomic performance is linked to these. Green\nbusinesses therefore need to also provide “de-\ncent work”, that is, work that is productive and\ndelivers a fair income, social protection and\nvoice to workers; only that way will the busi-\nness function optimally.\nExercise:\nDecide whether the following businesses are\ngreen or not green. Then try to rank them in\nterms of greenness from most green (1) - to\nleast green (4).\nBUSINESS GREEN\nNOT\nGREEN\nNOT\nSURE\nGREEN-\nNESS\nRANK\nYOUR\nCOM-\nMENTS\nA bicycle\nmanufacturer\nthat uses\nsecond-hand\nparts to make\nthe bicycles\nA shoe man-\nufacturer that\nmakes shoes\nfor the export\nmarket\nA tourism\ncompany that\norganizes\njeep safaris\nin a nature\nreserve\nA juice-mak-\ning company\nthat has\nconverted to\nsolar energy\nNote: You will notice while doing the exercise\nthat it is not always easy to answer whether\na business is green or not, or to compare en-\nterprises in terms of their greenness. Often,\nbusinesses start with only a few changes that\nbegin their transformation into a greener busi-\nness than before, and they then continue to\nprogressively become greener. Initially, even a\nfew small changes are a step in the right di-\nrection!\n8 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n1.3 Why go green?\nThe benefits of green business\nThere is no doubt that green business is critical-\nly important for productive, healthy and sustain-\nable societies. As green businesses use limited\namounts of (or no) fossil fuels and have low (or no)\nemissions, they can play a key role in combating\nclimate change while contributing to growth and\nthe creation of decent and green jobs.\nBut apart from macro-level benefits, going green\nalso makes business sense for the entrepreneur.\nThe benefits of greener business include ac-\ncess to untapped markets, improved resource\nefficiency and cost savings, and improved pro-\nductivity of staff as a result of a cleaner and\nsafer working environment. These benefits are\nexplained in the section below.\nEXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS OF\nA GREEN BUSINESS:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nAccess to markets, as clients increasingly\ndemand environmentally friendly products\nbecause of increased eco-awareness, but\nalso because of health reasons (greater\nsafety of non-toxic products) or financial\nreasons (lower operating cost).\nCost savings, as water, energy and other\nbills go down and as resource-use becomes\nmore efficient.\nAccess to support, both financial and\nnon-financial, as governments place in-\ncreasingly high importance on environ-\nmental considerations.\nHigher productivity due to a healthier\nworkforce whose ability to work is not com-\npromised by health hazards such as toxins\nin the workplace.\nA healthier surrounding environment in\nwhich the resources needed by the busi-\nness now and in the future are preserved.\nA growing market and\nincreased demand\nThere is an increased demand for green prod-\nucts and services for several reasons.\nIn their choice of products and services, be-\ncause of ethical concerns, customers are in-\ncreasingly interested in clean production pro-\ncesses, environmentally friendly inputs and\nthe way businesses dispose of their waste.\nIn addition, because clients are aware of the\nreduced operation cost of highly efficient prod-\nucts, the market is increasingly demanding\nproducts and services which are highly materi-\nal and energy efficient as well as environmen-\ntally friendly. This is not only because of re-\nduced costs for users but because of the added\nbenefits: energy efficient light bulbs reduce the\nusers’ electricity bill and require less frequent\nchanges; solar lanterns provide better and\ncleaner light as compared to kerosene lanterns\nwhile they can also be re-charged for free; and\nhighly efficient cell phone batteries which last\nfor one week are far more convenient for clients\nthan those that last for only one day.\nOrganic products and nature tourism are in de-\nmand because of the perceived health and lei-\nsure benefits for the clients. Clients consider\nfood that is free from pesticides and synthet-\nic additives to be a safer and healthier option\nthan non-organic food. Similarly, relaxing in\na nature resort with beautiful scenery is pre-\nferred to staying in a concrete block in a pol-\nluted environment.\nGreen enterprises offer environmentally friend-\nly innovations that can tap into this growing\nmarket demand.\nIncreased business efficiency and\ncost savings\nGoing green can reduce costs and improve the\nbusiness’ productivity (meaning that with the\nsame amount of inputs, it can produce more),\nmaking it more competitive. A business that re-\nduces its material costs, energy costs, water costs\nas well as other costs that might be incurred by\nwastage becomes more efficient, less costly and\nmore productive. For example, if the business is\nable to reduce electricity costs through energy\nefficient equipment or techniques, and thereby\nreduce its overall production cost, its profit mar-\ngin may grow or it may be able to reduce its price\nto attract new customers.\nA healthier and more productive\nworkforce\nWorkers in a green business will usually have\nless health problems than those in businesses\nwhich engage in environmentally damaging pro-\ncesses. For example, in enterprises that use toxic\nchemicals, indoor air pollution in the facilities\ncan cause both immediate health problems such\nas nausea, headaches and dizziness as well as\nlong-term health impacts like lung damage. If\nthese issues are resolved, less people will be sick\nand firm production processes will not be inter-\nrupted. With less disruptions, the business will\nnot lose time and resources. Workers will also be\nmore productive because they will not be worried\nabout health hazards. The greening of processes\ncan thus lead to less absences in the form of sick\nleave or a lower rate of discontinuation of work\ndue to serious health problems, and higher on-\nthe-job productivity as workers are able to work\nin a healthy state.\nAccess to financial incentives and\nother support measures\nDifferent countries have developed measures\nand policies to create a shift towards an econ-\nomy that has a reduced negative effect on the\nenvironment. Policies, laws, and regulations\nhave been developed to discourage tradition-\nal enterprises from high energy consumption,\nhigh pollution and high greenhouse gas emis-\nsions. In some countries, polluting activi-\nties may be subject to fines, and taxes may\nbe imposed on fuels such as petrol or diesel;\nshifting away from these thus makes financial\nsense. But more importantly, positive incen-\ntives are also increasingly being introduced to\nencourage greener business processes and to\nstimulate emerging green industries such as\nrenewable energy, eco-agriculture, and green\ntourism among others. Because of this, busi-\nnesses which go green are often able to benefit\nfrom a range of measures designed to encour-\nage the growth of the green business sector.\nThese may include, for example, tax reduc-\ntions, access to attractive financial products\nsuch as low-interest loans for green business,\nsubsidies for switching to new environmen-\ntally friendly technologies, or various types of\nnon-financial assistance such as training pro-\ngrammes.\nExercise:\nTry to brainstorm incentives and support meas-\nures that are available in your context for green\nbusinesses:\nTYPE OF\nINCENTIVE/\nSUPPORT\nAVAILABLE:\nWHO\nPROVIDES IT?\nWHO CAN\nACCESS IT?\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 9\nA better business environment\nBusinesses not only have a responsibility but also\na self-interest to ensure a healthy environment.\nBusinesses depend on the resources in their\ncommunities, and often, an environmentally\nfriendly choice in terms of resources is a sound\nbusiness choice too: for example, fossil fuels\nare depleting and becoming more and more ex-\npensive to procure. If your business continues\nto rely on a fossil fuel and does not diversify\nenergy usage to renewable natural resources, it\nmight run the danger of suffering losses when\nthe fossil fuel is no longer available.\nAlso, the impact of a business on the surround-\ning environment affects the enterprise itself,\nother enterprises, and communities at large,\nparticularly children who suffer the most from\nwater and air pollution. For example, a textile\ncompany that dumps waste materials such\nas dying or bleaching chemicals into a near-\nby river pollutes freshwater which many poor\nfamilies use for cooking and drinking, and may\nkill the fish upon which communities depend\nfor food and livelihoods. Similarly, a farm that\nuses pesticides that are toxic to humans or a\nbrick kiln emitting polluting smoke may affect\nthe health of the surrounding community, in-\ncluding those who work for these businesses as\nwell as other community members. Protecting\nthe resources within the surrounding environ-\nment is therefore both an ethical responsibility\nof the business as well as a sensible business\nstrategy to ensure continued access to these\nresources.\nBeyond these immediate effects, green busi-\nnesses can also contribute to slowing down\nclimate change in the long term, and have an\ninterest to do so. Agro-enterprises, for exam-\nple, suffer from the changing weather patterns\nand extreme events such as floods or droughts.\nBy greening their businesses, entrepreneurs\ncontribute to the maintenance of an environ-\nment in which they can continue to operate on\na profitable basis also in the future.\n10 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nExercise:\nTest whether you have read everything in this\nchapter carefully and reflected on the various\nbenefits!

While this\nchapter is primarily intended for aspiring en-\ntrepreneurs in search of a business idea, it\nmay also prove useful for entrepreneurs who\nalready have a business but would like to di-\nversify their product or service range.\n2.1\nDo I have the right\ncharacteristics to become a\ngreen entrepreneur?\nGreen entrepreneurs are involved in the pro-\nduction of environmentally friendly products\nand services or make use of processes that\nare environmentally friendly.\nGreen entrepreneurs like any other entrepre-\nneurs need to possess certain characteris-\ntics to be successful. These characteristics\n(passion; goal-orientation; decision-making;\nrisk-taking; ability to handle stress; ability\nto access to social support; financial endow-\nment; business management skills) are dis-\ncussed in detail in the GYB manual.\nIn addition to these general characteristics,\ngreen entrepreneurs need to think about the\nplanet and its people along with profit, so\nsome further characteristics are required.\nWhen completing the assessment in the\nGYB manual, we recommend you also re-\nflect on whether you have these additional\ncharacteristics.\nA GREEN ENTREPRENEUR NEEDS TO BE:\n•\n•\n•\nAnalytical – As the green sector is rela-\ntively new, entrepreneurs venturing into it\nneed to be able to analyze the potential for\nsuccess and failure and plan accordingly.\nInnovative – Green entrepreneurs need\nto be able to “think outside the box” and\ncome up with new solutions to address en-\nvironmental problems.\nCommitted to ethical standards – A green\nentrepreneur needs to think about profit,\nbut also about people and the planet (the\n3 “P”s) when making business decisions.\nWhen developing green business ideas, consider your future market and\nresources that can be availed.

It is equally important\nto assess the economic dimensions such as\nwhether there will be sufficient demand for\nthe product or service. If your business idea\nis not economically viable, it cannot succeed,\nno matter how noble the idea may be. So you\nneed a sound business idea to be able to help\nthe environment!\n14 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n3\nYOUR GREEN\nBUSINESS PLAN\nAs you now know, a green business may be a\nbusiness that sells green products or services,\nor which operates according to green princi-\nples. Green businesses therefore contribute\nto solving environmental problems and have a\nminimal negative impact on the environment.\nIn order to launch your business, you need to\ndevelop a business plan. The Start Your Busi-\nness (SYB) package has a detailed step-by-\nstep process for developing a business plan.\nThe business plan for your green business\nneeds to be adapted to include key elements\nthat are critical in starting a green business. In\naddition to coming up with a viable green busi-\nness idea (see Chapter 2 for guidance), as you\nThe founder of Lemonbar decided to start a business that serves organic\ndrinks to a health-oriented clientele. To get started with your green business,\na first step is the development of a business plan.\nplan for starting your green business it is im-\nportant to also look at the business processes\nand workplace behaviours and practices with\nthe objective of increasing resource efficiency,\nclean production and reducing any possible\nnegative impacts on the environment.\nThis section of the GBB highlights some im-\nportant green aspects to include in the busi-\nness plan.\nA more in-depth overview of how to green your\nprocesses by setting up an environmental\nmanagement system (EMS), also important for\nyour business plan, is provided in the following\nchapter, as it is applicable not only to starting\nenterprises, but also existing ones.\n3.1 The green dimensions of\nyour business plan\nWriting a green business plan is one of the\nmost important steps for starting up a green\nbusiness. The development of the plan is not\nan overnight process and may take several\nweeks to complete. The business plan for your\ngreen business should cover all the aspects to\nbe considered before starting the business.\nThe main components of a business plan are\noutlined in this chapter. For all the compo-\nnents of your business plan, you need to make\nsure that you add any green dimensions that\nare relevant.\nThese green dimensions may relate to:\n•\nHow the environment is affected by the par-\nticular business plan component: for exam-\nple, in terms of marketing, when consider-\ning distribution, long-distance transport will\nbe more damaging to the environment than\nshort distances.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 15\n•\nHow each of the business plan components\nis affected by the green characteristic of your\nproduct/service: for example, when consider-\ning the price, you may be able to charge more\nthan your competitors because customers may\nbe willing to pay more for a green product, and\nyou may thereby enjoy a higher profit margin.\nYou will note that the business plan also in-\ncludes a section on greening your business.\nGreening is a cross-cutting issue that will come\nup in most other sections of your business plan.\nHowever, it is useful to give greening specific\nattention through a section specifically devoted\nto summarising all the required measures.\nBUSINESS PLAN\nCOMPONENT\nPURPOSE &\nGREEN DIMENSION\nExecutive summary The executive summary is an outline of your green business idea. In addition to\nthe generic issues covered in a business plan, the summary should highlight its\ngreen dimensions.\nYour business idea All business plans are based on an idea. In describing your idea, you need to high-\nlight what makes it unique as a green business (in terms of the product/service or\nprocess).\nThe marketing plan Your marketing plan needs to be based on a solid understanding of the market.\nOnce you know your market, you then need to develop a marketing plan based\non the 7 “P”s: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, People, Process, and Physical\nEvidence. Consider the environmental dimension of these 7 “P”s when developing\nthe plan (for example, for “Price”, whether you can charge a premium price).\nStaff You will need to decide what your business’ staffing needs are based on what tasks\nneed to be performed. When assessing what staff you need, consider whether any\nadditional technical skills are needed for your green product/service.\nOrganization and\nmanagement\nLike any entrepreneur, you will need to decide on the form of business. A green\nbusiness can take one of many forms, including a sole proprietorship, a partner-\nship, or a cooperative, for example. You should weigh the pros and cons of each\nbefore choosing the best form.\nYou will also need to consider all required taxes and permits and select an appro-\npriate insurance policy; make sure to include environmental taxes and environ-\nmental permits when doing so.\nBuying for your\nbusiness\nYour business will need to buy before you make or sell your products/services.\nWhen buying for your business, consider how environmentally friendly the materi-\nals or equipment you buy are.\nGreening your\nprocesses\nGreening your processes covers a range of elements, starting from how environ-\nmentally friendly your raw materials are to how you get your product to your final\nconsumers. To ensure the environmental-friendliness of your enterprise, you should\nset up an environmental management system (EMS). This system will help you\ntrack and improve your performance in key areas such as procurement, energy and\nwater consumption, pollution prevention, distribution and waste management.\nCosting To be able to set your price and make a financial plan, you will need to calculate\nthe cost of your products. Keep in mind that you may incur some additional costs\nat the outset for green investments relating to equipment, premises or skills, but\nalso that you will most likely make savings thanks to green practices such a re-\nduced consumption of electricity or water, resulting in reduced utility bills.\nFinancial planning You need to be able to plan and monitor the financial situation of your business\nusing tools such as the profit plan and a cash flow plan. Like any other business,\nyour green business needs to perform financially, otherwise you will not be able to\nkeep it going!\nRequired start-up\ncapital\nWhen estimating the required start-up capital, you will need to assess your needs\nin terms of capital investment and working capital. Consider the elements required\nfor your business to be green while estimating this cost, and be realistic when\ndoing so.\nSources of start-up\ncapital\nThe most important types of start-up capital are owner’s equity and loans. Keep in\nmind that there are also a number of institutions with special funding opportuni-\nties for green businesses.\n16 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n3.1.1 Your business idea\nAll business plans are based on an idea. In\nthe previous chapter, you will have discovered\nways of identifying and selecting a suitable\nbusiness idea. In describing your business\nidea, you need to highlight what makes it\ngreen. The description should explain which\nenvironmental challenge your business idea\nis addressing and/or how the process makes it\nenvironmentally friendly.\n3.1.2 Marketing plan\nYour marketing plan needs to be based on a\nsolid understanding of the market. By doing\nmarket research you will be able to identify the\nneeds of potential customers and find out how\nyour future competitors have been satisfying\nthose needs. While carrying out the research,\nbe sure to assess:\n•\nWhether your future customers want to buy a\nproduct/service with green added value; and\n•\nWhether they are willing to pay a premium\nprice for this.\nYou will then need to develop your marketing\nplan based on the 7 “P”s of the marketing\nmix. As explained in the SYB manual, the 7\n“P”s are:\n•\nProduct - the goods or services you are going\nto offer to satisfy the customers’ needs.\n•\nPrice - how much you are going to charge\nyour customers for your goods or services.\n•\nPlace - how and where you are going to reach\nyour customers.\n•\nPromotion - how you will inform customers\nabout your goods or services and attract\nthem to make a purchase.\n•\nPeople - who will develop the unique charac-\nteristics of your business that differentiates\nyour business from others.\n•\nProcess - the various mechanisms and proce-\ndures to get the product to your customers.\n•\nPhysical evidence - the overall appearance\nof your good, service or company.\nWhen developing your plan, consider the envi-\nronmental dimension of each of these 7 “P”s.\nSome examples are provided below. Depending\non your specific business, more may emerge.\nEXAMPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nIN THE MARKETING MIX:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n“Product”: By offering a green product that\naddresses an environmental challenge or\ndoes not harm the environment thanks its\nrecyclability/reusability, its green produc-\ntion process and its green packaging, for\nexample, you will be able to attract cus-\ntomers who place importance on environ-\nmental, social and health issues. This will\ndifferentiate you from others and will give\nyou a competitive advantage. You may also\nwish to consider having your product cer-\ntified by a reputable organization to show\nthat it meets the green standards that have\nbeen set.\n“Price”: Green products and services or\ngreen production processes might help\nthe business to reduce costs. As you may\ncharge the same price as your competitors\nwhile producing at a lower cost, this can\nenable you to have a larger profit margin.\nSometimes, green products or services\nmight be more expensive, if suppose the\ncost of the green technology used is high-\ner. But you can still attract customers by\nexplaining the benefits of the products or\nservices so that they see the value added\nand are convinced to pay a higher price.\n“Place”: When deciding on the location of\nyour business, try to minimize distances\nto raw materials as well as to the market.\nNot only will this help the environment,\nbut it will also help the business to reduce\nthe cost of transport and result in less\ntime-losses due to travel. To appeal to a\nhealth-oriented clientele, such as the cus-\ntomers of a beauty shop, you may wish to\nchoose a naturally beautiful location which\nis clean and has trees.\n“Promotion”: When deciding on how to\npromote the product, consider ways of re-\nducing resource use and the generation of\nwaste/pollution. For example, go paperless\nand make use of electronic media, or, if\nusing print material such as leaflets, opt\nfor recycled paper and non-toxic inks.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 17\nExercise:\nThink of as many as possible green elements\nfor each of the 7 “P”s:\n“P”s OF\nMARKETING GREEN ELEMENTS\nProduct\nPrice\nPlace\nPromotion\nPeople\nProcess\nPhysical\nevidence\n3.1.3 Staff\nYou will need to decide what your business’\nstaffing needs are based on what tasks need\nto be performed and what you can or cannot\ndo yourself.\nWhen assessing what staff you need, consider\nwhether any additional technical skills are needed\nfor your green product/service. Think about the fol-\nlowing questions: Do you need to hire extra staff?\nOr can you train existing staff? If this is needed,\nwhat types of training are available, which institu-\ntions offer such trainings, and at what cost? Or, al-\nternatively, could you rely on short-term expertise\nfrom outside of your business?\n3.1.4 Organization and management\nLike any entrepreneur, you will need to decide\non the form of business. A green business can\ntake any of the legal forms available in your\ncountry, such as a sole proprietorship, a part-\nnership, a cooperative or a limited company, for\nexample. You should familiarize yourself with\neach form and weigh the pros and cons before\nchoosing the most appropriate form.\nYou will also need to consider the taxes that\nyour business has to pay, licenses and permits\nit needs to obtain, and insurance that it needs\nto take out. Keep in mind that:\n•\nOn top of other generic taxes, in some coun-\ntries businesses may need to pay additional\ntaxes that are related to the environment,\nsuch as pollution tax; depending on the\n18 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\ngreen choices you make, you may be able\nto lower the tax amounts you pay or even be\ncompletely exempt.\n•\nEnvironmental permits may be included in\nthe regulations of your country, and in order\nto obtain a permit, you may need to submit\nan environmental impact assessment report\nor other documentation to show how you in-\ntend to assess and address environmental\nissues in your business.\n3.1.5 Buying for your business\nYour business will need to buy before you make\nor sell your products/services. When buying for\nyour business, consider:\n•\nHow environmentally friendly the equipment\nand materials you buy are. Are the products\ncertified through a recognized label?\n•\nIf sourcing natural resources such as wood,\ncharcoal, fish, water etc., whether these\nare sustainably produced or overexploited,\nwhich is a risk not only for the environment\nbut also for your business future.\n•\nWhether the materials and equipment are\navailable locally or as close as possible to\nyour business to avoid long-distance trans-\nport. This will also help the business to re-\nduce the cost of transport. Reduced travel\ntime will mean quicker access to the mate-\nrials needed for production or the provision\nof services.\n3.1.6 Greening your processes\nGreening your processes covers a range of el-\nements, starting from how environmentally\nfriendly your raw materials are to how you get\nyour product to your clients.\nTo ensure the environmental-friendliness of\nyour enterprise, you should set up an envi-\nronmental management system (EMS). This\nsystem will help you track and improve your\nperformance in key areas such as:\n•\nProcurement: using environmentally friendly\nand locally available materials.\n•\nEnergy and water consumption: using energy\nand water from renewable sources and sav-\ning energy and water where possible.\n•\nPollution prevention in production/service\nprovision: using low-emission equipment\nand techniques.\n•\nDistribution: using environmentally friendly\ntransport methods and avoiding long distances.\n•\nWaste management: reducing, reusing and\nrecycling where possible and disposing what\nneeds to be disposed of in a responsible way.\nThe setting up of this system is discussed in\nmore detail in the next chapter; please refer to\nit in order to develop yours!\n3.1.7 Costing\nTo be able to set your price and make a finan-\ncial plan, you will need to calculate the cost of\nyour products.\nWhen costing your green goods and services,\nkeep in mind that:\n•\nSome additional investments may be need-\ned in terms of equipment, premises, skills or\nother areas. This will entail additional costs\nat the outset. Specialized equipment may\nbe needed to make the green product/deliv-\ner the green service, or, instead of standard\nequipment, you may wish to opt for more\nefficient equipment which you may need to\nbuy. You may also make green choices for\nyour premises (such as the installation of\nLED lights) or for your sources of energy (for\nexample, solar energy) which will have a cost\nimplication.\n•\nBut, you can also make savings through these\ninvestments in terms of operation cost. For\nexample, the use of solar panels will cut your\nbill in terms of regular electricity.\n•\nOther green choices that you may make,\nsuch as buying second-hand equipment or\nfurniture for your business may also help you\nto lower the cost of your product.\nWhen costing, consider also the cost of an\nenvironmental impact assessment, an envi-\nronmental certification if you opt for one, and\nother similar costs. These will give you an add-\ned marketing advantage later, but their cost\nneeds to be included when doing your initial\ncosting.\n3.1.8 Financial planning\nYou need to be able to plan and monitor the\nfinancial situation of your business. You can\ndo so by making a profit plan and a cash flow\nplan and checking the actual performance of\nthe business against these plans.\nLike any other business, your green business\nneeds to perform financially, otherwise you will\nnot be able to keep it going, no matter how\nnoble its objective. Therefore, make sure to be\nthorough in your financial planning.\n•\n•\n•\n•\n3.1.9 Required start-up capital\nWhen estimating the required start-up capital,\nyou will need to assess your needs in terms of:\nCapital investment: business premises,\nequipment, and furniture.\nWorking capital: the stock of raw materials\nand finished products, marketing costs, sal-\naries, rent, insurance and other costs.\nConsider the elements required for your busi-\nness to be green while estimating this cost. In\nparticular, keep in mind that:\n•\nSome green investments will entail addition-\nal costs at the outset, as mentioned in the\nsection on costing, above.\nHowever, these green investments will usu-\nally pay off in the long term thanks to lower\noperating costs.\nFurthermore, other green choices that you\nmay make, such as buying second-hand fur-\nniture for your business, may also help you\nto lower the start-up capital that is required.\nIn terms of other costs, consider also wheth-\ner you have to budget for an environmental\nimpact assessment, an environmental certifi-\ncation if you opt for one, and other costs that\nmay arise such as contracting an energy ex-\npert. As mentioned in the section on costing\nabove, these will be beneficial for your busi-\nness, but their cost needs to be kept in mind\nwhile budgeting.\nIn estimating the required start-up capital,\nbe realistic in assessing the capital needed to\nsustain your green business up to a time when\nyou make enough money to cover your expens-\nes and make a profit.\nExercise:\nThink about the additional costs and savings\nresulting from greening your processes.

Chap-\nter 2 on green business ideas will provide use-\nful tips for doing so.\nBut even when continuing to offer convention-\nal products or services, existing enterprises\ncan also go green by making their processes\nenvironmentally friendly.\nThis chapter is related to this second strategy.\nIt explains what is meant by the greening of\nprocesses, and provides practical guidance on\nhow to do so.\nThough this chapter is intended for existing\nentrepreneurs, it will also be relevant for those\nwho are in the process of starting a business,\nas the environmental management system cov-\nered in it complements the business plan for\nstarting entrepreneurs from the Chapter 3. In\na similar way, existing entrepreneurs should\nalso refer to Chapter 3 as revisiting certain el-\nements of their already established business\nplan from an environmental angle will be use-\nful when going green.\n4.1 What is greening and\nhow can you green your\nprocesses?\nGood waste management practices help businesses to reduce costs, and\nsometimes even enables them to make extra money as recyclables are\nsought-after material.\nYou will recall from Chapter 1 that a business\ncan be a green business in two different ways:\n•\n•\nBy offering products or services that are en-\nvironmentally friendly.\nThrough environmentally friendly business/\nproduction processes, even when offering\nconventional products or services.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 21\nGreening your processes refers to the transfor-\nmation of the business/production processes\nof your enterprise in order for it to become a\ngreen business.\nEvery enterprise can green its operations and\nprocesses. There are two dimensions to this.\nOn the one hand, it concerns the inputs re-\nquired and on the other hand, it concerns the\nunintended output or waste and pollution. So,\ngreening your processes aims both at:\n•\nIncreasing the efficiency of inputs used in\nthe enterprise, i.e. reducing the use of en-\n•\nergy, material and water while increasing or\nmaintaining the same level of product or ser-\nvice delivery;\nReducing the amount of unintended output,\ni.e. reducing waste, pollution and the exces-\nsive destruction of natural resources.\nExercise:\nRead the case study below and think of the in-\nputs and outputs of the business, and whether\nthey could be greener.\nGreening the Cutting Edge Clothes (CEC) company*\nCutting Edge Clothes (CEC) is a T-shirt manufacturer with 30 workers in a small town in Bangladesh.\nThey buy cotton imported from India, dye it with dyes imported from China, and cut and sew it\ninto its final shape.\nThey operate in a building that was previously a school class room and which had the advantage\nof already being connected to the city’s electricity grid and sewage system.\nThe T-shirts are sent to the capital city, 500 km away, in a rented truck in lots of 20-50 T-shirts\nseveral times a month depending on the requirements of their 3 buyers.\nINPUT (RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY,\nIS THE INPUT GREEN?

Here are some further tips\non how to go green:\n•\n•\n•\n•\nPay attention to your raw materials: When\nselecting your raw materials, think sustaina-\nble. This may mean organic, biodegradable,\nrecyclable or renewable. Organic agricultur-\nal products, biodegradable plastic, or wood\nfrom sustainable forestry are examples of\nraw materials that make your business foot-\nprint greener.\nGreen your energy and water consumption:\nYour business is likely to require energy and/\nor water. You can go green by using energy\nfrom renewable sources such as solar energy,\nand by using harvested rainwater, for exam-\nple. You can also reduce your energy con-\nsumption by making use of more energy-ef-\nficient equipment. Energy and water usage\ncan also be minimised by technologies that\nhelp you to use as little as possible, such\nas light switches or taps with sensors. These\nchanges are good for the environment, but\nthey are also good for your business: the less\nyou use, the less you spend!\nMinimise your emissions: Switch to fuels\nthat are as green as possible and use equip-\nment that produces the smallest amount\nof emissions possible. Sometimes a switch\nfrom a diesel generator to an electric ma-\nchine reduces costs while cleaning the local\nair. In case of any remaining emissions, look\ninto appropriate filtration technologies.\nReduce, reuse and recycle waste: Reduce by\nusing as little as possible. Could your product\nbe packaged with less material, for example?\nReuse whatever can be reused. Your raw ma-\nterials may be supplied to you in packaging\nthat you can in turn reuse for packaging your\nown product. For waste that you can’t reuse\nyourself or provide to others for reuse, give\nit in for recycling. In many cities, waste col-\nlectors will pay for your recyclables, so don’t\nmiss the opportunity! Finally, for waste that\ncannot be reused or recycled, dispose of it in\na responsible way.\n•\n•\nTransport responsibly: Minimise distances\nused for transport, reduce weight and vol-\nume through efficient packaging options,\navoid less than full loads, plan efficient\njourneys, and when transporting, choose the\nleast environmentally harmful options avail-\nable. Also think of sharing transport with\nothers when possible.\nThink outside of the box: Use your creativity\nto make a profit while helping the environ-\nment. Eco-entrepreneurs tend to be inno-\nvators. Sometimes, sophisticated technolo-\ngies, scientific expertise or a large amount\nof money are needed to make an innovative\nidea a reality. But sometimes you can also\nuse resources that are already available in\nyour community and transform them to\nmake a profit. You may have heard of inno-\nvative ideas such as eco-coolers made from\ndiscarded plastic bottles, or cups and plates\nmade from coffee grinds, or even of entre-\npreneurs creating services from products:\nbecause a consumer is often interested in\nthe quality of the service (e.g. light) rather\nthan the product itself (e.g. a lantern), entre-\npreneurs have started selling light by charg-\ning solar lanterns during the day and bring-\ning them fully-charged to households in the\nevening. Be creative in your thinking and you\nmay become an eco-innovator too!\nEASY WAYS TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND\nYOUR BUSINESS: THE 3R STRATEGY\nIf you manage your waste using the 3R\nstrategy, you can help the environment:\n•\nReduce: The creation of waste can be min-\nimized by reducing our consumption. We\ncan buy less, and we can buy more durable\nproducts that last longer, meaning less new\nproducts and less waste.\n•\n•\nReuse: We can also reuse things in another\nway to diminish the amount of waste we pro-\nduce. Old objects can be re-used in a differ-\nent way instead of being thrown away.\nRecycle: When reduction or reuse are not\npossible, recycling can be used to produce\nnew raw materials from waste; in this way,\nwaste is not simply disposed of, and in\naddition, raw materials do not need to be\nextracted from the natural environment for\nthe creation of new products.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 23\nThough the above are the most commonly used\nbasic 3 “R”s, even more “R”s can be added\nto the strategy: “Rot” is sometimes added to\nbring in composting as a way of dealing with or-\nganic waste, and “Repair” is a useful means of\nextending the life of many products if broken.\nAll these “R”s have a positive business implica-\ntion. You can save money by reducing the amount\nof inputs you are using, and by reusing whatever\ncan be reused. In some countries, the disposal of\nwaste also results in taxes/fines which a proper\nseparation of waste can avoid. Finally, not only\ncan you save money this way, but by selling your\nwaste to those who are in the business of recy-\ncling or equipment you no longer need to others\nwho are looking for the same type of equipment,\nsometimes you can even make money!\nSAVING THROUGH GREENING\nDid you know you can save money by being\nenvironmentally friendly? Here are a few ex-\namples of how you can help the environment\nand cut costs at the same time:\n•\n•\nReduce usage. Cutting costs and reducing\nbills can be as easy as only using electricity\nand water when you really need it. Installing\ntaps with sensors or automatic light switches\nhelps you do this.\nGo for efficient choices. For example, in\nterms of energy use, by choosing energy-ef-\nficient lighting options such as LED and\nCFL lights instead of the more traditional in-\ncandescent light bulbs, you can reduce the\namount of energy you use by 50 percent or\nmore because of their efficiency. In monetary\nterms, replacing a traditional light bulb with\na CFL of the same brightness will save you\nabout USD 7 per year, or USD 87 over the\nlifetime of the bulb. Think of this when set-\nting up your business premises and choosing\nequipment!\n•\nSwitch sources. For example, start using\nsolar energy instead of regular energy.\nYou’ll need to pay for the installation of\nsolar panels, but once you’ve done this,\nyou’ll have access to a source of energy\nthat is free.\nThink about how much you could save if\nyou would implement some of these meas-\nures in your business!\nSources: http://yourenergysavings.gov.au/ ; http://\nwww.energysavingtrust.org.uk/home-energy-effi-\nciency/lighting\n24 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n4.3 Greening in practice:\nYour environmental\nmanagement system\nIn order to green your business, it is helpful to\ndevelop a simple environmental management\nsystem.\nTo do this, you can follow the steps below:\n•\n•\n•\nAssess your current situation.

These phenomena in-\nclude increased temperature trends (global\nwarming), sea level rises, ice mass losses, and\nextreme weather events.\nDecent work/jobs: Decent work involves op-\nportunities for work that is productive and\nprovides a fair income, security in the work-\nplace and social protection for families, free-\ndom for workers to participate in the decisions\nthat affect them, and equality for women and\nmen. Green businesses should provide decent,\ngreen jobs.\nEnvironmental protection: Environmental pro-\ntection is a practice of protecting the natural\nenvironment on individual, organisational or\ngovernmental levels, for the benefit of both the\nenvironment and humans. It aims to conserve\nnatural resources, preserve the current state of\nthe environment and to reverse its degradation\nwhere possible.\nFossil fuels: Fossil fuels are fuels such as coal,\ncrude oil, and natural gas that were formed\nfrom the buried remains of plants and animals\nthat lived millions of years ago. They are con-\nsidered to be harmful to the environment be-\ncause their use creates greenhouse gases such\nas carbon dioxide or methane which cause\nglobal warming.\nGlobal warming: Global warming refers to the\nincrease in temperature across the Earth due\nto the increase in greenhouse gas emissions\nresulting from the burning of fossil fuels.\nGreen business: A green business is a busi-\nness that produces/provides an environmen-\ntally friendly product/service or uses an envi-\nronmentally friendly process, or both. Green\nbusinesses thus help to protect and restore\nthe environment, while generating profit for\nthe owner.\nGreenhouse effect: The greenhouse effect is\na natural process that warms the Earth’s sur-\nface. When energy from the sun reaches the\nEarth’s atmosphere, greenhouse gases such\nas carbon dioxide act like a roof, absorbing\nand re-radiating some of this warmth. This\nis a vital, natural process that allows life on\nEarth to exist. However, because human ac-\ntivities such as the burning of fossil fuels in-\ncrease the concentration of these gases, we\nare now facing a problem of global warming.\nGreenhouse gases: Greenhouse gases are gases\nsuch as carbon dioxide or methane that trap\nheat and make the planet warmer. A large\nshare of these gases are produced through hu-\nman activities such as the burning of fossil fu-\nels for electricity or for transport, for example.\nGreen jobs: Green jobs are decent jobs that\ncontribute to preserving or restoring the en-\nvironment. Green jobs can be found in tradi-\ntional sectors such as manufacturing and con-\nstruction, or in new, emerging green sectors\nsuch as renewable energy and energy efficien-\ncy. Green businesses are essential providers of\ngreen jobs.\nPollution: Pollution is the introduction of un-\nsafe or toxic substances that are harmful for\nliving organisms into the environment (the\nsoil, the air and water). Pollution is caused by\nhuman activities, such as the spilling of oil,\nthe emission of harmful gases from cars or fac-\ntories, or the disposal of industrial waste.\nRenewable resources: Renewable resources are\nresources that can be replenished naturally,\nusually in a short period of time. For example,\nsolar energy is a renewable energy source be-\ncause it replenishes naturally in a short period\nof time, while crude oil, natural gas, coal and\nuranium (nuclear energy) are non-renewable\nsources of energy as they do not form or re-\nplenish naturally in a short period of time.\n3 R: This is a strategy for dealing with waste,\ninvolving reducing consumption before waste\nis generated in the first place; reusing rather\nthan throwing away items for which new uses\ncan be found; and recycling waste by extract-\ning materials from it and transforming them\ninto new products.\nSources:\nhttp://www.ilo.org/global/topics/green-jobs/lang--en/index.htm\nhttp://www.ilo.org/global/topics/decent-work/lang--en/index.htm\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming/\nhttps://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\nhttp://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science/\ngreenhouse-effect\nhttps://www.epa.gov/recycle\nhttps://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=nonrenewable_home\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 29\nANNEX 2\nExamples of Innovative Green Business Ideas1\nThe Solar Radio\n•\nSimply converting to a solar powered bag can\nhelp save money when we need to charge\ncell phones or other electronics.\nThis is a very creative innovation for people liv-\ning in areas that have little or no electricity but\nlots of sunlight.

Certifications or\neco-labels are issued by governmental agen-\ncies, industry associations, non-governmental\norganizations and commercial environmental\nauditors, among others.\nCertification has several advantages. It helps\nyou to do a more thorough job of greening,\nmeaning more efficiency and greater cost\nsavings for your business. It also provides a\ncompetitive marketing advantage through in-\ncreased recognition by media and trust by con-\nsumers, which can result in increased sales\nand overall improved business performance.\nFor example, the ISO 14000 certification\nstandard involves a voluntary environmental\nmanagement system which can help to im-\nprove business performance while providing an\nobjective basis for verifying a business’ claims\nabout its environmental performance.\nHowever, given the number of certifications\navailable, choosing the most appropriate one\nmay be confusing. Moreover, keep in mind\nthat obtaining and maintaining certification\nstatus may have implications in terms of\nmoney and time.\nCheck what certifications are available in your\ncountry and what is required in order to obtain\nthem. If one of them is a realistic option for\nyou and one that would help your business,\nyou may benefit from giving it a go!\nBelow are a few examples of international en-\nvironmental certifications and standards:\nCertified Emission Reductions (CER) and\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) Gold\nStandard\nDemeter\nFair Trade\nForest Stewardship Council (FSC)\nGlobal Organic Textile Standard\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI)\nGreen Globe Certification\nInternational Federation of Organic Agriculture\nMovements (IFOAM)\nInternational Standards Organisation (ISO)\nOeko-Tex\nRainforest Alliance\nSoil Association\nSustainable Travel International\nUTZ\n2 Adapted from Green Africa Directory website: http://www.greenafricadirectory.org/resources/green-certifications/\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 31\nFigure: Examples of eco-lables3\n3 Selected eco-labels reproduced from ILO (Oliver Ortis and Janti Gunawan), Start Your Green Business - Phase I: Start Up, ILO-IJEP project, Jakarta, 2013.\n32 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nANNEX 4\nGreen Business and Decent Jobs\nJobs are green when they help reduce nega-\ntive environmental impact, ultimately leading\nto environmentally, economically and socially\nsustainable businesses and economies, and\nwhen they are decent.\nDecent work is defined by the ILO as work that,\namong others:\n•\nIs productive and delivers a fair income,\n•\nProvides security in the workplace and social\nprotection for families,\n•\nBrings with it better prospects for personal\ndevelopment and social integration,\n•\nGives people the freedom to express their\nconcerns, organize and participate in the de-\ncisions that affect their lives, and\n•\nEnsures equality of opportunity and treat-\nment for all women and men.\nGreen businesses create work that is decent,\ncontributes to poverty reduction and leads to\nsocial inclusion.\nFor example, if we look at the energy sector,\nvarious reports show that renewable energy\nbusinesses provide more green jobs than fossil\nfuel energy businesses.\nBy participating in the green economy, your\nbusiness contributes towards reducing unem-\nployment by creating green jobs and decent\nwork.\nBut, going green can also help your business,\ngiven that it can provide a marketing advan-\ntage, and results in cost savings and increased\nefficiency and productivity. In many cases it\nalso enables you to access new types of sup-\nport for green businesses.\nSo, greening your business is a win-win situation!\nPLANET\nEnvironment\nQuality\nGREEN\nBUSINESS\nPEOPLE\nSocial\nEquality\nPROFITS\nEconomic\nEfficiency\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 33]]]\nThen we should return An overview summary of our work so far\nOur strategy for integrating green and climate-resilient practices\nThe modules and how they’re clustered and how they relate and address the recommendations the client sent originally, which you can find here [[[Five One Labs Curriculum Outline\nJan 2025\nSome observations on potential incorporate of green elements (environment, climate\nchange)\nIn the below commenting, references are made to the ILO/SIYB ‘Green Business\nBooklet’ which includes tools and guidance for integrating green elements into\nbusiness development.\nFor additional, in-depth guidance, please also refer to the ‘Green Business Guide’,\nalso from the ILO, found here:\nOther links that can be useful:\nThe basics of sustainable customer journey mapping: A guide\n3 Green Initiatives In Iraq Tackling Climate Change – Iraqi Innovators\nComments on “greening” entry points\nPart I.
