      "content": "**Summary**:\n\nThe conversation revolves around wellbeing and its various dimensions, mainly initiated by Dara from Bloom. There is an ongoing discussion and engagement about wellbeing, its elements, and importance in professional settings. Participants also discussed feedback, its frequency, and its importance in organizational growth. Several individuals shared percentages related to specific unknown contexts, perhaps indicative of time or resources dedicated to wellbeing initiatives or programs. Another repeated theme was an exploration of different areas of wellbeing, including positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, accomplishment, physical health, mindset, environment, and economic security. \n\n**Action Items**:\n\n1. **Clustering participants based on their needs**:\n   - **Feedback Enthusiasts**: Bilal Ghalib, Karl Steyaert, Rida Abdallah, nada ghandour, Sanaa HAJJ (CEF).\n   - **Well-being Priority – Positive Emotions**: Nathalie Khoury Breidy- MDF, Dara - Bloom, Bilal Ghalib.\n   - **Well-being Priority – Physical Health**: Rida Abdallah, Dara - Bloom.\n   - **Well-being Priority – Engagement**: Bilal Ghalib.\n   - **Well-being Priority – Relationships**: Rida Abdallah.\n   - **Well-being Priority – Meaning**: Rida Abdallah.\n\n2. Explore the link provided by Dara - Bloom ([https://www.recipesforwellbeing.org/](https://www.recipesforwellbeing.org/)) and possibly consider it for resources or collaborations.\n3. Review the Google Presentation link shared by Bilal Ghalib for further context or action items.\n4. For individuals interested in the discussion on feedback, consider scheduling a dedicated workshop or session. Bilal Ghalib suggested Annie could offer a \"Feedback\" workshop.\n5. For those discussing percentages related to programs and offices, clarify the context and decide on future strategies or adjustments based on the data shared.\n6. Regularly reflect on wellbeing priorities and possibly implement strategies or programs based on the identified priorities of participants.\n\n*Note*: Without further context, especially regarding the percentages shared by participants, some recommendations are based on general observations from the provided text.",

Here's a video walkthrough of the community for those who prefer video :)\n\nIf you couldn't attend the session or would like a recap, the session recording and slides are available here: Watch the Session.\n\nNext steps are to identify your priority area and growth practice. If you need help you can always message me. I'm attaching an image of people's priority areas so far to the community session page. I will be matching people in pairs and triplets next week :)\n\nNext week we will also be having our optional call/working session to align on our Ecosystem Wellbeing for Impact data and the end of program conference. You can see the proposed questions here, feel free to add comments in the community here.\n\nFeedback is an integral part of our continuous improvement. If you have not yet provided your input for Session One, please take a moment to complete our feedback form: Submit Your Feedback\n\nWe appreciate your commitment to the EON ToT initiative and look forward to our continued collaboration.\n\nBest regards, \n",
