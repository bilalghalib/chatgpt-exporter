      "content": "To create assessment questions and identify evidence for the competency \"Mobilising Others,\" we need to align each level of depth with the threads in the competency: Inspire and Get Inspired, Persuade, and Communicate Effectively. Each level of depth should progressively demonstrate higher levels of mastery in these threads.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Competency Threads**: First, I'll analyze each thread in the \"Mobilising Others\" competency to understand the nuances at different levels - Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.\n2. **Aligning Threads with Depth Levels**: Next, I'll map each depth level to the competency progression, ensuring that the evidence required at each level reflects the increasing complexity and sophistication in the competency.\n3. **Creating Unique Evidence Types**: For each depth level, I'll define specific, unique types of evidence that reflect the competency's threads, ensuring no overlap between levels.\n4. **Designing Diverse Attempts**: I'll create three distinct sets of assessment questions, each with a unique theme, to offer diverse approaches in assessing the competency.\n\n### Attempt Themes:\n\n1. **Practical Application Theme**: Questions and evidence focus on real-world applications, such as leading projects or initiatives.\n2. **Educational and Theoretical Theme**: Emphasizes theoretical understanding and educational experiences, like courses or workshops.\n3. **Personal Development Theme**: Centers on personal growth, self-reflection, and leadership journey.\n\n---\n\n### Practical Application Theme:\n\n1. **Q Level 1: Inception & Exploration**\n   - **Question**: Describe a situation where you showed enthusiasm for a new challenge. How did you communicate this enthusiasm to others?\n   - **Evidence**: A reflective journal entry or video describing the experience and initial engagement with others.\n\n2. **Q Level 2: Experimentation & Action**\n   - **Question**: Provide an example of a project where you persuaded others using evidence-based arguments. What was the outcome?\n   - **Evidence**: A project proposal or presentation used to persuade stakeholders, along with feedback summaries.\n\n3. **Q Level 3: Skill Enhancement**\n   - **Question**: Discuss a scenario where you communicated imaginative solutions to a team. How did you enhance your persuasive skills in this context?\n   - **Evidence**: Recorded team meetings or communication materials demonstrating advanced persuasive techniques.\n\n4. **Q Level 4: Collaboration & Complexity**\n   - **Question**: Describe your role in a complex team project. How did you inspire and maintain momentum among stakeholders?\n   - **Evidence**: Project summaries, leadership or coordination logs detailing stakeholder engagement and team inspiration.\n\n5. **Q Level 5: Transformation & Innovation**\n   - **Question**: Provide an example of a time when you created a strategic plan that inspired action among a wide range of stakeholders. What was the impact?\n   - **Evidence**: Strategic plans or roadmaps, along with impact assessments or stakeholder testimonials.\n\n---\n\n### Educational and Theoretical Theme:\n\n1. **Q Level 1: Inception & Exploration**\n   - **Question**: Discuss a learning experience that sparked your interest in mobilizing others. How did you share this interest?\n   - **Evidence**: Reflective essay or video on the learning experience and initial discussions with peers or mentors.\n\n2. **Q Level 2: Experimentation & Action**\n   - **Question**: Describe a group project in an educational setting where you had to persuade team members. What methods did you use?\n   - **Evidence**: Presentation or report from the project, along with peer feedback on persuasive effectiveness.\n\n3. **Q Level 3: Skill Enhancement**\n   - **Question**: How have you used educational experiences to improve your communication skills for mobilizing others?\n   - **Evidence**: Certificates from relevant courses or workshops, along with a reflective analysis of skills gained.\n\n4. **Q Level 4: Collaboration & Complexity**\n   - **Question**: Share an example of a complex academic project where you led a team.

They can also write a short story / reflection descirbing a time they had to deal with a difficult decision and they can explain how they thought about it. You might have better ideas, think step by step, and think about any potential resources or research you might need to do and then give me a comprehensive list of evidence and evidence types",

      "content": "Creating a comprehensive list of evidence types for demonstrating various competencies, especially those that are more abstract like ethical behavior, requires a blend of traditional and creative solutions. The idea is to provide avenues through which individuals can showcase their skills, experiences, and thought processes in unique and personal ways. Here's a step-by-step approach to developing this list:\n\n1. **Identify Key Competencies**: Determine a range of competencies that are commonly valued, such as ethical behavior, leadership, teamwork, creativity, problem-solving, and communication.\n\n2. **Understand Each Competency**: Understand what each competency entails and what makes it challenging to demonstrate, especially in an online or remote context.\n\n3. **Brainstorm Evidence Types**: For each competency, brainstorm a variety of evidence types that can effectively demonstrate it. Consider both traditional and non-traditional forms of evidence.\n\n4. **Incorporate Creative Solutions**: For competencies that are more abstract or difficult to quantify, think of creative ways individuals can express their experiences or skills, such as storytelling, artistic expression, or personal reflections.\n\n5. **Ensure Accessibility and Practicality**: Make sure the suggested evidence types are feasible for individuals to produce and share, considering the limitations of online formats.\n\n### Comprehensive List of Evidence Types:\n\n1. **Ethical Behavior**:\n   - Personal journal entries detailing ethical dilemmas and decision-making processes.\n   - Short stories or reflections describing real or hypothetical situations involving ethical decisions.\n   - Recorded role-play scenarios demonstrating ethical reasoning.\n   - Essays or blog posts analyzing ethical issues in current events.\n\n2. **Leadership**:\n   - Video testimonials from team members or colleagues.\n   - Project management documents showing leadership roles and responsibilities.\n   - Reflection essays on leadership experiences and lessons learned.\n   - Recorded presentations or speeches demonstrating leadership qualities.\n\n3. **Teamwork**:\n   - Collaborative project summaries, including team roles and contributions.\n   - Peer reviews or feedback from team members.\n   - Video compilations from team meetings or group discussions.\n   - Case studies detailing teamwork experiences and challenges overcome.\n\n4. **Creativity**:\n   - Portfolios of creative work (art, writing, design, etc.).\n   - Brainstorming session records or mind maps.\n   - Descriptions of innovative solutions to personal or professional challenges.\n   - Time-lapse videos of the creative process.\n\n5. **Problem-Solving**:\n   - Case studies or reports of problems solved in academic, personal, or professional contexts.\n   - \"Before and after\" analyses showing the problem-solving process.\n   - Interactive simulations or games designed to solve specific problems.\n   - Infographics or flowcharts outlining problem-solving methodologies.\n\n6. **Communication**:\n   - Recorded speeches, presentations, or podcasts.\n   - Professional emails or letters demonstrating effective communication.\n   - Blogs or vlogs on topics requiring clear explanation.\n   - Infographics or visual presentations conveying complex information.\n\n7. **Adaptability/Flexibility**:\n   - Personal stories or reflections on adapting to change.\n   - Timelines or journals documenting a period of significant change.\n   - Analyses of how past experiences have shaped adaptability.\n   - Recorded interviews discussing responses to unexpected scenarios.\n\n8. **Technical Skills**:\n   - Screenshots or video tutorials of software or tools used.\n   - GitHub repositories or code snippets for programming skills.\n   - Technical reports or project documentation.\n   - Certificates from online courses or workshops.\n\n9. **Emotional Intelligence**:\n   - Reflective essays on understanding and managing emotions.\n   - Recorded role-plays demonstrating empathy and emotional regulation.\n   - Analyses of personal interactions and emotional responses.\n   - Diaries or logs tracking emotional growth over time.\n\n10. **Critical Thinking**:\n   - Essays critiquing a theory or concept.\n   - Recorded debates or discussions.\n   - Analyses of a complex problem and proposed solutions.\n   - Book reviews or literature critiques demonstrating analytical thinking.\n\n11. **Cultural Competence**:\n   - Travel diaries or blogs detailing experiences in different cultures.\n   - Essays on understanding and adapting to cultural differences.\n   - Recorded interviews or discussions on cultural topics.\n   - Reflections on working in multicultural teams.\n\nBy providing a wide range of evidence types, individuals have the flexibility to choose the methods that best suit their skills and experiences, allowing for a more nuanced and personal demonstration of their competencies.",
