      "content": "Here’s how I’d rewrite your original **Day / Theme / Summary Highlights** table so it actually reflects the new “real client project” strategy you described.  \nI’ve kept the format tight for the slide, but each day’s line now points clearly to:  \n\n- **The ONE THING** they must deliver that day  \n- **How it’s tied to the workbook**  \n- **The proof they collect**  \n\n---\n\n**Updated Slide: 5-Day Sprint Overview**\n\n| Day | Theme | Summary Highlights |\n|-----|-------|--------------------|\n| **1** | **Discovery Sprint** | Meet your real client, interview them via WhatsApp, fill out the CLIENT_PROFILE tab (costs, pains, empathy map), and post their “problem story” on Instagram. Output = Baseline profile with real data. |\n| **2** | **Evidence Collection** | Visit suppliers, get 3 verified quotes (with photos/screenshots), test heritage comfort ideas. Fill SUPPLIER_NETWORK tab. Post “discovery story” showing proof of prices. |\n| **3** | **Numbers That Convince** | Use your client’s budget to calculate Phase 1 vs Phase 2 ROI in BOQ_ROI tab. Post “reality story” showing 10-year savings. Output = ROI table + recommended first steps. |\n| **4** | **Client Choice** | Co-design via WhatsApp: send visual options, explain in voice note, record client’s selection. Fill DESIGN_DECISION tab. Post “choice story” with their voice quote. |\n| **5** | **Pitch Your Real Project** | Present your actual client’s solution to judges with a live WhatsApp testimonial. Show full evidence chain: profile → quotes → ROI → decision. Post “success story” with proven impact. |\n\n---\n\nThis way:  \n\n- The table **matches your revised slides** instead of the old product-first flow.  \n- It reads as a **project journey** rather than a theory course.  \n- It **anchors each day to a workbook tab and a proof artifact** so trainers and trainees know exactly what “done” looks like.  \n\nIf you want, I can also give you a **condensed one-liner per day** for the top of the slide so the whole sprint arc fits into a single visual storyline. That would make it even more pitch-ready for the first intro.",
