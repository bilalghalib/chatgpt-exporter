      "content": "Martin Luther’s own aims were **theological and pastoral**, not economic—and he personally *criticized* many early-capitalist practices. But some aspects of his thought (especially “vocation”) were later woven into stories about the rise of capitalism, most famously by Max Weber.  \n\niturn3image2turn3image0turn3image3turn3image8  \n\nI’ll break it into:\n\n1. Luther’s primary intentions  \n2. What he actually said about money and business  \n3. How (and whether) this fed into capitalism, according to researchers  \n4. Key scholars & references for going deeper  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Luther’s primary intentions\n\nHistorians of the Reformation agree on a few core aims:\n\n- **Reform the Church’s teaching on salvation**  \n  - Luther’s central move was that humans are justified *by faith alone* (sola fide), not by buying indulgences or accumulating “good works” managed by the clergy. This begins with his 1517 attack on indulgence-selling and continues in works like *The Freedom of a Christian* (1520).citeturn3image8  \n\n- **Re-center authority on Scripture**  \n  - He wanted the Bible (not canon law, papal decrees, or scholastic theology) to be the norm for Christian doctrine and life—“Scripture alone” (sola scriptura). This led him to translate the Bible into German; in the process he popularized the word *Beruf* (“calling/vocation”) for ordinary work.citeturn1search10turn1search16  \n\n- **Dignify everyday life and work as service to God**  \n  - Breaking with the medieval idea that monks and nuns were “higher” Christians, Luther argued that **all legitimate stations in life—farmer, parent, magistrate, craftsman—are vocations from God.**citeturn1search8turn1search18  \n  - This doctrine of vocation is where later sociologists see a potential link to capitalism.\n\n- **Restrain economic injustice as a matter of neighbor-love**  \n  - He saw economic life as an arena of sin and exploitation—especially usury, price-gouging, and monopolies—and wanted princes and councils to regulate markets to protect the poor.citeturn1search3turn0search0  \n\nSo his *intention* was not “let’s unleash the market,” but “let’s restore right teaching about God, and curb the economic sins flowing from greed.”\n\n---\n\n## 2. What did Luther actually teach about money, trade, and profit?\n\nLuther wrote several economic tracts, including **“Trade and Usury” (1524)** and **“On Commerce and Usury”**, responding to very concrete questions about lending, fair prices, and speculation. Recent economic-historical work emphasizes:\n\n- **Strong critique of usury and profit-maximization**  \n  - Luther condemned lending at interest as a general practice (though he struggled with borderline cases). Christian Hecker’s article *“From ‘Usury’ to ‘Financial Alchemy’: Martin Luther’s Economic Writings Revisited”* shows how Luther warned against financial speculation, fraud, and power imbalances, insisting on personal responsibility and limits on risk-shifting.citeturn0search0  \n  - He opposed “selling for as much as you can get,” especially in essentials, and rejected buying cheap only to sell dear at the expense of the poor.citeturn1search3turn0search10  \n\n- **Ethic of neighbor-love over market freedom**  \n  - Luther’s touchstone was: *does this practice harm or help my neighbor?* If “market price” starves the poor, Christians must not charge it; rulers should prevent it. Economic freedom is always subordinated to love and justice.citeturn1search3  \n\n- **Suspicion of early capitalist actors**  \n  - In his comments on the **Frankfurt fairs** and international trade, Luther describes big merchant houses as draining money from the empire through luxury imports—Peter R. Rössner notes this has led some to call him “proto-mercantilist,” though he doesn’t fit later theories cleanly.citeturn0search7  \n\n- **Yet: positive valuation of ordinary economic work**  \n  - Within his strict moral frame, he affirmed buying, selling, and wage-earning as legitimate vocations when done justly and in service of others.citeturn1search7turn1search10  \n\nSo: Luther is **not** an enthusiast of capitalist accumulation. He’s a critic of early capitalist abuses, but he gives **moral and religious weight to everyday work and economic roles.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Did any of this *lead* to capitalism?\n\n### The classic thesis: Max Weber\n\n- **Max Weber**, in *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* (1904–05), is the go-to reference.citeturn0search2turn2search11  \n  - Weber notes that Luther’s translation of *Beruf* (“calling”) gives worldly work a religious meaning: faithfully performing your profession is serving God.citeturn1search16turn1search23  \n  - But Weber explicitly says that **Lutheranism itself did *not* produce the “spirit of capitalism”**. For Weber the decisive step comes later, mainly in **Calvinism and ascetic Protestant sects** (Puritans, some Pietists, etc.), whose discipline, anxiety about election, and world-denying asceticism unintentionally channeled surplus income into systematic reinvestment.citeturn0search2turn1search20  \n\nOn Weber’s reading, Luther is more like a **precondition**:\n\n- He destroys the medieval hierarchy of “spiritual” vs “secular” life.\n- He sacralizes everyday work as vocation.\n- That opened a path that later Protestants radicalized into the disciplined, rationalized life Weber thinks is congenial to capitalism.\n\n### Tawney and other historians\n\n- **R. H. Tawney, *Religion and the Rise of Capitalism* (1926)**, gives a broad historical sweep from late medieval Christendom through Luther and Calvin.citeturn0search3turn0search6  \n  - Tawney argues that medieval Catholicism and Luther both maintained a strong suspicion of commerce and interest; it is **Calvin** who relaxes the prohibitions on interest (within limits) and whose followers more comfortably integrate profit-seeking with piety.citeturn0search12  \n\n- **Jacob Viner, *Religious Thought and Economic Society* (1978)** surveys how Christian (including Reformation) theology interacted with economic ideas; Luther appears there as part of a long ambivalent tradition about wealth, contract, and interest.citeturn2search0  \n\n- **David H. Eaton, “The Economists of the Reformation” (2013)**, contrasts Luther, Calvin and the Puritans on work, wealth and interest, noting Luther’s stricter stance and his foundational role in articulating vocation without embracing accumulation.citeturn1search7  \n\n- **Recent Luther scholarship** (e.g., E. Mangeloja, *“Martin Luther’s Business Ethics and the Economic Utopia”* 2023; various essays in the *Journal of Lutheran Ethics*) emphasizes that Luther consistently **prioritized need over profit**, rejected “what the market will bear” pricing, and called for strong regulation.citeturn0search4turn1search3  \n\n### Does the link “Luther → capitalism” really hold?\n\nModern empirical work on Weber’s thesis is mixed to negative:\n\n- Some economic historians (e.g. Kurt Samuelsson, summarized in the *Protestant work ethic* article) argue that economic growth patterns don’t line up neatly with Protestant vs. Catholic regions and that Weber’s causal story is weak.citeturn0search2turn1search20  \n- Others suggest Protestantism mattered more via **literacy and human capital** (because Protestants wanted everyone to read the Bible) than via a special “work ethic.”citeturn0search2  \n\nMost scholars today would say:\n\n- **Luther did not intend capitalism.**  \n  He was trying to restore right worship, free consciences, and restrain economic injustice.\n- **His ideas indirectly contributed to a cultural shift** that capitalism could later inhabit:\n  - Equal dignity of secular work and spiritual life  \n  - Stability and seriousness of lifelong “callings” (professions)  \n  - Weakening of monastic/clerical dominance in favor of lay, often urban, actors  \n\nBut the **decisive theological legitimation of capitalist practices**—charging interest, systematic profit reinvestment, entrepreneurial risk as a positive good—owes more to **later Protestant traditions** than to Luther himself.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Researchers & references to look up\n\nHere’s a focused reading path if you want to trace the debate:\n\n### On Luther’s aims and theology (including vocation)\n\n- **Heiko A. Oberman**, *Luther: Man Between God and the Devil* – classic historical portrait situating Luther between medieval and modern worlds.citeturn1search22turn1search24  \n- **Carter Lindberg**, articles/books on Luther’s social and economic ethics (often cited in the *Journal of Lutheran Ethics*).citeturn1search3  \n- **Douglas W. Loya**, “Luther, Vocation, and the Search for Significance,” *Lutheran Quarterly* 35 (2021).citeturn1search0  \n\n### On Luther’s economic thought specifically\n\n- **Christian Hecker**, “From ‘Usury’ to ‘Financial Alchemy’: Martin Luther’s Economic Writings Revisited,” 2017.citeturn0search0  \n- **Peter R. Rössner**, *Martin Luther and the Making of the Modern Economic Mind* (working paper/book-length study).citeturn0search7  \n- **Esa Mangeloja**, “Martin Luther’s Business Ethics and the Economic Utopia,” *Journal of Economics, Theology and Religion* (2023).citeturn0search4  \n- **“Luther’s Economic Ethic of Neighbor-Love and Its Implications for Economic Life Today,”* Journal of Lutheran Ethics* – accessible synthesis of Luther’s economic norms.citeturn1search3  \n\n### On Protestantism & the rise of capitalism\n\n- **Max Weber**, *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism* – foundational but heavily debated.citeturn0search2turn2search11  \n- **R. H.

      "content": "Short version:  \n\n- There are strong alternative histories of capitalism that *don’t* start from Luther or “work ethic,” but from land, empire, class struggle, and the re-framing of people and earth as *resources*.  \n- Neoliberalism is a late-20th-century *tightening* of those moves: it turns every person into “human capital,” every relation into a market, and every landscape into “natural capital,” backed by a whole set of cognitive frames with a long genealogy.\n\nI’ll sketch both the **alternative stories of capital** and the **cognitive frames of neoliberalism**, and name key researchers for each.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Alternative stories of how capitalism emerged\n\nInstead of “Luther → ethic → capitalism,” many historians say:\n\n> Capitalism = a historically specific way of organizing land, labor, and nature around *compulsory* competition for profit — not just “people liking money.”\n\nA few major threads:\n\n### a) Agrarian class relations (the Brenner / Wood line)\n\n- **Robert Brenner** argues that capitalism began in **English rural class relations**, where landlords and tenant-farmers were locked into competitive lease markets and had to constantly increase productivity or lose their land.citeturn2search0turn2search4  \n- **Ellen Meiksins Wood** expands this in *The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View*: capitalism isn’t “markets finally freed,” but a *new regime* where producers are forced to depend on the market for survival. That compulsion arose from specific property and political arrangements in England, not an abstract “Western spirit.”citeturn2search1turn2search9turn2search16  \n\n👉 Frame: capitalism emerges when **access to livelihood is mediated by competitive markets**, not when people simply become more “work-ethic-y.”\n\n### b) World-systems and empire (Wallerstein / Arrighi)\n\n- **Immanuel Wallerstein**’s *Modern World-System* series: capitalism is a **world-economy** that emerges in the “long 16th century,” with a *core* of states (like England, the Netherlands) extracting surplus from *peripheries* through unequal trade, coerced labor and colonialism.citeturn2search6turn2search24  \n- **Giovanni Arrighi**, *The Long Twentieth Century*, tracks successive “systemic cycles of accumulation” (Genoa, Dutch, British, US) where finance capital and state power co-evolve over ~700 years.citeturn2search3turn2search7turn2search19  \n\n👉 Frame: capitalism as a **planetary system** of core–periphery relations and financial power, not just national religious reform.\n\n### c) Markets as political projects (Polanyi, Marx, Federici, etc.)\n\n- **Karl Polanyi**, *The Great Transformation*, shows that 19th-century “free markets” were not natural but a **political project** to turn **land, labor, and money** into “fictitious commodities” – things treated as commodities even though they weren’t produced for sale.citeturn0search1turn0search11turn0search6  \n- This matches what you’re calling “natural resources” (land) and “human resources” (labor): Polanyi’s point is that this treatment is *historical*, not inevitable or neutral.\n- Marx’s ideas of **primitive accumulation** and **commodity fetishism** similarly foreground enclosure, colonial theft, and the way social relations appear as relations between things (wages, prices, interest).citeturn0search6  \n- Eco-feminist historian **Carolyn Merchant**, in *The Death of Nature*, traces how the Scientific Revolution replaced an image of Earth as a living organism with a **mechanistic** worldview. That shift legitimated treating nature as a machine to be mastered and exploited.citeturn4search14turn4search1  \n\n👉 Frame: “resources” (people, land, money) are *made* into commodities through law, violence, and new cosmologies.\n\n### d) World-ecology (Jason W. Moore and others)\n\n- **Jason W. Moore** (world-ecology perspective) argues that capitalism is a way of organizing **“cheap nature”** – cheap labor, food, energy, and raw materials – by pushing costs onto humans and environments treated as external.citeturn4search7turn4search21turn4search25  \n\n👉 Frame: capitalism = a **world-ecology**, not simply an economic system sitting on top of “nature.”\n\nThese all give you an alternative to “Protestant ethic → capitalism”: they’re about **land regimes, empire, scientific cosmology, and commodification**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. From “creation” to “resources”: how people + nature become neutral inputs\n\nYou framed it beautifully as:\n\n- **“Natural resources vs. divine expression of God’s majesty”**  \n- **“Human resources vs. other beautiful human beings”**\n\nHistorically, those shifts line up with:\n\n### a) Mastery of nature (Bacon, Descartes)\n\n- **Francis Bacon** explicitly talks about expanding the *“power and dominion of the human race over the universe”* and “imposing new natures on bodies” in *Novum Organum* – science as a tool to command nature.citeturn1search2turn1search17turn1search28  \n- **René Descartes**, in *Discourse on Method*, famously proposes that knowledge should make us “*masters and possessors of nature*.”citeturn1search29turn1search21turn1search33  \n\nThese are explicit rejections of older “creation is enchanted” cosmologies. Nature becomes *object of method*, not a choir praising God.\n\nMerchant’s *The Death of Nature* reads this as the symbolic “death” of a living earth, clearing the way for **resource extraction** and for the feminisation–domestication of both women and nature.citeturn4search14turn4search12turn4search23  \n\n### b) Disenchantment and objectification (Weber & Taylor)\n\n- **Max Weber**’s “disenchantment of the world” (Entzauberung) describes how rationalization strips the world of sacred meaning; capitalism in particular reduces workers to impersonal entries in accounting books.citeturn4search22turn4search0turn4search15  \n- **Charles Taylor**, in *A Secular Age*, describes the transition from a “porous self” (embedded in a cosmos full of spirits and God’s presence) to a “buffered self” living in an immanent, disenchanted order.citeturn4search10turn4search24turn4search20  \n\nIn your terms: the move from **“divine expression”** to **“resource”** is part of this long disenchantment arc.\n\n### c) The literal vocabulary of “resources” and “HR”\n\n- The English word *resource* originally referred more to inner reserves or means of support; only later did “natural resources” become standard for components of nature defined by their usefulness.citeturn1search26turn1search10turn1search18  \n- **“Human resource”** as a term is credited to labor economist **John R. Commons** (1893). Later, “human resource management” develops in the 20th century alongside **Taylorist** “scientific management,” which treats workers as optimizable factors of production.citeturn1search16turn1search23turn1search5  \n\nThis is exactly the cognitive move you’re pointing at: **from “persons” to “factors,” from “earth” to “input stock.”**\n\nPolanyi’s “fictitious commodities” (land + labor + money) is the cleanest conceptual bridge between:\n\n- theological / moral language (creation, neighbor) and  \n- economic language (resource, factor, asset).citeturn0search6turn0search23  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Historical threads of *neoliberal* economic thinking\n\nNeoliberalism is not just “free markets” but a **renewed, radical project** from the mid-20th century onward.\n\n### a) Core intellectual currents\n\n1. **Ordoliberalism (Freiburg School, Germany)**  \n   - Thinkers like **Walter Eucken** and colleagues argued for a “competitive order” where the state sets strong rules to ensure competition, prevent monopolies, and restrain both private and state power. This shaped the German “social market economy.”citeturn3search1turn3search5turn3search9  \n\n2. **Austrian / Chicago liberals**  \n   - **Friedrich Hayek**, **Ludwig von Mises** and later **Milton Friedman**, **Gary Becker**: markets as superior information processors; prices as signals; planning as knowledge-impossible and liberty-destroying.  \n   - **Mont Pelerin Society** (founded 1947) becomes a transnational hub for these ideas, explicitly defending competitive markets and private property and building the think-tank ecosystem that later shapes policy.citeturn3search0turn3search4turn3search8  \n\n3. **Neoliberalism as governmentality (Foucault)**  \n   - In *The Birth of Biopolitics* lectures, **Michel Foucault** reads German ordoliberalism and US neoliberalism as new forms of **governmentality**: the state governs less by law and more by *shaping the game* so that people govern themselves as market actors (“entrepreneurs of themselves”).citeturn0search3turn0search8turn0search16turn0search20  \n\n### b) From theory to global policy\n\n- **David Harvey**, *A Brief History of Neoliberalism*, defines neoliberalism as a doctrine that human well-being is best advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms, within an institutional framework of strong property rights, free markets and free trade.citeturn3search10turn3search2turn3search6turn0search10  \n- Harvey argues that, post-1970s crises (oil shocks, stagflation), neoliberalism was adopted (Pinochet’s Chile, Thatcher, Reagan) as a **class project** to restore elite power via privatization, deregulation, and attacks on labor.citeturn3search6turn3search14turn3news45  \n- Internationally, these ideas are carried through the **IMF, World Bank, and WTO** via structural adjustment and the “Washington Consensus,” pushing privatization and austerity worldwide.citeturn3news45  \n- **Quinn Slobodian**, *Globalists*, shows neoliberals building **supranational legal structures** (trade regimes, investor protections) to “encase” markets against democratic interference; more recently he traces “crack-up capitalism,” with archipelagos of zones insulated from public accountability.citeturn0search2turn0search7turn0news54  \n\n### c) Neoliberalism as form of subjectivity\n\n- **Pierre Dardot & Christian Laval**, *The New Way of the World*, argue neoliberalism is a **normative rationality** that generalizes competition as behavioral norm; individuals must become self-optimizing entrepreneurs.citeturn0search9turn0search17turn0search26turn0news55  \n- **Wendy Brown**, *Undoing the Demos*, shows how neoliberal reason recasts citizens as **bundles of human capital**, reconfiguring universities, law, and politics themselves around market metrics, eroding democratic imaginaries.citeturn3search7turn3search11turn3search15  \n\nAll of these help you see neoliberalism as a specific late-stage tightening of the longer moves we talked about: turning all of life into **capital flows and competitive performance.**\n\n---\n\n## 4. The cognitive frames that neoliberalism needs\n\nYou asked for “the cognitive frames they require.” Put very bluntly, neoliberalism *needs* people to see the world through frames like:\n\n1. **Humans as human capital / resources**  \n   - People are primarily **investment projects**: “upskilling,” “personal brand,” “maximize your return.” Brown’s work is almost a taxonomy of this shift.citeturn3search11turn3search15  \n\n2. **Nature as natural capital / ecosystem services**  \n   - Forests, rivers, even climate are recoded as **assets** providing “services” that can be priced and traded. Moore’s “cheap nature” analysis tracks how capital keeps inventing such categories to maintain accumulation.citeturn4search7turn4search21turn4search25  \n\n3. **Society as a set of markets**  \n   - Every institution (school, hospital, family, mosque, NGO) is modeled as a mini-firm facing incentives and competition. Dardot & Laval call this the “generalization of competition as a behavioural norm.”citeturn0search26turn0search9  \n\n4. **Freedom = market choice; responsibility = individual risk-bearing**  \n   - Unemployment, illness, burnout become primarily **individual investment failures**, not structural outcomes. Harvey and Brown both emphasize this moralization of market outcomes.citeturn3search6turn3search15  \n\n5. **Everything is comparable via one metric (money / growth)**  \n   - Growth rates, GDP, ROI become the master measure; other values (dignity, beauty, worship, baraka) can appear only as “externalities” or niche “preferences.”\n\nCognitively, a lot of this lives in **metaphors**, which cognitive linguists like Lakoff and Johnson show are not just language but *thought-structures*: “Time is money,” “Life is a journey/investment,” “Society is a market.”citeturn1search27turn4search27  \n\nCombine those metaphors with:\n\n- **Disenchantment** (Weber / Taylor)citeturn4search22turn4search10turn4search24  \n- **Fictitious commodities** (Polanyi)citeturn0search6turn0search23  \n\n…and you basically get the mental world where:\n\n> “The earth is an asset to optimise, and I am a little firm managing my human capital.”\n\nWhich is almost the exact opposite of your framing:\n\n> “The earth is a divine expression to be in relationship with, and I am a worshipping being among other beings.”\n\n---\n\n## 5.
