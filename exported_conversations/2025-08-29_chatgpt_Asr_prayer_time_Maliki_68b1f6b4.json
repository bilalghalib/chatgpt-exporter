      "content": "In the **Mālikī madhhab**, the time for **ʿAṣr prayer** is divided into two categories:  \n\n1. **Waqt al-ikhtiyār (the preferred/optional time):**  \n   - Begins when an object’s shadow is equal to its length **plus** the shadow it already had at noon (zawāl).  \n   - Ends when the sun becomes **yellowish and weak** (i.e., shortly before sunset).\n\n2. **Waqt al-ḍarūra (the emergency time):**  \n   - Extends from when the sun yellows until actual sunset.  \n   - Praying in this time is valid but considered disliked unless one had a genuine excuse (e.g., illness, forgetfulness, unavoidable circumstances).  \n\nSo, in Mālikī fiqh:  \n- **Asr is “on time” (ikhtiyār)** until the sun starts turning yellow.  \n- **After that until maghrib**, it is still valid (ḍarūra), but blameworthy if delayed without excuse.  \n\nWould you like me to give you the approximate modern clock-time ranges for **Asr in the Maliki school** (based on where you are in France), so you can know the cut-off today?",

      "content": "Yes — in the **Mālikī madhhab**, ʿAṣr can be prayed **all the way until Maghrib**, but with that distinction:\n\n- **Preferred time (ikhtiyār):** from when the shadow equals the object until the sun starts to yellow.  \n- **Emergency time (ḍarūra):** from yellowing of the sun until sunset (Maghrib). Prayer is still valid here, but disliked unless you had a real excuse.  \n\nIn practical terms:  \n\n- The “yellowing of the sun” is usually reckoned as **about 20–30 minutes before Maghrib** (some Maliki jurists stretch it to 45 minutes depending on latitude/visibility).  \n- After that point, you’re still allowed to pray ʿAṣr until the **adhan of Maghrib** — but you should avoid delaying into this time unless necessary.  \n\n👉 So to answer directly:  \n- **Yes, till Maghrib.**  \n- **But ideally finish at least 20–30 minutes before sunset**, to stay within the “preferred time.”  \n\nWould you like me to check today’s **Asr–Maghrib times for Lille** so you can see the exact cut-off window?",
