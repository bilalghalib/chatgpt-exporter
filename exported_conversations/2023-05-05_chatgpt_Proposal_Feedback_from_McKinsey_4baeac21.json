      "content": "I want to pitch something to get corporate clients and I'm wondering what you think of this proposal, imagine you're a McKinsey consultant giving us feedback on our pitch :) \nProposal for Bloom Pilot Program Partnership with Wise Systems\nMay 2023\nIntroduction\nAt Bloom PM, we understand the importance of a healthy hybrid work culture. We are excited to present a pilot program to support and improve your employees' personal and professional growth, leveraging our extensive experience as a social enterprise accelerator.\nSince 2015 we have been developing our values-based personal and professional growth methodology for entrepreneurship education, fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. Through our programs, we've impacted thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, many of which have launched, grown, and mobilized millions in funding.\nWe believe in the power of remote/hybrid organizations to transform how we do business. Remote work, when leveraged correctly, allows companies to save money, boost employee productivity, and improve retention. Using our tried and tested models and concepts in The Bloom Method, we help individuals and organizations outline a working model for productivity and engagement. We identify and implement coaching solutions to propel learning, organizational effectiveness, and personal and professional development.\nWhat We Can Do For Wise Systems\nIn 2023, offices worldwide struggle to balance rising employee demand for more remote flexibility, less meeting time, and work-life balance with a need to keep employees engaged, productive, and motivated. \nAt Bloom, we transitioned in 2018 to operating our organization and delivering customer services in fully remote or hybrid environments. Using cutting-edge tools, positive reinforcement strategies, and strengths-based development, we have grown our company to 4 continents and 12 hours of time difference while remaining on the leading edge of business acceleration programs in the MENA region. \nWith this program, you can expect the following:\nIncreased Employee Engagement: The tailored activities and personalized growth plans will help ignite each employee's passion and motivation to contribute meaningfully to the organization.\nHealthier Remote Work Culture: Our program focuses on creating a supportive remote work environment, addressing remote employees' challenges, and promoting a sense of belonging and connectedness with the team.\nEnhanced Organizational Performance: With improved engagement levels, your employees will be better equipped to collaborate, innovate, and drive growth, leading to positive impacts on Wise Systems' performance.\nAssessing Impact \nTo evaluate the impact of our pilot program on remote work engagement and effectiveness, we propose working with Wise Systems to assess the following KPIs to monitor progress and ensure our solution aligns with your organization's goals:\nRemote work capacity: Assessed across the organization.\nEmployee engagement: Assessed by team members\nProductivity: Assessed during the program we will monitor/report team member accomplishments, streaks, and post-program monitoring of selected KPIs.\nProgram Overview\nBloom PM's pilot program aims to catalyze positive change in your remote work culture and improve overall team health, productivity, and performance. Our program will be tailored to suit the unique needs of Wise Systems, and will train one of your team members - such as an HR representative or team lead - on our methodology so that it may become a repeatable process ingrained in your organizational culture. In addition, they will receive weekly coaching to successfully implement our combined personal and professional growth method within your organization.\nThe Bloom Method\nOur methodology  helps people and teams identify their shared purpose and build towards enhanced shared success. We use reflective practices, personal and professional development assessments, and a library of activities designed to help your employees thrive at work holistically. \nWe focus on fostering self-awareness and identification of purpose at work, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid word environments. These tools will allow your trained team member to facilitate and support your employees' ongoing growth and development.\nThree key principles of a successful Bloom program are:\nOur values and strengths power our performance: We help participants identify their sources of meaning at work that unlocks energy and capacity for committed learning and development in their “missions.”\nAction-based learning loops: Participants are guided to design a “mission” every two weeks. A mission is a performance objective they want to achieve each cycle, including reflecting on past learnings and planning next best steps.\nLearning by doing together: Promote collaboration and mutual support, especially online, since usually two heads are better than one.\nSuggested Approaches \nTier 1, The Basics\nEngagement: 3 weeks\nTier 2, The Standard\nEngagement: 5 weeks\nTier 3, Deep Learning\nEngagement: 10 weeks\n• Intro info by email \n\n• Pre-workshop assessments \n\n• 2 hour participatory online workshop reviewing challenges, priorities, goals, and setting action plans … and direct focused adaptive learning during the workshop  \n\n• Two weeks of self-guided implementation \n\n• Follow-on 2 hour participatory online workshop, reviewing progress, and setting next-stage action plans   \nBasics program, plus: \n\n1 additional group session 2 weeks later\n\n~~ plus ~~\n\nA 40-minute 1-on-1 coaching session for up to 5 people on your team. \n\nor\n\nA 2-hour intro train-the-trainer workshop to improve facilitation/online facilitation skills on your team plus help people from your team continue supporting your team using Bloom’s assessments and library.\nPlus observe TOT trainees deliver a workshop or session, and provide them with written feedback post-session.  \n\n\n\nStandard program, plus: \n\n3 month program, 6 group sessions total \n\n~~ plus ~~\n\n2 x 40-minute 1-on-1 coaching sessions for up to 5 people on your team. \n\nor\n\n2 x 2-hour train-the-trainer workshops to improve facilitation/online facilitation skills on your team plus help people from your team continue supporting your team using Bloom’s assessments and library.\nIncludes 2 TOT facilitation observation sessions, facilitator certificates, and guidance in follow-on program design.

      "content": "As a McKinsey consultant, I have a few suggestions and observations on your proposal. Overall, the proposal is well-structured, and the services offered by Bloom PM seem promising for Wise Systems. However, there are areas in which you can improve the proposal to make it more compelling and effective.\n\n1. Executive Summary: Add an executive summary at the beginning of the proposal that briefly outlines the problem you are addressing, the solution you are offering, and the benefits for Wise Systems. This will give busy executives a quick understanding of your proposal.\n\n2. Quantify the Impact: It would be helpful to provide some quantitative data on the impact of your programs on other organizations. This could include increases in employee engagement, productivity, or retention rates. Providing such data will strengthen your proposal and make it more convincing.\n\n3. Testimonials: Including testimonials or case studies from previous clients who have benefitted from your programs can help build credibility and trust with potential clients.\n\n4. Tailoring the Program: You mention that the program will be tailored to suit the unique needs of Wise Systems, but the proposal does not provide much detail on how you will do this. Provide examples of how you have customized your programs for other clients and the positive outcomes that resulted.\n\n5. Pricing: Consider presenting the pricing in a table format for better readability. Also, it might be helpful to break down the costs for each tier, so clients can understand what they are paying for.\n\n6. Clearer Differentiation: Ensure that there is clear differentiation between the tiers to help clients understand the value of each option. This could include more details on the specific services and support provided in each tier.\n\n7. Next Steps: Consider providing a more detailed timeline for the next steps in the process, such as a date for an initial consultation and an expected start date for the program. This will help Wise Systems understand the timeline they can expect for implementation.\n\n8. Formatting and Visuals: Enhance the overall readability of the proposal by using consistent formatting, bullet points, and visuals (such as charts, graphs, or images) to break up large blocks of text and make the content more engaging.\n\nBy addressing these points, your proposal will be more compelling and better demonstrate the value that Bloom PM can bring to Wise Systems. Good luck with your pitch!",
