Earlier entrepreneurs in Leb - still one of the ones remaining here and he’s done really well. What I really appreciate in his journey - ethics. Someone who worked with Samer Karam (issues with ethics) - Maroun navigated that with kindness and empathy and standing with what i sjust in this whole debate. Knowing when to scale back and when to grow. Interesting entrepreneurial journey. Built a house on a plot of land for his family and a huge garden with all the vegetables you can imagine, totally off grid and I think this is a wonderful way to embrace life. \n\nWhat is he noticing when he’s making decisions (about the good life): Guiding question, is this going to be fun for “Us” - family or the work. \n\nAttending to what might be fun: \nThey do a lot of movie production, series production, curious about arabic culture, make it modern and accessible to other cultures - taking your identity. It’s not just a lebanese identity - it’s a global identity and how do you communicate that to many audiences.\n\n\nMikey Muhanna - what he’s achieved with Afikra - guides him is fun. When I listen to his talks or at Taco Night. \n\nAttending to what might be fun: Just basic joy. Having a kid run after a chicken on Saturday afternoon when you’re roasting some burgers. \n\nOne of our core values at work? How can we make sure that we are doing experiments that don’t feel like work - it’s fun, we’re enjoying it, states of flow, really fun.

Fear of a lion, you value staying alive. \n\nHumor\n\nWe can find ourselves in situations where competing things on our todo lists matter to us. \n\nEx: I want to play with my niece - there’s a deadline at work. \nThe tension here is an ideal moment to explore values and prioritization, yet often leads to procrastination and negative states.\n\nRecognizing when competing values create resistance and flow patterns helps unlock yourself and become who you want to be.\n\n\nBenefits:\nAuthenticity, \n\nTo paraphrase the philosopher Nietzsche, he who has a strong enough why can bear\nalmost any how. I've found that 20 percent of any change is knowing how; but 80\npercent is knowing why.
