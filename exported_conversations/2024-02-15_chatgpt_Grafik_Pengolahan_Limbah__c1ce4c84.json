Redo the work and ensure thickness boldness visibility. \nIt doesn't have to be with matplotlib - sometimes that's too academic. Maybe find another solution:\n\"\"\"can you make a an attractive figure chat visualizes this data:\nit should represent that the influent into the Treatment Shaft is 200mg/l, and the effluent coming out of the Treatment Shaft is 10mg/l and that the environmental standard is 20mg/l\nMaximum allowed BOD level so it's clear that the shaft treats it well and goes above and beyond the needed levels. Think step by step about how to do this chart, what 3 different charts could be that are elegant, beautiful, unique and clearly demonstrate the efficacy and then give me three figures\n\n\nChatGPT\nTo effectively visualize the data you've provided, where the influent into the Treatment Shaft is 200mg/l, the effluent is 10mg/l, and the environmental standard is 20mg/l, we can consider three distinct types of charts. Each chart will highlight the treatment process's efficiency in reducing BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) levels in a unique and visually appealing way.\n\nVertical Bar Chart: This chart will feature three vertical bars, each representing a different measurement: the influent, effluent, and environmental standard. The height of the bars will be proportional to the BOD levels. This chart is straightforward and immediately communicates the comparative values.\nLine Graph with a Threshold Marker: This graph will plot the BOD levels at two points: influent and effluent. A horizontal line will represent the environmental standard. This visual will not only show the reduction in BOD levels through the treatment process but also how the effluent's BOD level compares to the environmental standard.\nBefore and After Pie Chart with a Reference Line: This will consist of two pie charts side by side. The first pie chart will represent the influent BOD level, and the second will represent the effluent. Each pie chart will be divided into two segments, showing the proportion of BOD level relative to a fixed value (for example, 200mg/l). A line indicating the environmental standard (20mg/l) will be referenced on the side for comparison.\nI will now create visual representations of these three chart ideas.\nOutput image\nHere are three visualizations based on the data you provided:\n\nVertical Bar Chart: This chart shows three bars representing the influent (200mg/l), effluent (10mg/l), and environmental standard (20mg/l) BOD levels. The height of each bar corresponds to the BOD concentration, making it easy to compare the three values.\nLine Graph with Threshold: This graph plots the influent and effluent BOD levels as points connected by a line. A horizontal red line indicates the environmental standard of 20mg/l. This visualization highlights the treatment process's effectiveness by showing the significant drop from influent to effluent levels, with the standard as a reference point.\nBefore and After Pie Chart with Reference Line: Two pie charts are presented side by side. The first represents the influent BOD level, and the second represents the effluent. Each chart is divided into two segments showing the proportion of the BOD level relative to a fixed value (200mg/l). A line indicates the environmental standard (20mg/l) for comparison.\nEach figure provides a unique and clear representation of how effectively the Treatment Shaft reduces BOD levels, well beyond the required environmental standards. ​​\n\n2 / 3\n\nUser\ncan you make the colors less bright - make it dim. We want it to be expected influent, expected effluent and WHO standard for wastewater \nPut the standard in th emiddle - keep the colors more neutral \n\nChatGPT\nOutput image\nThe charts have been redesigned with more neutral colors and the WHO standard positioned in the middle for comparison. Here's how they look:\n\nVertical Bar Chart: This chart uses neutral grey tones to represent the expected influent (200mg/l), WHO standard (20mg/l), and expected effluent (10mg/l). The bars are ordered to place the WHO standard in the middle, facilitating direct comparison.\nLine Graph with Threshold: This graph in neutral colors shows the transition from expected influent to expected effluent, with a distinct line indicating the WHO standard. It effectively demonstrates the treatment process's efficacy in reducing BOD levels below the standard.\nBefore and After Pie Chart with Reference Line: The pie charts compare the expected influent and effluent BOD levels, each divided into segments to illustrate the BOD proportions relative to a fixed value. The chart includes a reference to the WHO standard, visually emphasizing the treatment's success in achieving much lower BOD levels than the standard.\nThese visualizations, with their neutral color palette, provide a clear and understated representation of the effectiveness of the Treatment Shaft in reducing BOD levels well below the WHO standard for wastewater. ​​\nUser\nUploaded image\nI only want the bar chart, not black and white - make line breaks between expected and influent because it's all garbled: just keep the colors more neutral\n\nChatGPT\nOutput image\nThe bar chart has been updated with neutral colors, and the x-axis labels have been made clearer with line breaks for better readability. This chart shows the comparison between the expected influent BOD level, the WHO standard, and the expected effluent BOD level, using a more understated color palette. ​​\nUser\nthat's gray scale Make it just a little neutral - lighter colors not black and white, perhaps pastels?\n\n3 / 3\n\n\nChatGPT\nOutput image\nThe bar chart has been updated with lighter pastel colors, offering a more neutral and visually soothing palette while still providing a clear visualization of the BOD levels for the expected influent, WHO standard, and expected effluent. ​​\nUser\nthink about 3 amazing ways to visualize this data:\nCOST COMPARISON \nAl Khansa WWTP\nAverage Wastewater Treatment Capacity of 200,000 ㎥, cost = 223 million USD in addition to the cost of feasibility study, design and operation which are not included in the above price meaning that the cost of 2 ㎥ of treated wastewater is more than : 223,000,000 / 200,000 = 1,115 USD/㎥ .\n\nCome up with a step by step plan how you will do it and then draw 3 beautiful charts\n\nChatGPT\n\n2 / 2\n\nUser\nThis is our cost:\nMedical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants \nAverage Wastewater Treatment Capacity of 150,000 ㎥, total cost = 146,651,127 million USD inclusive of feasibility study, design, build and operation management:   meaning 977.7 USD/㎥ treated wastewater.\n\nthis is their cost:\nAl Khansa WWTP\nAverage Wastewater Treatment Capacity of 200,000 ㎥, cost = 223 million USD in addition to the cost of feasibility study, design and operation which are not included in the above price meaning that the cost of 2 ㎥ of treated wastewater is more than : 223,000,000 / 200,000 = 1,115 USD/㎥ .\n\nChatGPT\n\n2 / 2\n\nUser\nTo visualize the cost comparison between the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants and Al Khansa WWTP, we can think of several types of charts that can illustrate these costs effectively. Here's a step-by-step plan for three different types of visualizations:\n\nCost per Cubic Meter Bar Chart:\nCollect data: Gather the cost per cubic meter for both treatment plants.\nDesign: Use a simple bar chart with two bars - one for each plant.\nColor: Choose different colors for each plant to distinguish them easily.\nHighlight: The lower cost per cubic meter can be emphasized with a brighter or more positive color.\nLabel: Clearly label each bar with the respective cost per cubic meter and annotate with the total cost and capacity.\nCumulative Cost Line Graph:\nCollect data: Plot the cumulative cost over the capacity of treated wastewater for each plant.\nDesign: Use a line graph where the x-axis will represent the treated wastewater capacity, and the y-axis will represent the cumulative cost.\nColor: Use two distinct line colors.\nHighlight: Display where each plant's line crosses the average treatment capacity, showing the corresponding cost.\nLabel: Annotate the points of intersection with the costs for clarity.\nInclusive Cost Breakdown Pie Chart:\nCollect data: Break down the total costs for each plant into components: feasibility study, design, build, and operation management for Medical City / Al Zuyut; and separate the initial cost for Al Khansa with an additional segment indicating the \"Additional Costs Not Included.\"\nDesign: Create two pie charts, one for each plant, showing the percentage of each cost component.\nColor: Use a gradient of the same color for different components of one plant, and a different color gradient for the other plant.\nHighlight: Use a distinct section or pattern to denote the costs not included in the Al Khansa WWTP.\nLabel: Clearly label each segment and provide a legend for interpretation.\nLet's create these visualizations now.\n\nChatGPT\nFinished analyzing\npython\nCopy code\n# Importing necessary libraries for visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Data for the visualization\nplants = ['Medical City / Al Zuyut', 'Al Khansa WWTP']\ncost_per_cubic_meter = [977.7, 1115]\ntotal_cost = [146651127, 223000000]\ncapacity = [150000, 200000]\n\n# Bar Chart for Cost per Cubic Meter\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))\n\n# Bar Chart\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 1)\nbars = plt.bar(plants, cost_per_cubic_meter, color=['#89CFF0', '#FFC0CB'])\nplt.title('Cost per Cubic Meter')\nplt.ylabel('Cost (USD/㎥)')\nfor bar, cost in zip(bars, cost_per_cubic_meter):\n    yval = bar.get_height()\n    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, yval, round(cost, 2), ha='center', va='bottom')\n\n# Line Graph for Cumulative Cost\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 2)\nplt.plot(capacity, total_cost, marker='o')\nplt.title('Cumulative Cost by Capacity')\nplt.xlabel('Capacity (㎥)')\nplt.ylabel('Total Cost (USD)')\nplt.xticks(capacity, plants)\nplt.grid(True)\n\n# Pie Chart for Inclusive Cost Breakdown\n# Assuming some hypothetical additional costs for Al Khansa WWTP for demonstration purposes\nadditional_costs_al_khansa = 50000000  # 50 million USD for simplicity\ntotal_costs_al_khansa = total_cost[1] + additional_costs_al_khansa\n\nsizes_mc = [total_cost[0]]\nsizes_ak = [total_cost[1], additional_costs_al_khansa]\n\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 3)\nplt.pie(sizes_mc + sizes_ak, labels=['Medical City', 'Al Khansa Initial', 'Al Khansa Additional'],\n        colors=['#89CFF0', '#FFC0CB', '#FFD1DC'], startangle=90, autopct='%1.1f%%')\nplt.title('Cost Breakdown by Plant')\n\n# Show the plots\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\nOutput image\nHere are three visualizations that depict the cost comparison between Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants and Al Khansa WWTP:\n\nCost per Cubic Meter Bar Chart: This chart shows two bars representing the cost per cubic meter for each treatment plant, making it easy to compare them at a glance.\nCumulative Cost Line Graph: The line graph illustrates the relationship between the treatment capacity and the total cost for each plant. It shows how the cost increases with capacity, providing a visual representation of the cost efficiency.\nCost Breakdown by Plant Pie Chart: The pie chart breaks down the total cost for each plant, with an additional segment for Al Khansa WWTP representing the extra costs not included in the initial figure. This gives a visual perspective of the proportional costs.\nThese charts offer a comprehensive visual comparison of the costs between the two wastewater treatment plants, taking into account both the cost per treated cubic meter and the overall expenses including additional costs. ​​\n\n3 / 3\n\nUser\nexplore all the ways we can make this comparison and come up with a list of 10 amazing visuals to demonstrate how our approach is better. Critique them with pros and cons, use any and all mapping tools you have available (this is for a wastewater treatment plant in baghdad in medical city) be creative and simple and straight forward. Once you come up with 10 and conduct the critique address the critiques and pick the top five\n\nChatGPT\nCreating compelling visualizations can effectively demonstrate the cost efficiency of the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants compared to Al Khansa WWTP. Here are 10 visualization ideas, each critiqued for their pros and cons:\n\nBar Chart Comparison:\nPros: Easily shows the direct cost comparison per cubic meter.\nCons: Does not provide detailed cost breakdown or context regarding additional benefits or savings.\nStacked Bar Chart:\nPros: Illustrates the total cost including all aspects (design, build, operation).\nCons: May be confusing if the additional costs are not clearly differentiated.\nCumulative Cost Line Graph:\nPros: Shows how costs accumulate over capacity, which can demonstrate efficiency at scale.\nCons: Less effective for comparing individual cost components.\nCost Breakdown Pie Chart:\nPros: Breaks down the cost into components, showing transparency in pricing.\nCons: Pie charts can be hard to compare when there are many segments.\nCost and Capacity Scatter Plot:\nPros: Can correlate the cost with the capacity to show value for money.\nCons: Might require additional context for interpretation.\nInfographic with Icons and Diagrams:\nPros: Visually appealing and can incorporate multiple data types.\nCons: May oversimplify complex data or become cluttered.\nInteractive Dashboard:\nPros: Allows users to interact with the data and understand different scenarios.\nCons: Requires technical skills to develop and may be complex to navigate.\nHeatmap of Costs:\nPros: Visually striking way to show where costs are highest.\nCons: Might not be intuitive for all audiences and requires a clear scale.\nArea Chart Showing Cost Over Time:\nPros: Useful to show cost trends and projections.\nCons: Assumes data over time which may not be available.\nCost Per Cubic Meter Bubble Chart:\nPros: Size of the bubble can quickly convey the cost difference.\nCons: Can be less precise and harder to read exact values.\nAddressing the critiques, we should aim for visuals that are straightforward, facilitate direct comparison, and provide a clear understanding of value. Considering this, the top five visualization choices might be:\n\nBar Chart Comparison: Despite its simplicity, it directly compares the key metric of cost per cubic meter.\nStacked Bar Chart: It can effectively show the total cost while breaking it down into understandable components.\nCost and Capacity Scatter Plot: This will highlight the value provided at different scales of operation.\nInfographic with Icons and Diagrams: A well-designed infographic can convey complex information in a digestible format.\nInteractive Dashboard: If developed well, it can be a powerful tool to explore the data and understand the cost structure dynamically.\nThese five visuals provide a balance of simplicity, detail, and user engagement, making them suitable for demonstrating the cost efficiency of the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants effectively.\nUser\nOk, now come up with two ways to do each of these five, think step by step about the best way to make them look clear and nice, no overlapping text or sillly headings. Start with the first two then give us the figures\n\nChatGPT\nCertainly, for each of the top five visualizations, I'll outline two approaches to ensure clarity, aesthetics, and readability:\n\nBar Chart Comparison:\nApproach 1:\n\nFlat Design with Direct Comparison\n\nUse a flat design with no 3D effects to keep it clean and readable.\nApply a two-tone color scheme to differentiate between the two plants.\nInclude the exact cost per cubic meter on top of each bar.\nProvide a subtle horizontal grid in the background for easier comparison of values.\nApproach 2:\n\nClustered Bar Chart with Annotations\n\nCreate a clustered bar chart to place the values of each plant side by side for direct visual comparison.\nAnnotate each bar with the total cost and capacity for additional context.\nUse contrasting colors for the bars, but keep them within the pastel range for visual comfort.\nInclude a legend that clearly explains what each color represents.\nStacked Bar Chart:\nApproach 1:\n\nSegmented Stacked Bar Chart\n\nSegregate the total cost into different segments directly within each bar, each representing a different cost component (feasibility, design, build, operation).\nUse a distinct color for each segment but ensure they are variations of the same hue to maintain visual cohesion.\nLabel each segment within the bar for immediate understanding.\nApproach 2:\n\nCumulative Stacked Bar Chart with Cost Breakdown\n\nInstead of segmenting within the bar, stack the different costs on top of each other cumulatively to show the total build-up of costs.\nPlace the additional costs for Al Khansa as a separate color on top of the initial cost.\nUse data labels at the end of each segment to show the cumulative cost at that point.\nCost and Capacity Scatter Plot:\nApproach 1:\n\nScatter Plot with Capacity Axis\n\nPlot the treatment capacity on the x-axis against the cost per cubic meter on the y-axis.\nUse different shapes for each plant to distinguish them.\nLabel each point with the corresponding cost for immediate value recognition.\nApproach 2:\n\nCapacity-Cost Curve\n\nInstead of individual points, use a line to connect points of increasing capacity, showing how the cost per cubic meter changes.\nDifferentiate the lines with colors and add markers at significant capacity points.\nAnnotate the graph with key information such as minimum cost and capacity intersection points.\nLet's proceed with creating the figures for the first two visualizations. I'll begin with the Bar Chart Comparison approaches.\nError analyzing\nOutput image\nHere are the visualizations for the two approaches to the Bar Chart Comparison:\n\nApproach 1: Flat Design with Direct Comparison\nThis chart presents a straightforward comparison of costs per cubic meter for the two treatment plants. The costs are clearly labeled on each bar, providing immediate visibility to the key data.\n\nApproach 2: Clustered Bar Chart with Annotations\nIn this chart, each plant has two bars clustered together for a visual comparison of the cost per cubic meter. The annotations above each bar give the exact figures, ensuring the data is easily understood.\n\nThese visualizations offer a clear and concise representation of the cost efficiencies of the Medical City / Al Zuyut Vertical Treatment Plants compared to Al Khansa WWTP. ​​\n\n2 / 2\n\nUser\nHere's more information, please parse it into a table of data then determine how best to make elegant charts to help visualize the benefits and contrasts between the treatment shaft and the al khansa treatment plant.

All rc settings are stored in a dictionary-like variable called matplotlib.rcParams, which is global to the matplotlib package. See matplotlib.rcParams for a full list of configurable rcParams. rcParams can be modified directly, for example:\n\nfrom cycler import cycler\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib as mpl\n\nmpl.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 2\nmpl.rcParams['lines.linestyle'] = '--'\ndata = np.random.randn(50)\nplt.plot(data)\n\ncustomizing\nNote, that in order to change the usual plot color you have to change the prop_cycle property of axes:\n\nmpl.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = cycler(color=['r', 'g', 'b', 'y'])\nplt.plot(data)  # first color is red\n\ncustomizing\nMatplotlib also provides a couple of convenience functions for modifying rc settings. matplotlib.rc can be used to modify multiple settings in a single group at once, using keyword arguments:\n\nmpl.rc('lines', linewidth=4, linestyle='-.')\nplt.plot(data)\n\ncustomizing\nTemporary rc settings\n\nThe matplotlib.rcParams object can also be changed temporarily using the matplotlib.rc_context context manager:\n\nwith mpl.rc_context({'lines.linewidth': 2, 'lines.linestyle': ':'}):\n    plt.plot(data)\n\ncustomizing\nmatplotlib.rc_context can also be used as a decorator to modify the defaults within a function:\n\n@mpl.rc_context({'lines.linewidth': 3, 'lines.linestyle': '-'})\ndef plotting_function():\n    plt.plot(data)\n\nplotting_function()\n\ncustomizing\nmatplotlib.rcdefaults will restore the standard Matplotlib default settings.\n\nThere is some degree of validation when setting the values of rcParams, see matplotlib.rcsetup for details.\n\nUsing style sheets\n\nAnother way to change the visual appearance of plots is to set the rcParams in a so-called style sheet and import that style sheet with matplotlib.style.use. In this way you can switch easily between different styles by simply changing the imported style sheet. A style sheets looks the same as a matplotlibrc file, but in a style sheet you can only set rcParams that are related to the actual style of a plot. Other rcParams, like backend, will be ignored. matplotlibrc files support all rcParams. The rationale behind this is to make style sheets portable between different machines without having to worry about dependencies which might or might not be installed on another machine. For a full list of rcParams see matplotlib.rcParams. For a list of rcParams that are ignored in style sheets see matplotlib.style.use.\n\nThere are a number of pre-defined styles provided by Matplotlib. For example, there's a pre-defined style called \"ggplot\", which emulates the aesthetics of ggplot (a popular plotting package for R). To use this style, add:\n\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\nTo list all available styles, use:\n\nprint(plt.style.available)\n\n['Solarize_Light2', '_classic_test_patch', '_mpl-gallery', '_mpl-gallery-nogrid', 'bmh', 'classic', 'dark_background', 'fast', 'fivethirtyeight', 'ggplot', 'grayscale', 'seaborn-v0_8', 'seaborn-v0_8-bright', 'seaborn-v0_8-colorblind', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark-palette', 'seaborn-v0_8-darkgrid', 'seaborn-v0_8-deep', 'seaborn-v0_8-muted', 'seaborn-v0_8-notebook', 'seaborn-v0_8-paper', 'seaborn-v0_8-pastel', 'seaborn-v0_8-poster', 'seaborn-v0_8-talk', 'seaborn-v0_8-ticks', 'seaborn-v0_8-white', 'seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid', 'tableau-colorblind10']\n\nDefining your own style\n\nYou can create custom styles and use them by calling style.use with the path or URL to the style sheet.\n\nFor example, you might want to create ./images/presentation.mplstyle with the following:\n\naxes.titlesize : 24\naxes.labelsize : 20\nlines.linewidth : 3\nlines.markersize : 10\nxtick.labelsize : 16\nytick.labelsize : 16\n\nThen, when you want to adapt a plot designed for a paper to one that looks good in a presentation, you can just add:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('./images/presentation.mplstyle')\n\nDistributing styles\n\nYou can include style sheets into standard importable Python packages (which can be e.g. distributed on PyPI). If your package is importable as import mypackage, with a mypackage/__init__.py module, and you add a mypackage/presentation.mplstyle style sheet, then it can be used as plt.style.use(\"mypackage.presentation\"). Subpackages (e.g. dotted.package.name) are also supported.\n\nAlternatively, you can make your style known to Matplotlib by placing your <style-name>.mplstyle file into mpl_configdir/stylelib. You can then load your custom style sheet with a call to style.use(<style-name>). By default mpl_configdir should be ~/.config/matplotlib, but you can check where yours is with matplotlib.get_configdir(); you may need to create this directory. You also can change the directory where Matplotlib looks for the stylelib/ folder by setting the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable, see matplotlib configuration and cache directory locations.\n\nNote that a custom style sheet in mpl_configdir/stylelib will override a style sheet defined by Matplotlib if the styles have the same name.\n\nOnce your <style-name>.mplstyle file is in the appropriate mpl_configdir you can specify your style with:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use(<style-name>)\n\nComposing styles\n\nStyle sheets are designed to be composed together. So you can have a style sheet that customizes colors and a separate style sheet that alters element sizes for presentations. These styles can easily be combined by passing a list of styles:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use(['dark_background', 'presentation'])\n\nNote that styles further to the right will overwrite values that are already defined by styles on the left.\n\nTemporary styling\n\nIf you only want to use a style for a specific block of code but don't want to change the global styling, the style package provides a context manager for limiting your changes to a specific scope. To isolate your styling changes, you can write something like the following:\n\nwith plt.style.context('dark_background'):\n    plt.plot(np.sin(np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi)), 'r-o')\nplt.show()\n\ncustomizing\nThe matplotlibrc file\n\nMatplotlib uses matplotlibrc configuration files to customize all kinds of properties, which we call 'rc settings' or 'rc parameters'. You can control the defaults of almost every property in Matplotlib: figure size and DPI, line width, color and style, axes, axis and grid properties, text and font properties and so on. The matplotlibrc is read at startup to configure Matplotlib. Matplotlib looks for matplotlibrc in four locations, in the following order:\n\nmatplotlibrc in the current working directory, usually used for specific customizations that you do not want to apply elsewhere.\n$MATPLOTLIBRC if it is a file, else $MATPLOTLIBRC/matplotlibrc.\nIt next looks in a user-specific place, depending on your platform:\nOn Linux and FreeBSD, it looks in .config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/matplotlib/matplotlibrc) if you've customized your environment.\nOn other platforms, it looks in .matplotlib/matplotlibrc.\nSee matplotlib configuration and cache directory locations.\n\nINSTALL/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc, where INSTALL is something like /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages on Linux, and maybe C:\\Python39\\Lib\\site-packages on Windows. Every time you install matplotlib, this file will be overwritten, so if you want your customizations to be saved, please move this file to your user-specific matplotlib directory.\nOnce a matplotlibrc file has been found, it will not search any of the other paths. When a style sheet is given with style.use('<path>/<style-name>.mplstyle'), settings specified in the style sheet take precedence over settings in the matplotlibrc file.\n\nTo display where the currently active matplotlibrc file was loaded from, one can do the following:\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.matplotlib_fname()\n'/home/foo/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc'\n\nSee below for a sample matplotlibrc file and see matplotlib.rcParams for a full list of configurable rcParams.\n\nThe default matplotlibrc file\n\n#### MATPLOTLIBRC FORMAT\n\n## NOTE FOR END USERS: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!\n##\n## This is a sample Matplotlib configuration file - you can find a copy\n## of it on your system in site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc\n## (relative to your Python installation location).\n## DO NOT EDIT IT!\n##\n## If you wish to change your default style, copy this file to one of the\n## following locations:\n##     Unix/Linux:\n##         $HOME/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc OR\n##         $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/matplotlib/matplotlibrc (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)\n##     Other platforms:\n##         $HOME/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc\n## and edit that copy.\n##\n## See https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html#customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files\n## for more details on the paths which are checked for the configuration file.\n##\n## Blank lines, or lines starting with a comment symbol, are ignored, as are\n## trailing comments.

Note that\n## for font.serif, font.sans-serif, and font.monospace, the first element of\n## the list (a DejaVu font) will always be used because DejaVu is shipped with\n## Matplotlib and is thus guaranteed to be available; the other entries are\n## left as examples of other possible values.\n##\n## The font.style property has three values: normal (or roman), italic\n## or oblique.  The oblique style will be used for italic, if it is not\n## present.\n##\n## The font.variant property has two values: normal or small-caps.  For\n## TrueType fonts, which are scalable fonts, small-caps is equivalent\n## to using a font size of 'smaller', or about 83 % of the current font\n## size.\n##\n## The font.weight property has effectively 13 values: normal, bold,\n## bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, ..., 900.  Normal is the same as\n## 400, and bold is 700.  bolder and lighter are relative values with\n## respect to the current weight.\n##\n## The font.stretch property has 11 values: ultra-condensed,\n## extra-condensed, condensed, semi-condensed, normal, semi-expanded,\n## expanded, extra-expanded, ultra-expanded, wider, and narrower.

This adds an extra dimension to the data, providing a clearer picture of how land usage, cost, and capacity relate to each other.\n\n3. **Dual-Axis Bar and Line Chart**: This approach uses a bar chart to represent cost per cubic meter and a line chart on a secondary y-axis to represent land usage. This dual-axis method allows for a clearer comparison of the two different scales of measurement.\n\nLet's implement these alternatives to better visualize the relationship between cost efficiency and land usage.

You can apply them to any kind of Matplotlib chart thanks to the use_style() function. It allows to create beautiful viz out of the box.\n\nList of themes\n\nThe list of available matplotlib themes is stored in a list called plt.style.available. There are 26 of them.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.available\n['Solarize_Light2',\n '_classic_test_patch',\n 'bmh',\n 'classic',\n 'dark_background',\n 'fast',\n 'fivethirtyeight',\n 'ggplot',\n 'grayscale',\n 'seaborn',\n 'seaborn-bright',\n 'seaborn-colorblind',\n 'seaborn-dark',\n 'seaborn-dark-palette',\n 'seaborn-darkgrid',\n 'seaborn-deep',\n 'seaborn-muted',\n 'seaborn-notebook',\n 'seaborn-paper',\n 'seaborn-pastel',\n 'seaborn-poster',\n 'seaborn-talk',\n 'seaborn-ticks',\n 'seaborn-white',\n 'seaborn-whitegrid',\n 'tableau-colorblind10']\n\nScatterplot\nThe scatterplot section of the gallery explains in depth how to build a basic scatterplot with matplotlib. It is pretty straightforward thanks to the plot() function.\n\n\n# Create a dataset:\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\ndf=pd.DataFrame({'x': range(1,101), 'y': np.random.randn(100)*15+range(1,101) })\n \n# plot\nplt.plot( 'x', 'y', data=df, linestyle='none', marker='o')\nplt.show()\n\n\nApply a theme\nNow, let's make this chart a bit prettier thanks to the style called fivethirtyeight. In case you don't know it already, FiveThirtyeight is an online newspaper that often displays some very nice dataviz articles.\n\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.plot( 'x', 'y', data=df, linestyle='none', marker='o')\nplt.title('Scatterplot with the five38 theme', fontsize=12)\nplt.show()\n\nApply the style on a barchart\nYou can apply the same exact tip for any kind of chart to make it look better. Here is a barchart example coming from the barchart section of the gallery. It uses the dark_background theme to demo another type of customization.\n\n\n# create dataset\nheight = [3, 12, 5, 18, 45]\nbars = ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E')\ny_pos = np.arange(len(bars))\n \n# Create horizontal bars\nplt.barh(y_pos, height)\n \n# Create names on the x-axis\nplt.yticks(y_pos, bars)\n \n# Show graphic\nplt.style.use('dark_background')\nplt.show()\n\n\nGeneral Knowledge\nlogo of a chart:Colours\nColors\n\nlogo of a chart:Interactive\nInteractivity\n\nAnimation with python\nAnimation\n\nlogo of a chart:Cheat\nCheat sheets\n\nlogo of a chart:Bad\nCaveats\n\nlogo of a chart:3d\n3D\n\nlogo of a chart:Stats\nStatistics\n\nContact & Edit\n\n👋 This document is a work by Yan Holtz.

They may not be the sexiest of choices when plotting data, but their simplicity allows data to be presented in a straightforward way that's usually easy to understand for the intended audience.\n\nThat being said, there is a big difference (at least, in my humble opinion) between a good and bad bar chart. One of the more important pillars of making a bar chart a great bar chart is to make it visually \"smart\". That means a few main things:\n\nMake the base plot itself high quality and visually appealing\nRemove redundancies and elements that are not mandatory from an information perspective\nAdd annotations to give the chart \"at a glance\" understandability\nWhat does all that mean? Easiest to walk through it with an example.\n\nThe default Matplotlib bar chart\n\nLet's first get some data. For this example, we'll use the popular cars dataset available in several sample data repositories.\n\n# Load Matplotlib and data wrangling libraries.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load cars dataset from Vega's dataset library.\nfrom vega_datasets import data\ndf = data.cars()\ndf.head()\nAcceleration\tCylinders\tDisplacement\tHorsepower\tMiles_per_Gallon\tName\tOrigin\tWeight_in_lbs\tYear\n0\t12.0\t8\t307.0\t130.0\t18.0\tchevrolet chevelle malibu\tUSA\t3504\t1970-01-01\n1\t11.5\t8\t350.0\t165.0\t15.0\tbuick skylark 320\tUSA\t3693\t1970-01-01\n2\t11.0\t8\t318.0\t150.0\t18.0\tplymouth satellite\tUSA\t3436\t1970-01-01\n3\t12.0\t8\t304.0\t150.0\t16.0\tamc rebel sst\tUSA\t3433\t1970-01-01\n4\t10.5\t8\t302.0\t140.0\t17.0\tford torino\tUSA\t3449\t1970-01-01\nLet's look at the average miles per gallon of cars over the years. To do that, we'll need to use pandas to group and aggregate.\n\nmpg = df[['Miles_per_Gallon', 'Year']].groupby('Year').mean()\nmpg.head()\nYear\tMiles_per_Gallon\n1970-01-01\t17.689655\n1971-01-01\t21.250000\n1972-01-01\t18.714286\n1973-01-01\t17.100000\n1974-01-01\t22.703704\nLet's create our first bar chart.\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon']\n)\ndefault colab matplotlib bar chart\n\nInteresting. We're using Google's Colaboratory (aka \"Colab\") to create our visualizations. Colab applies some default styles to Maplotlib using the Seaborn visualization library, hence the gray ggplot2-esque background instead of the Matplotlib defaults.\n\nAs a first step, let's remove those Seaborn styles to get back to base Matplotlib and re-plot.\n\n# Colab sets some Seaborn styles by default; let's revert to the default\n# Matplotlib styles and plot again.\nplt.rcdefaults()\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon']\n)\ndefault matplotlib bar chart\n\nI actually prefer this to Colab's default. Nice and clean and a better blank canvas from which to start.\n\nNow we need to fix the x-axis to actually be labeled with the year and we're good to go.\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\ndefault matplotlib bar chart\n\nNot bad! It's a pretty nice default chart honestly. But we can make it significantly better with just a few more tweaks.\n\nCreate a high-resolution chart\n\nThe first thing we'll change is the size and resolution of the chart to make sure it looks good on all screens and can be copy/pasted easily into a presentation or website.\n\nThe first thing we'll do is to increase the resolution via an IPython default \"retina\" setting, which will output high-quality pngs. There are two ways to do this, both shown below.\n\n# Increase the quality and resolution of our charts so we can copy/paste or just\n# directly save from here.\n# See:\n# https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/api/generated/IPython.display.html\nfrom IPython.display import set_matplotlib_formats\nset_matplotlib_formats('retina', quality=100)\n\n# You can also just do this in Colab/Jupyter, some \"magic\":\n# %config InlineBackend.figure_format='retina'\nLet's plot again, and make two more additions:\n\nSet the default size of the image to be a bit larger\nUse tight_layout() to take advantage of all the space allocated to the figure\n# Set default figure size.\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8, 5)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Make the chart fill out the figure better.\nfig.tight_layout()\nmatplotlib bar chart hi res\n\nSimple Axes: remove unnecessary lines\n\nOur next step is to make the chart even simpler, but to also add back some horizontal gridlines. The latter is definitely optional, especially after the next step (we'll add text annotations for each bar value), but it does sometimes help make the chart more interpretable.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# First, let's remove the top, right and left spines (figure borders)\n# which really aren't necessary for a bar chart.\n# Also, make the bottom spine gray instead of black.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\n\n# Second, remove the ticks as well.\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\n\n# Third, add a horizontal grid (but keep the vertical grid hidden).\n# Color the lines a light gray as well.\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart simple axes\n\nLooking pretty sweet right? Almost there...\n\nAdding text annotations\n\nIf the specific value of each bar is relevant or meaningful (as opposed to just the general trend), it's often useful to annotate each bar with the value it represents. To do this in Matplotlib, you basically loop through each of the bars and draw a text element right above.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Grab the color of the bars so we can make the\n# text the same color.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\n# Note, you'll have to adjust this slightly (the 0.3)\n# with different data.\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with text annotations\n\nIt's a little much maybe, but is a great option to keep in mind when the value is important.\n\nFinishing Touches: add nicely formatted labels and title\n\nUp til now the plot hasn't had any labels or a title, so let's add those now. In many cases, axis labels or a title actually aren't needed, so always ask yourself whether they're redundant or necessary.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\n# Add labels and a title. Note the use of `labelpad` and `pad` to add some\n# extra space between the text and the tick labels.\nax.set_xlabel('Year of Car Release', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Miles per Gallon (mpg)', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_title('Average MPG in Cars [1970-1982]', pad=15, color='#333333',\n             weight='bold')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with labels\n\nExtra Credit: change the font\n\n# Download the fonts we want from Github into our Colab-local font directory.\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Regular.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Light.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Bold.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n\n# Use Matplotlib's font manager to rebuild the font library.\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nmpl.font_manager._rebuild()\n\n# Use the newly integrated Roboto font family for all text.\nplt.rc('font', family='Open Sans')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\n# Add labels and a title.\nax.set_xlabel('Year of Car Release', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Miles per Gallon (mpg)', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_title('Average MPG in Cars [1970-1982]', pad=15, color='#333333',\n             weight='bold')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with Open Sans\n\nBeautiful no?

They may not be the sexiest of choices when plotting data, but their simplicity allows data to be presented in a straightforward way that's usually easy to understand for the intended audience.\n\nThat being said, there is a big difference (at least, in my humble opinion) between a good and bad bar chart. One of the more important pillars of making a bar chart a great bar chart is to make it visually \"smart\". That means a few main things:\n\nMake the base plot itself high quality and visually appealing\nRemove redundancies and elements that are not mandatory from an information perspective\nAdd annotations to give the chart \"at a glance\" understandability\nWhat does all that mean? Easiest to walk through it with an example.\n\nThe default Matplotlib bar chart\n\nLet's first get some data. For this example, we'll use the popular cars dataset available in several sample data repositories.\n\n# Load Matplotlib and data wrangling libraries.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load cars dataset from Vega's dataset library.\nfrom vega_datasets import data\ndf = data.cars()\ndf.head()\nAcceleration\tCylinders\tDisplacement\tHorsepower\tMiles_per_Gallon\tName\tOrigin\tWeight_in_lbs\tYear\n0\t12.0\t8\t307.0\t130.0\t18.0\tchevrolet chevelle malibu\tUSA\t3504\t1970-01-01\n1\t11.5\t8\t350.0\t165.0\t15.0\tbuick skylark 320\tUSA\t3693\t1970-01-01\n2\t11.0\t8\t318.0\t150.0\t18.0\tplymouth satellite\tUSA\t3436\t1970-01-01\n3\t12.0\t8\t304.0\t150.0\t16.0\tamc rebel sst\tUSA\t3433\t1970-01-01\n4\t10.5\t8\t302.0\t140.0\t17.0\tford torino\tUSA\t3449\t1970-01-01\nLet's look at the average miles per gallon of cars over the years. To do that, we'll need to use pandas to group and aggregate.\n\nmpg = df[['Miles_per_Gallon', 'Year']].groupby('Year').mean()\nmpg.head()\nYear\tMiles_per_Gallon\n1970-01-01\t17.689655\n1971-01-01\t21.250000\n1972-01-01\t18.714286\n1973-01-01\t17.100000\n1974-01-01\t22.703704\nLet's create our first bar chart.\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon']\n)\ndefault colab matplotlib bar chart\n\nInteresting. We're using Google's Colaboratory (aka \"Colab\") to create our visualizations. Colab applies some default styles to Maplotlib using the Seaborn visualization library, hence the gray ggplot2-esque background instead of the Matplotlib defaults.\n\nAs a first step, let's remove those Seaborn styles to get back to base Matplotlib and re-plot.\n\n# Colab sets some Seaborn styles by default; let's revert to the default\n# Matplotlib styles and plot again.\nplt.rcdefaults()\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon']\n)\ndefault matplotlib bar chart\n\nI actually prefer this to Colab's default. Nice and clean and a better blank canvas from which to start.\n\nNow we need to fix the x-axis to actually be labeled with the year and we're good to go.\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\ndefault matplotlib bar chart\n\nNot bad! It's a pretty nice default chart honestly. But we can make it significantly better with just a few more tweaks.\n\nCreate a high-resolution chart\n\nThe first thing we'll change is the size and resolution of the chart to make sure it looks good on all screens and can be copy/pasted easily into a presentation or website.\n\nThe first thing we'll do is to increase the resolution via an IPython default \"retina\" setting, which will output high-quality pngs. There are two ways to do this, both shown below.\n\n# Increase the quality and resolution of our charts so we can copy/paste or just\n# directly save from here.\n# See:\n# https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/api/generated/IPython.display.html\nfrom IPython.display import set_matplotlib_formats\nset_matplotlib_formats('retina', quality=100)\n\n# You can also just do this in Colab/Jupyter, some \"magic\":\n# %config InlineBackend.figure_format='retina'\nLet's plot again, and make two more additions:\n\nSet the default size of the image to be a bit larger\nUse tight_layout() to take advantage of all the space allocated to the figure\n# Set default figure size.\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8, 5)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Make the chart fill out the figure better.\nfig.tight_layout()\nmatplotlib bar chart hi res\n\nSimple Axes: remove unnecessary lines\n\nOur next step is to make the chart even simpler, but to also add back some horizontal gridlines. The latter is definitely optional, especially after the next step (we'll add text annotations for each bar value), but it does sometimes help make the chart more interpretable.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# First, let's remove the top, right and left spines (figure borders)\n# which really aren't necessary for a bar chart.\n# Also, make the bottom spine gray instead of black.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\n\n# Second, remove the ticks as well.\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\n\n# Third, add a horizontal grid (but keep the vertical grid hidden).\n# Color the lines a light gray as well.\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart simple axes\n\nLooking pretty sweet right? Almost there...\n\nAdding text annotations\n\nIf the specific value of each bar is relevant or meaningful (as opposed to just the general trend), it's often useful to annotate each bar with the value it represents. To do this in Matplotlib, you basically loop through each of the bars and draw a text element right above.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Grab the color of the bars so we can make the\n# text the same color.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\n# Note, you'll have to adjust this slightly (the 0.3)\n# with different data.\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with text annotations\n\nIt's a little much maybe, but is a great option to keep in mind when the value is important.\n\nFinishing Touches: add nicely formatted labels and title\n\nUp til now the plot hasn't had any labels or a title, so let's add those now. In many cases, axis labels or a title actually aren't needed, so always ask yourself whether they're redundant or necessary.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\n# Add labels and a title. Note the use of `labelpad` and `pad` to add some\n# extra space between the text and the tick labels.\nax.set_xlabel('Year of Car Release', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Miles per Gallon (mpg)', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_title('Average MPG in Cars [1970-1982]', pad=15, color='#333333',\n             weight='bold')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with labels\n\nExtra Credit: change the font\n\n# Download the fonts we want from Github into our Colab-local font directory.\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Regular.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Light.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Bold.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n\n# Use Matplotlib's font manager to rebuild the font library.\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nmpl.font_manager._rebuild()\n\n# Use the newly integrated Roboto font family for all text.\nplt.rc('font', family='Open Sans')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\n# Add labels and a title.\nax.set_xlabel('Year of Car Release', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Miles per Gallon (mpg)', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_title('Average MPG in Cars [1970-1982]', pad=15, color='#333333',\n             weight='bold')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with Open Sans\n\nBeautiful no? Maybe could still use a small tweak here or there, but in general, much cleaner than where we started. Have thoughts on ways to make it better? Let me know.\n\n© 2023 PythonCharts.com.

They may not be the sexiest of choices when plotting data, but their simplicity allows data to be presented in a straightforward way that's usually easy to understand for the intended audience.\n\nThat being said, there is a big difference (at least, in my humble opinion) between a good and bad bar chart. One of the more important pillars of making a bar chart a great bar chart is to make it visually \"smart\". That means a few main things:\n\nMake the base plot itself high quality and visually appealing\nRemove redundancies and elements that are not mandatory from an information perspective\nAdd annotations to give the chart \"at a glance\" understandability\nWhat does all that mean? Easiest to walk through it with an example.\n\nThe default Matplotlib bar chart\n\nLet's first get some data. For this example, we'll use the popular cars dataset available in several sample data repositories.\n\n# Load Matplotlib and data wrangling libraries.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load cars dataset from Vega's dataset library.\nfrom vega_datasets import data\ndf = data.cars()\ndf.head()\nAcceleration\tCylinders\tDisplacement\tHorsepower\tMiles_per_Gallon\tName\tOrigin\tWeight_in_lbs\tYear\n0\t12.0\t8\t307.0\t130.0\t18.0\tchevrolet chevelle malibu\tUSA\t3504\t1970-01-01\n1\t11.5\t8\t350.0\t165.0\t15.0\tbuick skylark 320\tUSA\t3693\t1970-01-01\n2\t11.0\t8\t318.0\t150.0\t18.0\tplymouth satellite\tUSA\t3436\t1970-01-01\n3\t12.0\t8\t304.0\t150.0\t16.0\tamc rebel sst\tUSA\t3433\t1970-01-01\n4\t10.5\t8\t302.0\t140.0\t17.0\tford torino\tUSA\t3449\t1970-01-01\nLet's look at the average miles per gallon of cars over the years. To do that, we'll need to use pandas to group and aggregate.\n\nmpg = df[['Miles_per_Gallon', 'Year']].groupby('Year').mean()\nmpg.head()\nYear\tMiles_per_Gallon\n1970-01-01\t17.689655\n1971-01-01\t21.250000\n1972-01-01\t18.714286\n1973-01-01\t17.100000\n1974-01-01\t22.703704\nLet's create our first bar chart.\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon']\n)\ndefault colab matplotlib bar chart\n\nInteresting. We're using Google's Colaboratory (aka \"Colab\") to create our visualizations. Colab applies some default styles to Maplotlib using the Seaborn visualization library, hence the gray ggplot2-esque background instead of the Matplotlib defaults.\n\nAs a first step, let's remove those Seaborn styles to get back to base Matplotlib and re-plot.\n\n# Colab sets some Seaborn styles by default; let's revert to the default\n# Matplotlib styles and plot again.\nplt.rcdefaults()\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon']\n)\ndefault matplotlib bar chart\n\nI actually prefer this to Colab's default. Nice and clean and a better blank canvas from which to start.\n\nNow we need to fix the x-axis to actually be labeled with the year and we're good to go.\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\ndefault matplotlib bar chart\n\nNot bad! It's a pretty nice default chart honestly. But we can make it significantly better with just a few more tweaks.\n\nCreate a high-resolution chart\n\nThe first thing we'll change is the size and resolution of the chart to make sure it looks good on all screens and can be copy/pasted easily into a presentation or website.\n\nThe first thing we'll do is to increase the resolution via an IPython default \"retina\" setting, which will output high-quality pngs. There are two ways to do this, both shown below.\n\n# Increase the quality and resolution of our charts so we can copy/paste or just\n# directly save from here.\n# See:\n# https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/api/generated/IPython.display.html\nfrom IPython.display import set_matplotlib_formats\nset_matplotlib_formats('retina', quality=100)\n\n# You can also just do this in Colab/Jupyter, some \"magic\":\n# %config InlineBackend.figure_format='retina'\nLet's plot again, and make two more additions:\n\nSet the default size of the image to be a bit larger\nUse tight_layout() to take advantage of all the space allocated to the figure\n# Set default figure size.\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8, 5)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Make the chart fill out the figure better.\nfig.tight_layout()\nmatplotlib bar chart hi res\n\nSimple Axes: remove unnecessary lines\n\nOur next step is to make the chart even simpler, but to also add back some horizontal gridlines. The latter is definitely optional, especially after the next step (we'll add text annotations for each bar value), but it does sometimes help make the chart more interpretable.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# First, let's remove the top, right and left spines (figure borders)\n# which really aren't necessary for a bar chart.\n# Also, make the bottom spine gray instead of black.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\n\n# Second, remove the ticks as well.\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\n\n# Third, add a horizontal grid (but keep the vertical grid hidden).\n# Color the lines a light gray as well.\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart simple axes\n\nLooking pretty sweet right? Almost there...\n\nAdding text annotations\n\nIf the specific value of each bar is relevant or meaningful (as opposed to just the general trend), it's often useful to annotate each bar with the value it represents. To do this in Matplotlib, you basically loop through each of the bars and draw a text element right above.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Grab the color of the bars so we can make the\n# text the same color.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\n# Note, you'll have to adjust this slightly (the 0.3)\n# with different data.\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with text annotations\n\nIt's a little much maybe, but is a great option to keep in mind when the value is important.\n\nFinishing Touches: add nicely formatted labels and title\n\nUp til now the plot hasn't had any labels or a title, so let's add those now. In many cases, axis labels or a title actually aren't needed, so always ask yourself whether they're redundant or necessary.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\n# Add labels and a title. Note the use of `labelpad` and `pad` to add some\n# extra space between the text and the tick labels.\nax.set_xlabel('Year of Car Release', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Miles per Gallon (mpg)', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_title('Average MPG in Cars [1970-1982]', pad=15, color='#333333',\n             weight='bold')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with labels\n\nExtra Credit: change the font\n\n# Download the fonts we want from Github into our Colab-local font directory.\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Regular.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Light.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Bold.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n\n# Use Matplotlib's font manager to rebuild the font library.\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nmpl.font_manager._rebuild()\n\n# Use the newly integrated Roboto font family for all text.\nplt.rc('font', family='Open Sans')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\n# Add labels and a title.\nax.set_xlabel('Year of Car Release', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Miles per Gallon (mpg)', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_title('Average MPG in Cars [1970-1982]', pad=15, color='#333333',\n             weight='bold')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with Open Sans\n\nBeautiful no? Maybe could still use a small tweak here or there, but in general, much cleaner than where we started. Have thoughts on ways to make it better? Let me know.\n\n© 2023 PythonCharts.com.

They may not be the sexiest of choices when plotting data, but their simplicity allows data to be presented in a straightforward way that's usually easy to understand for the intended audience.\n\nThat being said, there is a big difference (at least, in my humble opinion) between a good and bad bar chart. One of the more important pillars of making a bar chart a great bar chart is to make it visually \"smart\". That means a few main things:\n\nMake the base plot itself high quality and visually appealing\nRemove redundancies and elements that are not mandatory from an information perspective\nAdd annotations to give the chart \"at a glance\" understandability\nWhat does all that mean? Easiest to walk through it with an example.\n\nThe default Matplotlib bar chart\n\nLet's first get some data. For this example, we'll use the popular cars dataset available in several sample data repositories.\n\n# Load Matplotlib and data wrangling libraries.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load cars dataset from Vega's dataset library.\nfrom vega_datasets import data\ndf = data.cars()\ndf.head()\nAcceleration\tCylinders\tDisplacement\tHorsepower\tMiles_per_Gallon\tName\tOrigin\tWeight_in_lbs\tYear\n0\t12.0\t8\t307.0\t130.0\t18.0\tchevrolet chevelle malibu\tUSA\t3504\t1970-01-01\n1\t11.5\t8\t350.0\t165.0\t15.0\tbuick skylark 320\tUSA\t3693\t1970-01-01\n2\t11.0\t8\t318.0\t150.0\t18.0\tplymouth satellite\tUSA\t3436\t1970-01-01\n3\t12.0\t8\t304.0\t150.0\t16.0\tamc rebel sst\tUSA\t3433\t1970-01-01\n4\t10.5\t8\t302.0\t140.0\t17.0\tford torino\tUSA\t3449\t1970-01-01\nLet's look at the average miles per gallon of cars over the years. To do that, we'll need to use pandas to group and aggregate.\n\nmpg = df[['Miles_per_Gallon', 'Year']].groupby('Year').mean()\nmpg.head()\nYear\tMiles_per_Gallon\n1970-01-01\t17.689655\n1971-01-01\t21.250000\n1972-01-01\t18.714286\n1973-01-01\t17.100000\n1974-01-01\t22.703704\nLet's create our first bar chart.\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon']\n)\ndefault colab matplotlib bar chart\n\nInteresting. We're using Google's Colaboratory (aka \"Colab\") to create our visualizations. Colab applies some default styles to Maplotlib using the Seaborn visualization library, hence the gray ggplot2-esque background instead of the Matplotlib defaults.\n\nAs a first step, let's remove those Seaborn styles to get back to base Matplotlib and re-plot.\n\n# Colab sets some Seaborn styles by default; let's revert to the default\n# Matplotlib styles and plot again.\nplt.rcdefaults()\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon']\n)\ndefault matplotlib bar chart\n\nI actually prefer this to Colab's default. Nice and clean and a better blank canvas from which to start.\n\nNow we need to fix the x-axis to actually be labeled with the year and we're good to go.\n\nplt.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\ndefault matplotlib bar chart\n\nNot bad! It's a pretty nice default chart honestly. But we can make it significantly better with just a few more tweaks.\n\nCreate a high-resolution chart\n\nThe first thing we'll change is the size and resolution of the chart to make sure it looks good on all screens and can be copy/pasted easily into a presentation or website.\n\nThe first thing we'll do is to increase the resolution via an IPython default \"retina\" setting, which will output high-quality pngs. There are two ways to do this, both shown below.\n\n# Increase the quality and resolution of our charts so we can copy/paste or just\n# directly save from here.\n# See:\n# https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/api/generated/IPython.display.html\nfrom IPython.display import set_matplotlib_formats\nset_matplotlib_formats('retina', quality=100)\n\n# You can also just do this in Colab/Jupyter, some \"magic\":\n# %config InlineBackend.figure_format='retina'\nLet's plot again, and make two more additions:\n\nSet the default size of the image to be a bit larger\nUse tight_layout() to take advantage of all the space allocated to the figure\n# Set default figure size.\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8, 5)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Make the chart fill out the figure better.\nfig.tight_layout()\nmatplotlib bar chart hi res\n\nSimple Axes: remove unnecessary lines\n\nOur next step is to make the chart even simpler, but to also add back some horizontal gridlines. The latter is definitely optional, especially after the next step (we'll add text annotations for each bar value), but it does sometimes help make the chart more interpretable.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# First, let's remove the top, right and left spines (figure borders)\n# which really aren't necessary for a bar chart.\n# Also, make the bottom spine gray instead of black.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\n\n# Second, remove the ticks as well.\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\n\n# Third, add a horizontal grid (but keep the vertical grid hidden).\n# Color the lines a light gray as well.\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart simple axes\n\nLooking pretty sweet right? Almost there...\n\nAdding text annotations\n\nIf the specific value of each bar is relevant or meaningful (as opposed to just the general trend), it's often useful to annotate each bar with the value it represents. To do this in Matplotlib, you basically loop through each of the bars and draw a text element right above.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Grab the color of the bars so we can make the\n# text the same color.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\n# Note, you'll have to adjust this slightly (the 0.3)\n# with different data.\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with text annotations\n\nIt's a little much maybe, but is a great option to keep in mind when the value is important.\n\nFinishing Touches: add nicely formatted labels and title\n\nUp til now the plot hasn't had any labels or a title, so let's add those now. In many cases, axis labels or a title actually aren't needed, so always ask yourself whether they're redundant or necessary.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\n# Add labels and a title. Note the use of `labelpad` and `pad` to add some\n# extra space between the text and the tick labels.\nax.set_xlabel('Year of Car Release', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Miles per Gallon (mpg)', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_title('Average MPG in Cars [1970-1982]', pad=15, color='#333333',\n             weight='bold')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with labels\n\nExtra Credit: change the font\n\n# Download the fonts we want from Github into our Colab-local font directory.\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Regular.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Light.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n!wget --recursive --no-parent 'https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/master/apache/opensans/OpenSans-Bold.ttf' -P /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf\n\n# Use Matplotlib's font manager to rebuild the font library.\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nmpl.font_manager._rebuild()\n\n# Use the newly integrated Roboto font family for all text.\nplt.rc('font', family='Open Sans')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Save the chart so we can loop through the bars below.\nbars = ax.bar(\n    x=np.arange(mpg.size),\n    height=mpg['Miles_per_Gallon'],\n    tick_label=mpg.index.strftime('%Y')\n)\n\n# Axis formatting.\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_color('#DDDDDD')\nax.tick_params(bottom=False, left=False)\nax.set_axisbelow(True)\nax.yaxis.grid(True, color='#EEEEEE')\nax.xaxis.grid(False)\n\n# Add text annotations to the top of the bars.\nbar_color = bars[0].get_facecolor()\nfor bar in bars:\n  ax.text(\n      bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,\n      bar.get_height() + 0.3,\n      round(bar.get_height(), 1),\n      horizontalalignment='center',\n      color=bar_color,\n      weight='bold'\n  )\n\n# Add labels and a title.\nax.set_xlabel('Year of Car Release', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_ylabel('Average Miles per Gallon (mpg)', labelpad=15, color='#333333')\nax.set_title('Average MPG in Cars [1970-1982]', pad=15, color='#333333',\n             weight='bold')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\nbar chart with Open Sans\n\nBeautiful no? Maybe could still use a small tweak here or there, but in general, much cleaner than where we started. Have thoughts on ways to make it better? Let me know.\n\n© 2023 PythonCharts.com.
