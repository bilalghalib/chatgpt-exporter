Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg about his intentions for his work. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n“They’re my friends.”\nThat single line plunged me into a deep realization: I had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a means to an end. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but the means were often confused between my own goals, funding, validation, and scale, hinged on chasing big stories and big numbers rather than authentic human connections. I suddenly felt clear about why I had this gnawing notion that there was a disconnect between me and my work, between measurements and meaning.\nI moved more permanently to Lebanon, driven less by strategy and more by trusting a deeper calling: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street—individuals I had previously (often unconsciously) categorized as “beneficiaries.” Where once I saw “targets,” I began to see humans with full stories. And that shift changed everything.\nIt was a moment that upended my understanding of social impact. I’d been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for “scaling impact”—always with an eye on the next pilot or next data set. Yet here was Father Greg, a man who’d transformed countless lives, insisting that friendship lay at the heart of change more than metrics or theories of impact. \nI felt a shock of recognition like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in my pursuit of “doing good,” I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new “success” story, but life is not a game, and people are not pawns. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn’t rooting. That single line—“They’re my friends”—pierced me with its radical simplicity.\nAnd so I made a choice: rather than continuing my peripatetic rounds, I would anchor myself where I was needed. I put down deeper roots in Lebanon. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised relationship—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. In stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of human connection over data.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. I’m arguing that the way we do anything is the way we do everything, as the zen tradition likes to say. \nI believe many of the problems the social impact and nonprofit space attempts to address is related to a deeply rooted materialist understanding of reality. This leads us to see nature as natural resources to extract and humans as resources to be used. Without acknowledging or recognizing this I believe we will re-create many of the problems if we don’t operate differently and with different assumptions. It’s as if we’re set a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York, and instead, we’re going from Los Angeles to Portland, except we’re driving a tank, so it doesn’t matter if our goals and destination is any “better” - SDGs verses profit maximization, we’re still going to tear up the road along the way. We need to get out of the tank, re-think our lives, and decide to work where we are and cultivate a garden wherever we’re planted. \n\"Bloom where you are planted.\" – Saint Francis de Sales\nNeoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\nMicrofinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as it ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas. In India, farmers burdened by micro-debts faced harassment and, tragically, suicides. The metric—repayment rate—became more important than any relational approach to poverty.\nIgnoring Genocide While Creating Jobs\nA stark example is the ongoing genocide in Palestine. International agencies pour resources into “job creation” for Palestinian refugees, touting how many short-term positions are funded or how many training certificates distributed. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is systemically downplayed—overshadowed by a tidy “jobs for refugees” success statistic. The raw metric of “employment rates” doesn’t speak to generational trauma, land theft, or the dismantling of entire communities.\nIn focusing on short-term numeric “impact,” we often fail to address—or even openly name—root injustices.\nCookie-Cutter Approaches to Crises\nFollowing natural disasters—like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti—major NGOs rushed to build houses and infrastructure, guided by ROI and donor satisfaction. Many solutions fell apart due to minimal community input. A house built for people—rather than with them—ignores local wisdom and fosters dependency rather than resilience.\nThroughout it all, we chase metrics: jobs created, houses built, tests passed, repayment rates achieved. We pride ourselves on scaling up “solutions.” Yet in conversation after conversation, I hear deep unease: a sense that behind the well-polished data, we are repeating the same logic of control and extraction that caused these crises in the first place.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\nFather Greg’s statement—“They’re my friends”—wasn’t just a warm sentiment. It was a radical critique of the mechanistic worldview that sees people as “beneficiaries,” “stakeholders,” or “target populations.” Friendship implies presence and empathy, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\nStereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose the other eye—the one that perceives intangible depth, emotional truth, moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide stereoscopic vision, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in flat outlines, easily manipulated.\nEye One (Metrics and Tools): We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.\nEye Two (Meaning and Relationship): This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that calling out genocide might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n“Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”\n—(Paraphrased concept)\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact\nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: “craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve combined them into “crafting a garden,” which captures the delicate balance between artistry and cultivation—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea\nWhen you craft something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You have an intuitive sense of when the clay yields and how it wants to form. You measure, but you also feel. Similarly, a gardener sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You cannot force a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\nCrafting a garden merges these ideas: we pay reverent attention to every interaction (the “craft” side), while recognizing natural growth cycles (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.\nGarden-Craft Mindset: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of community trust. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n3. Lessons from Craftsmanship\nA craftsperson understands:\nAttentiveness: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.\nTiming and Rhythm: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, a sense of readiness is as crucial as speed.\nEmbrace of Imperfection: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we’re letting them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\nSuccess at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\nThink about a food forest versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, every moment is successful—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for the apples; it’s alive and successful in every moment.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”\nLet’s face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a “faster, cheaper, bigger” approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\nGenocide in Palestine: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.\nPost-Disaster Reconstruction: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\nA gardener doesn’t force the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is conducive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\nSustaining Long-Term Flourishing\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—we plant seeds that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts.\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work\nBloom can transform into being an organization that co-runs programs that aim to help people rediscover meaning in work and life. We used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. But now I’m proposing adopting the crafting-a-garden approach:\nPreparing the Soil (Community Readiness)\nInstead of imposing solutions, we spend time listening. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have conversations, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.\nPlanting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)\nWe collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—we craft the shape together.\nTending the Garden (Sustained Support)\nLike a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain ongoing relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.\nHarvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)\nOf course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics follow the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather stories, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\nOn the Edge of True Impact\nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight. But we can stand with communities in a lifelong posture of solidarity. We can name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\nWhat This Means for Our Work\nWhat This Could Mean\nInstead of our current approach—dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools—we could build like craftspeople:\nFrom Programs to Practice Spaces\nReplace fixed curriculum with living apprenticeship\nCreate conditions for natural emergence\nSupport direct transmission of wisdom\nLet timing follow organic development\nFrom Tools to Relationships\nBuild technology only when we truly have to\nStart with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out\nOnly add systems when the human work demands it\nLet tools serve connection, not replace it\nQuality recognition requires human presence\nLet technology serve connection, not replace it\nFocus on Depth Over Breadth\nBetter to work deeply with a few than superficially with many\nTrust that quality spreads naturally\nLet impact emerge from meaning\nMeasure What Matters\nTrack moments of real connection\nNotice where quality recognition develops\nDocument authentic transformation\nLet patterns emerge naturally\nThe future isn’t in better automation or control systems—it’s in better supporting our natural capacity to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true. Everything else follows from that.\nMaking Measurement Serve Life\nHere’s what this could look like:\nInstead of measuring:\nPlatform engagement\nGrowth projections\nImpact metrics\nResource utilization\nWe measure:\nMoments of meaning\nQuality of relationships\nWisdom transmission\nCommunity vitality\nThe key isn’t just changing what we measure, but how we measure: through direct relationship, story, observation, and community, not just data extraction.\n\nA Different Kind of Economy\nThis isn’t about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It’s about putting them in service of life. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning. When we do this:\nQuality naturally reduces waste\nRelationship naturally builds resilience\nMeaning naturally guides growth\nBeauty naturally creates value\n\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\nA Different Way Forward\nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading Winners Take All and realizing that what we’re doing isn’t what we’re talking about. We’re not saving the world—we’re helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency. We’re not even really helping them establish financially successful exponential businesses, because we don’t embody that. We embody something that matters to many, yet we’re not clear about that. Instead, we pretend to sell other things, and that tension hurts.\nThis isn’t abstract theory—there are organizations showing a different way forward. Buurtzorg in the Netherlands eliminated all management and metrics-based control, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country. Or Sounds True, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\nThese aren’t just nice stories—they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that honors quality recognition and craft. When I say craft, I don’t just mean artisanal products. I mean any work that:\nDevelops through direct relationship and apprenticeship\nValues mastery and depth alongside innovation\nCreates containers for meaningful work to emerge\nTrusts people’s natural capacity to recognize quality\nSo how do we shift from metrics mania to crafting a garden?\nPractice Stereoscopic Vision\nKeep your metrics if they help you see part of reality. But never lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees goodness, truth, beauty and possibilities for friendship.\nName Reality Clearly\nAvoid euphemisms. If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance turns exploitative, say so openly. Authentic relationships thrive on honesty, not polite obfuscation.\nSlow Down to Go Deeper\nSlowing the pace allows you to “listen to the clay,” to sense a community’s soul. Rushing might create short-term outputs but often yields shallow or harmful outcomes.\nTrust the Process of Craft\nAccept that not everything can be a linear blueprint. Gardening has seasons; some seeds fail. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks. This is growth, not a series of guaranteed leaps.\nAdopt the Gardener’s Long View\nA gardener invests in the soil, knowing real harvests may come years later—or bless future generations. In social impact, facing crises that range from genocide to climate disasters, we must hold a long-range vision. Even small acts of genuine friendship, alignment with our perception of beauty, can ripple beyond our immediate horizon.\n\nA Moment for Reflection\nWhat tension do you feel when pressured for quick results?\nWhich relationships in your work might you deepen rather than “scale”?\nWhere might you stand in truth—calling out systemic violence or injustice—rather than quietly conforming to funder-friendly narratives?\nAsking these questions is an act of reclaiming our second eye—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\nConclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—“They’re my friends”—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that relationship can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\nCrafting a garden of social impact means:\nTending relationships like precious seedlings.\nUsing skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions with communities, cultivating the context in the present moment - anticipating the “impact” in the future like a gardener planting seeds in the spring hopes for tomatoes in the summer, yet can’t ensure it.\n\n\nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that truly integrates rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—we simply refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of stereoscopic vision—two ways of seeing that yield a deeper perception of reality.\nIn the end, what we grow—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We may witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or a donor report existed. We may craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly come alive.\nAnd that, I believe, is what real impact looks like.\n\nFinal Thought\nWhen we stand next to someone—whether a refugee, a farmer crushed by debt, or a family in Palestine facing daily violence—and say, “You are not my data point; you are my friend,” we enact the very transformation we hope to see in the world. We show that life isn’t a mechanical series of inputs and outputs, but a shared tapestry of stories, joys, and struggles.\nMay we all become craftspeople and gardeners of this new paradigm—humans who measure thoughtfully but love wholeheartedly, who plant seeds of change with skilled hands and open hearts, cultivating relationships that outlast any spreadsheet.\nConclusion: Success at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact, but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way? Think of a food forest—it’s successful in every moment, even in winter’s decay. It isn’t waiting for harvest to declare success. Similarly, real transformation emerges when we let quality recognition guide us at each step, rather than fixating on some distant “scalable” end.\n“We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.”\nMaybe we start small, document what emerges when we trust this process, build evidence through real stories of transformation, and let the work speak for itself. We could become gardeners—crafting conditions for people to come alive—rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\nI believe we can pioneer a different way of working: trust quality recognition first, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves beauty. This approach might feel risky, but it leads to more authentic impact—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters real transformation.\nThat, in essence, is what I think social impact can be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true, we can finally step beyond hollow metrics into the living reality of meaningful work.]]]"

      "content": " Here are my suggestions for improving the flow, structure, and clarity of your essay:\n\nPart I: The Moment That Changed Everything\n\nThis section works well as an introduction, using a personal anecdote to set up the essay's central theme. The writing is engaging and the message about the importance of authentic human connection comes through clearly. I would suggest a few minor tweaks:\n\n- Break up the longer paragraphs into shorter ones for easier reading. For example, split the third paragraph into two after \"individuals I had previously (often unconsciously) categorized as 'beneficiaries.'\" \n- Vary the sentence structure a bit more. There are several sentences in a row that start with \"I\" - try rephrasing a couple of them.\n- The final paragraph in this section is very powerful. Consider moving the sentence \"I felt a shock of recognition like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway\" to be the first sentence of that paragraph to draw the reader in.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\n\nThis section does an excellent job expanding the scope to discuss broader issues in the social impact sector. A few suggestions:\n\n- The first paragraph introduces the idea that organizations often \"instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change.\" It would be helpful to provide a concrete example here to illustrate this point.\n- I love the metaphor about driving from LA to Portland in a tank. It's very vivid and drives home the point well. That said, the paragraph feels a bit long - try breaking it up or condensing slightly.\n- The examples under the \"Neoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\" heading are powerful but the section overall feels a tad disjointed. Consider adding some brief introductory and concluding sentences to tie it together more cohesively with the rest of Part II.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\n\nThe stereoscopic vision metaphor is extremely effective and works well here. A couple small notes:\n\n- There's a slight duplication of ideas between the first and second paragraphs. Condense them into one stronger lead-in before launching into the explanation of the two \"eyes.\"\n- When you mention \"calling out genocide\" as part of the second eye perspective, it connects back nicely to Part II but might feel abrupt if someone skipped straight to this section. Consider a brief segue or reference to genocide to link the ideas.\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden\n\nThe crafting a garden metaphor is beautiful and encapsulates your vision meaningfully. Some suggestions:\n\n- Under \"The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\" consider adding 1-2 more specific examples of how social impact work sometimes falls into this paradigm. The examples you have in Part II could actually fit well here.\n- The \"Lessons from Craftsmanship\" section is excellent - the three key points (Attentiveness, Timing/Rhythm, Embrace of Imperfection) connect seamlessly to social impact. If anything, this section could even be expanded with another illustrative example or two.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of \"Faster, Cheaper, Bigger\"\n\nThis section hits on a very real tension in the field. The examples you provide are relevant and underpin your argument well. One possibility for improvement:\n\n- The section on \"Sustaining Long-Term Flourishing\" could be woven in more throughout Part V rather than tacked on at the end. Consider integrating a sentence or two about this after each of the examples you give (genocide in Palestine, post-disaster reconstruction) to drive home how a more relational approach could make a difference.\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom\n\nIt's great that you ground the philosophy in the concrete practices and possibilities at Bloom. A few tweaks to consider:\n\n- The \"Instead of our current approach\" section is highly skimmable and engaging. See if you can apply a similar format to some of the other sections that are a bit more dense prose. Using bullet points, short paragraphs, or visuals can help break things up.\n- I would move the \"A Different Kind of Economy\" part to be the conclusion of this section, rather than sandwiched in the middle. End with the inspiring vision that \"Quality naturally reduces waste, Relationship naturally builds resilience\" etc.\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\n\nThe examples of Buurtzorg and Sounds True are excellent illustrations of the core concepts in action. I suggest:\n\n- Clarifying the through-line that links this section to the previous ones. How does it build on or conclude the thoughts from Parts IV-VI?\n- The \"Conclusion: Success at Every Step\" paragraphs that come after the Final Thought seem a little out of place. Integrate these ideas elsewhere or consider removing them if they are redundant to other points you've made.\n- The final few paragraphs are inspiring but very lofty. Ground it with a final specific example of what this kind of \"different way of working\" could look like - either a real organization or a hypothetical.\n\nOverall:\n- The interweaving of the personal narrative with the bigger picture issues works really well to keep the reader engaged.\n- The garden metaphor is powerful and used effectively throughout. I wonder if it could be brought in even more consistently from the beginning (rather than primarily concentrated in Parts IV and VI).\n- There are a lot of sub-sections and not always a clear arc linking them. Consider pruning any redundant points and making sure each section clearly builds on the previous ones. \n- The writing is almost poetic in places, which fits the topic well. That said, varying the sentence lengths a bit more could improve the flow. Throw in a few more short, punchy lines amidst the beautiful longer sentences.\n\nI hope this feedback is helpful as you refine this thought-provoking piece! Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of the suggestions.",

End with the inspiring vision that \"Quality naturally reduces waste, Relationship naturally builds resilience\" etc.\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\n\nThe examples of Buurtzorg and Sounds True are excellent illustrations of the core concepts in action. I suggest:\n\n- Clarifying the through-line that links this section to the previous ones. How does it build on or conclude the thoughts from Parts IV-VI?\n- The \"Conclusion: Success at Every Step\" paragraphs that come after the Final Thought seem a little out of place. Integrate these ideas elsewhere or consider removing them if they are redundant to other points you've made.\n- The final few paragraphs are inspiring but very lofty. Ground it with a final specific example of what this kind of \"different way of working\" could look like - either a real organization or a hypothetical.\n\nOverall:\n- The interweaving of the personal narrative with the bigger picture issues works really well to keep the reader engaged.\n- The garden metaphor is powerful and used effectively throughout. I wonder if it could be brought in even more consistently from the beginning (rather than primarily concentrated in Parts IV and VI).\n- There are a lot of sub-sections and not always a clear arc linking them. Consider pruning any redundant points and making sure each section clearly builds on the previous ones. \n- The writing is almost poetic in places, which fits the topic well. That said, varying the sentence lengths a bit more could improve the flow. Throw in a few more short, punchy lines amidst the beautiful longer sentences.\n\nI hope this feedback is helpful as you refine this thought-provoking piece! Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of the suggestions.",

      "content": " Sure, here are the specific sections with suggested rewrites. Feel free to copy and paste these to replace the corresponding parts in your original essay.\n\nPart I: The Moment That Changed Everything\n\nParagraph 3:\nI moved more permanently to Lebanon, driven less by strategy and more by trusting a deeper calling: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street. Where once I saw \"targets,\" I began to see humans with full stories.\n\nThat shift changed everything. It was a moment that upended my understanding of social impact. I'd been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for \"scaling impact\"—always with an eye on the next pilot or next data set.\n\nFinal paragraph:\nI felt a shock of recognition like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in my pursuit of \"doing good,\" I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new \"success\" story. But life is not a game, and people are not pawns. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn't rooting. That single line—\"They're my friends\"—pierced me with its radical simplicity.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\n\nParagraph 1:\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. Microfinance, for instance, started as a way to empower the poor but has sometimes devolved into aggressive loan sharking that leaves borrowers trapped in debt.\n\nParagraph 2:\nI believe many of the problems the social impact space attempts to address are related to a deeply rooted materialist understanding of reality. This leads us to see nature as resources to extract and humans as units of labor. It's as if we're set a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York, but instead, we're going from Los Angeles to Portland. Except we're driving a tank, so it doesn't matter if our goals and destination are any \"better\" - SDGs versus profit maximization. We're still going to tear up the road along the way. \n\nNeoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong:\nThe social impact world is rife with examples of good intentions gone awry when metrics are prioritized over people. Microfinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as the industry ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas, leading to tragic cases of borrower suicides in India. The metric—repayment rate—trumped any humane consideration for the poor. \n\nIn Palestine, international agencies pour resources into \"job creation\" for refugees, touting the number of short-term positions funded. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is systemically downplayed, overshadowed by tidy employment statistics that ignore generational trauma. And after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, major NGOs rushed to build houses guided by donors' demands for visible outputs. Many of these homes later fell apart due to lack of community input.\n\nAcross the board, we chase faster gains, bigger numbers, more impressive ratios. But in conversation after conversation, I hear a deep unease from those on the frontlines—a sense that in our obsession with meteoric impact, we are losing touch with the messy, relational reality of social change.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing \n\nFather Greg's words offer a radical challenge to the mechanistic worldview that pervades much of the social impact space. Friendship resists objectification—it requires presence and genuine empathy.  \n\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose sight of the other eye—the one that perceives emotional truth, moral complexity, the depth of human experience. Together, these two ways of seeing provide stereoscopic vision, revealing the nuances we'd otherwise flatten.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of \"Faster, Cheaper, Bigger\"\n\nLet's face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a \"faster, cheaper, bigger\" approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\n\nIn Palestine, if we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence—or create lasting livelihoods. Post-disaster, if we fail to partner intimately with local communities in reconstruction, our \"efficient\" building blitzes might yield a ghost town of broken houses a year later.  \n\nA gardener doesn't force a seed to sprout faster by cracking it open with a hammer. They ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the environment supportive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn't just rush their materials—they learn to work with the inherent properties, strengthening the creation from the inside out.\n\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or build genuine relationships—as Father Greg does—we plant seeds that can sustain transformation for the long haul. Quick wins might spike the graphs but erode community trust. Scale without soul is just another form of colonization.\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom\n\nImplications for Bloom:\n- Instead of impact dashboards, focus on preparing the soil, planting the seeds of co-creation, and tending the garden through sustained support.\n- Replace standardized programs with living apprenticeships that foster organic growth and transmission of wisdom.\n- Build technology to serve human connection, not replace it. Start with people, bring in tools only as the work demands.\n- Measure what matters: moments of meaning, quality of relationships, community vitality. Track transformation through storytelling and direct presence.\n\nA Different Kind of Economy\nThis approach isn't about rejecting markets entirely—but putting them in service of life. When we honor both tangible metrics and intangible meaning:\n\n- Quality naturally reduces waste\n- Relationship naturally builds resilience \n- Meaning naturally guides growth\n- Beauty naturally creates value\n\nWe can pioneer an economy that affirms our humanity rather than exploits it. Where craft and care matter more than extraction and scale. Where honoring the uniqueness of people and place generates abundance for all.\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\n\nWeaving it Together:\nThe examples of Buurtzorg and Sounds True illustrate how we might live out the principles of the crafted garden in our organizations. By privileging quality over control and wisdom over sheer scale, these pioneers point toward a new paradigm—one that the social impact world desperately needs.\n\nGrounding the Vision:\nWhat could this look like in practice? Imagine a social enterprise that apprentices local youth in green building, teaching both technical and relational skills. They construct eco-homes not through a cookie-cutter blueprint, but by truly understanding the landscape and the community's dreams. The organization tracks not just houses built, but the confidence and leadership that blossoms in the youth. Funders receive not just data points, but rich stories of transformation. This is impact with the intimacy of a garden and the integrity of a well-crafted structure.\n\nClosing Reflection:\nAs Father Greg's words echoed in my mind, I saw how easily the social impact world can mirror the very systems we long to change—prizing efficiency over empathy, short-term gains over long-term wisdom. But when we begin with friendship, when craft and care guide our work, a different future unfurls. It's a future where our institutions don't just deliver services, but create the conditions for human flourishing. Where we measure success not just by what we build, but by who we become in the process. In this future, may we all be gardeners and craftspeople, tending to the beauty that lies waiting in the depths of our world.\n\nI hope these suggested revisions help streamline and strengthen the essay while maintaining your powerful insights and poetic voice.
