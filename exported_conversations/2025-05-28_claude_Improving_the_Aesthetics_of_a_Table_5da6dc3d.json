Good balance of theory and hands-on activities\n3. Practical business component integrated throughout\n4. Optional certification day shows clear value proposition\n5. Icons help differentiate between activity types\n\n**5 Cons:**\n1. Text is cramped and difficult to read in cells\n2. Color scheme feels dated and unprofessional\n3. Inconsistent text formatting and alignment\n4. Icons are too small and don't add much clarity\n5.

It's more compact and will integrate better into a larger document\n2. The horizontal layout makes it easier to compare activities across days\n3. It prints better and is more accessible\n4. The professional appearance aligns with the serious nature of technical training\n\nBoth versions are fully responsive and will look great when you take a screenshot. The table version especially maintains its clarity even at smaller sizes, making it perfect for including in your document.\n\nWould you like me to adjust the colors, spacing, or any other aspects of either version?",

It's more compact and will integrate better into a larger document\n2. The horizontal layout makes it easier to compare activities across days\n3. It prints better and is more accessible\n4. The professional appearance aligns with the serious nature of technical training\n\nBoth versions are fully responsive and will look great when you take a screenshot. The table version especially maintains its clarity even at smaller sizes, making it perfect for including in your document.\n\nWould you like me to adjust the colors, spacing, or any other aspects of either version?",

The layout automatically adjusts for RTL reading, with the cards flowing from right to left.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Adjust any specific translations?\n2. Change the number style (Eastern Arabic vs Western numerals)?\n3. Modify the typography or spacing for better Arabic display?\n4. Create an Arabic version of the table format as well?",

Let me create a comprehensive daily timeline that shows how each day flows from morning to evening, incorporating all the elements from your 3-Block Method.\n\nLet me design this in a visually appealing timeline format that clearly shows:\n- Time blocks\n- Activity types (Frame, Learn, Apply, Sell, Reflect)\n- Specific activities and rotations\n- Breaks and transitions\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\nI've created a detailed hour-by-hour schedule with a beautiful timeline design. Here are the key features:\n\n**Design Highlights:**\n1. **Visual Timeline** - Clear vertical timeline with time markers showing the flow of the day\n2. **Activity Cards** - Each time block has a card showing type, duration, and details\n3. **Color-Coded Activities** - Different colors for Frame, Learn, Apply, Sell, and Reflect\n4. **Rotation Indicators** - Clear marking of the 30-minute station rotations\n5. **Key Outcomes** - Highlighted boxes showing important takeaways\n6. **Interactive Day Selector** - Buttons to switch between different days (framework ready for expansion)\n\n**Schedule Structure (Day 1 Example):**\n- **8:00 AM** - Opening Frame (15 min)\n- **8:15 AM** - Learn Block (60 min) \n- **9:15 AM** - Break (15 min)\n- **9:30 AM** - Apply Station 1 (30 min)\n- **10:00 AM** - Apply Station 2 (30 min)\n- **10:30 AM** - Apply Station 3 (30 min)\n- **11:00 AM** - Lunch Break (30 min)\n- **11:30 AM** - Sell Part 1 (30 min)\n- **12:00 PM** - Sell Part 2 (30 min)\n- **12:30 PM** - Reflect & Assess (45 min)\n- **1:15 PM** - Closing Frame (15 min)\n\nThis gives you a 5.25-hour training day, which is practical and intensive without being overwhelming.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Expand this to show all 5 days with unique content?\n2. Adjust the timing (make it longer/shorter)?\n3. Add more detail to specific activities?\n4. Create a simpler table version for easier editing?\n5. Include specific equipment/materials needed for each station?",

Here are the key features:\n\n**Design Highlights:**\n1. **Visual Timeline** - Clear vertical timeline with time markers showing the flow of the day\n2. **Activity Cards** - Each time block has a card showing type, duration, and details\n3. **Color-Coded Activities** - Different colors for Frame, Learn, Apply, Sell, and Reflect\n4. **Rotation Indicators** - Clear marking of the 30-minute station rotations\n5. **Key Outcomes** - Highlighted boxes showing important takeaways\n6. **Interactive Day Selector** - Buttons to switch between different days (framework ready for expansion)\n\n**Schedule Structure (Day 1 Example):**\n- **8:00 AM** - Opening Frame (15 min)\n- **8:15 AM** - Learn Block (60 min) \n- **9:15 AM** - Break (15 min)\n- **9:30 AM** - Apply Station 1 (30 min)\n- **10:00 AM** - Apply Station 2 (30 min)\n- **10:30 AM** - Apply Station 3 (30 min)\n- **11:00 AM** - Lunch Break (30 min)\n- **11:30 AM** - Sell Part 1 (30 min)\n- **12:00 PM** - Sell Part 2 (30 min)\n- **12:30 PM** - Reflect & Assess (45 min)\n- **1:15 PM** - Closing Frame (15 min)\n\nThis gives you a 5.25-hour training day, which is practical and intensive without being overwhelming.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Expand this to show all 5 days with unique content?\n2. Adjust the timing (make it longer/shorter)?\n3. Add more detail to specific activities?\n4. Create a simpler table version for easier editing?\n5. Include specific equipment/materials needed for each station?",
