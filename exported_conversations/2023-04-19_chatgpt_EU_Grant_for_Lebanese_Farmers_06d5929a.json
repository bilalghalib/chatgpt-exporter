Many of the Lebanese population have already taken that step and started their own small scale Agro-food and Mounet production, and many are now eligible to take their business a step further and produce on a bigger scale and cater to a larger market. \n",

Here's a possible reframing of your message for an EU grant proposal:\n\nThe economic recovery and financial stability of developing countries like Lebanon can be significantly accelerated by investing in key domestic sectors such as food & beverage and tourism. Our proposed project aims to build on the growing interest and expertise of Lebanese entrepreneurs in the agro-food and mounet production sectors, by providing targeted support to help them scale up their businesses and reach larger markets.\n\nBy offering training and upskilling opportunities, as well as certifications and labels to increase consumer trust and confidence, our project will enable small-scale producers to grow their businesses and increase their revenues. This, in turn, will help to create new jobs and opportunities in the local economy, while also positioning Lebanon as a competitive player in the global marketplace.\n\nWith the support of this EU grant, we will be able to unlock the full potential of Lebanon's agro-food and mounet production sectors, and pave the way for sustainable economic growth and development.",
