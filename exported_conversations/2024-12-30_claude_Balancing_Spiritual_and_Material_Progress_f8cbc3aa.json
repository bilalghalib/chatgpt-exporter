I believe taking halal rizq(sustenance) seriously can be a source of our healing and can bring balance to our world.\n\nThe phone in your pocket connects you with cobalt miners in Kolwezi, Congo, designers in San Francisco, USA, and oil refineries in Iraq. The money you spend on that phone is your vote for the hundreds of processes it takes to make, market, ship, and sell it to you. Are you ready to accept responsibility for your actions? Are you ready to face the miners in Congo? Are you willing to defend your vote before God (SWT)?\n\nAre we except from being considered accomplices to oppression that happens in the value chains of our products simply because we are unaware? \n\nIgnorance is an excuse until you know better. In the light of the global wars, Occupy Wall Street, and the consequences of climate collapse, more people are waking up to the idea that many elements of our compounding crisis are by-products of the systems we use to get and spend our sustenance. There are movements, like the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that have shown how we can follow our ethics in choosing what not to buy. This book will examine what to buy instead. \n\n“...I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves.”\n-Surah Ibrahim Ayah 22\n\nMuslims represent nearly a quarter of the population of the planet, and we can show leadership by developing products and services that follow the beautiful advice of the Prophet of God (S,) who has said in an authentic (sahih) hadith: \n\n“Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” \n- Sunan an-Nasa’i 5711; In-book reference : Book 51, Hadith 173\n\nIn an era of destabilizing change and disquiet, we all want our prayers to be answered, and the Prophet (S) has given us a clue as to the relationship between halal rizk and answered prayers:\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: O people, Allah is Good and He therefore, accepts only that which is good. …  He then made a mention of a person who travels widely, his hair disheveled and covered with dust(a person desperately needy). He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes the supplication): \"O Lord, O Lord,\" whereas his diet is unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful and his nourishment is unlawful. How can then his supplication be accepted?\nSahih Muslim 1015\n\nIt has been said that true wealth is contentedness, a path towards contentedness in this life, and confidence on the day we will be held accountable to how we earned and spent our money is increasing our efforts to gain knowledge in what is كَسْبٍ طَيِّبٍ (pure earning) and how best to spend it..\n\nBy reading this book, the reader will:\nTake stock of their transactions and work to purify their regular expenditures\nLearn how to earn a halal livelihood and make business a part of our worship.\nBe inspired to establish Baraka-based businesses that can support a parallel economy, one where Muslims can confidently acquire pure goods and services.\nBe a part of showing leadership to a world questioning capitalism without alternatives.\n\nAbout the Author\nBilal Ghalib is an educator, entrepreneur and facilitator with 15 years of experience training entrepreneurs internationally. \nIn 2016, he co-founded Bloom.pm, a social impact entrepreneurship training organization and education technology company. He’s also an advisor for Project Defy, a non-profit organization working to redefine education in India. Since 2015, he has been running Nur Coop, a business that seeks to bless the entire value chain from “Dirt to Delivery.” \n\nI have 8 intentions for writing this book:\nTo open the blessings of God to our beloved Muslim Community by sharing knowledge on halal rizk(sustenance).\n To support more people to spend their money in ways that are regenerative and uplifting of the people and ecological systems that underlie their purchases.\nTo transform my own eyes and others, and to see what happens to businesses that see their customers, the natural world, and their business with the eye of the heart. \nTo increase my taqwa of God(SWT) when he mentions in the Quran “O you who believe! Eat of the lawful and pure things that We have provided you.” [2:172]” that it is God(SWT) providing my sustenance. And I must seek the lawful and pure and increase my efforts in ensuring my consumption is within the good pleasure of God.\nTo inspire people by demonstrating that the Muslim economy can bring about a beautiful transformation. \nTo alter my perception of success and increase my contentedness.  \nTo share my intuition that Muslims can be a blessing for this world by their deeper concern on the next.\nTo invite Muslims, and myself, to decommodify the world and to return to a pre-modern way of seeing the signs of God in all things and all people. And to witness the accompanying change in my interactions, including commercial interactions, with all things. \n\n  The Market \nThe book has three target audiences:\nPrimary target: \nEarly-stage Muslim Entrepreneurs in the UK and the USA\nWhy is this book unique to them? Young Muslims are seeking security in an age of instability. Modern wisdom suggests they start multiple income streams, be their boss, and “ditch the 9-5” even if they could find one. The book attempts to direct them away from repeating the methods of doing business that have led to the age of instability in the first place and to seek trust not in themselves and their capabilities, to first put their relationship with God right, to purify their expenditures, and then to set an intention and execute on creating a taqwa-filled baraka based business that in aggregate can act as a lighthouse in an age of darkness. \nAffinity Groups:\n Cambridge Muslim College\n Karim Lahham\n Faithfully Sustainable\n4 Nations Unite\nGeoff Lawton and Greening The Desert Project\nPeople who like https://tuniqoasis.com/\n\nSecondary Target\nBusiness leaders with a heart. Native American business people with a focus on \nWhy is this book unique to them? There’s a growing understanding that indigenous peoples and religious and spiritual collaborations to create a movement.\nAffinity Groups:\n Charles Eisenstien - Sacred Economics\n Carol Sanford - The Regenerative Business\n \n\n\n\nTertiary Target\nNon-Muslim conscious consumers and ethical entrepreneurs \nWhy is this book unique to them? \nThe book provides a fresh perspective on business ethics through the lens of Islamic principles, offering universal wisdom about trust, relationships, and sustainable commerce that can appeal to anyone seeking alternatives to traditional business models. Affinity Groups:\nAffinity Groups:\nRegenerative business communities\nSocial enterprise networks\nEthical consumption groups\nAlternative economy advocates\n\nCompetition\n\nEssays in Islamic Economics - is a compilation of academic essays beyond the ken of the lay person.\n\nBook: The Book Of The Proprieties of Earning and Living is a translation of Al Ghazali, a wonderful resource for the principles that will define the book I’m seeking to write. It’s for the person interested in primary sources. \nHardcover. \nPublisher: Islamic Banking and Finance Institute Malaysia (IBFIM)\nCost: 20.52$\n\nBook: Your Money Matters\nPublisher: IPH (International Islamic Publishing House)\nCost: 15.95$\n- this book discusses economics from a business administration angle. It’s written as a text book and goes over broad subjects from HR to finance and accounting and setting up a business. My focus is towards inspiring producers and consumers to alter their purchase/production decisions by directing attention towards the problems people see with our ecology, our social ails and how we call to our lord wanting support when we know from the hadith: https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:10 - that unless we purify our clothes, our food, our drink - unless we purify the way we seek our sustenance that this hadith indicates our duaas are less likely to be answered, and God is capable of all things. My goal is not to describe a halal economics precisely, or to define where things are going wrong.\nMy goal is to activate people who become more and more careful and direct more and more of their economic power towards people who are more and more careful. Amplifying our strength and building the alternatives while ensuring our akhiras. \n\n  Book Marketing \nBelow is a breakdown of my team’s marketing assets and marketing plan for this book:\nMarketing Assets:\nWebsite: https://barakanomics.com X-Y unique visitors/month \nEmail List: 10,000 subscribers (Bloom.pm) 1,000 subscribers (Bilal Ghalib)\nFacebook: 12000 followers fans (Bloom.pm), 3800 followers (Bilal Ghalib)\nTwitter: 5974 followers (Bloom.pm), 3018 followers (Bilal Ghalib)\nYouTube: 727 Subscribers (Bilal Ghalib)\nInstagram: 4534 followers (Bloom.pm), 2806 followers (Bilal Ghalib)\nLinkedIn: 672 followers (Bloom.pm), 500 connections (Bilal Ghalib)\n\nMarketing Plan\nOur marketing plan will be divided into 3 phases:\nPre-Launch Phase (3-6 months before book launch)\nObjective of this phase: Build a real, engaged, and vibrant tribe of a like-minded community of \nreaders, evangelists, and action-takers who will be willing to pre-order, spread the word, and\nreview the book when it is released. \nWhat we’ll do:\nEarly engagement of readers through various online marketing campaigns that hint at the upcoming book, e.g., X, Y, Z.\nEarly engagement of Islamic and mainstream influencers who'd be interested in reading, reviewing, and promoting the book.\nBuild & launch book website + dedicated Facebook Group.\nRecord and promote book video trailer.\nGather book reviews / social proof / testimonials.\n\nLaunch Phase (first 3-6 weeks from book launch)\nObjective of this phase: Create an international buzz (online and offline) and sell the first\n3000-5000 copies during this period.\nWhat we’ll do:\nHold a virtual book launch party through high-quality streaming with special guests.\nOrganize book reading/signing events in X, Y and Z.\nPromote special “bulk order” offers – especially to corporate clients.\nOffer [insert supplementary product/item] as a bundle with the book at the book launch.\nRun exclusive launch contests.\nGet featured on traditional & media outlets via interviews, book reviews, & podcasts.\nEncourage readers to post reviews on Amazon.com to encourage friends and family to buy the book.\nEncourage Indie Islamic Bookstores to feature the new book and give their readers a special discount to our online course on developing halal business models, the “least you should know before you begin”.\n\nPost-Launch Phase (After launch phase)\nObjective of this phase: Continuous promotion of the book via online workshops, webinars, and offline events and conferences.\nWhat we’ll do:\nGet on podcasts?\nTraining courses?\nWrite articles for Islamic and mainstream media, e.g., Muslim Matters, LinkedIn, Huffington Post, and Thrive Global.\n\n  The Manuscript \nManuscript Details\nAnticipated length: [Insert expected number of words]\nAnticipated completion date: Approximately 6-8 months after receiving a commitment from a publisher.\nSpecial Features: The manuscript will include various tables, charts, figures, and worksheet templates designed to graphically community important information in an easy-to-understand format.

This is a fascinating intersection of Islamic principles, economic justice, human connection, and sustainable business practices. Let me ask you some thought-provoking questions to help draw out more content and organize these ideas:\n\n1. You mentioned the soul needing to catch up with physical movement - can you share a personal experience where moving too fast in business caused you to lose touch with your spiritual center? How did you recognize and address this?\n\n2. The concept of beauty as a business metric is intriguing - could you elaborate on what specific qualities or characteristics would make a business \"beautiful\" from an Islamic perspective?\n\n3. When you talk about the colosseum effect and modern entertainment as pressure release valves for societal tension - how do you envision halal businesses could provide healthier alternatives for community catharsis?\n\n4. In considering the 8 forms of capital from permaculture - how might these different forms of wealth align with Islamic principles of barakah? Could you give examples of businesses successfully operating with multiple forms of capital?\n\n5. The relationship between wu wei (non-action) and Islamic concepts is fascinating - how do you see this connecting to the Prophet Muhammad's (S) business practices? What lessons can modern entrepreneurs draw from this synthesis?\n\n6. Your proposal touches on building parallel economies - what are some concrete examples you've seen of successful small-scale halal value chains that maintain human relationships throughout the process?\n\n7. How has your experience with Nur Coop demonstrated the practical challenges and opportunities in creating businesses that prioritize relationships and baraka over pure profit?\n\n8. You mentioned the idea of being \"in touch\" and closer to things - could you share a story about how physical proximity or direct relationship with products/services changed your understanding of halal business?\n\n9. What role do you see technology playing in your vision of barakanomics? How can we use modern tools while maintaining the human scale and relationship-centered approach you're advocating?\n\n10. When you discuss \"answering to the miners in Congo\" - could you elaborate on how you envision businesses practically implementing this level of supply chain consciousness while remaining viable?\n\nWould you like to start with any particular question, or shall we work on incorporating these themes into a more detailed outline?",
