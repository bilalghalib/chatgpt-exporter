First, I'll highlight how your experience aligns with their key requirements:\n\nStrong Alignment Points:\n\n1. MENA Region Experience\n- Your work in Lebanon during crises\n- Recent project facilitation in Arabic in Mosul\n- 20+ visits to Egypt, including during Arab Spring\n- Direct experience with youth entrepreneurship in the region\n\n2. Crisis & Resilience Focus\n- Research on post-traumatic growth in entrepreneurship contexts\n- Documented evidence of program success during multiple crises (COVID, Beirut blast, economic challenges)\n- Published insights on resilience-building methodologies\n\n3. Measurement & Impact\n- Supported 950+ entrepreneurs with 4.8 NPS rating\n- Developed assessment tools and monitoring systems\n- Research-backed approach to program design\n\n4. Technical Systems & Frameworks\n- Created Bloom.pm platform for entrepreneur assessment and support\n- Quiz-based system for customized learning journages\n- Experience integrating personal and professional development metrics\n\n5. Language Skills\n- Strong Arabic facilitation capabilities (demonstrated in Mosul)\n- Experience working in Arabic-speaking contexts\n- Additional language skills (French)\n\nQuestions to Further Strengthen Your Application:\n\n1. Can you share specific examples of how you've built funding networks or helped entrepreneurs secure investments? The role emphasizes building \"follow-on funding networks.\"\n\n2. Could you elaborate on your experience with ROTA/Silatech or any other major MENA youth development organizations? This would be relevant for the Egypt Country Office work.\n\n3. Do you have experience developing formal monitoring & evaluation frameworks for large institutions? UNICEF places heavy emphasis on results frameworks.\n\n4. Could you share a specific example of how you've adapted your training methodologies for youth audiences specifically? GenU focuses on youth entrepreneurship.\n\n5. Have you worked on any green skills or sustainability-focused entrepreneurship programs? The role mentions incorporating \"green\" thematic pathways.\n\nFor the cover letter rewrite, I notice a few style elements we could enhance:\n\n1. Structure: Keep paragraphs focused and concise\n2. Tone: Balance professional expertise with passion for youth development\n3. Specificity: Include more concrete numbers and outcomes\n4. Alignment: Directly reference GenU's goals and objectives\n5. Action: Use strong action verbs to describe your achievements\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before I help draft a revised cover letter? That way I can incorporate your additional experiences and make the letter even more compelling.",

My background combines building entrepreneurial ecosystems, developing innovative learning methodologies, and creating scalable support systems - with a particular focus on youth resilience and sustainable development.\n\nCurrently, I'm completing a project with the International Trade Center in Iraq focused on green sustainable housing, where I facilitate workshops in Arabic and support young entrepreneurs in developing environmentally conscious solutions. Previously, I founded Bloom.pm, where we've supported over 950 entrepreneurs across 16 countries using a unique assessment-driven methodology that enables customized learning journeys. Our approach has consistently achieved a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating while demonstrating measurable improvements in entrepreneur resilience and success rates.\n\nMy experience is particularly relevant to GenU's objectives in several key areas:\n\nPortfolio Management & Support Systems: I've developed the Bloom platform that integrates assessment tools, progress tracking, and targeted interventions - enabling program managers to support more entrepreneurs effectively while maintaining personalized attention. This system has been successfully adopted by multiple accelerators through our training-of-trainers programs.\n\nRegional Expertise: Having worked extensively throughout MENA, including Egypt during the Arab Spring and recently in Iraq, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities for youth entrepreneurship in the region. I conduct workshops in Arabic and have deep connections with entrepreneurship support organizations across the ecosystem, including partnerships through the Safir program network.\n\nResearch-Backed Methodology: My master's research at Learning Planet Institute focused on post-traumatic growth in entrepreneurship contexts, leading to evidence-based approaches for building resilience in youth entrepreneurs. This research has informed program designs that demonstrably improve outcomes, particularly in challenging environments.\n\nGreen Skills Integration: Most recently, I've led programs specifically focused on sustainable entrepreneurship, including the HerMeNow accelerator supporting green solutions across MENA and Africa, and ITC's sustainable housing initiative in Iraq. This experience directly aligns with GenU's focus on green thematic pathways.\n\nI am particularly excited about contributing to GenU's mission of youth empowerment through entrepreneurship. My daily rate is $400, with a total project cost of $100,000 (inclusive of travel and expenses). I am available to begin on January 10th, 2025, and am prepared to meet all deliverables as outlined in the Terms of Reference.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience designing resilient entrepreneurship ecosystems can contribute to GenU's vision of nurturing the next generation of innovators.\n\nSincerely,\nBilal Ghalib\nbilal@bloom.pm | +1 (478) 227-2253\n\nWould you like me to help you refine any particular aspects of this letter or prepare additional materials for the application package?",

My background spans founding a social enterprise support organization (Bloom.pm) in Lebanon, serving as a Sustainability Curriculum Consultant for the International Trade Center (ITC) in Iraq, and conducting research into post-traumatic growth and resilience following the Beirut blast.\nThroughout my career, I have focused on helping entrepreneurs discover and express their fullest potential. My approach emphasizes learner-driven methodologies, blending personal growth with actionable business tasks. For instance, I have developed quiz-based assessments that enable participants to self-identify growth areas, receive targeted mentorship, and tap into shared resources. This allows a single trainer or a small team to scale support effectively to large cohorts, a framework that aligns closely with UNICEF’s mission to maximize impact for youth worldwide.\nMoreover, I have a demonstrated record of collaborating with UN agencies, and successfully aligning deliverables through structured reporting, bilateral meetings, and robust communication channels. My extensive work in diverse cultural settings—from Lebanon to Iraq—has honed my ability to adapt rapidly, navigate institutional requirements, and cultivate strong stakeholder relationships.\nKey highlights of my experience include:\nDesigning and managing accelerator programs that served 950+ entrepreneurs, achieving a 4.8 NPS rating.\nImplementing research-driven evaluations, including a study showing enhanced resilience and lower stress levels among participants post-Beirut blast.\nOverseeing the creation of integrated software platforms (Bloom.pm) that support real-time monitoring, track user milestones, and maintain cohesive online communities.\nBuilding funding and partnership networks by connecting various ecosystem players, from private investors to international NGOs.\nShould I be selected, I will bring a results-driven mindset, a passion for youth empowerment, and proven strategic planning skills to the Entrepreneurship Consultant role. My daily rate is currently set at $400, with a total cost for the full assignment at $100,000 (inclusive of travel and other expenses). I am available to begin on January 10th, 2025, and I am prepared to meet all required deliverables punctually and in full alignment with UNICEF’s standards.\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing my expertise to UNICEF’s essential work in nurturing the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators.\n\n\n\nFinancial Proposal\nConsultant Name: Bilal Ghalib\nPosition: Entrepreneurship Consultant\nAssignment Period: January 10, 2025 – December 31, 2025\nDaily Rate: USD 350\nTotal Estimated Days: 90 days\nTotal Lump Sum: USD 31,500\n\nIntroduction\nThis financial proposal outlines the estimated costs for the consultancy assignment as per the Terms of Reference (TOR) provided by UNICEF.

We can note: \"Daily rate is inclusive of standard operational costs (communication, software licenses, etc.).\"\n\nLet's break down the 90 days across deliverables based on the timeline they provided:\n\n```\nJanuary - February 2025 (15 days)\n- Comprehensive mapping report\n- Initial stakeholder engagement\n- System assessment\n\nMarch - April 2025 (20 days)\n- Integrated support system design\n- Portfolio strategy development\n- Portfolio management framework\n\nMay - July 2025 (25 days)\n- Incubation system toolkit\n- Follow-on funding strategy\n- Egypt Country Office model enhancement\n\nAugust - October 2025 (20 days)\n- Knowledge products\n- Capacity building sessions\n- Technical proposals development\n\nNovember - December 2025 (10 days)\n- Webinars/learning events\n- Results framework\n- Final documentation\n```\n\nWould you like me to draft a clean version of the financial proposal incorporating these elements? We can keep it professional and aligned with UN standards while avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\nOne question: Would you prefer to stick with the $350/day rate or should we adjust it given the strategic nature of many deliverables? The current total ($31,500) is at the very bottom of their range ($31,500-$160,500).",

I bring over 15 years of experience designing and implementing youth-focused entrepreneurship programs across the MENA region. My background combines building entrepreneurial ecosystems, developing innovative learning methodologies, and creating scalable support systems, with a focus on youth resilience and sustainable development.\nI recently completed a project with the International Trade Center in Iraq focused on entrepreneurship in green and sustainable housing in a post-conflict setting. I conducted literature reviews, interviews, and framework analysis and developed a heritage innovation curriculum for environmentally conscious housing solutions. Previously, I founded Bloom.pm, where we've supported over 950 entrepreneurs across 16 countries using an assessment-driven methodology that enables customized learning journeys. Our approach has consistently achieved a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating while demonstrating measurable improvements in the resilience and success rates of entrepreneurs.\nMy experience is particularly relevant to GenU's objectives in several key areas:\n**Portfolio Management & Support Systems:** I've developed the Bloom platform, which integrates assessment tools, progress tracking, and targeted interventions. This enables program managers to support larger programs while maintaining personalized attention. Multiple accelerators have successfully adopted this system through our training-of-trainers programs.\n**Regional Expertise:** Having worked extensively throughout MENA, including Egypt and recently in Iraq, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities for youth entrepreneurship in the region. I conduct workshops in Arabic and have deep connections with entrepreneurship support organizations across the ecosystem I’ve been supporting since 2011.\n**Research-Backed Methodology:** My master's research at Learning Planet Institute focused on post-traumatic growth in entrepreneurship contexts, leading to evidence-based approaches for building resilience in youth entrepreneurs. This research has informed program designs that improve outcomes, particularly in challenging environments.\n**Green Skills Integration: **At Bloom, we’ve run many programs focused on sustainable entrepreneurship, including the HerMeNow accelerator supporting green solutions across MENA and Africa. Working with the UN ITC's sustainable housing initiative in Iraq gave me a deeper insight into connecting entrepreneurship and sustainability.

      "content": "Alright. So for mappings systems and development, how would I approach mapping Genu's entrepreneurship initiatives? Well, I'd get some knowledge, and I'd start getting on phone calls I'd, developed my content relationship management, CRM, documents, for the on Airtable, probably. I'll set up a call a Calendly link and schedule and I'll, start reaching out and, you know, of course, like, reading all the documentation and all the paperworks, I don't exactly know what an integrated support system means. So an integrated support system for whom exact Let's see if we can figure that out. Integrated Yeah. Create a support system. Mapping entrepreneurship. Okay. Create a support system. Building an entrepreneurship portfolio strategy, Yeah. So the entrepreneurship portfolio strategy is a great idea, and there's, like, a lot of places for it. For instance, there's stuff that the Learning Planet Institute's doing with the LPI project page and other places and just on the Genu website. I feel like there's gotta be a something between systematizing and making things available, in a database that's queryable through a cumbersome model, but Also, training people to be able to tell their stories, run their Instagrams, share common hashtags, build real dynamic community support. It's like, how do you find things these day? It's actually important to try to create some both structure and flexibility and autonomy for people to be able to do things and to be able to feel like they are part of something greater integrated, harmonized incubation mentorship, and funding support. So integrated support system can be the similar to something around the Bloom platform. You know, we've developed a lot of common assessments, the the Ontracomp, the enterprise, capacity assessment the ECAT that we do, that helps us create a common library of activities and support that's actually probably a really great integrated support system and we've already kind of built a lot of that. And we have a common structure for activities and common tags that span between personal and professional growth and, resilience and flourishing have all of these different assessments that we already use that I can probably, utilize for their, initiatives Android they have different software or different approaches that they wanna take, by all means, but we have our platform ready and available. Workshop capacity building, looking at their scope, training around portfolio management systems. Yeah. So, you know, I know a little bit about HubSpot and also I'm really good at Airtable and, there are I'm not sure exactly what a portfolio management assistant is. Like, we can actually roll our own using software and Airtable so that people can actually update their own content, you know, forms. Just gotta make it really easy for people. And I think it's really important also to have a portfolio that is Trustable and alive and also supports community building. So the idea of if you don't update your stuff once a year, you get removed know, I've been a part of the global entrepreneurship and sorry, the global innovation gathering for a while, and we have a, you know, it's could be as simple as a WordPress and a portfolio thing, but there's a community manager, and so that could be something that I recommend. For them. To have someone that actually keeps tabs on things and sets up regular activities and events virtual things so that people around the world can join and maybe, like, it could be like a lottery there's 1,000,000 or 1,000 of, young entrepreneurs we have a lottery for presenting and maybe we send that lottery out to a 1000 people a month, and we pick 10 people if they respond. And then the people that don't respond we kind of demote their thing to a, like, hiatus page, and then the ones that respond are active, again, and they can update some stats. Maybe they can update if they hired people. They can update their impact and stuff like that. I think that would be great. Funding mechanisms I think, yeah, we need, tag participants by their Claude areas, a lot of funders are interested in different, impact measures and impact causes and it can be a gallery it's the same thing with the portfolio and the funding. You know, the we just need a content management system that has different types of people, investors, startups, and businesses. Mentors, trainers, all sorts of, different roles. And then somehow creating public and, private ways of engaging with things depending on, the investors' interests. And it really depends on the technology platform that they're comfortable with, but I have a lot of experience with things like HubSpot and, Airtable and rolling my own databases and even WordPress but it just has to be as easy as possible for people And in a place where it's really easy for them to Connect. Would I need to learn? Yes. I need to learn a lot more about Image Ventures. I'm some research on them online. I love what they're doing. It seems like they're having amazing and large scale impact. With young people around the world and I'm excited to get connected, but I don't know much about it, but definitely need to do background research I'd love to talk with people and, have, you know, a download. Yeah. So I have my recommendations, and so we can probably you know, develop the same kind of literature review or curriculum review or framework review and find alignments. I always like to find, synonyms and having these kinds of things are we're trying to measure the same real thing, and in the end, we just need to find the synonyms and, agree agree upon them. And there are a lot of standards and the the UNICEF is a part of the EU. Right? I think it is. I'm not sure. If it's not a part of the EU, or the UN, it doesn't matter, but, like, the UN has the, entra comp for the entrepreneurial capacities and there's all sorts of know, 21st century skills and other skill, like, frameworks that we've been trying to align with for ages so we can align with them as well. What questions did I ask about the technical infrastructure? Yeah. Like, what do they use for their databases? I guess is easy knowledge products. If they want these products, Most useful for similar organizations. So Knowledge products. Entrepreneurial, entrepreneurship learnings across different contexts. Yeah. I think best thing to do is to find this closest and most similar context What types of case studies or knowledge products not even sure what that means. Yeah. So you know, like having case studies, I really like ChangeX's model where it shows you, like, the step by step of how to start. So you can think, oh, I wanna start a business and like, here's a package and you you get it and then know, it tells you step 1, step 2, find cofounders, do this, do that, and then they unlock funds along the way. That's really cool. I I really like that. And I feel like the most helpful thing is kinda community and getting online and and connecting and sharing stories and trusting yourself as an entrepreneur and building self efficacy and these types of things that are really internal rather than external And, format for sharing entrepreneurship learning is about different context. Definitely online sessions. And getting people into breakouts 1 on 1 with a person who's 1 step ahead of them, not 10 steps ahead of them, not a mentor who's already, like, managing a giant company, but someone that's just one step ahead of them in the entrepreneurial journey and get them into breakout rooms and online sessions.",

Well, I'd get some knowledge, and I'd start getting on phone calls I'd, developed my content relationship management, CRM, documents, for the on Airtable, probably. I'll set up a call a Calendly link and schedule and I'll, start reaching out and, you know, of course, like, reading all the documentation and all the paperworks, I don't exactly know what an integrated support system means. So an integrated support system for whom exact Let's see if we can figure that out. Integrated Yeah. Create a support system. Mapping entrepreneurship. Okay. Create a support system. Building an entrepreneurship portfolio strategy, Yeah. So the entrepreneurship portfolio strategy is a great idea, and there's, like, a lot of places for it. For instance, there's stuff that the Learning Planet Institute's doing with the LPI project page and other places and just on the Genu website. I feel like there's gotta be a something between systematizing and making things available, in a database that's queryable through a cumbersome model, but Also, training people to be able to tell their stories, run their Instagrams, share common hashtags, build real dynamic community support. It's like, how do you find things these day? It's actually important to try to create some both structure and flexibility and autonomy for people to be able to do things and to be able to feel like they are part of something greater integrated, harmonized incubation mentorship, and funding support. So integrated support system can be the similar to something around the Bloom platform. You know, we've developed a lot of common assessments, the the Ontracomp, the enterprise, capacity assessment the ECAT that we do, that helps us create a common library of activities and support that's actually probably a really great integrated support system and we've already kind of built a lot of that.

            "extracted_content": "Below is a new financial proposal that reflects your structured implementation approach (Phases 1–4), aligns with GenU’s deliverables, and clarifies all associated costs (professional fees, travel, subsistence, insurance, etc.). The proposal also ensures that timelines and outputs match the stated deadlines while integrating sustainability themes throughout.\n\nReasoning Behind This Proposal\nPhase Alignment:\n\nThe timeline is designed to logically progress from Discovery & Integration (Phase 1) to Knowledge Product Co-Creation (Phase 4). Each deliverable builds on previous findings, ensuring an adaptive approach rather than isolated workstreams.\nDaily Rate & Level of Effort:\n\nDrawing from experience and the complexity of tasks (mapping, system development, capacity building, and producing knowledge products), a daily rate of $375 remains competitive yet realistic.\nA total of 90 days is allocated across the year, matching the depth of engagements, facilitation, and iterative feedback loops required.\nCost Breakdown:\n\nProfessional Fees are broken down by deliverable to give GenU a clear view of how each milestone is resourced.\nTravel Costs and Daily Subsistence are projected based on possible site visits (e.g., to Egypt Office) and UNICEF/UN guidelines.\nHealth Insurance is indicated, but as you’re already covered under the French national system, it is not charged to UNICEF.\nAvailability starts in February 2025, enabling immediate focus on early deliverables (mapping and integrated system design).\nSustainability Integration:\n\nGreen entrepreneurship themes are woven into each phase—particularly in the Capacity-Building Program (resilient entrepreneurship, sustainable mentorship models) and the Knowledge Products (green success stories, environmental impact metrics).\nFinancial Proposal & Timeline\n1. Overall Timeline\nPhase\tDates\tKey Outputs\nPhase 1: Discovery & Integration\tFeb – Mar 2025\tMapping Report, Early Engagement with Egypt Office\nPhase 2: System & Framework Dev.\tApr – Jun 2025\tIntegrated Support System Plan, Portfolio Strategy, Incubation Toolkit, Funding Strategy\nPhase 3: Capacity Building Program\tJul – Nov 2025\t4 Workshops, 3 Technical Proposals, Refined Egypt Model\nPhase 4: Knowledge Product Co-Creation\tAug – Dec 2025\t2 Knowledge Products, 3 Webinars, Results Framework\nNote: Some phases overlap to accommodate iterative feedback and schedule adjustments.\n\n2. Deliverables, Estimated Effort & Costs\nBelow is a per-deliverable breakdown, noting how the 90 days are distributed. Each deliverable cost is calculated at a $375/day rate.\n\nDeliverable\tDeadline\tEstimated Days\tSubtotal (USD)\tKey Activities / Notes\n1. Comprehensive Mapping Report (Phase 1)\t15 Feb 2025\t10 days\t$3,750\t- Virtual focus groups & 1:1 interviews\n- Adapted ACAT framework\n- Streamlined data collection\n2.

Portfolio Management Framework (Phase 2)\t22 Apr 2025\t6 days\t$2,250\t- Structure for data tracking & feedback loops\n- M&E integration\n5. Incubation System Toolkit (Phase 2)\t14 May 2025\t6 days\t$2,250\t- Mentorship guidelines, capacity-building templates\n- Personal/professional growth components\n6. Follow-On Funding Strategy (Phase 2)\t12 Jun 2025\t5 days\t$1,875\t- Partnership outreach\n- Green funding opportunities\n- Private/public investor alignment\n7. Refined Egypt CO Model (Phase 3)\t10 Jul 2025\t6 days\t$2,250\t- Align with imaGen Ventures & ROTA/Silatech\n- Local adaptation & stakeholder co-creation\n8. Two Knowledge Products (Phase 4)\t28 Aug 2025\t6 days\t$2,250\t- Youth-led storytelling\n- Sustainability best practices included\n9. Three Technical Proposals (Phase 3)\t19 Sep 2025\t5 days\t$1,875\t- Funding proposals for scaling programs\n- Incorporate sustainability metrics\n10. Four Capacity-Building Sessions (Phase 3)\t24 Oct 2025\t8 days\t$3,000\t- Workshops on resilience, mentorship, portfolio management, M&E\n- Emphasis on green entrepreneurship\n11. Three Webinars (Phase 4)\t18 Nov 2025\t4 days\t$1,500\t- Community of Practice approach\n- Focus on green skills & funding\n12. Results Framework Document (Phase 4)\t31 Dec 2025\t6 days\t$2,250\t- Indicators & tracking tools\n- Aligned with GenU objectives\nTotal Estimated Days: 75 days (above) + 15 days additional buffer for coordination, feedback loops, interim calls, and unexpected tasks = 90 days\nProfessional Fees Total: 90 days x $375/day = $33,750\n\n3. Additional Cost Estimates\nCost Item\tEst. Amount (USD)\tNotes\nTravel & Local Transport\t$3,000\t- Estimated for short visits to Egypt Country Office or regional partner sites (flights + local)\nDSA (Daily Subsistence)\t$2,000\t- In line with UNICEF/UN rates for short in-country stays (hotel/meals incidentals)\nVisa & Related Fees\t$300\t- Potential visa costs for travel to Egypt or other MENA countries\nHealth Insurance\t$0\t- Covered through French national system\nLiving Costs\t$0\t- Not charged to UNICEF; included in daily rate\nTotal Additional Costs: $5,300\n(This can be reimbursed as per UNICEF policies or added to the lump sum, depending on contract terms.)\n\n4. Lump-Sum vs. Reimbursement\nOption A: Lump-Sum Contract\n\n$33,750 (Professional Fees) + $5,300 (Travel & Related) = $39,050 total.\nOption B: Professional Fees + Reimbursable\n\n$33,750 for professional fees (lump sum).\nReimbursement of travel, DSA, and visa costs as per actual expenses (with a ceiling of $5,300).\n5. Proposed Payment Schedule\n20% upon contract signing and submission of detailed work plan (Feb 2025)\n30% upon completion of Mapping & Integrated System deliverables (Apr 2025)\n30% upon delivery of Incubation Toolkit & Refined Egypt Model (Jul 2025)\n20% upon final submission of Knowledge Products, Workshops, Webinars, & Results Framework (Dec 2025)\n6. Availability\nReady to commence work in February 2025, ensuring immediate progress on Phase 1 deliverables (mapping and early engagement with the Egypt office).\nConclusion\nThis financial proposal balances a comprehensive, phased approach (Discovery → Systems → Capacity Building → Knowledge Products) with a clear cost structure. It embeds sustainability in each workshop and deliverable, ensuring GenU’s green pathways are fully integrated.\n\nShould you need a refined timeline, adjusted daily rates, or a different payment schedule, I am open to discussing modifications to best meet UNICEF’s and GenU’s requirements. I look forward to supporting GenU’s vision with an approach that is resilient, collaborative, and impact-driven."
