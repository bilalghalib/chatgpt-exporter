You would put the sale type as a T-shirt and the unit cost is $7. \n\nActivity (30 min):\nDevelop your COGS, and then consider a strategic change that might be able to reduce costs\nStep 1: Calculate COGS for your business.\nStep 2: Identify one strategic tweak (e.g., bulk purchase, green sourcing, supplier negotiation) that could lower costs long-term.\nDiscussion: Where in your production costs can you improve efficiency? Would bulk purchasing, different suppliers, or alternative materials reduce costs?\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration \nGo onto the financial model and show the simple COGS calculation chart. (Old, will remove)\nPoint out areas that can add to your COGS such as delivery, bulk orders, maybe you can add something like product customization, etc…  (Old, will remove)\n\nIf you are not calculating any COGS, feel free to remove these rows altogether.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nwith minimal changes to include the ideas here : \"\"\"BUSINESS EFFICIENCY CHECKLIST\n(5 minutes: Lecture + Discussion)\n\nThe Business Efficiency Workbook helps you identify cost-saving opportunities:\n\n- Categories: Power & Equipment (energy efficiency), Materials & Waste (local sourcing), Water & Utilities (conservation), Transport & Logistics (route optimization), Supply Chain (supplier selection).\n- Benefits: Reduces costs (e.g., energy savings) and environmental impact (e.g., less waste).\n\nActivity (3 min):\n- Open the workbook’s \"Checklist\" and note one cost-related challenge (e.g., high electricity costs in Power & Equipment).\n- Suggest an action to address it (e.g., install solar panels).\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n- Introduce the Business Efficiency Workbook as a comprehensive tool that integrates resource efficiency.\n- Point out that the checklist includes key environmental considerations in categories like:\n  - Power & Equipment (energy efficiency, renewable sources)\n  - Materials & Waste (waste reduction, local sourcing)\n  - Water & Utilities (conservation, renewable sources)\n  - Transport & Logistics (route optimization, low-emission options)\n  - Supply Chain (supplier selection, distance considerations)\n- Demonstrate how the workbook helps identify, prioritize, and implement improvements that benefit both:\n  - Business bottom line (cost reduction, efficiency improvements)\n  - Environmental performance (resource conservation, waste reduction)\nDetailed Facilitator Notes:\n\nObjective: Introduce the Business Efficiency Workbook as a tool to identify cost-saving opportunities, focusing on its \"Checklist\" section, and demonstrate its relevance to cost management and environmental performance.\nPreparation (Before Session):\nEnsure the Business Efficiency Workbook is distributed (already done earlier in the module).\nPrepare a projector or screen to display a screenshot of the workbook’s \"Checklist\" section (e.g., Page 3, Power & Equipment section: \"High electricity costs, frequent outages\").\nReview the categories listed (Power & Equipment, Materials & Waste, etc.) and their link to cost reduction (e.g., energy efficiency saves on utilities).\nHave the Risk Category Worksheet ready to connect risks (e.g., \"Resource Costs\") to checklist challenges.\nFacilitation Steps (5 minutes):\nIntroduction (1 minute):\nSay: “We’ve discussed types of costs, but how do we identify opportunities to reduce them? The Business Efficiency Workbook is a tool to help you do just that. It includes a ‘Checklist’ section to assess your operations and find cost-saving, sustainable solutions.”\nDisplay the screenshot of the \"Checklist\" section, pointing to categories like Power & Equipment and Materials & Waste.\nHighlight Categories and Benefits (2 minutes):\nSay: “The checklist covers key areas like Power & Equipment—think energy efficiency or renewable sources like solar; Materials & Waste, focusing on waste reduction or local sourcing; Water & Utilities for conservation; Transport & Logistics for route optimization; and Supply Chain for better supplier selection.”\nAdd: “Using this tool benefits both your business bottom line—by cutting costs like electricity bills—and the environment, by reducing waste or emissions. For example, addressing ‘high electricity costs’ in Power & Equipment with solar panels can save $80/month while lowering your carbon footprint.”\nActivity (1.5 minutes):\nSay: “Let’s try it. Open your workbook to the ‘Checklist’ section. Pick one category relevant to your costs—say, Power & Equipment—and note a challenge, like ‘high electricity costs.’ Then, suggest an action, such as ‘install solar panels.’ If you’ve filled out the Risk Category Worksheet, check if this matches a ‘Resource Costs’ risk.”\nWalk around to assist, ensuring entrepreneurs write specific challenges and actions (e.g., Transport & Logistics: \"High fuel costs\" → \"Optimize delivery routes\").\nWrap-Up and Transition (30 seconds):\nSay: “The workbook helps you systematically identify and prioritize cost-saving actions. We’ll use these insights to calculate your COGS and other expenses in the next sections.”\nKey Tips for Facilitators:\nUse the screenshot to visually guide entrepreneurs to the right section, ensuring they don’t get lost in the workbook.\nIf time allows, share a quick example: “A bakery noted ‘material waste’ in Materials & Waste and reduced costs by 10% through better inventory tracking.”\nEncourage linking to the Risk Category Worksheet: “If you marked ‘high electricity costs’ as a high-priority risk, this is where you start addressing it.”\nAnticipated Challenges and Solutions:\nChallenge: Entrepreneurs may not know where to start in the checklist.\nSolution: Suggest starting with Power & Equipment, as it’s a common cost area, and use the pre-filled example (e.g., \"frequent outages\").\nChallenge: Some may question the environmental focus.\nSolution: Emphasize dual benefits: “Reducing waste not only helps the planet but also cuts your disposal costs—win-win!”\"\"\"\n\nThe slide has this on it: \"\"\"COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\n Item\nNormal cost \nBulk order price\nBulk order requirement\nDelivery fee (charged on business)\nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\n$5.00\n30\n$2.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nDay Tour\n$90.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n Item\nNormal cost \nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\nDay Tour\n$90.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\"\"\"",

Investors increasingly care about sustainability—they want to see both financial returns and impact.

Could it save money, tap into new markets, or align with your values?”\nPrompt with examples: “A restaurant using local produce might reduce transport costs and appeal to eco-conscious customers. A tech startup could use energy-efficient servers to cut electricity bills.”\nEncourage sharing: “Anyone already doing something green? How does it help your business?”\nHandout and Workbook Link (1 minute):\nSay: “To explore this further, use the ‘Green Ideas Brainstorm’ handout.
