      "content": "Okay, so I'm in a moment where I need to really maybe fix my online presence and persona, and I have some things that I'd like to do, but like my website is so old and I'm not even sure what it says about me, like I feel like it's my kid self online. You can check it out. It's BilalGhalib.com, B-I-L-A-L-G-H-A-L-I-B.com, and I really like some help thinking about, you know, like I don't feel like I can share online, and I'm such a critic, and I don't know if it's a critic in a good way, a healthy way, or a unhealthy way, and you know, I want to be using social media differently and not actually using it quite as much at all, but at the same time I know it's how people connect online, and I know that there's like great uses of it, but I also feel really ashamed to use it during a time of genocide and war, and I feel like the only thing I should be doing is sharing about these problems. I also need work, like you know, I'm like now sort of working on getting new work and contracts, and like I don't feel like my website engenders trust, and I'm just so critical I think of the UN and of everybody, and I think everyone is stupid, and that's not healthy I think, but I don't know what to do instead, and so I need to kind of take this and break it into pieces, and think what are the things that I want to do, what's going to help me, who's going to help me, how do I trust people, how do I love people, and then thinking against, against, against, and saying okay yeah, so let's doubt everything, let's not work on social media, let's go quiet, and maybe it protects me from a lot of things, but also I feel like I'm a loud person, I have a personality and a lot of ideas, and I really want to find a way of getting it out there, and I actually love some people that have been very consistently blogging and showing something, and I think my website shows something very different, so I want to like work on my website, maybe get a haircut, get a new outfit, and then just be more confident in the world, you know, and even if it is confident in my taking a step back from being like, hi, welcome to Pillai TV on social media, I'm going to talk to you, and like actually being who I am, which is like long-form interviewers, and but like why am I sharing if I don't consume, I always feel like this tension here, and so let's, can you help me think step by step, ask me some deep like profound questions, like a professional coach, and therapist, and psychologist, you know me, like look at our chat history, and help me figure out how to do this well, in a way that's sustainable, and I won't just like, oh work on it, work on it, work on it, put up some like stupid blog posts, and then call it done, and then never touch it again, like what, what would Derek Sivers do, and Seth Godin, and other people that I admire, and I don't really, yeah maybe I don't want to share, because I don't admire myself or something, I don't know.",

      "content": "First, nothing about what you wrote sounds weird or broken.  \nYou’re feeling:\n\n- torn between integrity and visibility  \n- disgusted with a lot of what’s happening in the world (and the institutions that fund work)  \n- and at the same time needing to earn money, be findable, and actually *use* your gifts.\n\nThat is a sane reaction to an insane context.\n\nLet me reflect back what I see, then I’ll give you a simple plan and **one** deep question to answer next.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What your current website is saying (that you didn’t intend)\n\nFrom a stranger’s eyes, your site right now: citeturn1view0\n\n**Good signals:**\n\n- “Learning and doing” – nice, modest, curious tagline.  \n- Clear that you co-founded Bloom/Pitchworthy, GEMSI, hackerspaces, etc.  \n- You talk about *hope*, mentoring, entrepreneurship in complex environments.  \n- It feels warm and human (the “Ask for a high five and you shall receive” photo, comments, etc.).\n\n**But… for 2025 Bilal, it also says:**\n\n- **Stuck in time.** The main story is GEMSI + early Bloom; no sense of your current chapter (Islamic psychology, barakanomics, BEIT, Come Alive, Parliaments, etc.).\n- **No clear “this is how you can work with me now.”**  \n  There’s no obvious, “If you’re a UN agency / foundation / org, here’s what I do and what outcomes I deliver.”\n- **Social-first vibe you no longer believe in.** The About page leads with Twitter/FB/Insta handles and embeds your tweets. That’s old-internet Bilal, not slow-web/regenerative Bilal.\n- **Visual tone:** old WordPress template, comments thread – it feels like vintage blogger/hacker era, not “deep, rigorous, 40-year-old systems architect of meaning and learning.”\n\nSo yeah: it *does* feel like your “kid self” online.\n\nThis is fixable, and you don’t need to become “BilalTV” to do it.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Two role models you named – what they actually do\n\n### Derek Sivers citeturn2view0  \n\n- Tiny, ultra-simple site.  \n- Clear “Me in 10 seconds.”  \n- List of what he’s doing now, his books, and how to contact him.  \n- No algorithm, no drama.  \n- He treats writing as a **gifted library for strangers**, not “content strategy.”\n\n### Seth Godin citeturn2view1  \n\n- Short daily reflections, forever.  \n- Consistency over performance.  \n- Very simple blog; everything points to the writing and to clear offers (books, workshops).\n\nWhat they have in common:\n\n- Their sites are **homes**, not billboards.  \n- Their online presence is **an extension of their values**, not a performance.  \n- They have *very clear offers*.\n\nYou already have that in you. You even wrote your own ikigai:\n\n> **“Interrupting urgency with sacred clarity—so goodness can root in truth.”**\n\nYour online presence can just be that, operationalized.\n\n---\n\n## 3. A simple plan (so you don’t burn out then ghost it)\n\nLet’s treat this as three projects:\n\n### Project A – Name your *current chapter*\n\nObjective: a 1–2 sentence description of “this is who I am and what I’m doing *now*.”\n\nRough draft (you’ll refine):\n\n> “I design learning systems and programs that help communities come alive — blending social entrepreneurship, Islamic psychology, and regenerative economics.”\n\nThis doesn’t lock you in forever. It’s just your **2025–27 chapter heading**.\n\n---\n\n### Project B – Design a *quiet, trustworthy* website\n\nThink **Derek Sivers level of simplicity**, but your flavor.\n\n**Pages:**\n\n1. **Home** – 1 screen\n   - Name + current chapter sentence  \n   - 3 bullet outcomes: e.g.\n     - Help organizations design trauma-aware, resilience-building entrepreneurship programs  \n     - Architect learning systems that combine human facilitation + AI in ethical ways  \n     - Explore barakanomics: economic models rooted in beauty, justice, and mercy\n   - One clear CTA: “→ Email me to explore working together.”\n\n2. **Work with me**\n   - 2–3 “offers,” written in plain language:\n     - *Program architect & facilitator* – for UN / NGOs / foundations.  \n     - *Advisor on Islamic / regenerative economics* – for think tanks, networks.  \n     - *Speaker & workshop host* – for conferences, communities.\n   - Each with:\n     - who it’s for  \n     - what changes  \n     - 2–3 past examples (Bloom, BEIT, Nawaya/UNICEF, etc.)\n\n3. **Writing / Notes**\n   - Not a “perfect blog,” just a list of essays / talks / longform posts you’re proud to stand behind.  \n   - Could even be **10 pieces max** you curate and occasionally rotate.\n\n4. **About / Now**\n   - Short biography.  \n   - A “Now” section (like Sivers) – what you’re currently focused on (family, projects, inner work).  \n   - This is where your warmth, history, humor, and story go.\n\nVisually: black text on white, one simple accent color, one recent photo that feels like “grown-up Bilal” not “hyper-extrovert Bilal.”\n\n---\n\n### Project C – Your “speaking policy” (so you can post without shame)\n\nInstead of “should I or shouldn’t I be on social media during genocide,” try:\n\n> **What are my conditions for speaking in public that feel aligned with God, conscience, and reality?**\n\nFor example (you’ll choose your own):\n\n- “I speak online only when it:  \n  1. supports justice or reduces harm,  \n  2. tangibly helps someone (tool, explanation, opportunity), or  \n  3. bears honest witness to something true in my experience.”\n\n- “I don’t post to ‘stay visible’; I post to serve.”\n\n- “I let my website be my quiet home, and social media is just the occasional doorway.”\n\nThat way, when you do share a longform reflection or a link to your work, it’s **part of the same ethic** as speaking about Palestine or other injustices. There’s no separation between “work Bilal” and “moral Bilal.” It’s one heart.\n\n---\n\n## 4. About the inner critic\n\nI don’t want to kill your critic. Your critic:\n\n- protects you from hypocrisy and bullshit  \n- refuses to be a brand in a burning world  \n- insists that your work has to be **real**.\n\nThat’s holy.\n\nThe part that hurts you is when the same critic says, “So you must stay invisible, broke, and silent because nothing is pure enough.”\n\nOur work here is to **aim the critic at the work, not at your existence.**  \nCritic as editor, not executioner.\n\n---\n\n## 5. One deep question for you (answer this next)\n\nImagine we **wipe the internet clean.**\n\nYou get **one single, simple webpage** that will be the *only* way a serious, values-aligned potential collaborator (someone you deeply respect) will ever meet you.\n\nThey’re choosing whether to:\n\n- invite you to co-design a program,  \n- fund your work, or  \n- bring you in to help their community heal and grow.\n\n> **What are the three things you want that person to *know* or *feel* about you when they close that page?**\n\nNot sentences yet – just three *things*.  \n(Examples: “I am rigorous,” “I won’t sell out the people I serve,” “I can hold trauma and still be playful,” etc.)\n\nIf you answer that, we can turn *those three things* into the backbone of your new online presence (and then into the copy, layout, even the haircut / photo vibe).",

      "content": "Okay, I've looked at it. Let me be straight with you: your website is like a house where someone moved out in 2017 but forgot to forward their mail. There are old comments sitting there like junk mail piling up, Twitter handles that might not even exist anymore, and a photo that may or may not be you now. It's not that it's bad - it's that it's frozen in time, and you've clearly moved on.\nBut before we talk about fixing it, I want to ask you something more fundamental:\nWhen you say \"I don't know if I admire myself\" - what would have to be true for you to admire yourself?\nBecause here's what I'm seeing: You've built Bloom, supported 1,000+ entrepreneurs across 16 countries, developed sophisticated curriculum for the UN in active conflict zones, you're creating Cursive which is genuinely thoughtful work, you're a father navigating cross-cultural life in France while staying connected to Iraqi heritage. That's not nothing.\nBut you're telling me:\nYou think everyone is stupid\nYou feel ashamed to use social media during genocide\nYou start things and abandon them\nYou're overly critical\nYou don't trust people\nSo here's my first real question: Is the problem that you don't have achievements worth sharing, or that you can't figure out what the achievement means - like, what story it tells about who you are and what you value?\nBecause \"I helped 1000 entrepreneurs\" is an achievement. But if you can't connect it to a deeper purpose or narrative, it just feels like a bullet point on someone else's LinkedIn.\nThe Derek Sivers types you admire - they're not just sharing what they did. They're sharing their thinking. The process. The contradictions. The questions.\nWhat would happen if you treated your online presence not as a resume, but as your way of thinking out loud about the tensions you're actually living with?\nYeah. So I can't figure out what the achievement means or is worth sharing. I think it's also like a long slow transition from someone who's just, like, into creativity and then got into, like, the development world and then got into, like, all of this SDG stuff and social impacts, and I don't know what. Right? Like, oh, we're gonna go to something important. And I used to just play. Right? Like, look at my website. I had all this cool experimentation, like, and the thing is though, like, even if I was working on that I don't even know if I would let myself do some of that stuff because some of that stuff is potentially dangerous. Like, I was working on sensory substitution things and can you imagine that this kind of stuff is the stuff that turns into You know, Neuralink and a difference between Neuralink to help people that are sick. And then Neuralink, that's just like because we can. You know? Know, there's this this whole thing. It's like, don't just stand there. Do something. And I think for a long time, ever since I got my burnout and post traumatic stress disorder from my time in Iraq witnessing car bombings and Little girl's dying and just losing faith, I guess. Humanity, I, you know, didn't really replace this with anything else. In the beginning, I had this talk I used to give. It's called, like, Stop making stuff and start making sense. Right? And then it was like, Don't change the world. Hold the hands. Right? And I would tell people like, just hug each other in my conferences. And then I got to a point where I started making news. Right? Like, this box of matches that would be about like, meditation. I haven't gotten to, like, spirituality and trying to figure out, like, what's the inside. So this is actually how I transitioned from, like, someone who just was excited about making stuff to someone who's really trying to figure out, like, what life is about. Like, what should we be making And then got really critical about, like, anybody doing anything that doesn't have that, like, deep liquor. Philosophy because not only is it naive. It's like it's dangerous, you know, like, hey, let's Let's see what happens. If we light the snowball on fire, let's see what happens. And you burn the house down. Right? Like, these kids are building social media platforms, and let's see what happens when scales. It's like we're giving people superpowered tools but they're still not even fully myelinated, and it's insane. And I was like that, and I was excited, but shouldn't we let people do that? But, like, now, I've gone through all of that. And I'm also recognizing, like, the importance of Well-being and healing and understanding trauma and trying to appreciate the simple things and learning to drink coffee and not need to change the world to to be important and trying all these things. Right? And think that's why I'm so critical is because I'm so critical of myself. And at some point, I'm like, but also this stuff is so cool. Like, AI, technology, let's make stuff. Like, and then how do we do it to, like, make beautiful stuff? And then I also remember though, when I was a 8 kid, I wrote an essay in high school about the difference that different kinds of pencils gave you the ways of your thinking. And, like, that's profound. And that's why I'm building like Chris' and I'm thinking, like, okay. Well, instead of just complaining, like, what can we do? Know, And I'm not sure I I got it all figured out, but I got, like, my different questions, and I'm trying to figure out my values. And also, I got, like, way more religious, you know, like, not just spiritual. I started to realize, like, wow. I actually believe. And this belief is beautiful and good. And believing I mean, I think it's it's not belief. It's Witnessing the realities within. And I've had these experiences these profound moments of presence and keeping my rational mind along for the ride and listening to Ken Wilbur and understanding the marriage of sense and soul and these challenges and, like, I think I'm trying to bring this all together, but How do I say fun and playful and contribute and make it easy for people to hire me. You know? It's not easy.\n\n\ninvite you to co-design a program,\n\n\nI'm hilarious, i help make progrss by finding beauty and finding ways to access it, i seek deep meaning and will help people feel safe and open to exploring what their gifts are and unfold beauty ",

      "content": "I’m really glad you laid all of that out. It actually hangs together much more coherently than it feels from the inside.\n\nYou didn’t “stop being a playful maker and become a bitter critic.”  \nYou **refused** to keep making powerful tools once you’d seen what unexamined power does to real humans.\n\nThat’s not failure. That’s a moral pivot.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Let me mirror back your arc in one line\n\nFrom what you wrote:\n\n- Early Bilal: “Let’s make stuff! Hackerspaces! Sensory substitution! Everything is possible!”\n- Iraq / bombs / loss → “Stop making stuff, start making sense.”  \n  → Don’t change the world, hold hands.\n- Then: SDGs, development, UN, impact… and a growing awareness that  \n  **“naive doing at scale can be dangerous.”**\n- Now: deeply spiritual, actually religious, with lived experiences of presence;  \n  Ken Wilber, sense & soul; Islamic psychology; barakanomics; Come Alive; Cursive.  \n  You’re asking:  \n  > *“What should we be making? And how do we make it beautiful and not harmful?”*\n\nSo you’re not “just critical.” You’re someone who:\n\n> Has seen what happens when you give unintegrated humans super-tools,  \n> and is now trying to design **gentle, beautiful tools** that grow the human first.\n\nThat’s a completely legit identity to build a website around.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Your three things (cleaned up into “pillars”)\n\nYou ended with:\n\n> *“I'm hilarious, I help make progress by finding beauty and finding ways to access it, I seek deep meaning and will help people feel safe and open to exploring what their gifts are and unfold beauty.”*\n\nIf we turn that into three things a serious collaborator should **feel** when they close your site, I’d phrase them as:\n\n1. **“He’s disarming and funny.”**  \n   Being with you lightens the nervous system; people laugh and can breathe.\n\n2. **“He finds real pathways to beauty in messy, constrained reality.”**  \n   You’re not utopian. You make progress in very non-ideal conditions (Iraq, Lebanon, UN systems) *without* losing beauty.\n\n3. **“I would feel safe going deep with this person.”**  \n   You’re trauma-aware, spiritually grounded, and curious about people’s gifts. Being around you helps people open.\n\nThose are not fluffy traits. They’re the spine of how you work.\n\nLet’s turn that into actual website words.\n\n---\n\n## 3. A first draft of your “one page that matters”\n\nImagine you wipe bilalghalib.com and replace it with this single page. (You don’t have to yet; this gives us clay to work with.)\n\n---\n\n**Headline:**\n\n> **Bilal Ghalib**  \n> Interrupting urgency with sacred clarity — so goodness can root in truth.\n\n**Subheadline:**\n\n> I help people in hard places design learning and entrepreneurship programs that are trauma-aware, spiritually grounded, and actually fun.\n\n---\n\n### What I do now\n\nI work with organizations who care about both **impact** and **inner life**:\n\n- **Program architect & facilitator**  \n  Designing and running social entrepreneurship and wellbeing programs in contexts of conflict, displacement, and transition.\n\n- **Learning systems designer**  \n  Blending human facilitation with careful use of technology (including AI) to support reflection, peer support, and long-term growth.\n\n- **Speaker / co-designer for regenerative futures**  \n  Exploring Islamic economics (“barakanomics”), trauma and post-traumatic growth, and what it means to build tools that are beautiful, not extractive.\n\nIf you want to co-design a program, curriculum, or experimental prototype that honors *both* people’s nervous systems and their agency, I’m a good person to talk to.\n\n> **→ Email me if you’re thinking: “We need to do this in a way that doesn’t burn people out or betray our values.”**\n\n---\n\n### How I got here (the short version)\n\nI started as a **playful maker**.\n\nHackerspaces, sensory substitution experiments, early social media projects — I loved giving people tools and watching what they created.\n\nThen I spent years in **Iraq and across MENA**, helping build communities of makers and social entrepreneurs. I saw car bombs, kids dying, systems failing. I saw how technology and “innovation” can amplify harm when we move fast without knowing what we’re doing.\n\nThat’s when my work shifted from:\n\n> “Let’s make cool stuff”  \n> **to**  \n> “Stop making stuff, start making sense.”\n\nI began focusing on:\n\n- **Holding hands instead of “changing the world.”**\n- Asking: *What are we actually doing to people’s nervous systems, families, and souls?*\n- Bringing humor and play into rooms where there’s a lot of grief and pressure.\n\nOver time, my own inner life caught up. I stopped calling it “just” spirituality and recognized it as **faith**. Islam became less of an identity and more of a witnessing — of mercy, order, beauty inside the chaos.\n\nNow my work lives at that intersection:\n\n> maker culture × social entrepreneurship × trauma awareness × Islamic / regenerative philosophy × a lot of laughter.\n\n---\n\n### What it’s like to work with me\n\nPeople who work with me usually say some version of:\n\n- **“This felt surprisingly safe.”**  \n  We make room for grief, ambiguity, and doubt while still moving forward.\n\n- **“We laughed more than we expected.”**  \n  Humor isn’t a performance; it’s how we keep our nervous systems online in hard work.\n\n- **“You helped us name the thing underneath the thing.”**  \n  I’m good at finding the deep tensions and values beneath a program, and designing around those so the work has integrity.\n\nIf you invite me into your project, I will:\n\n- take your people’s wellbeing seriously  \n- challenge lazy, harmful assumptions (including my own)  \n- help you build something that feels true to who you are supposed to be serving.\n\n---\n\nThat’s the kind of page that would already be way closer to the current you than the frozen-in-time WordPress about page with old social links and random comments. citeturn0view0  \n\nYou can feel how it holds **both**: seriousness about harm **and** your playful, beauty-seeking side.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How this answers your “fun + hireable” tension\n\n- It **doesn’t hide** your spiritual / philosophical depth. It foregrounds it as an asset.\n- It **names** your critique of naive tech and impact, but in a way that makes you *more* trustworthy to UN / NGOs / funders who are worried about burn-out and backlash.\n- It gives a **clear path to hire you**: co-design programs, learning systems, and spaces.\n\nThis is much closer to “Derek Sivers but Bilal-flavored” than to “Bilal TV content machine.”\n\nWe can later shape this into:\n\n- a bare-bones homepage  \n- a simple “Work with me” page (pulling those offers into more detail)  \n- maybe a “Now / Writing” page.\n\nBut even if all you did was put a cleaned-up version of the above as your About/Now, it would already turn your site from “kid moved out, mail piling up” into “oh, okay, someone lives here and is thinking deeply.”\n\n---\n\n## 5. One question to sit with next\n\nI’ll keep to your “one deep question at a time” preference.\n\n> **If a future collaborator read that draft page, what part would feel like a lie or an over-claim to you?**\n\nNot what feels “too vulnerable” or “too weird” — specifically:  \n**what feels like it overstates your solidity, your clarity, or your availability right now?**\n\nYour answer to *that* will tell us where your self-admiration gap actually is, and we can adjust both the words and the reality in small, honest ways.",

      "content": "Okay, so I didn't stop being a playful critic and then error-facted my mark in one line, is that even possible? Um, yeah, you know, like, I feel like my life is so scattered in so many ways because, for whatever reason, you know, maybe I need to distinguish between, like, my innate, natural curiosity and expansion and all that, and, like, maybe my innate aim of doing too much, and I'm not sure how to figure that out so I can kind of stay with it. So, for instance, I have a, you know, I had a screen printing company, and then I was like, yeah, creativity and art and music, and I just got everyone that I knew to, you know, basically quit their day jobs and try to start this business with me. And then I was into, like, I've learned something, I find it so amazing, and I want everyone to know what I'm learning, and I share it. And so I was starting to build things, and I was doing this laser cutter because I wanted to build something to, I had this, like, profound high school insight that, you know, warfare is, like, the base of all human endeavor, and then even our games are about war, and I wanted to make a giant chess set and put it into the center of the city for people to, quote-unquote, play war in public and create, like, this interactive sculpture. And I think I had, like, a part of me when I was young that just wanted to be famous and, like, do some stuff and be, you know, like, important, you know? I think maybe that's something related to my parents or something probably very common for a lot of kids is, like, weird and interesting. Yeah, I think I had this interest in being weak. Early Bilal. So that's a lot of early Bilal stuff. And then... Mid-stage Bilal. I was doing, what is this? Yeah, I took that momentum, that energy, that creativity and started realizing the beauty of community and, like, doing things together and learning and growing and, yeah, so that was really nice. And then it took me out, and I was like, yeah, let's connect it with the Middle East, and I definitely cared about that. I did care about God when I was younger, for sure. It was an important part of my journey. And then I had, like, this difficulty with women, right? And, like, God, this is my love life. And I just had a lot of difficulty with finding a partner that I felt like my parents could accept. And then that turned into, like, a big crisis moment in my life where things exploded, right? Like, I didn't want to leave Ann Arbor. I wanted to be there, and I wanted to, like, grow there and do things. And then I had this moment where, like, I just couldn't because this woman broke up with me, and I felt like my parents were always judging me and wanted me to be something that I wasn't. And I couldn't figure out how to be in my family, and so I wound up sort of leaving, in a way. Not officially, but I started just working more and more in the Middle East, and now I hardly even go home, I think. You know, I wind up staying out a lot, and I live in France now. But, you know, like, that healing moment, I think, is super important for me because I was just, like, in love, and I wanted to share beauty and joy and goodness and connect people and all of this. And then my life kind of exploded when this girl broke up with me. And when that happened, I started to realize, like, I needed to figure out if God was real and what I actually believed, and I've always had this kind of serious bent. And also, as a kid, I was always kind of alone, and I just didn't really have this connection much with people. I just was one by one, you know, and that was good for me. I didn't really like connecting so much with a ton of people at the same time. I was bullied. I was a big nerd, and people didn't really like me so much, and I didn't like them. I liked them one at a time and not in groups. And so I wound up, you know, I think always just wanting to be alone. I think maybe that still continues to this day where we're talking about this process of why don't I like to engage and connect so much with people. You know, maybe it is that I'm connected to this initial habit or tendency of mine to not necessarily, you know, jump all in. Not really my thing, I think, quite often. Yeah, being bullied for being smart, and so I think I just was like, okay, I'll just be smarter and smarter and smarter or something like that. And yeah, I think after all of that, I also just like never wanted to play in people's systems. Even as a young kid, I think most of us just didn't fit into the systems, and so I was like, okay, fine, I'll do it my way. And, you know, I don't like sports, I don't watch soccer, I don't watch football, but it also makes me feel like an outsider. So I try to create my own communities of nerds and people that like build things and hackerspaces and naked spaces. But even then, I don't think I really figured out how to be a part of something. And this wound around religion and God had been pretty big for some time, but thankfully, after a long time, I think also I had this deep love of nature. And I think the deep love of nature transformed into something that became my connection again with God. So I'm now in a place where, you know, I have my Sufi teacher, he's from Zambia, you know, I get to drink with him just as often as I'd like. But just feeling confident in my religion, and I found a person, my partner, my wife, who's on this journey with me. And it's just so cool to not have these multiple personalities anymore, just being who I am. And like today, we're fasting together and praying together, and it's just a really beautiful thing. So I'm realizing that I actually really believe in this religion. It has goodness in it. And that's why I'm doing this psychology thing. I'm realizing, yeah, even there, that it's a real proof that I think of having someone to judge. And yeah, what else did you say? Three things. Yeah, and I think also, just being funny is both good and bad. I think a part of it is, you know, I think it's just me, like as a kid, wanting to fit in and be okay and safe. It's just a constant opportunity for people to see if they're okay. So if I make them laugh, then obviously they're okay. I did that with my family, et cetera. Okay, so that's all that. That's what else did you say? Charming and funny. First draft of the book. Yeah, so that's like a lot of the inner, behind the scenes stuff that I think could be interesting for you all to know. But yeah, I just try to take my life, smash it all together, and make it, I think, make it real. How does this become something that I can share? Maybe that's where a lot of this sharing comes from, actually. It's like, okay, I want to feel safe in the world, so I need to have someone to judge me. And accept me as good ",

      "content": "Yeah, this all makes a lot of sense.\n\nYou’re not “too scattered” in some random way – I hear a very consistent *person* who kept changing environments and tools, but not essence.\n\nLet me mirror that back first, then give you one concrete way this *can* turn into something shareable, and end with one deep question.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The threads that run through all your chapters\n\nFrom what you just shared, I see at least three long threads:\n\n### 1️⃣ “I won’t be ruled by stupid systems”\n\n- Bullied → “fine, I’ll just get smarter than all of you.”  \n- Don’t like sports / mainstream culture → create your own nerd/hacker spaces.  \n- Don’t want to play in corporate / UN / tech-bro systems → insist on doing it your own way.\n\nUnderneath “I think everyone is stupid” there’s a more tender thing:\n\n> “I don’t trust the systems that shaped them, and I don’t want to be swallowed by those systems myself.”\n\nThat’s not arrogance. That’s self-protection plus discernment.\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ “I want a safe, holy place to be myself”\n\n- As a kid: one-to-one connections, not groups.  \n- As an adult: build your own communities where the weird, sensitive kids can belong.  \n- Leaving home after the breakup + family judgment → self-exile, living between worlds (Ann Arbor / Middle East / France).  \n- Deep love of nature → becomes doorway back to God.  \n- Now: Sufi teacher, partner who shares your path, praying and fasting together, *one* coherent Bilal instead of split identities.\n\nSo much of what you do (hackerspaces, Bloom, Cursive, Come Alive) is really:\n\n> “Let’s build spaces where people like me aren’t humiliated for caring, thinking, or feeling too much.”\n\nThat’s a beautiful thing to say out loud on a website.\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ “I need a trustworthy judge”\n\nYou ended with:\n\n> “I want to feel safe in the world, so I need to have someone to judge me and accept me as good.”\n\nI hear this all over your story:\n\n- Early desire to be “famous / important” → wanting the world to say, “You’re good.”  \n- Family conflict, love crisis → “I need to know if God is real and what He thinks of me.”  \n- Now: a Sufi teacher you trust, and a wife on the same path → humans who can reflect your goodness back.\n\nYour critic goes wild when the only judges are:\n\n- Algorithms  \n- Crowds you don’t trust  \n- Institutions you suspect are complicit in harm\n\nOf course you don’t want social media to be your court. It’s a trash courtroom.\n\nThe shift you’re in now is:\n\n> From “random people on the internet as judge”  \n> to “God / nature / trusted few as judge”  \n> and letting your online presence be *evidence in that case*, not the courtroom itself.\n\nThat’s why you study Islamic psychology, barakanomics, healing: you’re trying to line the outside up with what this inner Judge would actually approve of.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Curiosity vs “doing too much”\n\nYou asked how to distinguish those.\n\nFrom what you described:\n\n- **Pure curiosity** looks like that high-school essay about pencils, or you geeking out about how tools shape thinking — slow, deep, not necessarily recruiting anyone.\n- **“Doing too much”** shows up when the *safety / judge* part jumps in:\n  - “This screen printing thing is amazing → everyone quit your job, join me!”  \n  - “This new insight is so important → I *must* get everyone to know it.”\n\nOne is about **exploring**.  \nThe other is about **proving** (to family, world, God, yourself) that you are good, useful, worth keeping.\n\nSo practically:\n\n- Website version of “too much”:  \n  “Here’s everything I’ve ever done, plus 9 initiatives, plus 7 calls to action.”\n\n- Website version of pure curiosity / integrity:  \n  “Here is the kind of work I’m actually called to do now, and a few glimpses into how I think.”\n\nWe want the second one.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How does this become something you can share?\n\nHere’s one very concrete way to turn what you wrote into an “About” story that is honest and hireable.\n\nThink of it as **three acts**, each organized around a *question* rather than a job title.\n\n### Act I – *“What can we make?”*\n\nEarly Bilal:\n\n- Screen printing company, music, art, laser-cut chess sets in public squares.  \n- Wanted to be seen, to be “interesting and important,” but also to create playful public reflections on violence and systems.  \n- Maker energy, trying to turn strange insights into shared experiences.\n\n**One website paragraph:**\n\n> I started as a maker. Screen printing, music, public art, hackerspaces. I wanted to turn strange questions (“Why are our games all about war?”) into things people could touch — like a giant chess set in the city, “playing war” in public.\n\n---\n\n### Act II – *“What should we make?”*\n\nMid Bilal:\n\n- Take that energy into community: hackerspaces, GEMSI, Bloom, connecting to Middle East.  \n- Witnessing bombs, death, burnout, naive “change the world” rhetoric.  \n- Personal heartbreak + family tension pushes you into exile and deeper spiritual seeking.\n\n**One paragraph:**\n\n> Then I started to see the cost of unexamined “innovation.” In Iraq and across MENA I saw bombs, grief, and systems that didn’t care if people’s souls were disintegrating as long as the metrics looked good. At the same time my own life broke open — heartbreak, leaving home, wrestling with family and faith. I shifted from “let’s make cool stuff” to “stop making stuff, start making sense.”\n\n---\n\n### Act III – *“How do we make it beautiful and safe?”*\n\nNow Bilal:\n\n- Sufi path, integrated faith, partner on same journey.  \n- Islamic psychology, barakanomics, Come Alive, Cursive.  \n- Humor as nervous system care; one-to-one safety as design principle.  \n- Deep suspicion of extractive tech, but still a maker: designing new tools and programs that are trauma-aware, spiritually grounded.\n\n**One paragraph:**\n\n> These days I’m trying to build in a different register. I’m rooted more openly in Islam, walking a Sufi path, and designing programs and tools that care about people’s nervous systems and souls as much as their KPIs. I still love technology and creativity, but I want them in service of mercy and beauty. That’s why I work on things like trauma-aware entrepreneurship programs, Islamic psychology, barakanomics, and tools like Cursive — ways for people to think and grow without being devoured by the machine.\n\n---\n\nYou can feel how *that* is shareable. It’s not oversharing; it’s coherent. And it gives clear context for why your offers now look the way they do.\n\nIt also lets your humor land properly: not “funny guy so you’ll like me,” but “funny guy who uses laughter to keep us safe enough to do real work.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. One question to sit with next\n\nKeeping to your “one deep question at a time” preference:\n\n> **If your Sufi teacher said, “Make a website that is a truthful *witness* of your life so far, not a performance,” what would *have* to be on it — and what would you be relieved to leave out?**\n\nNot in full sentences yet if that’s too much — you can just list:\n\n- Must include: …  \n- Okay to leave out (for now): …\n\nYour answer to that will help us decide what actually belongs on bilalghalib.com in this next chapter, and what can stay as private history, side projects, or raw notes.",

      "content": "Yeah, and I think the thing that I'm struggling with right now is the answers that I'm having to the question of, like, what is a good life, what is healing, what is the right thing to do next, and all of that, these days, seem to be coming in through the Muslim tradition very clearly, right? And I'm thinking, like, oh, okay, well, does that mean that I should just do Muslim stuff with only Muslim people and forget everyone else? What is my life about? Bridge-building. And I'm not sure, like, part of me sort of wants to go, move to Spain and Andalusia, be with the Muslim community that I love, where I studied permaculture, and, you know, like, I'm not a scholar, and I'm kind of old, I'm not going to be able to catch up and become a scholar or anything like that, but, like, what do I do with the life that I have? And, yeah, maybe the question that I should be asking is, like, what is the Muslim way to live, right? What is the real way to think about my rizq? If I really believe that my rizq was mektoub, and, like, it's all written, I don't really need to think about, like, my job as much in the same way. I need to be more, yeah, like, thinking differently about all this. So, I'm thinking, you know, if it's mektoub, my rizq, then my money, things that I'm going to be receiving in life, then maybe I don't need to worry about work. I should be thinking, okay, well, why did God make me this way? I mean, you see, look at my conversations. It's about, like, everything. Ontology, to foraging, to mushrooms, to psychedelics, to very, very broad. And what is the authentic interest that is, like, really for me, and isn't the response? And, like, even that thing about me as a child, like, being a loner, and not really liking other kids, is that real, or is that a response? Like, if I was in a different environment, would I have thrived with socializing? Or is that really a part of me? And if that's a part of me, what am I supposed to do with that part of me? Like, how do I give from that or with that, you know? I'm just not sure.",

      "content": "I’m really glad you brought this here, because you’re not asking a “branding” question anymore, you’re asking a **vocation** question:\n\n> If my answers are coming through Islam now…  \n> what kind of *life* does that actually call me to live?\n\n…and then underneath:\n\n- Do I belong only with Muslims now, or am I still a bridge?  \n- If rizq is written, how much should I worry about work?  \n- Which parts of me are “me” and which are trauma responses?  \n- What do I do with being a loner who also wants to give?\n\nLet me reflect back a few things and then give you **one focused exercise + one deep question**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Your path is *narrowing*, not shrinking\n\nIt sounds like:\n\n- Earlier: “What is a good life?” = a very wide search (ontology, mushrooms, psychedelics, foraging, hackerspaces, SDGs, impact, etc.).\n- Now: a *lot* of your clarity is arriving through the Muslim tradition – Qur’an, Sufi teacher, Islamic psychology – in a way that feels *real* and grounded.\n\nThat doesn’t mean:\n\n> “Oh I guess I become a full-time Muslim-community-only person.”\n\nIt might mean:\n\n> “This is the lens through which I read the whole world now.”\n\nThe Prophet ﷺ lived *from* revelation and *among* all kinds of people. The question isn’t “Muslims only or everyone,” the question is:\n\n> **From which well do I drink, and for whom do I carry water?**\n\nYou already *are* a bridge:  \nIraqi / American / French  \ntech / soul  \nUN systems / sufi zawiya  \nloner / facilitator.\n\nThe fact that Islam is giving you the clearest answers right now doesn’t mean you shut the bridge. It means you’re finally standing on one bank instead of dangling in the middle.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rizq as a nervous-system intervention\n\nYou’re absolutely right: if you *really* believe your rizq is written, your relationship to hustle changes.\n\nBut “I don’t need to worry about work” can split into two very different inner states:\n\n1. **Trustful spaciousness:**  \n   “My provision is written; my job is to walk with ihsan and to use the gifts I’ve been given.”  \n2. **Avoidant collapse:**  \n   “Since it’s written, I can ignore my financial reality and stay vague forever.”\n\nFrom how you speak, I don’t hear laziness. I hear **scrambled responsibility**:\n\n- You feel responsible for *everything* (genocide, tech ethics, SDGs, the UN’s stupidity, the whole internet).  \n- So of course one part of you wants to say “screw work, it’s all written” just to get some relief.  \n\nA more Muslim framing might be:\n\n> “My *share* is written.  \n> My *amanah* (trust) is how I respond to what I’ve been given.”\n\nYour amanah looks like:\n\n- a mind that goes from ontology to mushrooms in 0.2 seconds  \n- a history in conflict / trauma / entrepreneurship  \n- a very real love of God and nature  \n- an ease with depth and 1:1 safety.\n\nRizq lets you **drop panic**.  \nAmanah asks: *with this particular mix I’ve been given, what is a fitting offering?*\n\nThe website / work question is really:  \n*What is a fitting offering for this soul in this season?*\n\n---\n\n## 3. “Is this me, or my wound?”\n\nYou asked if your being-a-loner is real, or just a response to bullying / not fitting in.\n\nShort answer: it’s **both**.\n\n- There’s almost certainly a temperamental part of you that likes depth, slowness, one-to-one, not big crowds.  \n- And that part got shaped and defended by bullying, judgment, feeling like an outsider.\n\nYou don’t need a pure origin story to work with it. You can treat it like:\n\n> “I am someone who does their best work in small, honest, safe constellations…  \n> and some of that is nature, some is scar tissue, and all of it is the material God actually gave me to work with.”\n\nSo your question becomes:\n\n> **Given that I’m like this, how do I *give* from here instead of fighting it or hiding it?**\n\nFor your work, that suggests:\n\n- intimate cohorts, not mass audiences  \n- deep partnership projects, not solo broadcasting  \n- long-form writing / audio, not short viral clips  \n- smaller “rooms” where you can hold safety and depth, not huge spectacle.\n\nWhich, honestly, fits everything you described about what you *actually* enjoy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. A tiny, concrete exercise (to sort “fitrah” from “response”)\n\nHere’s something you can do in 10–20 minutes, maybe as an audio note if writing feels heavy:\n\n**Step 1 – Last 12 months only.**  \nList **3 specific moments** where you felt:\n\n- “This is me. I’m in the right place, doing the right kind of thing.”\n\nTiny or big, doesn’t matter. A conversation, a class, a walk, a session with your teacher, a piece of curriculum that clicked, whatever.\n\nFor each moment, note:\n\n- Who was there (alone, 1–1, small group, big group)?  \n- What were you actually *doing* (teaching, listening, designing, praying, foraging…)?  \n- What did your body feel like (settled, buzzing, tender, open, etc.)?\n\n**Step 2 – Look for patterns.**\n\n- Are you usually **in nature or online**?  \n- **Speaking, listening, or co-thinking?**  \n- Is Islam **explicitly in the foreground**, or is it quietly in the background as your inner stance?  \n- Is it **Muslims only, or mixed**?\n\nThose 3 moments are your best current clues to:\n\n- what is authentically yours (fitrah), and  \n- what kinds of giving feel non-harmful and alive.\n\n---\n\n## 5. One deep question for right now\n\nSticking to one question at a time:\n\n> **If you imagine yourself 10 years from now, still firmly on this Muslim path, what is one way you’d love to be *of service* that feels completely natural to you — the kind of thing where you’d think, “Of course, this is where I ended up”?**\n\nDon’t overthink it or make it noble. Let it be specific and a bit ordinary:\n\n- “I’m the person people call when…”  \n- “I host a small circle where we…”  \n- “I design X kind of thing for Y kind of people…”\n\nAnswering that will give us a directional arrow.  \nFrom there, we can shape both your work choices *and* your online presence so they support that trajectory, instead of you trying to be everything everywhere.",
