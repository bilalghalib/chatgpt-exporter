How are you doing today? \nToday, we will talk all about financing alternatives! We are coming to the end of the incubator and you will soon be working towards launching your business. In today’s session, we will look at your business and think through all the ways startups typically secure financing.\n1\n\nUnderstand typical startup financing options.\nIdentify local financing alternatives that you can use.\nCreate an alternate post-incubation go to market strategy.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nUnderstand typical startup financing options.\nIdentify local financing alternatives that you can use.\nCreate an alternate post-incubation go to market strategy.\n\n2\n\nProduct development\nOperational support\nMarketing\nFINANCE WHAT?\n3-5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Why do startups need to be financed?\nPotential answers:\nHelp them grow faster\nGo to market faster\nHelp with product development \nPay for marketing and operational costs before turning a profit\nEtc…\nRecap: It might seem really obvious, but financing can be really important for startups. Although there are ways to start without being financed, when you have extra cash, you can go to the market much faster helping you to secure your place in the market. \n\nAsk: So how can you pay for these things? \nPotential answers:\nDebt: Borrowing money that will be repaid.\nEquity: Raising money by selling shares or a part of your business equity represents ownership of your business.\nOther funding: There are also other sources of funding such as grants, pitch competitions, etc… \nNo funding: You can grow organically without the use of any funds. Or you can invest your own money into the business. This is also known as bootstrapping. \n\n3\n\nDEBT VS EQUITY\nDEBT\nEQUITY\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nStart a conversation around the 2 primary sources of financing, debt and equity.\nWrite all the answers on the whiteboard with debt on one side and equity on the other side.\nAsk a few questions to get a healthy discussion going: \nAsk: What do you know about debt and equity? Which is better?\nNeither of them are inherently “good” or “bad”. They have their pros and cons and are better or worse for a startup in different situations. Both of them:\nAre ways to finance your business\nProvide cash to start up or grow and scale\nCan pay for salaries, operating costs, startup costs, product development, and more.\n\nAsk: Why is debt good/bad?\nYou keep full ownership of the business- good\nNeed to pay all the money back (with interest)- bad\nIf you face cash flow issues, you can spiral into a worse situation. Banks often take collateral when you take out a loan and if you can’t pay it back they might take your house, car, or something else. - bad\nThere are usually no obligations after you pay the lender back. You can simply move on from them. - good\n\nAsk: Why is equity good/bad?\nBy choosing to finance through equity, you are choosing to share ownership (and profit) of your business\nBy selling a part of your business, you now give someone who might help you to make business decisions. It all depends on the agreement and match between you and the other person, but often times investors might:\nConsult or mentor you, \nBe a part of the decision making process,\nStay silent and just wait for returns,\nShare their network, knowledge, and experience with you,\nEtc…\nYou don’t usually have to pay back funds because investors expect distant returns -good\nThere is no one way that an investment works. It all depends on the agreement you make with the investor. You must agree on terms and find the right partner to support you based on your needs.\n\nTrainer note: Make sure to bring up debt/equity in the context of your location and the current situation (you might need to research this before the session)\n\n4\n\nPartners\nEQUITY\nAngel Investors\nVenture Capital\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nAs we mentioned on the previous slide, one of the most common ways to start a business is to sell a part of your business. Again, business equity represents ownership. When someone invests in your business, you don’t have to repay them directly because they are buying ownership and will likely take a share of the profits. Again it will all depend on the details of your term sheet, but that is typically how it works.  \n\nAsk: What are the most common ways to sell equity? In what situations can you sell equity (also known as “selling ownership” or “selling shares”) of your business in the context we are in here? Go into the pros and cons of each option.\nOpen the conversation to discuss the current situation you are in. Make sure to cover these 3 points as well:\nPartner: One way to get capital or support in the form of resources and support is to find a business partner or co-founder. This person might invest cash, resources, and be involved in the day to day running of the business. They might take a salary, but they might not. This person will be highly involved; therefore, they should be as passionate about the business and invested in its long term success as much as you are. It is common for tech businesses to have a co-founder with a tech/coding background. \nInvestment can range in the amount. Oftentimes there is a degree of sweat equity that is provided by the partner. This is the value you put into the business in other non-financial ways. Maybe you are working for free in your business for example. Your time is valuable and should be calculated.\nYou might be able to find these partners through connections and networking events. Be careful and take your time with this to ensure the right match!\nNetworking is key. You might find these partners through:\n- Connections and networking events.\n- Startup communities.\n\n\nAngel investors:  Angels invest in startups with high growth potential. Angels are usually localized and want to “give back” to the community. Angels typically step in to provide funding for companies that have exhausted any friend and family investments or personal savings they may have been able to access, and before investment from VCs. There are benefits of mentorship, connections, and sector specific knowledge (among other things). They may be more involved than venture capitalists and help startups refine financial strategies. Angels are usually willing to help more than VCs. \nUsually invest between $25-100k. Can be more or less though.\nYou can find angel investors through local angel networks, other entrepreneurs (especially if they have been funded), or other connections.  \nYou should build a relationship with the investor to get them onboard. Make them believe in you as the founder and inspire them with your vision. \n\nVenture capital: Venture capital funds typically finance startups with long term growth potential. These funds usually come from investment banks or venture capital firms. To get venture capital, you need to show real traction and have secured customers. Venture capital firms might focus on something in particular such as an industry or startup stage for example. \nUsually invest $1-5 million, but can be much more ($100 million for example). Sometimes they will do less than $1 million, but this is less common.  \nThis is the hardest type of funding to secure.\nIt is hard to apply to, and it is hard to get approved as well.\nThere is a more formal due diligence process which includes pitches, business plans, interviews, and more. \nSome VC firms focus on startups that have a focus on financial sustainability through supply chain efficiency and or energy use because they see these as lower-risk, higher-return investments and align on values.\n5\n\nSales \nPromotion\nBusiness loans\nMicroloans\nDEBT\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAnother one of the most common ways to raise money is by taking out a loan. We mentioned the pros and cons of this before, but now we will talk about how to actually take out a loan here. \n\nAsk: What are ways that you can take out a loan here?\nBusiness loans: You can take out business loans through banks. The trainer should do research and share some specific examples with the entrepreneurs. \nMicro loans: Some institutions offer microloans (usually $2-6K in Iraq) to new or small businesses. The trainer should do research and share some specific examples with the entrepreneurs.\n\nTransition: You can also borrow from friends, family, and other people. This is usually a smaller amount of money because it is from an unofficial source. This is usually safe, but if you take out loans with people you don’t know well, they might take collateral for what they lend you. \n\n6\n\nFRIENDS, FAMILY, AND FOOLS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nOne way that entrepreneurs start their business is by asking everyone they know for support. This support can be in the form of advice, resources, money, and more.  As you start, don’t be afraid to ask anyone/everyone for help. Your family and friends are a great starting point. \nAsk: Why do you think that is?\nThey love you and want to support you\nThey are easier to convince because they might not look at the idea like an investor or bank would\nThey have watched you develop your idea over time and really believes in it like you do\nThese people will give you money and resources for all different reasons and motivations.\n\nReturns to Friends, family and fools:\nBecause this group is pretty informal, they can give you money in the form of debt (money to be repaid later), equity (they might want a share of your business), or as a gift (no need to repay in any way). Be careful when giving equity to friends and family! There are cases where this works out fine, but going into business with family can be hard and often has negative parts to it.\nAsk: Can anyone see why going into business with friends and family oftentimes goes bad?\nPotential answers:\nYou are stuck with your family! It is not easy to break ties if something goes wrong. Other members of the family might get involved and make it worse\nMix between personal and business life could get overwhelming (always talking about business)\nIt can be difficult to say hard (but often necessary) things to family members or friends\nIt can become unprofessional at times due to the fact that your relationship comes first\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\nSales \nPromotion\nBOOTSTRAPPING\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAnother one of the most common ways to secure funding from your business is “bootstrapping”. Bootstrapping a startup means starting lean and without the help of outside capital. It means continuing to fuel growth internally from cash produced by revenues from the business. Many large businesses start out bootstrapping. It can be hard, but if you really believe in your business, you can make it happen on your own. As you show the market need and real traction, you might be able to take outside investment. Remember, all the options we mentioned so far will expect to see evidence that this is not just an idea, but rather a good investment. \nAsk: How can you begin to bootstrap? \nUse existing resources to invest in your own business\nUse personal finances/savings to invest in your business\nUse operating revenues to reinvest into your business\nGet another job to pay for it (maybe not the best thing to tell the entrepreneurs, but it is an option)\n\nAsk: What are some of the pros and cons of bootstrapping?\nSlow process and might not be able to generate enough revenues\nYou can keep 100% ownership of the business\nSlow growth\n\n8\n\nOTHER FINANCING\n10-15 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAfter doing some research, share funding opportunities available to entrepreneurs in your region.\n\nDiscussion: Did you know that some organizations provide grants or funding opportunities for businesses that focus on improving their operations and long-term sustainability?\nThese funds may come from:\n Government programs\n Financial institution\n Private organizations or investors\n\nThe trainers in the room will probably have some ideas as well so make sure to give them an opportunity to share!\nGo over points such as:\nOrganization name\nFunding range\nApplication process\nTimeline \nEtc…\nIf there are not funding opportunities that you are aware of, share information of organizations that normally fund startups with their typical funding amount and process. \n\nTrainer note: The trainer should research different business and micro loan options available to entrepreneurs in addition to various funding opportunities. Share information about interest rates, requirements, and what the process usually entails. You can share this information with them as a handout in addition to discussing it in the training.\n\n9\n\nWHAT DO THEY WANT?\nOR\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nRemember, these people/organizations all have a motive. Nobody is just giving out money because they feel like it. Therefore, when speaking to these people/organizations, make sure you think about why they are giving money out. In order to make a good deal (or get accepted for the grant/loan), make sure that you know what the other person wants! If you know what they want, you can negotiate better with them. Make sure that you know what the other person wants. To get them to accept your business, you should communicate in a way that is tailored to their needs. Don’t lie, just know the right points to highlight. You can use some of the skills and techniques we learned in the negotiation session here!\nAsk: What do you remember from last week on how to get them to accept you? What are the things that you should consider? \nHow much money are they able to give?\nHow much involvement do they want?\nDay to day involvement\nMonthly updates\nBroader decision making abilities\nSilent relationship\nEtc…\nWhat do they value?\nFinancial returns\nCreating jobs\nSupporting vulnerable people\nThe environment?\nLooking “good” (people who do things just for their ego)\n10\n\nYour Target\n$0\nNo financial limit\nWhat will you do if you don’t win?\nFINANCING STRATEGY\n0$\n1M$\n55 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\n3-5 minutes: Lecture \nYou should be prepared to go to the market with or without seed funding. You have spent the past few months with us developing your product, you have begun to make strategic partnerships, and many of you have begun to make sales! This is amazing. You all have the capability to leave this incubator and continue to make strides on your business.  \nYour Target: Right now, you should have a very clear strategy on how much money you need and what you would use it for. You are all ready to pitch for this amount and have a detailed plan to actually go to market. \n$0: The reality is that there is a strong possibility that you won’t get seed funding from Five One Labs. On Demo Day, we will announce three winners and the rest of you will leave with nothing (it seems harsh, but they should understand the reality). We are here to support you no matter what and help you find funding; however, if you don’t prove to us, investors, or other organizations that your business is feasible and that you have a high likelihood of success, you might not get funded the amount that you need (or at all). That is very much possible. So, what is your plan if you don’t get any seed funding? I want to see that you believe in your idea. If you truly think it will work, you will make it happen even if you have no money in your pocket. \nNo financial limit: What if there was no limit for you? What if there was someone who could invest $1,000,000 into your business? How would you be prepared to deal with this? Although it is important to consider the realities of getting a smaller amount of seed funding, you should be so confident in your business that you could pitch for $100s of thousands of dollars. Big pitch competitions often start with asks around $250k and can go up much more than that. Money is easy to come by; however, great ideas with great founders to implement the ideas are much harder to find. \n\n50 minutes: Activity:\n30 minutes: Individual work:\nTake 30 minutes to write out your financing strategy for each of these options. \nWhat will you do if you get no money at all? How will you go to market?\nHow will you adapt your strategy if you have the opportunity to pitch for all the money you would need to launch?\n\n10-20 minutes: Share: \nGo around the for and have each person share their $0 and $1M strategies\nAllow the cohort to provide feedback to each person (in addition to the trainers feedback).\nMake sure entrepreneurs are really thinking about how they would start with no money. This will be the case for most of them!\n\n\n\nConsider all of your financing opportunities and formalize your strategy to actually launch your business. \nDefine your $0 and $1,000,000,000 strategies\nContinue working on your pitch and business plans!\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS:\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n13]]]"

Slide 9 (\"OTHER FINANCING\") is where you've left space to incorporate information about special funding opportunities, which would be the perfect place to integrate green funding options.\n\n## Suggested Improvements Based on Client Request\n\nThe client specifically requested: \"Consider mapping if there are any available special funds or other incentives targeted for 'green' businesses in the area.\" Here's how I'd recommend enhancing your slides:\n\n### 1. Expand Slide 9 (\"OTHER FINANCING\")\n\nAdd a dedicated section on green financing options that includes:\n\n- **Green Funds & Grants**: Identify specific funds in Iraq/region that support environmentally sustainable businesses\n- **Climate Finance Initiatives**: Any programs from international organizations operating locally\n- **Green Business Incentives**: Tax breaks, subsidies, or other government incentives for sustainable business practices\n\n### 2. Add to Slide 10 (\"WHAT DO THEY WANT?\")\n\nInclude a specific callout about green investors' motivations:\n- Green investors often look for both financial returns AND environmental impact\n- They may have specific metrics they track (carbon reduction, water conservation, etc.)\n- They might require reporting on environmental outcomes alongside financial performance\n\n### 3. New Content for Slide 8 (Enhancing \"OTHER FINANCING\")\n\nI recommend adding this content to slide 9:\n\n**Green Funding Opportunities:**\n- **International Climate Funds**: Organizations like the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility, or UNDP's climate programs often have funding windows for businesses addressing climate challenges in the MENA region\n- **Regional Green Accelerators**: Several accelerators in the region prioritize businesses with sustainability components\n- **Energy Efficiency Grants**: Some institutions offer favorable financing terms for businesses implementing energy-efficient technologies\n- **Circular Economy Innovation Funds**: Funding for businesses focused on waste reduction, recycling, or resource recovery\n\n**Why Green Funding?**\n- Often offers more favorable terms than traditional financing\n- May include technical assistance alongside funding\n- Growing rapidly as a funding category worldwide\n- Can position your business for additional sustainability-focused investments\n\n### 4. Create a Simple Green Funding Worksheet\n\nConsider creating a one-page handout that entrepreneurs can use to:\n- Assess if their business has \"green\" elements that could qualify for special funding\n- List specific green funding opportunities in Iraq with contact information\n- Outline application requirements and timelines\n\n## Iraqi Context\n\nFor maximum relevance, you'll need to research specific green funding opportunities in Iraq. Some starting points could be:\n\n1. The International Solar Alliance (which is mentioned in the Green Business Booklet)\n2. UNDP Iraq's environmental programs\n3. Regional sustainable development initiatives\n4. Any government incentives for energy efficiency or renewable energy adoption\n\nThe Green Business Booklet mentions on page 20 that entrepreneurs should \"find out about these schemes and take advantage of them!\" - so providing concrete local information would be extremely valuable.\n\n## Integration with Business Efficiency Workbook\n\nLooking at the Business Efficiency Workbook, I notice it already includes space for \"Potential funding sources? Green grants, Investors, etc?\" in the Business Efficiency Plan tab. This suggests there's already a framework for entrepreneurs to consider green funding as part of their efficiency improvements.\n\nConsider creating a connection between your financing session and this workbook, perhaps by:\n1. Referencing the workbook during your session\n2. Using similar terminology for consistency\n3. Encouraging entrepreneurs to note potential green financing options directly in their efficiency plans\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific suggestions for any part of this assessment?",

I added all the green funds earlier: [[[5 minutes: Lecture + discussion Remember, these people/organizations all have a motive. Nobody is just giving out money because they feel like it. Therefore, when speaking to these people/organizations, make sure you think about why they are giving money out. In order to make a good deal (or get accepted for the grant/loan), make sure that you know what the other person wants! If you know what they want, you can negotiate better with them. Make sure that you know what the other person wants. To get them to accept your business, you should communicate in a way that is tailored to their needs. Don’t lie, just know the right points to highlight. You can use some of the skills and techniques we learned in the negotiation session here! Ask: What do you remember from last week on how to get them to accept you? What are the things that you should consider? How much money are they able to give? How much involvement do they want? Day to day involvement Monthly updates Broader decision making abilities Silent relationship Etc… What do they value?

We will spend this session breaking down the different types of costs and forecasting those like we did for your revenues. \n\nAsk: Why is it important to have a clear picture of your costs before you start your business?\nPotential answers could be:\nEven if you are making sales and your situation is good, if you can’t control your costs, your profitability or cash flow could be ruined. \nIt is necessary for planning. If you want to hit a certain number of sales, you should think about what you need to do to actually make those sales (and what you need to spend). \nBy laying out your costs, you can think more strategically about new systems or techniques to lower them (maybe through partnerships or new and innovative systems)\n\nProfit and loss\n  Revenue model\n  Cost model\n\nBalance sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nRecap: Last we worked on the revenue model. This week we will work on developing your cost model. After these 2 parts are finished, you will have finished your Profit and Loss statement. Remember, that just because we finished the session and you do the assignment, that doesn’t mean we won’t see this again. As you develop your business strategy and clarify your product and go to market strategy, run numbers on here. You want to keep this updated as you progress with your business. Right now there are a lot of estimations, but as you clarify your business model, these financials will become more and more accurate.\n\nSTRATEGIC EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS\nInvestment\nInitial Cost\nEfficiency Benefit\nCost Reduction\nSolar Panels\n$3,000\nLower electricity bills\n$80/month\nLED Lighting\n$500\nEnergy savings & lower maintenance\n$20/month\nWater Systems\n$800\nReduced water costs & conservation\n$25/month\n[[need speaker notes]]\n\nTYPES OF COSTS\n5-10 minutes: Discussion + lecture\nAsk: From what you understand, what are the different types of costs? Can someone give me a few examples \nWrite all answers on the whiteboard or Jamboard. \nGroup answers so that you get categories for COGS, salaries, and SG&A (you can have other groups if necessary). \nPotential Answer\nEntrepreneurs will give a variety of answers, write them all down.\nGroup their answers to highlight the costs below:\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS): Direct costs of producing an item sold by a company (e.g., materials, direct labor).\nSalaries: Team and staff payments (if directly tied to production, might be COGS).\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A): Indirect costs like rent, marketing, and overhead.\nConsider your costs strategically, they represent what you care about and communicate that to your customers:\nCosts reflect values: Do you prioritize efficiency, quality, or resilience?\nEfficiencies save money over time: Smart investments (e.g., longer-lasting materials, reducing waste, energy-efficient choices) can lower costs long-term.\nExample: Switching to LED lights may have an upfront cost but reduces long-term electricity expenses.\nActivity Prompt (Discussion 5-10 min):\nWhat costs matter most to your business?\nHow could aligning with values help manage risks and costs?\nExample: If your priority is operational efficiency, would bulk ordering, material choices, or equipment upgrades help lower costs over time?\nGroup responses into COGS, Salaries, SG&A as before.\n1 minute: Transition\nToday, we will talk in more detail about COGS, Salaries, and SG&A.  These are these are key categories in your profit and loss statement.\nNext week we will go deeper in your start up costs, including capital expenditure vs. operating expenditure..\n\n6\n\nCOGS\n40 minutes: Lecture, brainstorm, demonstration (this includes hidden slides 7-11)\n\nThe first thing we will go over are the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Again COGS are the direct costs of producing an item sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the product itself. \nSo for example, if you sell T-shirts, you need to calculate the cost of actually producing that item. Whether you are buying it from someone else, or producing it from scratch, these costs have to be accounted for.\n\n\n30 minutes: Brainstorm \nWe will do two examples together on the board (a very simple example and a complex one).\nThe entrepreneurs should lead the conversation and figure out how to calculate the unit economics of the examples (the price of one scoop of ice cream for example) \nThe hidden slides 7-10 are for trainers to go deeper on how to facilitate the discussion for each part of the COGS calculation (keep in mind that the slides are animated so might have a few layers of information).\n\n5 minutes: Example 1 (simple)\nHow do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business? – slide 7\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). \nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell\nAsk: What if you don’t sell ice cream by the tub, you sell it by the scoop?\nAnswer: We need to figure out how many scoops are in 1 tub of ice cream, then divide. \nLet’s say there are 100 scoops of ice cream in a tub\n$10/100 scoops = $1 per scoop\n\n5 minutes Example 2 (advanced): \nThat was easy right? What if you don’t know the price of a tub of ice cream? – Slides 7-11\nAsk: What would you do to calculate the cost of 1 scoop?\nGo through a detailed example of calculating the costs of something from scratch. In hidden slides 7-11 we go through how to calculate the price of 1 scoop of ice cream. The general layout is as follows:\nIdentify what goes into making the item (identify all the supplies/ingredients) –Slide 8\nIdentify the price of everything you buy (that goes into what you are making) – Slide 8\nFigure out how much of each ingredient you use (what you buy vs what you use) – Slides 8 & 9 \nLink unit cost to sales – Slide 10 & 11\n\n10-15 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \n7\n\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nItem\nNormal cost \nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\nDay Tour\n$90.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\nItem\nNormal cost \nBulk order price\nBulk order requirement\nDelivery fee (charged on business)\nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\n$5.00\n30\n$2.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nDay Tour\n$90.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + demonstration\n\nCalculating COGS can be simple or highly complex depending on the product.\nA basic approach: Make a simple chart to highlight how much each unit costs your business.\n\nSimple examples:\nExample: How do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business?\nGive background info on business:\nA tub of ice cream costs $9 from your supplier.\nLabeling adds $1 per tub.\nTotal COGS per tub: $10.\nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell \n\nAnother example: A t-shirt costs you $5 +$2 delivery cost. You would put the sale type as a T-shirt and the unit cost is $7. \n\nActivity (30 min):\nDevelop your COGS, and then consider a strategic change that might be able to reduce costs\nStep 1: Calculate COGS for your business.\nStep 2: Identify one strategic tweak (e.g., bulk purchase, green sourcing, supplier negotiation) that could lower costs long-term.\nDiscussion: Where in your production costs can you improve efficiency? Would bulk purchasing, different suppliers, or alternative materials reduce costs?\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration \nGo onto the financial model and show the simple COGS calculation chart. (Old, will remove)\nPoint out areas that can add to your COGS such as delivery, bulk orders, maybe you can add something like product customization, etc…  (Old, will remove)\n\nIf you are not calculating any COGS, feel free to remove these rows altogether.\n\n\n8\n\n We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurement used when making the product)\nPrice\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n(10-15 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nLet’s take the example of an ice cream shop.\nAsk: We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream. There are several ways to do this, so lets think about how we want to approach this.\nHave a discussion on the board to see if the class can figure out how to determine how much a tub of ice cream costs, or even one ice cream cone. Guide the entrepreneurs to calculate this on the whiteboard before showing them the answer.\nManage the flow of the discussion to cover the following points:\nTo make it easier, first let’s see how much it would cost us to make a tub of ice cream. You would never make 1 scoop of ice cream, you make a large amount and then sell the scoops individually. So lets say that in our tub of ice cream, there are 100 scoops.\nFirst figure out the ingredients you need to make this tub of ice cream. Write down all of the ingredients you would need to make ice cream on the white board (it is ok to estimate). \nPotential answers could be:\nSugar\nMilk\nSalt\nOreos\nEtc….\nWhen you buy this ingredient, how much do your buy (1 kilo, 1 package, 100 pieces, etc…). Write that down next to the ingredient itself.\nHow much did you pay for the ingredients? Write that down as well so you can calculate how much you actually spend\nTransition to next slide: Great, the first steps are done, now what do we do? \n\nNote to trainer: We are not ice cream experts, so we are going to stay simple for now. If this was really a business we are working on, we would need to calculate the real costs and know the real ingredients. This is just a simple example so we are making some things up.\nIt is ok, if the group comes up with a different answer from the example shown. \n\n9\n\nBut I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! \nI won’t have accurate costs estimates!\n  COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurment used when making the product)\nPrice\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\n800\n$2.56\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\n5\n$4.00\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\n10\n$1.25\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\n5\n$1.56\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\n20\n$3.00\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\n0.5\n$0.30\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\n$     -\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n100\n$12.00\n(5-10 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6 \n\nSome entrepreneurs might point out “But I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! I won’t have accurate cost estimates!”. Make sure to explain how to accurately calculate COGS considering the fact that they won’t use all of their ingredients.\nMake sure when you write out the quantity you are buying, you convert it to the measurements that you will use when making the ice cream. For example, you buy 1 Kilo of sugar, but you cook with cups, so write it out as 5 cups as well (as you can see in the image). \nThe next step is to write down how much of the ingredient you use to make a tub of ice cream. From all that information, you can find the amount you spend on just the ingredients you use. This means you can use the rest of your ingredients and not miscount your costs.\nIf each tub has about 100 scoops, you can divide the tub price by 100 to get the cost per scoop.\nNow you know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream!\n\nTransition: \nAsk: What do you guys think is the next step? Now that we know how much 1 scoop of ice cream, what do we use that information for?\nWe need to see how much we are spending month to month to produce the ice-cream that we are selling\nMultiply price per scoop by the number of ice cream sales. \nThis is what is known as a variable cost. \n\n\n10\n\n# of ice cream scoops produced\nCALCULATING VARIABLE COSTS\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY \nFEBRUARY\nBranded T-Shirt\n20\nIce cream scoop\n300\n315\nSweet drink\n300\n315\n(10 minutes: Discussion) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nAsk: What do you guys know about variable costs? Have the class share what they know on the topic.\nPotential answers: \nThere are fixed costs and variable costs. \nFixed costs stay the same month to month. Variable costs change.\nIf you produce more, it costs you more. \n\nAsk: If it costs us $.25 for one scoop of ice cream, and we sell 300 scoops in January, how much are the Ice cream related COGS in January?\nAnswer: $74\nAs we increase our ice cream sales, we also increase the COGS related to ice cream.\nIn the financial model, you should link your sales with COGS to calculate your variable costs.\n\n\nAsk: What other things can be variable in your business?\nPotential answers: \nDelivery of your item (each item sold needs to be delivered- you can link this to sales as in COGS calculation)\nDirect labor for your product/service (if not paid a salary)\nIf you offer something (like a gift) with every purchase\nTransportation\nAdvertising\nEtc…\n\nQuestion that might come up: \nHow do we forecast variable costs that aren’t linked to sales?\nWe will approach variable costs in 2 ways. \nWe will link costs to sales. As sales grow, some of your variable costs grow with them\nFor the items that are variable that we can’t link to sales and easily forecast. We are going to estimate how much we would want to spend on those items. For example, although advertising can be variable (you can spend as much as you want on it), we are going to treat it like a fixed cost and set a budget for ourselves and not spend over that amount. \n\n11\n\nCALCULATING COGS\nTOTAL COGS\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nIce Cream Costs\n74\n78\n82\n86\nT-Shirt Costs\n-\n240\n-\n240\nSweet Drink Costs\n834\n876\n919\n965\nTotal COGS\n$74\n$318\n$82\n$326\n(3 minutes: Lecture + demonstration) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nCalculating the actual costs shown on P&L:\nNow based on the unit price of an item, and the amount old, you can easily calculate the actual COGS. \nThis is broken down month to month and can also be broken down product to product.\nThe more detailed you are in your work, the more detailed and accurate the results will be.\nThe COGS will generate automatically into your P&L if you don’t add or remove rows. \nIf you add/remove rows, make sure to look at the formulas to ensure they add up correctly.\nThe trainer can show exactly how this works by doing it on the actual Google sheet.\n12\n\nGross Profit = Revenues - COGS\nGROSS PROFIT\n2018A\n2019A\n2020A\n2021E\n2022E\nREVENUES\nSales\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 120,000\n$ 200,000\nServices\n$ 20,000\n$ 40,000\nOther Income\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 140,000\n$ 240,000\nCOGS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,400\n$ 8,820\n$ 9,261\n$ 9,724\nGROSS PROFIT\n$ 19,000\n$ 36,000\n$ 71,180\n$ 130,739\n$ 230,276\nEXPENSES\nSG&A\n$ 12,000\n$ 12,600\n$ 13,230\n$ 13,892\n$ 14,586\nSalaries\n$ 15,000\n$ 15,750\n$ 16,538\n$ 17,364\n$ 18,233\nOther expenses\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL EXPENSES\n$ 35,000\n$ 36,750\n$ 38,588\n$ 40,517\n$ 42,543\nPROFIT/LOSS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,250\n$ 41,413\n$ 99,483\n$ 197,457\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nTo place us back onto the P&L, let’s see where we are and what we have done so far.\nGo through the P&L statement up until Gross profit\nWe have talked about our revenues. Here we can see how our different revenue streams are highlighted. \nNext, we want to calculate our COGS. We have just learned how to do that.\nNext, we have gross profit. Gross profit is the money that a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products, or the costs associated with providing its services. This means your total revenues – COGS.\nQuiz the group and ask something like:\nIf you made $1,000 selling hats and your hats cost you $200 to make and deliver to your customer, what is your gross profit? \nAnswer: $800\n\nAsk: How many of you need to calculate COGS in one way or another?\nSome people might raise their hands, others might not. \nCOGS won’t be relevant for everyone. In reality, your COGS are only one type of expense. In the next slides, we are going to take a look at how to calculate the other parts (which will be relevant for everyone). \n\nRecap: You need to calculate the COGS for your business (if relevant) in order to get an accurate picture of your expenses, you should understand the unit economics of your business. This is how much it costs you to produce 1 unit of whatever it is that you are selling. \n\n\n\n\n13\n\nSALARIES\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm + discussion\n\n3 minutes: Lecture\nAs you mentioned previously, another cost that we need to consider are staff salaries. Your team is an essential part of your business, but they can often be costly. You need to evaluate who should be on your team, when to hire them, and how much you need to pay them! These are strategic questions because you usually need staff to create and sell your product, but you don’t want to hire unnecessary people. You can use the finance tool to help plan when the best time to hire employees are. \n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\nWe will do an example together on the board and then I will show you how to apply it on your cost assumptions tab of the financial model.\nThe brainstorm/explanation should be done on a whiteboard or Jamboard. \n\nExample:  Calculating salaries\nAsk: What is the best way to approach figuring out our costs related to salaries?\nStep 1: Figure out who you need to hire\nSome things are obvious. You already know who to hire\nLook at your sales forecast. Who do you need to actually reach that target? Don’t hire someone until you need them\nFind interns and students who could volunteer instead of hiring someone\nTake more responsibilities on yourself\nNote to trainer: We will go over hiring in more detail in the LEAD sessions\nStep 2: Estimate their salary\n\nStep 3: Figure out when you want to hire and how many people\n\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \nPoints to bring up include:\nAs entrepreneurs are answering that question, show them these parts of the model:\nBlue: The job title of the person you need. \nOrange: The salaries for each person. Make sure you write your own salary as well. Put a number that you actually deserve (what is your worth?)!\nMonth to month in orange: The number of that particular employee you will hire for that given month (for example, 1 CEO, 2 interns, etc…). If your salary is too high, remember you don’t have to pay yourself at the beginning or you can take half of your salary (type in .5 in the month to month box – shown in the first row of the second picture under October and November). \n\n\n\n14\n\nPRACTICE\n\nAdd your employees into your financial model!\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n2 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work on their own model and input information for their salaries. \nWe will not apply the COGS directly because it does not relate to everyone, but this is a good time for them to apply some of the new knowledge onto their business.\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nSet the timer for 8-10 minutes and let entrepreneurs work on their model.\nThe trainer should go around to answer any questions or help when needed. \nTrainers should make sure to point out if they want to hire someone who might not be necessary at this point. You can suggest to hire them maybe in year 2 or 3 (show them on the model how that would work)\n\n\n\nSELLING, \u000bGENERAL, & ADMINISTRATIVE\n15 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nHave a brief discussion on selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&A). These are costs that are not directly related to production or salaries but are essential for business operations.\nOk, so we are clear on COGS and salaries, now what about all of your other costs? Where do they go? \nWe will put all of your other costs (except for startup costs) under SG&A.\nThe SG&A category can encompass all of your other expenses that we haven’t accounted for yet. \nAsk: What are the other expenses that are left that we still need to account for?\nPotential answers can be:\nRent\nOverhead (ongoing expenses of operating your business)\nAdvertising\nSupplies\nLawyer fees\nAccountant\nUtility Costs\nResource Efficiency Savings\nWorkspace efficiency\nOperational tools to reduce costs over time.\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDemonstrate how the finance tool works:\nCategories: You have already mentioned a few of the categories that can be listed in here. These can be larger categories broken down into specific expenses. For example, you can see that I have advertising listed here. Instead of just saying $160 will be spent on advertising, you want to think about how you will actually advertise. Think about where your customers are and how you can best reach them. In this case I chose Facebook promotions, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and printed materials. You should think of every expense you will need to pay out over the coming years and write it out. \nMonth to month expenses: You can highlight how much you plan on spending every month for each category. Take a look at your sales targets per month and consider how much you would have to spend to get there. Be as realistic as possible. \nFor example, If you spend $100 on a Facebook advertisement, how many views will that generate? How many people typically look at an ad before converting into a sale? If you are only spending a small amount of money on 1 form of advertising, don’t expect a ton of sales! \nYoY growth: The year over year (YoY) growth box allows you to set a standard growth rate for your expenses. You should assume that you will be spending more on expenses every year because of the rise in prices or because you are spending more as you grow. You can choose to use this method or not depending on the situation of that expense item. \nResource Efficiency Discussion: \nWhen planning utilities or operational costs, think about potential resource efficiency measures. For example, you might spend $2,000 on an LED retrofit and reduce your monthly electricity bill from $300 to $200, which pays back in under two years\nKey Example: If you invest $2,000 in energy efficiency upgrades and save $100 monthly, that’s $1,200 annual savings—a 60% ROI in the first year alone.\n\nQuestions that might come up:\nAre these fixed or variable costs?\nSome of them are fixed and some of them are variable. Things like rent are fixed all the time. Maybe there is a price increase, but for the most part you know that it will be the same month to month.\nFor some of the others such as advertising, meeting expenses, and so on, these are variable, but if you plan ahead and budget for them, you can treat them as a fixed cost. You can say that you will only spend $100 on _____ per month or something like that. Remember that we want to plan as accurately as possible. \n\n.\n16\n\nPROFIT AND LOSS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nYEAR 3\nSALES\nProducts\n26,276\n72,604\n127,752\nSubscriptions\n6,364\n11,428\n20,523\nTOTAL SALES:\n$ 46,965\n$ 84,032\n$ 148,276\nEXPENSES\nCOGS\n17,333\n29,635\n49,097\nSalaries\n19,700\n49,000\n92,400\nSG&A\n8,820\n12,945\n13,166\nTOTAL EXPENSES:\n$45,853\n$91,580\n$154,663\nNET INCOME:\n$2,622\n$7,548\n$6,387\n5 minutes: Demonstration + discussion\n\nStay on the financial model and show the profit and loss summary tab.\nFinally, now that all the costs are accounted for, you can see the completed P&L.\nShow how it is all linked to that one page. \nIf you look at the P&L summary tab, you can see all your information at a very high level. Again, these numbers should automatically generate for you based on the totals generated from your detailed P&L statement (which are generated from your assumptions). Just make sure that all of the calculations and formulas add up in the detailed profit and loss tab.\n\nAsk: What can you learn from this tab? How can you use the information here to be a better manager?\nPotential answers:\nThis tab can be very insightful for you or anyone else evaluating your financials. \nGet a very clear summary of all the details of where you are doing well and where you are suffering. \nYou can see if your costs/revenues are super high or low. \nFor example, salaries are posing a big problem here. They are so expensive and are growing fast!\nYou can easily see if there is an error somewhere on your financials on this page, you know where to go to solve it or fix the formula\nYou can see your growth and profitability over time. Are you being realistic? Are you over or undervaluing yourself? \nWhen you start to really track information, this can be helpful to help you know where to cut costs or be more efficient. \nIf these numbers are interesting enough, an investor might ask how you plan on doing it, which could lead to a longer conversation with them\nAlternatively, an investor might look at them and be turned off right away.\n\n\n17\n\nPRACTICE\n\nHow can you make this business more profitable?\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nBreak the room into small groups of 3-5 people\nAllow entrepreneurs to go somewhere comfortable to work as a group\nEvery group will get an example P&L statement to work on as a group (Old, will remove)\nThe P&L statement will not be profitable (Old, will remove)\nEvery group will receive an example Profit & Loss (P&L) statement that is not profitable.\nEach group needs to evaluate the statement and make it profitable.

How are you doing today? \nToday, we will talk all about your business plan. Up to this point, you thought everything through and you are starting to actually start your businesses! The business plan is a chance for you to put all of the most important information in one place.  \n1\n\nUnderstand what should be included in a business plan.\nReview examples of great business plans.\nBegin to create your business plan.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nUnderstand what should be included in a business plan.\nReview examples of great business plans.\nBegin to create your business plan.\n2\n\nBUSINESS PLAN\n20-30 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What do you guys know about business plans? Why is it useful to have one?\n Show stakeholders that you have a clear strategy and plan for long-term success.\n Demonstrate that your business idea is viable and has a strong market foundation.\n Detail an effective implementation strategy, ensuring sustainability in business operations (in terms of longevity and adaptability, not just environmental aspects).\n Help you think through the different parts of your business\n Provide more detail to your pitch\n Highlights several points in detail:\nBusiness overview\nMarket research\nOperational plan\nTeam\nFinancials\n\n[[Original Ask: What do you guys know about business plans?

What are the things that you should show to prove that you have the best idea out there?\nHave the entrepreneurs explain what they think is most important.\nTry to write out the flow of an entire business plan based on what they say.\nAfter, go through the next slides to touch on the points they missed or go deeper on the important elements. \n\n Ask: If your business has a unique angle—like solving a community problem or cutting costs—how could that strengthen your plan? \n\nRecap: A business plan is just like your pitch in the sense that it tells a story about why your business is a good bet. After pitching or getting some interest from an investor/granting organization, they might ask you for more information. Depending on the person, they might ask for a meeting or for a copy of your business plan. This business plan is your chance to show your professionalism and to dive into the details of your action plan. Many people think of a business plan as a long boring document that nobody looks at (which some people still do), but the business plan has evolved over time. It is detailed, but avoids unnecessary content. The main thing to show is where your business has been, where it is going, and how you plan on getting there.\nClassical: \nLong 50 page documents that nobody reads. \nTo many unnecessary details. \nQuantity over quality. \nBlack and white, text heavy, boring.\nModern: \nThere has been a shift to either pitch decks or short comprehensive plans. \nThese business plans are action oriented and interesting for the reader. \nQuality over quantity.\nRepresents your brand, highly visual, interesting.\n\n2 minutes: Transition\nAll of those points are correct, what we will do now is cover some of the key elements that should be included in a business plan. None of this is new, throughout the incubator you have already done this! Now it is about putting it together on one clean document! We will go over the points briefly, then we will spend the rest of the session working on them. You can follow along on your business plan template we sent you.\n\n3\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWhere you are now\nHow you plan on getting there\nWhere you want to be\nExecutive summary 3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe executive summary is the first thing in a business plan, but the very last thing you write. After you write out the whole business plan, you pull out the most important information and create a one page teaser document. This will highlight all of the important points you want to make in a brief overview.  It explains:\nWhere you are now: Why do you do what you do? Why are you here? What is the problem you have identified and what is the solution (your product/service)?\nWhere you want to be: What is the end result you are looking to achieve? What is the long-term impact and growth potential of your business?\nHow you plan on getting there: How are you planning to accomplish this? How do you know this will work?\nWhen summarizing your business, consider mentioning any environmental benefits or efficiency measures that give you a competitive edge or cost advantage.\n\nIf it wasn’t covered in the earlier brainstorm, ask: Why is this section really important to have?\nYou can send this out to people who might be interested in your business. If they are interested, they might ask for more information\nYou should be able to sum up the key elements of your business plan in one page! Where are you now, where do you want to go, and how will you get there?\nIt will highlight the most important things. People don’t have to read the whole thing if they don’t want to. \n\n\n\n4\n\nBUSINESS DESCRIPTION\nBusiness Description 3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your business description. This is a really high level explanation of what you do. Be clear and simple. Don’t try to be fancy and use complicated explanations or jargon. You want people to really understand who you are and why you are here. \nAsk: When describing your business, which points should you include?\nDescription: Tell us about your business. Who are you, why are you here, and what do you do (think challenge-solution)? \nMake sure the way you talk about your business is consistent on your pitch, business plan, website, and social media. \nIf you talk about your business one way in the executive summary, talk about it the same way in your business description!\nMission Statement, Vision, values, and Goals: What do you want to accomplish through the existence of your business (usually not financial accomplishments, for instance sustainability in your mission/values could strengthen your market position)?\nRemember, write what works. If you think it is repetitive and not effective to write all of these, then don’t! You choose what will tell the best story for your business (where you have been, where you are going, how you will get there)\nProducts and services:  What are you offering, and what is its unique value? Be clear and obvious here.  \nAsk: When describing your products, what should you include? \nPotential answers:\nThe name of your products/services (write all revenue streams)\nPricing mechanism\nCompetitive advantage of each product/service\nThe values your business lives in its product/service  (e.g., durability or eco-friendliness, if applicable) \nAny patents? Copyrights?\nPhotos/screenshots (professional-looking ones!)\n\n5\n\nMANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION\n 3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your business management and organization. How will your business operate? What are key operational or organizational elements of your business that will be key to its success? \nAsk: When thinking about your management and organization, which points should you include?\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts.\nMake sure to touch on a few main points:\nYour team/organizational structure:\nWho is there now? What experience does your team bring to ensure the success of this business?\nWho do you plan to have on your team? Consider adding a hiring timeline of key and operational teammates.\nWhat kind of management and structure do you have? Consider including an “organigram” to show how the structure, reporting, and information flows to the different members of your team. \nDo you have a board of advisors?\nA solo founder isn’t convincing to investors. They want to see a strong passionate team and a supportive network to reassure them. \nYour legal structure:\nLegal requirements. Should you be registered to operate? How will you register?\nWhat is your legal structure? Are you a non profit? Are you a corporation, are you the only owner (sole proprietorship)?\nAre there any particular safety or health requirements you should follow?\nThis section is not necessary for everyone\nKey partners:\nDo you have any key partners, distributors, manufacturers, etc… that you are working with? \nExplain how your business will operate in coordination with other key players\nThis is not necessary for everyone\n6\n\nWho are your customers?\nHow big is the market?\nIs it growing?\nWho else is in the market? \nMARKET ANALYSIS\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your market analysis. Show evidence based on research. You can take the information from your feasibility study and add it in here. Who are your customers and competitors? How big is the market? \nAsk: If you wanted to prove with evidence that your business was a good bet in this market, what would you want to show?\nPotential answers:\nGood feedback from user research and testing\n Market size and future growth potential\n Trends that indicate shifting consumer preferences, operational efficiencies, or regulatory changes that may impact your business\n PESTEL analysis\n Competitive benchmarking or analysis (how your business fills those gaps)\n Supporting data (any research or figures that shows the market need or demand for a product like yours)\n Risk analysis\n Etc..\n\n7\n\nACTION PLAN\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nNext, we have the action plan. What will you do to make this business a success? How can you convince the people around you that this is a sustainable idea and you have thought everything through? Your action plan should clearly explain the steps you will take to turn the idea into a reality (or take your existing business and take it to the next level). Make sure that this is really practical, realistic, and reflects your financial projections. \nAsk: What could be included in your action plan? \nPotential answers:\nGo to market strategy\nGrowth and milestones\nSales and marketing strategy\nLocations\nStrategy\nTimeline\nPotential partners, distributors, and manufacturers\nHow do your startup costs/investment play into this action plan?\n8\n\n\nWhat’s do you need to turn this into reality?\nHow much do you think you will make in 1 year?\nHow much in 3 years?\nFINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\n$\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nNext, we have the financial projections.\nAsk: What should you show in terms of your financials? What story are you telling here?\nFinancial history: Show evidence that this idea will work through actual sales!\nWhat sales have you already made?\nCan you show any traction?\nKey financial or profitability ratios such as CAC, gross margin, and others we have talked about in the past (these can be very meaningful on actual financials)\n\nFinancial projections: Show where you expect to be going over the next few years!\nForecasting for 3-5 years\nThey should be strong numbers, but also realistic and based on facts or your market research.\nDoes this have potential to make money? \nWhen will you break even? \nBalance sheet/income statement/cash flow statements are all things that could be included. Remember to put a summary here or 3 year highlights. You can add detailed financials to the appendix if you want.\nKey financial or profitability ratios (these won’t be as meaningful if you don’t have a financial history because it is mostly made up)\n9\n\nWant to stand out? Consider a green angle\nSolve environmental problems in your community (e.g., waste, energy use).\nUse efficient processes or eco-friendly products to cut costs and attract customers.\nHighlight these strengths to impress investors who value sustainability.\nGREEN ADVANTAGE (Optional)\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThis is an optional section for those interested in a green angle. Not every business needs to be green, but it can be a way to stand out. A green focus could mean:\n Solving environmental problems in your community (e.g., reducing waste or energy use, see Green Business Booklet p. 12).\n Using efficient processes or eco-friendly products to lower costs and appeal to customers (Green Business Booklet p. 16).\n Highlighting these strengths to attract investors who care about sustainability or long-term resilience.\n\nAsk: How could a green focus (if it fits your business) give you an edge? For example, could it save money, tap into new markets, or align with your values?\n\nPoint them to the “Green Ideas Brainstorm” handout (based on Green Business Booklet p. 12 questions like “What environmental problems exist in your community?” and “What resources could you use?”). They can skip this if it doesn’t apply.\n10\n\nAPPENDICES\n1 hour and 25 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\nFinally we have the appendices. You can add anything in here really, just remember to only add things that add value to the story you are telling. Don’t add things for no reason. What do you want to show that will prove that your ideas are great?\nAsk: What else might you want to include as an attachment to your business plan? \nPotential answers:\nSummary of research\nComplicated charts that you don’t want in the body of your document\nScreenshots of detailed financials\nCompetitive benchmarking\nSWOT analysis\nPictures of your product\nPictures of people using your product\nEtc…\n\n1 hour: Activity\nLet the entrepreneurs work on their business plans for the next hour. \nThey can use the template we provided, Canva, or anything else. \nRemind them that they can be creative with this and add or remove any sections they would like based on what they think would be valuable information.\n\n20 minutes: Share\nBring them back for the last 20 minutes or so to go around the room and share. \nWhat was each entrepreneur able to accomplish during this time? \nDid anyone have any trouble? Did anyone have any great successes that they would like to share?\n\n11\n\nDESIGN AND LAYOUT\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe last point we will talk about is the Design and layout of your business plan. Just like a pitch deck, your business plan should be well thought through and designed carefully. You should match themes with your pitch deck, website, application, Facebook page, social media, and more. Remember, you are creating a brand!\nPoint out that they should feel free to adjust the template we sent out in any they want. We sent a simple word document plan, which is acceptable. \nSubstance is more important than design! The design should be there to make it more readable and understandable first. \nShow them alternative layouts (click through the slides):\nTell them to go onto Canva to find some simple, yet creative business plan templates. Simply search “business plan” into the search bar and several options will come up.\nPoint out that these are just examples and they should find a theme that represents their brand. It should have their logos, photos of their products, and their color and font schemes. \n\n\nAsk: Based on what you know about branding, how should you design your business plan?\nUse the same fonts and color scheme.\nMake it visually appealing, clear, and easy to read\nIt should have your own touch to it and be linked to who you are and what you are doing. Link your UVP into this as well. \nAre you innovative? Be innovative here as well. \nAre you creative? Be creative here. \nAre you highly professional? Your document should be highly professional.\nEtc…\n\n12\n\n\n Create a first draft of your business plan.\n\n Please keep in mind:\nCheck your spelling and grammar!\nDetails are everything.\nSource your information & explain assumptions.\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n14\n"

How are you doing today? \nToday we will be talking about your supply chain. Many of your products/services have some physical element to it. We will break down how you get those things and how they impact your business and customers. If you don’t have a physical element to your business (many tech businesses), this information is still good to know. A lot of what we will talk about are just good business practices in general.  \n1\n\nExperience a rapid product development process.\nUnderstand the different parts of your supply chain.\nEvaluate how to add value along your supply chain.\nIdentify resource efficiency opportunities that reduce costs and environmental impact.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nExperience a rapid product development process.\nUnderstand the different parts of your supply chain.\nEvaluate how to add value along your supply chain.\nIdentify resource efficiency opportunities that reduce costs and environmental impact.\n2\n\nDEVELOP A \u000bNEW PRODUCT\nUpdated game 1 hour:\u000b Activity\n\n5 Minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work in teams to experience a complete business cycle: design, pitch, produce, and sell a product (paper airplanes).\n\nSetup:\n- Divide into teams of 3-4 people\n- Each team receives limited materials:\n  • 3 sheets of standard paper\n  • Access to shared resources: markers, scissors, paperclips\n- Materials have costs: Each sheet of paper costs $5\n- Teams can purchase additional paper during production for $8 per sheet\n\nThe Challenge:\n- Design a paper airplane that flies well, looks appealing, and uses materials efficiently\n- The buyer (trainer) will evaluate planes on:\nFlight performance (distance, accuracy)\nDesign appeal and uniqueness\nResource efficiency (how effectively materials were used)\n- These factors will determine the selling price ($2-$20 per plane)\n\u000bThe challenge has been updated to prompt teams to think about resource efficiency, waste and cost management.\n\n55 Minutes: Activity\n\n10 minutes: Design Phase\n- Teams develop their airplane concept and prototype\n- Encourage teams to conduct \"customer research\" by asking what the buyer values\n- Teams should consider: How can we design a plane that maximizes quality while minimizing material use?\n\n10 minutes: Pitch & Pricing\n- Each team presents their plane and demonstrates flight capabilities\n- Trainers evaluate and set a price based on performance, design, and efficiency\n- Trainers should reward innovative resource efficiency (e.g., higher price for designs that use minimal material)\n\n15 Minutes: Production Phase\n- Teams have 10 minutes to produce multiple planes using their initial materials\n- After 5 minutes, announce: \"Market demand has increased! A buyer wants 25 planes instead of 15\"\n- Teams can purchase additional materials if needed, but this cuts into profit margins\n- Extend production time by 5 minutes\n\n15 Minutes: Evaluation & Discussion\n- Calculate profits: (Number of accepted planes × Price) - (Materials cost)\n- Rejected planes don't generate revenue, but still count as material cost\n- Discuss which teams were most profitable and why\n\nFacilitator note: Watch for teams that develop resource-efficient strategies like making multiple planes from one sheet, minimizing waste, or repurposing scraps. Point these out during discussion as successful business innovations.\n\n\nOriginal : [[[1 hour: Activity (you can find an alternate online activity on the drive)\n5 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work in groups to go through a rapid product development process.\nTell everyone they are a business developing a new product that will be sold to the training team: a paper airplane. The plane has to fly and look good. Based on the trainers thoughts on your plane, they will give your plane a selling price. \nBreak the group into small teams (about 3 people per team)\nThe trainer should have prototyping materials ready including paper, markers, stickers, etc… These items are available to the entrepreneurs to continue using as they want throughout the entire game. They can use whatever they want. \nEntrepreneurs are free to continue asking the trainers (the people buying the planes) questions about the activity/type of plane to design (they can do user research to find out more about how to design their plane based on customers needs/wants)\nEntrepreneurs should feel free to work with their groups wherever they are comfortable\n\n55 minutes: Activity\n10 minutes: The team will have 10 minutes to design a new product (paper airplane)\n10 minutes: Each group will pitch their plane to the trainer. \nThe trainer will evaluate functionality, design, and the overall pitch to determine a price for each plane. \nThe trainer can also consider the amount of work that went into the plane design. \nThe trainer should set prices like $2, $5, $10, $15, $20 depending on detail and flying capabilities. Try to have a variety of prices.\nTell them that each plane costs $5 to make (make it all the same to keep it simple)When we price the plane some people will get better margins or worse margins. And some people would be able to produce a lot or a little causing different levels of profitability. It depends on how the game goes, but interesting conversations come up.\n\n15 minutes: Announce to the groups that you like all of the planes they pitched and you would like to purchase them for your store. They will have 10 minutes to produce 15 of the planes they pitched. \nWhen you are halfway through this time (after about 7 minutes), announce to the group that you would like to change your order. You are expecting high demand for these planes after a focus group and you would like to order 25 planes instead. \nAnnounce that you will extend the delivery time by 5 additional minutes (13 minutes left for production).\n 15 minutes: Bring everyone back and tell people production has stopped and they need to deliver their products to you.\nThe trainer will now pay each group for their product\nCount each plane that matches the one they pitched. Reject planes that do not work or do not match what they pitched to you.\nMultiply the number of accepted planes by the price that was set before mass production. \nSubtract $5 for each plane that they made (even if the plane was rejected because they produced it)\nCalculate who made the most money! \nTrainer tip: Make it more fun by offering a small piece of candy for each $of profit they made. (Some people might owe you candy at the end if they weren’t profitable…. But don’t actually make them give you candy).]]]\n3\n\nPhotography by Jason Fulford in the New Yorker\nPlaceholder slide during the paper plane activity.\n4\n\nWHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?\n20 minutes: Discussion\n\nDiscuss the activity. And write key learning outcomes on the whiteboard or Jamboard.\nPotential questions to ask: \nWhat did you learn from this activity?\nWhat was your team approach to this activity? \nHow did you decide what plane to do (listened to one paper plane expert on the team, tested many to find the best, copied someone else, simple and efficient basic plane, etc…)?\nWhat challenges came up? What did you learn from those challenges?\nWere there any successes? What worked so well?\nDid you prepare for production during your design phase?\nDid you think about who on your team will manufacture the plane? Did everyone on the team know how to make it?\nWhen manufacturing, were you able to keep the product consistent? \n\nPossible learning outcomes can include: \nCommunication is important (with your team and with your clients). \nSome teams forgot about the bigger picture (they are selling a product). Focus on the end game.\nMake sure you know what you are getting into before agreeing to anything\nConsider available resources and your actual capabilities while designing\nBe prepared to meet customers changing demands quickly and accurately\nConsider negotiating when necessary. Most people just agreed when they were asked to deliver more products. You could have agreed, or negotiated to only make the ones that you could. That is a business decision. Can you adapt quickly and meet the demand? Or should you stick with your original contract and do what you agreed to at high quality? Maybe you weren’t actually capable of doing it, that is ok. But keep in mind, in real life, demand can change in an instant and you would want to capitalize on that if possible.\n\nRecap: These are all really important things that we learned. However, the real question is how do we take these learnings and create systems so that we don’t make the same mistakes when we are actually running our business? \n\n5\n\nResearch, design, & development\nMarketing and sales\nProduction and delivery\nQuality control\nDEVELOPMENT PROCESS\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nDiscuss what you did as a group and how it is linked to any typical business and its activities. If these points were covered on the previous slide, just quickly recap them and move on.\nResearch, Design, and Development: All businesses have to do the right research before starting their business. Based on that research, they should design, test, and build out their full set of products/services.\nAsk:\n Did anyone ask me what kind of plane I was interested in? Or what I needed it for?\n Who will use it? Or what color and design I might like?\n Could you have made a design that was easier to build?\n If you did, you would have gotten a leg up in the exercise because you might have been able to plan better, know how many I wanted, or know which planes I was interested in “buying.” Early-stage research can prevent inefficiencies, help businesses design smarter, and more scalable products.\n Never forget about how important this step is. Make the time to do the right research to set yourself up for success down the line.\n\n Marketing and Sales: Each team had their product evaluated and accepted or rejected from the “market.” Your price was set by the quality of the plane and how it met my needs.\n Many of you were very clever during your pitch. Some of you targeted emotions, some of you targeted functionality, etc. It would have been really smart if you knew what I wanted the plane for by doing the right research ahead of time.\n Ask: How does knowing your customer’s needs help you sell more efficiently?\n \n Production and Delivery: All of you have great ideas, but if you can’t make and deliver your product/service to the market, then your business will fail!\n Some planes were priced really high because they were really amazing, but it was too much for them to deliver!\n Maybe you made a plane that only one person on the team knew how to make, and it was really time-consuming.\n Some of you ran out of raw materials.\n Ask: Did anyone experience this? What did you do to get around the challenge?\n\n Quality Control: Never forget about quality control! So many of you gave planes that I didn’t want. They were poor quality, and I refused to pay for them, which cost your business.\n You should put a system in place to make sure that the quality of your product is ensured at every step while also maintaining efficiency.\n Ask: Who had a system for quality control? What worked well, what didn’t?\n\n Recap: At each of these steps, there was an opportunity to make me a happy customer and provide me with value. You can either lower your costs or make your product more tailored to customer needs—but the best businesses do both.\n When developing your product, think about:\n How it will be produced efficiently.\n How it will be shipped at the lowest cost.\n How it will be stored without waste.\n How it will be packaged to balance protection and material use.\n\n The design of the product itself is one of the key steps that will determine your supply chain. Entrepreneurs should ask themselves how they will actually be able to manage the successful delivery of a product to their customers. To do that, you have to carefully break down each step. \n[[Original Version]]\nDiscuss what you did as a group and how it is linked to any typical business and its activities.

To do that, you have to carefully break down each step. \n\n6\n\nUNDERSTAND YOUR CAPABILITIES\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nBefore you get into any agreement, make sure that you fully understand your capabilities before you agree to anything. \nAsk: What are the things that you should be sure of (in terms of your capabilities) to make sure that you can deliver on the work you are agreeing to. \nPotential answers:\nYou can get the materials to make the product/service. \nThe materials are of the quality that you want and your customers demand\nYou have enough time to make and deliver your product/service. This includes you and your team. \nYou are choosing materials and suppliers that balance cost, reliability, and efficiency.\nYou have considered how the availability of materials and production methods could affect your delivery timeline.\nYou have evaluated opportunities to reduce waste and increase resource efficiency in your processes.\nYou have the knowledge and skill set to deliver your product or service. Each member of your team has the knowledge and skills to work efficiently and collaboratively. \nYou have the money and resources to deliver your product or service.\nYou have the energy, patience, and excitement to deliver this product or service. \n7\n\nAdapt quickly:\nBUSINESS EFFICIENCY CHECKLIST\nFacilitator notes:\nIntroduce the Business Efficiency Workbook as a comprehensive tool that integrates resource efficiency\nPoint out that the checklist already includes key environmental considerations in categories like:\n  Power & Equipment (energy efficiency, renewable sources)\n  Materials & Waste (waste reduction, local sourcing)\n  Water & Utilities (conservation, renewable sources)\n  Transport & Logistics (route optimization, low-emission options)\n  Supply Chain (supplier selection, distance considerations)\nDemonstrate how the workbook helps identify, prioritize, and implement improvements that benefit both:\nBusiness bottom line (cost reduction, efficiency improvements)\nEnvironmental performance (resource conservation, waste reduction)\n\n\n8\n\nAdapt quickly:\nIntegrated supply chain\nCommunication \nUnderstand customers\nADAPT QUICKLY\u000b\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAnother technique to help your supply chain is by enabling yourself to be able to adapt quickly. In the activity we did, we created 1 item, imagine doing this for hundreds or thousands of items. What if you were working in several cities and you had many employees to get onboard a new project? What would you do if you had to adapt quickly? What systems should you have in place to allow for quick and adaptive responses? Sometimes there are crises that happen (Coronavirus for example) that totally change things. How will your business adapt quickly and efficiently? \n\nAsk: What are ways that you can enable yourself to adapt quickly and respond to change?\nPotential answers: \nIntegrated supply chain: Create a supply chain that connects all the different partners in one place through a system that facilitates good communication and efficiency. Ask: What can you do to create an “integrated supply chain”?\nCoordinate the movement of your products and services. Track your shipments or other arrangements with suppliers online. Although you might not have a digital system, you can ask the person to give you weekly updates on the status of your deliveries.  \nMake sure that there is always a path for clear information flows with key partners (see communication point below)\nHave each of your partners in your supply chain communicating with each if relevant. \nReduce the number of steps in your supply chain, or find a supplier that can deal with multiple steps (or you can take control of more steps)\nUse technology to manage the supply chain more efficiently and know what is happening at each step. There is software for this, but probably not relevant for businesses at this stage\nEtc…\nCommunication When you are developing/designing the product, make sure you communicate with all the stakeholders\nCommunication with partners:\nHave a system to quickly share information with key partners (tell a supplier about change in demand, for example)\nThis could be through the phone, email, or something else, but it can be slow and is susceptible to a lot of human error. \nYou can purchase online systems \nDesignate certain employees to be the communicators to certain partners\nEtc…\nCommunication with your team:\nDoes the team know why they are doing this? \nMake a clear connection between marketing, design, procurement, and other teams in your organization\nWhat is the system in place to communicate big news and information? – Which system is best to make sure key information is made clear to the team and things aren’t lost along the way?\nSlack\nEmail?\nFace to face?\nUnderstand customers: \nInternet (gather data on them)\nAsk them (surveys, feedback, SM, etc…)\nLearn from other parts of the supply chain (integrate processes so you can observe changes in demand)\nEtc...\n\nRecap: Be responsive to changing customer demands and changing markets. Do this by putting systems in place to be able to forecast potential trends and also communicate with key partners to adapt quickly. \n\n9\n\nINVENTORY MANAGEMENT\u000b\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nBefore you get into any agreement, make sure that you fully understand your capabilities before you agree to anything. \nAsk: What are the things that you should consider while managing inventory? What systems can you put in place to make sure that your inventory is being managed well?\nPotential answers:\nCategorize your assets in a logical way so that you always know what is there and you can easily organize information. This prevents unnecessary purchases and waste. \nDigitize your inventory. Consider buying a software to manage inventory. Or keep digital records by tracking your purchases and sales. Digital tracking helps prevent overstocking or running out of key materials.\nManage inventory based on safety levels. Make sure you set a range on how much inventory you need at one time. You don’t want too much because it can be expensive to store, materials can expire or degrade, and space can be wasted, etc… And you don’t want to run out of materials because then you miss out on sales opportunities or slow down production! Find a good level, and stick to it. Keep records so you can learn about seasonal trends over time (in case inventory changes seasonally, safety levels might change too)\nPerform routine checks. Check in on your inventory now and again to make sure that your digital records are accurate. Maybe things aren’t being managed correctly causing broken, stolen, or damaged products.\nEtc…\n10\n\nSales \nPromotion\nSUPPLY CHAIN MAPPING\n10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nA Supply Chain is the entire system of producing and delivering a product or a service, from the very beginning stage of sourcing the raw materials to the final customer. \nLet’s do an example together. Let’s take a simple mug and break down its supply chain together and identify areas to make a more efficient supply chain.\nUse some of the questions below to prompt the group to map out the full supply chain for a mug (or another example):\nWhat are the raw materials needed for this product? Where are they found?\nWhat are the steps involved in making this product? Where does each step in the production take place?\nWhat energy is needed to produce this item? Where does that energy come from?\nWhat kind of transportation, if any, is needed at each stage of the production process, including getting the finished product to you?\nWhich steps does the business control vs other companies? Are there opportunities for the business to control more? Would it be a good idea to take control?\nPotential answer for the supply chain mapping of a mug:\nPurchase the best materials (procurement) – Maybe we buy the ceramic mugs from China and cardboard boxes for packaging from another retailer in China. These items get shipped through Alibaba.\nAsk: What should you consider during the procurement stage? \nTake into consideration customers preferences\nConsider your brand\nConsider your budget\nHow convenient is it to buy this material? \n\nManufacturing and operations– We are not manufacturing anything because we pre-order from China, but we need to package and label all the products to prepare for shipping to the customers. This will happen in the office you rented with your small team. \nAsk: What should you consider during the manufacturing and operations stage? \nManage time limits and employees\nComplete all tasks on time and with high quality\nClean up and prepare for continued work\n\nLogistics and transportation – We need to store and ship all the mugs to the customers address. We will store the items in our store. We use a 3rd party delivery company and also sell from our storefront. \nAsk: What should you consider during the logistics and transportation stage? \nHow will your packaging affect storage, transportation, and delivery? \nHow can you ensure timely delivery?\nWhere will you store your product? \nHow will you get the product to your customers? \n\nIkea example: Take the case of Ikea – its ‘Bang’ mug has been redesigned many times to realize shipping cost savings (pictures show first and final versions of the cups). Originally, 864 mugs would fit into a pallet; after redesign a pallet held 1,280 mugs. With a further redesign 2,024 mugs could be held. This act of packaging ingenuity and attention to detail reduced its shipping costs by 60%. In addition, IKEA now owns a huge number of forests so that it controls some areas of its own supply. They use wood from this forest in their own products instead of paying a little bit more for someone else to provide the wood. They are able to profit off of this because they are a huge company and benefit from economies of scale. \n\n11\n\nSales \nPromotion\nMAP YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n35 minutes: Activity\nNow you will apply this to your business.\nEveryone should map out their supply chain and pinpoint areas that they can create value. \nResearch the raw materials needed to make your product and how these raw materials come together to form the finished product. \nMake sure entrepreneurs have the handout where they can answer the following questions:\nWhat are the raw materials needed for your product? Where are they found?\nWhat are the steps involved in making your product? Where does each step in the production take place?\nWhat energy is needed to produce this product/service? Where does that energy come from?\nWhat kind of transportation, if any, is needed at each stage of the production process, including getting the finished product to your customers? \nFinally, think about how you can add value to either your business or your customers:\n- Can you reduce steps?\n- Can you control more steps?\n- Can you cut costs?\n- Can you be more sustainable?\n\nAfter mapping your supply chain, transfer your findings to the Business Efficiency Workbook:\n- Add specific challenges identified to the \"Challenges\" column\n- Mark which challenges to work on\n- Add your planned improvement actions\n- Use the prioritization matrix to decide where to start\n\nIf you are having trouble, think about the \"happy path\" of your whole business. Go through each step and think about all the activities that you have to do to run and operate your business. Then, at each activity, think about how you will turn this idea to reality. \nEncourage everyone to think about how they could apply the activity to their business; however, if someone insists that they don’t have a supply chain in any form, have them help someone else work on theirs. \n\n10 minutes: Discussion\nYour supply chain has a big impact on your business, people, and the environment. Some supply chains are completely local, while others have supply chains that are around the world. Every decision you make on how to source, produce, transport, sell your product/materials has an impact. \nAsk: How can you make sure that your supply chain is sustainable, cost effective, and creating a positive impact?\nPotential answers:\nMake sure that each step of your supply chain is sourcing their supplies ethically (don’t use sweatshops, child labor, causing environmental harm, etc…)\nProduce as much as you can locally to reduce transportation costs, CO2 emissions, and provide jobs to the local economy\nCut costs by renegotiating partnerships or cutting out steps all together\nBe more efficient and reduce waste wherever you can\nOptimize inventory and transportation by using systems and data analytics\nImprove functionality by making things easier and saving time\nA more efficient and sustainable supply chain can be a great source of value creation\nYou can cut costs and increase your profitability\nYou can cut costs and pass savings over to your customers, increasing value for them\nYou can create value for customers and stakeholders by being more sustainable and eco friendly\n\nRecap: Inventory, distribution, production, procurement and transportation are some of the key costs that exist in the supply chain. Being able to find ways to minimize them is a recognized competitive advantage, and one way to create a lasting competitive edge.\n\n12\n\nReview your supply chain and find three ways to improve efficiency (cut costs, simplify processes, or track better).\n\nUse the Business Efficiency Checklist to guide you.\n\nPrioritize high-impact changes with the matrix and create a clear action plan with deadlines and responsibilities.\n\nKey Tip: The best businesses make efficiency and risk mitigation a core focus!\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS:\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS Re-evaluate your supply chain and identify at least 3 ways you can create value (reduce costs, streamline processes, improve resource efficiency) \n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n14\n"

Introduce the Business Efficiency Workbook as a tool to help identify and evaluate similar opportunities:\n   * \"Today we're introducing the Business Efficiency Workbook, which will help you identify similar opportunities in your own business\"\n   * Show a quick screenshot of the workbook\n   * \"This workbook will become a recurring tool throughout our program to help you identify cost-saving opportunities\"\n\n**Connection to financing:**\n* \"These investments can be attractive to certain funders because they demonstrate both financial acumen and operational resilience\"\n* \"Some funders specifically look for these efficiency improvements as evidence of good business management\"\n\n**Wrap-up:**\n* \"We'll explore this workbook more deeply in our Supply Chain session, but keep it in mind as we discuss costs today\"\n* \"Think about which areas of your business might benefit from efficiency investments with strong ROI\"\n\n## Module 25: Supply Chain - Business Efficiency Checklist (Slide 8)\n\n**FACILITATOR NOTES:**\n\nThis is your primary deep-dive into the Business Efficiency Workbook. Your goal is to position it as a practical business tool rather than an environmental exercise.\n\n**Introduction (1-2 minutes):**\n* \"We introduced the Business Efficiency Workbook briefly in our Cost Model session. Now we'll explore how it can help optimize your supply chain.\"\n* \"This isn't just about being 'green' - it's about identifying practical ways to reduce costs and operate more efficiently.\"\n\n**Demonstration (2-3 minutes):**\n* Display the workbook on screen, focusing on the checklist page\n* Walk through the sections one by one, highlighting their business relevance:\n  * \"The Power & Equipment section helps identify energy costs that are unnecessarily high\"\n  * \"Materials & Waste shows where you might be literally throwing money away\"\n  * \"Water & Utilities focuses on reducing utility bills\"\n  * \"Transport & Logistics helps optimize delivery costs and transportation efficiency\"\n  * \"Supply Chain examines how your suppliers impact your bottom line\"\n\n**Business benefits emphasis (1-2 minutes):**\n* \"Each section of this workbook connects directly to your profit and loss statement\"\n* \"For example, the workbook helped one entrepreneur identify that their electricity costs were 30% higher than necessary because of inefficient equipment\"\n* \"Another entrepreneur used it to negotiate better terms with suppliers by showing how improved packaging would reduce transportation costs\"\n\n**Connection to risk management (1-2 minutes):**\n* Reference the Risk & Resilience worksheet: \"The workbook pairs with this risk assessment tool to identify where efficiency improvements also reduce business vulnerabilities\"\n* \"For example, finding local suppliers might both reduce shipping costs AND make your business less vulnerable to supply chain disruptions\"\n\n**Practical application (1-2 minutes):**\n* \"As you map your supply chain today, use this checklist to identify the biggest opportunities for improvement\"\n* \"Focus on the areas with the highest potential ROI first - the workbook includes a prioritization matrix to help with this\"\n\n## Module 23: Business Plan - Green Advantage (Slide 9)\n\n**FACILITATOR NOTES:**\n\nThis slide helps entrepreneurs incorporate their efficiency improvements into their business plans as competitive advantages. It's the culmination of the workbook's application.\n\n**Introduction (1 minute):**\n* \"Remember the Business Efficiency Workbook we've been using throughout the program? The improvements you've identified can be valuable selling points in your business plan.\"\n* \"This isn't a separate 'green' section - these advantages can be woven throughout your plan as competitive differentiators\"\n\n**Connections to business advantages (2 minutes):**\n* \"Your efficiency improvements translate into specific business advantages that investors value:\"\n  * \"Cost advantages: You operate with lower overhead than competitors\"\n  * \"Risk reduction: Your business is less vulnerable to price fluctuations and supply disruptions\"\n  * \"Market differentiation: You can appeal to customers who value sustainability\"\n  * \"Long-term viability: Your business model anticipates future resource constraints\"\n\n**Examples from participants (2 minutes):**\n* \"Would anyone like to share an efficiency improvement they identified using the workbook that could be a selling point in their business plan?\"\n* If no volunteers: \"For example, one entrepreneur discovered they could reduce packaging costs by 15% by redesigning their product, which became a key selling point in their investor pitch\"\n\n**Integration guidance (1 minute):**\n* \"Rather than relegating these advantages to a separate 'sustainability' section, incorporate them where they make the most business sense:\"\n  * \"Cost savings in your financial projections\"\n  * \"Operational efficiencies in your supply chain description\"\n  * \"Resource durability in your risk assessment\"\n  * \"Market advantages in your marketing strategy\"\n\n**Handout reference (1 minute):**\n* \"The Green Ideas Brainstorm handout provides additional prompts if you're still identifying opportunities\"\n* \"This is completely optional - only pursue this angle if it genuinely strengthens your business case\"\n\n**Closing connection to Risk worksheet (1 minute):**\n* \"Remember to reference your Risk & Resilience assessment when highlighting how your efficiency measures reduce business vulnerabilities\"\n* \"This demonstrates to investors that you've thought comprehensively about both opportunities and threats\"\n\nWould you like me to modify any of these facilitator notes or make them more specific to your program context?",

As we are getting close to the end of the program, check in on their milestones and pitch progress.\n\n9:15 | Begin the session\nGood morning everyone! How are you doing today? \nToday, we are going into risk and crisis management. We will talk about decision making and how that ties into risk and managing your business.\n\n\nReflect on your decision-making style, and pinpoint strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSet an initial risk management strategy and learn how to adapt it over time.\n\nLearn a few strategies to adapt when you are in a crisis.\n\n\n\n1 minutes: Objectives\n\nReflect on your decision making style, and pinpoint strength and weaknesses\nSet an initial risk management strategy and learn how to adapt it over time.\nLearn a few strategies to adapt when you are in a crisis.\n\n\nA Plane Crash Activity\n25 minutes: Activity\n\nStart the session off with an activity that will help entrepreneurs evaluate their decision making style.\n5 minutes: Explain the situation and answer questions\nHand out the plane crash game information\nYou have just survived a plane crash. Both the pilot and co-pilot were killed in the crash; however you and a number of passengers survived. It is mid-January, and you are in Northern Canada. The daily temperature is -4 degrees Celsius (-24 degrees Fahrenheit), and the night time temperature gets even colder. There is snow on the ground, and the countryside has many trees with several small rivers crisscrossing the area. The nearest town is about 20 miles away. You are all dressed in city clothes appropriate for a business meeting. \nRules:\nYou must decide how to work together to survive or get help. \nYou only have a few minutes before the plane explodes. Go through the plane wreckage to salvage five items from the list below.\nDecide your strategy (either to walk to the nearest village, or wait for help).\n\n20 minutes: Activity:\n3-5 minutes: Part 1\nIndividual work \nEach person should rank the importance of each item and choose their top 4 choices\nChoose your strategy (stay put or walk to find the closest town)\n15 minutes: Part 2\nGroup work, after entrepreneurs do it themselves, break them into groups of about 5 people \nAs a group, make a decision on the 5 items you will choose\nAs a group, decide on your strategy (stay put or walk to find the closest town)\n\nHow to score:\nEach team should list its top 5 choices in order prior to seeing the answer sheet. \nTo award points, look at the ranking numbers on this answer sheet. Award points to each team’s top choices according to the numbers here. For example, the map would earn 12 points, while the steel wool would earn 2 points. \nLowest score wins (and survives).\nIf the team wasn’t able to come to a conclusion, they died!\nTypically, if you choose to leave the plane, you will likely freeze and die! It is easy to track a crashed plane, but not as easy to track people lost in the woods.- Bring this up as a point to consider for those who chose to leave. \nConsider giving a small prize to the survivors! Or if anyone “died” in the game, they have to do something nice for the survivors.\n\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MAKE DECISIONS?\n20 minutes: Discussion\n\nDebrief from the activity. Have a discussion on their experience during this “crisis”. \nPotential questions to ask to get the conversation going include: \nWhat did you learn during the activity? What were the consequences of your choices? \n\nWhat roles did group members adopt? \nWas there a leader, a manager, a timekeeper, a facilitator, a slacker, etc… Which roles were helpful and which were not?\nWhat kinds of behavior helped or hindered the group?\nWho influenced the decisions and how?\nDid people listen to each other? If not why not? \n\nWhat are the main differences from when you did it alone or when you did it within the group?\nAlone: Fast, confident, easy, maybe wrong maybe right (depending on the person)\nGroup: Slow, a lot more voices and discussion, harder to make a decision, more ideas, more variety of ideas, better ideas, \n\nHow did your group’s decision-making process affect what you prioritized?\n(Prompt participants to reflect on whether they focused on immediate needs or long-term survival.)\n\nHow were decisions made? How was conflict managed while deciding on what to do?\nVoting\nA leader told everyone what to do\nRandom choices\nEmotionally based choices\nLogical decisions\nDiscussion and agreement\nLook at the facts\nListen to other opinions\nEvaluate pros and cons\n\nWere there trade-offs in your choices?\nExample: Did you sacrifice one priority for another, such as warmth vs. mobility, or safety vs. speed?\n\nDid anyone notice how different people communicated based on the communication aspects that you ranked yourself during the last leadership class?\n\nWhat prevented good decision making? How could better decisions have been made?\nNot enough information available. It would have been good to do research or find an expert on the matter.\nEmotional attachments to one of the solutions (maybe you or a friend came up with the idea, for example)\nTeam members not heard or considered. Anyone on the team could have had a great idea, but if nobody heard you, it is pointless. Consider this point both if you are the loud person (let others speak) and if you are the quiet one (find a way to be heard by speaking up or influencing others who can speak for you)\nFear can impact decisions. Although this isn’t real, if you were in a real crisis, you wouldn’t be able to think clearly.\n\nRecap: The way that you reacted in this game reflects how you would react in real life. The role you played shows who you are on a team (the one who leads, the one who isn’t heard, the one who sits back and lets others decide, etc…). It also shows how you evaluate risk and make decisions in real life. Were you logical and tried to find the right answer? Did you try to appease the group and just settle on something to move on to avoid conflict? Did you prevent a decision from being made because you were stubborn? There is no good or bad in this; however, it is an opportunity to reflect on your style and pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses as a decision maker. \n\nEvery decision you make as an individual, team, or organization has an element of risk involved that will affect your business. Here, your decisions risked your life. In business, your decisions risk other things. Sometimes you have to make quick decisions that could impact your business, your team, your shareholders (if you have any), and your customers.  \n\nAsk: What are some business decisions that can bring risk to your business? Where can they be rewarding and where can the risk cause harm? \nPotential answers: \nHiring the right right/wrong person \nInvesting in parts of your business\nCertain partnerships can be risky/rewarding\nDecisions have an impact on your brand and how people talk about you\nDoing something illegal or socially unaccepted (possibly for quick financial gain)\nChoosing to implement an emergency action plan or not\nChoosing to launch a new product or not can set you apart from your competitors and be rewarding, or it can make you run out of money if it isn’t developed and launched accurately.\nAll of these decisions could impact:\nBrand reputation\nFinancial security and profitability\nCustomer trust\nEmployee trust and commitment\nLegal ramifications\nEtc…\n\nTransition: On one hand, you have risk, but on the other hand you have reward. When you make decisions, there are both elements of risk and reward. The key is to make decisions that are well thought-out and adaptable, so that you can adjust if things don’t go as planned.  For the rest of the session, we will look at risks and how to make decisions while considering the risk involved at each step. By evaluating these risks, you set yourself up for better decision making in the long run. \n\n4\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nIdentify Risks\nMeasure, Control and Monitor\nAssess and Analyze the Risk\nPlan Action\nImplement\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nEvery decision you make now has an element of risk to it and will impact your business in one way or another. If you have the time to break down your decisions through a risk perspective, you should. Although you can’t predict the future impact of your decisions, you can at least think through the different risk factors and have a plan to adapt to the unexpected quickly.\n\nAsk: What are some business decisions that can bring risk to your business? Where can they be rewarding and where can the risk cause harm? \nPotential answers: \nHiring the right right/wrong person \nInvesting in parts of your business\nCertain partnerships can be risky/rewarding\nDecisions have an impact on your brand and how people talk about you\nDoing something illegal or socially unaccepted (possibly for quick financial gain)\nChoosing to implement an emergency action plan or not\nChoosing to launch a new product or not can set you apart from your competitors and be rewarding, or it can make you run out of money if it isn’t developed and launched accurately.\nAll of these decisions could impact:\nBrand reputation\nFinancial security and profitability\nCustomer trust\nEmployee trust and commitment\nLegal ramifications\nSupply chain stability\nOperational costs\nEtc…\n\nRecap: Each decision has an opportunity to reward you or hurt you and the future of your business. That depends on the riskiness of the decision you are making. It is your job to be able to evaluate these risks and figure out what the best strategic move to make is.  Each of you should have a plan for risk mitigation and management. Risk management is all about thinking ahead to try to understand what might cause an issue, then take the steps necessary to avoid the problem and reduce losses wherever you can. \n\nRisk management steps to help guide you through the process of creating a risk management plan include:\nIdentify risks: Define the problems and risks that might arise for your business. There are some obvious ones, and some that are less obvious. You should think about your business to see where there are higher opportunities for risk. Each business will face different ones. \nAssess and analyze the risk: Look at each of the risks you have identified. Try to prioritize them and see which ones are the riskiest and could cause the most harm. Evaluate them through factors that you consider to be important. \nPlan action: Make a decision on what to do. Common decisions include:  \nDo nothing. This can be an option and it is totally fine. Make sure you really understand the situation before you choose to “do nothing”.\nWait for the risky event to happen and have a plan to fix it\nMitigate the risk altogether. \nImplement: Implement whatever it is you decided to do. If it is a mitigation strategy start it. If it is just waiting for it to occur, make sure that everyone on the team knows how to respond when/if it does.\nMeasure, control, and monitor: Monitor the situation. Whether you implemented a risk mitigation strategy or chose to ignore the risk (because it wasn’t risky enough to implement something), make sure that you don’t forget about your decision. \nIt is a cycle and you should continue to look ahead to spot future risks so that you can plan accordingly.\n\n\nWhen identifying risks, businesses can categorize them under three main areas:\nPeople: Employee well-being, customer safety, and the impact of business decisions on staff and community.\nProduct: Product quality, demand fluctuations, supply chain reliability, and risks related to sourcing materials.\nPlanet: Resource dependency, operational costs, and external risks like energy prices or environmental regulations.\n\nPotential questions:\nHow does the risk management process tie into decision making? When you have to make a decision, you are presented with a series of alternative actions you can make. Each alternative has a different level of risk and reward. You should assess the risk- reward of each of those options and make a decision. Once you decide on a course of action, make a plan for mitigating some of those risks that you thought of before. Monitor your decision so you know if you need to step in and make a change at any point.\n5\n\nRISK PLANNING\nYou are starting a tourism business, what are the internal and external risks you might face for the first 6 months of operation? \n15-20 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nHave a brainstorm on the board with the class. Give a business situation and determine what the risks a business might face. Go through all of the steps that would be needed to fill out the tool as a discussion on the board.\nAsk: What kind of risks might you find for this example?\nPotential answers:\nMarket risks due to competition\nWell known tourism agencies reduce their prices when I can’t.\nNew competition enters the market making the current marketing plans obsolete.\nPeople follow the trend and go online making my primary sales channel obsolete. \nInexperienced marketing and sales team cause low brand awareness and sales. \n\nTechnical risks related to the technical side of the business\nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one)\nCar breaks down so you can’t go on tours\n\nLegal risks \nUnexpected changes or new regulations on tourism\nDanger of being sued if someone gets injured on your tour\nAn important contract is broken\n\nNatural risks related to climate and natural disasters.\nGlobal pandemics (COVID 19, for example)\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible\nEarthquakes or fires affecting the team and the office\n\nOperational risks related to delivering your product/service to the customer\nTour guide gets sick and can’t go on tours\nPartner organization (that organizes flights, for example) closes or raise their prices so you can use them anymore\nTerrorism and violence is always a possibility that can have an impact on the market and how you operate within the situation.\nHigh dependency on a single supplier or resource, making operations vulnerable to delays or shortages\n\nFinancial risks: \nRun out of cash\nSomething breaks down and you need to replace it unexpectedly\nCustomer refuses to pay you after you spent money on delivering a tour\nIncreasing costs of raw materials or services that directly impact pricing strategy.\n\n\nAfter you pinpointed several risks for the business, choose a few to focus on and go through the points reflected on the tool described on the next slides. \nWrite all the answers on the board. An example of outcomes from the discussion are shown below.\nAsk the following questions for each risk:\nWhat is the likelihood of it actually happening? \nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): Very high likelihood due to the early stage of the app\nRun out of cash: High likelihood since it is an early stage startup\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: Low likelihood. Temperatures and weather have been stable and predictable the past several years. \nA key supplier stops providing materials, affecting production: Medium likelihood, especially if no backup plan is in place.\n\nWhat is the financial impact on your business if this happens?\nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): Low impact. We have several sales channels to if the app doesn’t work, the business will be ok. We also have a CTO that can fix bugs free of charge. \nRun out of cash: High impact. I will have to reduce staff and marketing which will lower customers and sales. \nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: High impact. Outdoor tours are a big part of what we do especially for international clients; however, tours with locals . \nA sudden rise in material costs increases product/service pricing: Medium to high impact, depending on how price-sensitive customers are.\n\nWhen might this risk actually happen? \nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): It is an immediate risk because the product hasn’t been tested much. \nRun out of cash. It is a low risk: We have a firm cash management plan and funding secured for the next year and a half.\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: Long term risk. Temperatures and weather have been stable; however, there is evidence the climate change will have a big impact in the coming years. \nSupply chain delays due to external disruptions: Medium risk—global trends in logistics and shipping can affect material availability.\n\n\n\nRISK EVALUATION:\n5 minutes: Demonstration\n\nGo onto the excel sheet and demonstrate how to use the risk evaluation document. \nTake 2-3 examples that you did on the board and put them into the matrix to see what the impact score is. \nMake sure to highlight:\nWhat each term means in each category\nHow the score is added up\nHow to change the scoring and categories by changing options on sheet 2. Simple changes on sheet 2 will automatically change on sheet 1 (it is more complicated to add rows or categories. If you do, just follow the formulas in the other categories or ask for help)\nThis is relative, and not 100% accurate. A risk should be evaluated from many perspectives and each perspective has a different weight in terms of importance. Don’t just rely on this. This is a very quantitative view of the process; however, don’t forget about a qualitative reflection as well. Think about all of the other factors that need to be considered before making a plan.\nThis can be adapted in other ways and you don’t always have to use this exact matrix. When you have a decision to make, or you are evaluating risk, think of a few key points that you want to evaluate, weigh their importance, and compare alternatives. You see how we did it on the board together, you can do that again in real life\n\n\nRISK EVALUATION:\n5 minutes: Demonstration\n\nGo onto the excel sheet and demonstrate how to use the risk evaluation document. \nTake 2-3 examples that you did on the board and put them into the matrix to see what the impact score is. \nHow risk categories are structured in your assessment\nExplain how risks are categorized (e.g., Resource Costs, Supply Security, Market Changes).\nIntroduce the 3Ps framework (People, Product, Planet) as a way to analyze risks comprehensively.\nHow risks are scored in your assessment\nShow how to assign scores for Severity, Likelihood, and Priority.\nNew Addition: Introduce Impact Areas as a factor to measure risks tied to waste, supply chain dependencies, and operational inefficiencies.\nHighlight how different risks (e.g., high electricity costs, supplier instability) are evaluated based on their financial, operational, and efficiency impact.\nHow the scoring system informs decision-making\nExplain how high-priority risks should be addressed first.\n\nSET A PLAN!\n35 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nYou can explain this on the board or continue the demonstration from the previous slide.\nNext is all about implementing a strategy and monitoring the risk over time.\nNow you need to make a decision on what to do. For each of your major risks, you should have a plan to deal with the situation.\nThe trainer should go through each category and explain why it is an important aspect of the risk mitigation process:\nAction plan: Don’t just go with the first option you think of. Carefully evaluate your options and alternatives if something were to happen. Write your action plan that will help you mitigate this risk or make a plan for if this were to happen.\nAsk: What are the things you might want to consider when deciding what to do for this situation?\nPotential answers:\nAssociated costs\nImpact on brand and reputation\nTime needed to implement this plan\nPeople needed to be able to implement the plan\nResponsibility: Once you decide what the best course of action is, highlight who would be involved in implementing this if it were to happen. You should actually speak to the team member to get them on board so that they know what their responsibility is ahead of time. \nAction plan status: What steps are you putting in place for this risk (if anything)? If there are steps you are putting into place now, put some dates on when you want it complete. When do you plan on re-evaluating this risk? \n\n30 minutes: Activity\nEntrepreneurs should think about the risks associated with their business and come up with some strategies to mitigate these risks or deal with them if/when they arise. \nThink about immediate risks first, but don’t forget about the risks that might arise down the line as well.\nThe trainer will be around to help entrepreneurs think through risks directly related to their business\n\nCRISIS MANAGEMENT\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nRight now, you all have a very nice plan. You have a clear budget, timeline, strategy, and a framework to evaluate and mitigate risks. As we discussed earlier, you can mitigate many of these risks through careful planning; however, sometimes things happen, and we are put in a challenging position where we can’t meet our targets because something unexpected happens. When you launch your business, you might face a crisis that you just don’t know how to deal with. If you are not prepared to adapt to the situation, this could devastate your business.  \t\n\nAsk: How can you prepare for the unexpected? What would you do in a sudden crisis? (Take Coronavirus or war for example if people can’t think of anything)\nPotential answers:\nChange your strategy\nLearn about your customers main needs during this time\nThink about how your business can have a positive impact on the overall situation\nCut costs where you can\nChange prices/revenue streams\nRenegotiate contracts\nCreate policies and a work environment that is flexible and responsive to change\nCreate a system to communicate information quickly to employees, partners, suppliers, and customers in the event that it is needed\nEtc…\n\nRecap: You need to re-evaluate, re-plan, and take action. You should not quit or take a break, it is time to stand out and make a bigger impact. Adapt your business in every way necessary.\n10\n\nIdentify where you are in the situation \n\nStop the bleeding\n\nAdd value and innovate!\n\nWHAT TO DO WHEN CRISIS HITS\n10-15 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk:  When crisis hits, what are specific things that you can do to protect your business? \nAllow for entrepreneurs to answer freely, but make sure to touch on the points on the slide as well. \nIdentify where you are in the situation: The first thing we have to do is think about where we are. What are all resources we have? What do we do well? Where are opportunities for us to add value. Where are we suffering the most? \nFor example, you might have:\nGreat following on social media\n3 staff members I have to pay but can’t afford\nI have a lot of operational costs I have to keep up\nEmployees are lost and don’t know what to do \nI have a lot of inventory\nClients are reaching out and want to buy, but I can’t deliver my product/service\n\nStop the bleeding: After you identify, where you are suffering, make a plan to stop unnecessary spending and get your situation under control. Basically, cut costs.\nPaid marketing might not be the best idea right now, and is expensive. Switch to organic marketing. It is cheaper and you can use this time to incorporate more content marketing or value added marketing (this could actually help you build a stronger customer base in the end). \nLet go of employees if you must.\nRe-negotiate contracts and deals. Don’t let bills pile up, try to cut costs where you can. \nPartner with competitors if you have to\n\nAdd value and innovate: Entrepreneurs should ask themselves “How could I be a winner in this?”. Add value that can transition into new sales, new customers, new revenue streams, and more.\nManage your community, call your customers, and strengthen relationships\nFollow trends. Where is the crisis forcing you to go? See if you can follow it instead of fight it.\nFor example, during COVID 19, many traditional business had to shut down because nobody could go out. However, there were many successful business that survived COVID because they were able to transition online quickly (that’s where the market went). \nAdapt your products/services to meet the needs of the current situation.\n\nRecap: You need to be adaptable in all areas of your business. You must be able to adapt your marketing, operational, and strategic plan to reflect the current situation. You can always shift back when the situation is back to normal (or maybe you change for the better and keep some innovative changes). \nWhen you are in this type of situation, always think:\nHow should I be marketing right now? \nHow can I be operating right now? \nWhat is my strategy, to get through this situation?\nWhat do my customers really need right now? \n11\n\nCRISIS MANAGEMENT\n“Never let a good crisis go to waste”\n- Winston Churchill\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\nAsk: What do you think of this quote?\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts on this quote. \nThere is opportunity in every situation. When there is a crisis, people are in need. It is the role of your business to relieve the pain, frustration, and find innovative solutions. Businesses solve problems and make customers’ lives easier. When people are suffering, there is so much opportunity to make things better!\nYou are forced to innovate by finding creative ways to cut costs and add value.\nWhen there is a crisis, innovative companies are the ones who take us out of the situation and make things better. \n\nRecap:\nWhen you are in a crisis, don’t panic or make rushed decisions. Instead:\nFirst, focus on survival: Identify the immediate problems and take action to stabilize the business.\nThen, regroup and reassess: Once things are under control, look at what can be adjusted.\nFinally, explore how you can use the crisis as an opportunity: Businesses that adapt their operations strategically can often come out stronger.\n“A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”  - Winston Churchill\n\n[[original version - Recap: When you are in a crisis, don’t break down and make risky decisions. Think logically and find the opportunity in the situation. First, we have to survive and stop the bleeding. Then you need to get yourself together and regroup. Think about how you can actually grow and take advantage of the situation! “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”  - Winston Churchill ]]]\n\n15 minutes: Activity\n10 minutes: Group discussion\nBreak into groups of 3-5 people\nAsk: How is risk management connected with decision making? (Encourages discussion on how crisis decisions require balancing risk and opportunity.)\nAsk: What decisions need to be made immediately when there is a crisis? (Focus on short-term vs. long-term decision-making.)\nAsk: Who will be in charge of implementing those decisions? (Encourages thinking about leadership and delegation in high-pressure situations.)\n\n5 minutes: Share\nBring everyone back to the room and discuss:\nWhat were some of the key takeaways from your discussion?\n12\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\nWrap up: 5 minutes!\n13\n"

As we are getting close to the end of the program, check in on their milestones and pitch progress.\n\n9:15 | Begin the session\nGood morning everyone! How are you doing today? \nToday, we are going into risk and crisis management. We will talk about decision making and how that ties into risk and managing your business.\n\n\nReflect on your decision-making style, and pinpoint strengths and weaknesses.\n\nDevelop an initial risk management strategy adaptable to changing circumstances (e.g., climate impacts, market shifts).\n\nLearn strategies to adapt swiftly and innovatively during crises.\n\n\n\n\n1 minutes: Objectives\n\nReflect on your decision making style, and pinpoint strength and weaknesses\nSet an initial risk management strategy and learn how to adapt it over time.\nLearn a few strategies to adapt when you are in a crisis.\n\n\nA Plane Crash Activity\n25 minutes: Activity\n\nStart the session off with an activity that will help entrepreneurs evaluate their decision making style.\n5 minutes: Explain the situation and answer questions\nHand out the plane crash game information\nYou have just survived a plane crash. Both the pilot and co-pilot were killed in the crash; however you and a number of passengers survived. It is mid-January, and you are in Northern Canada. The daily temperature is -4 degrees Celsius (-24 degrees Fahrenheit), and the night time temperature gets even colder. There is snow on the ground, and the countryside has many trees with several small rivers crisscrossing the area. The nearest town is about 20 miles away. You are all dressed in city clothes appropriate for a business meeting. \nRules:\nYou must decide how to work together to survive or get help. \nYou only have a few minutes before the plane explodes. Go through the plane wreckage to salvage five items from the list below.\nDecide your strategy (either to walk to the nearest village, or wait for help).\n\n20 minutes: Activity:\n3-5 minutes: Part 1\nIndividual work \nEach person should rank the importance of each item and choose their top 4 choices\nChoose your strategy (stay put or walk to find the closest town)\n15 minutes: Part 2\nGroup work, after entrepreneurs do it themselves, break them into groups of about 5 people \nAs a group, make a decision on the 5 items you will choose\nAs a group, decide on your strategy (stay put or walk to find the closest town)\n\nHow to score:\nEach team should list its top 5 choices in order prior to seeing the answer sheet. \nTo award points, look at the ranking numbers on this answer sheet. Award points to each team’s top choices according to the numbers here. For example, the map would earn 12 points, while the steel wool would earn 2 points. \nLowest score wins (and survives).\nIf the team wasn’t able to come to a conclusion, they died!\nTypically, if you choose to leave the plane, you will likely freeze and die! It is easy to track a crashed plane, but not as easy to track people lost in the woods.- Bring this up as a point to consider for those who chose to leave. \nConsider giving a small prize to the survivors! Or if anyone “died” in the game, they have to do something nice for the survivors.\n\nIn your business, you’ll use the Risk Category Worksheet to identify similar risks—like power outages or supplier issues—and the Business Efficiency Workbook to plan actions.” Purpose: Sets the stage for using the tools later, framing the activity as a precursor to structured risk assessment.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MAKE DECISIONS?\n20 minutes: Discussion\n\nDebrief from the activity. Have a discussion on their experience during this “crisis”. \nPotential questions to ask to get the conversation going include: \nWhat did you learn during the activity? What were the consequences of your choices? \n\nWhat roles did group members adopt? \nWas there a leader, a manager, a timekeeper, a facilitator, a slacker, etc… Which roles were helpful and which were not?\nWhat kinds of behavior helped or hindered the group?\nWho influenced the decisions and how?\nDid people listen to each other? If not why not? \n\nWhat are the main differences from when you did it alone or when you did it within the group?\nAlone: Fast, confident, easy, maybe wrong maybe right (depending on the person)\nGroup: Slow, a lot more voices and discussion, harder to make a decision, more ideas, more variety of ideas, better ideas, \n\nHow did your group’s decision-making process affect what you prioritized?\n(Prompt participants to reflect on whether they focused on immediate needs or long-term survival.)\n\nHow were decisions made? How was conflict managed while deciding on what to do?\nVoting\nA leader told everyone what to do\nRandom choices\nEmotionally based choices\nLogical decisions\nDiscussion and agreement\nLook at the facts\nListen to other opinions\nEvaluate pros and cons\n\nWere there trade-offs in your choices?\nExample: Did you sacrifice one priority for another, such as warmth vs. mobility, or safety vs. speed?\n\nDid anyone notice how different people communicated based on the communication aspects that you ranked yourself during the last leadership class?\n\nWhat prevented good decision making? How could better decisions have been made?\nNot enough information available. It would have been good to do research or find an expert on the matter.\nEmotional attachments to one of the solutions (maybe you or a friend came up with the idea, for example)\nTeam members not heard or considered. Anyone on the team could have had a great idea, but if nobody heard you, it is pointless. Consider this point both if you are the loud person (let others speak) and if you are the quiet one (find a way to be heard by speaking up or influencing others who can speak for you)\nFear can impact decisions. Although this isn’t real, if you were in a real crisis, you wouldn’t be able to think clearly.\n\nRecap: The way that you reacted in this game reflects how you would react in real life. The role you played shows who you are on a team (the one who leads, the one who isn’t heard, the one who sits back and lets others decide, etc…). It also shows how you evaluate risk and make decisions in real life. Were you logical and tried to find the right answer? Did you try to appease the group and just settle on something to move on to avoid conflict? Did you prevent a decision from being made because you were stubborn? There is no good or bad in this; however, it is an opportunity to reflect on your style and pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses as a decision maker. \n\nEvery decision you make as an individual, team, or organization has an element of risk involved that will affect your business. Here, your decisions risked your life. In business, your decisions risk other things. Sometimes you have to make quick decisions that could impact your business, your team, your shareholders (if you have any), and your customers.  \n\nAsk: What are some business decisions that can bring risk to your business? Where can they be rewarding and where can the risk cause harm? \nPotential answers: \nHiring the right right/wrong person \nInvesting in parts of your business\nCertain partnerships can be risky/rewarding\nDecisions have an impact on your brand and how people talk about you\nDoing something illegal or socially unaccepted (possibly for quick financial gain)\nChoosing to implement an emergency action plan or not\nChoosing to launch a new product or not can set you apart from your competitors and be rewarding, or it can make you run out of money if it isn’t developed and launched accurately.\nAll of these decisions could impact:\nBrand reputation\nFinancial security and profitability\nCustomer trust\nEmployee trust and commitment\nLegal ramifications\nEtc…\n\nTransition: On one hand, you have risk, but on the other hand you have reward. When you make decisions, there are both elements of risk and reward. The key is to make decisions that are well thought-out and adaptable, so that you can adjust if things don’t go as planned.  For the rest of the session, we will look at risks and how to make decisions while considering the risk involved at each step. By evaluating these risks, you set yourself up for better decision making in the long run. \n\n4\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nIdentify Risks\nMeasure, Control and Monitor\nAssess and Analyze the Risk\nPlan Action\nImplement\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nEvery decision you make now has an element of risk to it and will impact your business in one way or another. If you have the time to break down your decisions through a risk perspective, you should. Although you can’t predict the future impact of your decisions, you can at least think through the different risk factors and have a plan to adapt to the unexpected quickly.\n\nAsk: What are some business decisions that can bring risk to your business? Where can they be rewarding and where can the risk cause harm? \nPotential answers: \nHiring the right right/wrong person \nInvesting in parts of your business\nCertain partnerships can be risky/rewarding\nDecisions have an impact on your brand and how people talk about you\nDoing something illegal or socially unaccepted (possibly for quick financial gain)\nChoosing to implement an emergency action plan or not\nChoosing to launch a new product or not can set you apart from your competitors and be rewarding, or it can make you run out of money if it isn’t developed and launched accurately.\nAll of these decisions could impact:\nBrand reputation\nFinancial security and profitability\nCustomer trust\nEmployee trust and commitment\nLegal ramifications\nSupply chain stability\nOperational costs\nEtc…\n\nRecap: Each decision has an opportunity to reward you or hurt you and the future of your business. That depends on the riskiness of the decision you are making. It is your job to be able to evaluate these risks and figure out what the best strategic move to make is.  Each of you should have a plan for risk mitigation and management. Risk management is all about thinking ahead to try to understand what might cause an issue, then take the steps necessary to avoid the problem and reduce losses wherever you can. \n\nRisk management steps to help guide you through the process of creating a risk management plan include:\nIdentify risks: Define the problems and risks that might arise for your business. There are some obvious ones, and some that are less obvious. You should think about your business to see where there are higher opportunities for risk. Each business will face different ones. \nAssess and analyze the risk: Look at each of the risks you have identified. Try to prioritize them and see which ones are the riskiest and could cause the most harm. Evaluate them through factors that you consider to be important. \nPlan action: Make a decision on what to do. Common decisions include:  \nDo nothing. This can be an option and it is totally fine. Make sure you really understand the situation before you choose to “do nothing”.\nWait for the risky event to happen and have a plan to fix it\nMitigate the risk altogether. \nImplement: Implement whatever it is you decided to do. If it is a mitigation strategy start it. If it is just waiting for it to occur, make sure that everyone on the team knows how to respond when/if it does.\nMeasure, control, and monitor: Monitor the situation. Whether you implemented a risk mitigation strategy or chose to ignore the risk (because it wasn’t risky enough to implement something), make sure that you don’t forget about your decision. \nIt is a cycle and you should continue to look ahead to spot future risks so that you can plan accordingly.\n\n\nWhen identifying risks, businesses can categorize them under three main areas:\nPeople: Employee well-being, customer safety, and the impact of business decisions on staff and community.\nProfit: Funding sources changing, demand fluctuations, customer priorities changing in crisis….\nPlanet: Resource dependency, operational costs, and external risks like energy prices or environmental regulations.\n\nPotential questions:\nHow does the risk management process tie into decision making? When you have to make a decision, you are presented with a series of alternative actions you can make. Each alternative has a different level of risk and reward. You should assess the risk- reward of each of those options and make a decision. Once you decide on a course of action, make a plan for mitigating some of those risks that you thought of before. Monitor your decision so you know if you need to step in and make a change at any point.\n\nAsk: What business risks have you identified in your Risk Category Worksheet? How can efficiency or resilience strategies (e.g., reducing energy dependency) mitigate these?\n\nRecap: Risk management is about thinking ahead. The worksheet helps you identify and prioritize risks, while the Business Efficiency Workbook helps you plan actions that enhance resilience—like reducing operational costs through efficiency.\n5\n\nRISK PLANNING\nYou are starting a tourism business, what are the internal and external risks you might face for the first 6 months of operation? \n15-20 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nHave a brainstorm on the board with the class. Give a business situation and determine what the risks a business might face. Go through all of the steps that would be needed to fill out the tool as a discussion on the board.\nAsk: What kind of risks might you find for this example?\nPotential answers:\nMarket risks due to competition\nWell known tourism agencies reduce their prices when I can’t.\nNew competition enters the market making the current marketing plans obsolete.\nPeople follow the trend and go online making my primary sales channel obsolete. \nInexperienced marketing and sales team cause low brand awareness and sales. \n\nTechnical risks related to the technical side of the business\nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one)\nCar breaks down so you can’t go on tours\n\nLegal risks \nUnexpected changes or new regulations on tourism\nDanger of being sued if someone gets injured on your tour\nAn important contract is broken\n\nNatural risks related to climate and natural disasters.\nGlobal pandemics (COVID 19, for example)\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible\nEarthquakes or fires affecting the team and the office\n\nOperational risks related to delivering your product/service to the customer\nTour guide gets sick and can’t go on tours\nPartner organization (that organizes flights, for example) closes or raise their prices so you can use them anymore\nTerrorism and violence is always a possibility that can have an impact on the market and how you operate within the situation.\nHigh dependency on a single supplier or resource, making operations vulnerable to delays or shortages\n\nFinancial risks: \nRun out of cash\nSomething breaks down and you need to replace it unexpectedly\nCustomer refuses to pay you after you spent money on delivering a tour\nIncreasing costs of raw materials or services that directly impact pricing strategy.\n\n\nAfter you pinpointed several risks for the business, choose a few to focus on and go through the points reflected on the tool described on the next slides. \nWrite all the answers on the board. An example of outcomes from the discussion are shown below.\nAsk the following questions for each risk:\nWhat is the likelihood of it actually happening? \nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): Very high likelihood due to the early stage of the app\nRun out of cash: High likelihood since it is an early stage startup\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: Low likelihood. Temperatures and weather have been stable and predictable the past several years. \nA key supplier stops providing materials, affecting production: Medium likelihood, especially if no backup plan is in place.\n\nWhat is the financial impact on your business if this happens?\nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): Low impact. We have several sales channels to if the app doesn’t work, the business will be ok. We also have a CTO that can fix bugs free of charge. \nRun out of cash: High impact. I will have to reduce staff and marketing which will lower customers and sales. \nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: High impact. Outdoor tours are a big part of what we do especially for international clients; however, tours with locals . \nA sudden rise in material costs increases product/service pricing: Medium to high impact, depending on how price-sensitive customers are.\n\nWhen might this risk actually happen? \nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): It is an immediate risk because the product hasn’t been tested much. \nRun out of cash. It is a low risk: We have a firm cash management plan and funding secured for the next year and a half.\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: Long term risk. Temperatures and weather have been stable; however, there is evidence the climate change will have a big impact in the coming years. \nSupply chain delays due to external disruptions: Medium risk—global trends in logistics and shipping can affect material availability.\n\n\n\nRISK EVALUATION:\n5 minutes: Demonstration\n\nGo onto the excel sheet and demonstrate how to use the risk evaluation document. \nTake 2-3 examples that you did on the board and put them into the matrix to see what the impact score is. \nMake sure to highlight:\nWhat each term means in each category\nHow the score is added up\nHow to change the scoring and categories by changing options on sheet 2. Simple changes on sheet 2 will automatically change on sheet 1 (it is more complicated to add rows or categories. If you do, just follow the formulas in the other categories or ask for help)\nThis is relative, and not 100% accurate. A risk should be evaluated from many perspectives and each perspective has a different weight in terms of importance. Don’t just rely on this. This is a very quantitative view of the process; however, don’t forget about a qualitative reflection as well. Think about all of the other factors that need to be considered before making a plan.\nThis can be adapted in other ways and you don’t always have to use this exact matrix. When you have a decision to make, or you are evaluating risk, think of a few key points that you want to evaluate, weigh their importance, and compare alternatives. You see how we did it on the board together, you can do that again in real life\n\n\nSET A PLAN!\n35 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nYou can explain this on the board or continue the demonstration from the previous slide.\nNext is all about implementing a strategy and monitoring the risk over time.\nNow you need to make a decision on what to do. For each of your major risks, you should have a plan to deal with the situation.\nThe trainer should go through each category and explain why it is an important aspect of the risk mitigation process:\nAction plan: Don’t just go with the first option you think of. Carefully evaluate your options and alternatives if something were to happen. Write your action plan that will help you mitigate this risk or make a plan for if this were to happen.\nAsk: What are the things you might want to consider when deciding what to do for this situation?\nPotential answers:\nAssociated costs\nImpact on brand and reputation\nTime needed to implement this plan\nPeople needed to be able to implement the plan\nResponsibility: Once you decide what the best course of action is, highlight who would be involved in implementing this if it were to happen. You should actually speak to the team member to get them on board so that they know what their responsibility is ahead of time. \nAction plan status: What steps are you putting in place for this risk (if anything)? If there are steps you are putting into place now, put some dates on when you want it complete. When do you plan on re-evaluating this risk? \n\n30 minutes: Activity\nEntrepreneurs should think about the risks associated with their business and come up with some strategies to mitigate these risks or deal with them if/when they arise. \nThink about immediate risks first, but don’t forget about the risks that might arise down the line as well.\nThe trainer will be around to help entrepreneurs think through risks directly related to their business\n\nRISK EVALUATION:\n5 minutes: Demonstration\n\nGo onto the excel sheet and demonstrate how to use the risk evaluation document. \nTake 2-3 examples that you did on the board and put them into the matrix to see what the impact score is. \nHow risk categories are structured in your assessment\nExplain how risks are categorized (e.g., Resource Costs, Supply Security, Market Changes).\nHow risks are scored in your assessment\nShow how to assign scores for Severity, Timeframe, Likelihood, and Priority.\nIntroduce Impact Areas as a factor to measure risks tied to waste, supply chain dependencies, and operational inefficiencies.\nHighlight how different risks (e.g., high electricity costs, supplier instability) are evaluated based on their financial, operational, and efficiency impact.\nHow the scoring system informs decision-making\nExplain how high-priority risks should be addressed first.\n\nSET A PLAN!\n35 minutes: Lecture + activity\n3-5 minutes: Lecture - The Risk-Efficiency Connection \"Now that you've evaluated your risks, it's time to implement strategies and monitor them over time.

You have a clear budget, timeline, strategy, and a framework to evaluate and mitigate risks. As we discussed earlier, you can mitigate many of these risks through careful planning; however, sometimes things happen, and we are put in a challenging position where we can’t meet our targets because something unexpected happens. When you launch your business, you might face a crisis that you just don’t know how to deal with. If you are not prepared to adapt to the situation, this could devastate your business.  \t\n\nAsk: How can you prepare for the unexpected? What would you do in a sudden crisis? (Take Coronavirus or war for example if people can’t think of anything)\nPotential answers:\nChange your strategy\nLearn about your customers main needs during this time\nThink about how your business can have a positive impact on the overall situation\nCut costs where you can\nChange prices/revenue streams\nRenegotiate contracts\nCreate policies and a work environment that is flexible and responsive to change\nCreate a system to communicate information quickly to employees, partners, suppliers, and customers in the event that it is needed\nEtc…\n\nRecap: You need to re-evaluate, re-plan, and take action. You should not quit or take a break, it is time to stand out and make a bigger impact. Adapt your business in every way necessary.\n11\n\nIdentify where you are in the situation \n\nStop the bleeding\n\nAdd value and innovate!\n\nWHAT TO DO WHEN CRISIS HITS\n10-15 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk:  When crisis hits, what are specific things that you can do to protect your business? \nAllow for entrepreneurs to answer freely, but make sure to touch on the points on the slide as well. \nIdentify where you are in the situation: The first thing we have to do is think about where we are. What are all resources we have? What do we do well? Where are opportunities for us to add value. Where are we suffering the most? \nFor example, you might have:\nGreat following on social media\n3 staff members I have to pay but can’t afford\nI have a lot of operational costs I have to keep up\nEmployees are lost and don’t know what to do \nI have a lot of inventory\nClients are reaching out and want to buy, but I can’t deliver my product/service\n\nStop the bleeding: After you identify, where you are suffering, make a plan to stop unnecessary spending and get your situation under control. Basically, cut costs.\nPaid marketing might not be the best idea right now, and is expensive. Switch to organic marketing. It is cheaper and you can use this time to incorporate more content marketing or value added marketing (this could actually help you build a stronger customer base in the end). \nLet go of employees if you must.\nRe-negotiate contracts and deals. Don’t let bills pile up, try to cut costs where you can. \nPartner with competitors if you have to\n\nAdd value and innovate: Entrepreneurs should ask themselves “How could I be a winner in this?”. Add value that can transition into new sales, new customers, new revenue streams, and more.\nManage your community, call your customers, and strengthen relationships\nFollow trends. Where is the crisis forcing you to go? See if you can follow it instead of fight it.\nFor example, during COVID 19, many traditional business had to shut down because nobody could go out. However, there were many successful business that survived COVID because they were able to transition online quickly (that’s where the market went). \nAdapt your products/services to meet the needs of the current situation.\n\nRecap: You need to be adaptable in all areas of your business. You must be able to adapt your marketing, operational, and strategic plan to reflect the current situation. You can always shift back when the situation is back to normal (or maybe you change for the better and keep some innovative changes). \nWhen you are in this type of situation, always think:\nHow should I be marketing right now? \nHow can I be operating right now? \nWhat is my strategy, to get through this situation?\nWhat do my customers really need right now? \n12\n\nCRISIS MANAGEMENT\n“Never let a good crisis go to waste”\n- Winston Churchill\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\nAsk: What do you think of this quote?\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts on this quote. \nThere is opportunity in every situation. When there is a crisis, people are in need. It is the role of your business to relieve the pain, frustration, and find innovative solutions. Businesses solve problems and make customers’ lives easier. When people are suffering, there is so much opportunity to make things better!\nYou are forced to innovate by finding creative ways to cut costs and add value.\nWhen there is a crisis, innovative companies are the ones who take us out of the situation and make things better. \n\nRecap:\nWhen you are in a crisis, don’t panic or make rushed decisions. Instead:\nFirst, focus on survival: Identify the immediate problems and take action to stabilize the business.\nThen, regroup and reassess: Once things are under control, look at what can be adjusted.\nFinally, explore how you can use the crisis as an opportunity: Businesses that adapt their operations strategically can often come out stronger.\n“A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”  - Winston Churchill\n\n[[original version - Recap: When you are in a crisis, don’t break down and make risky decisions. Think logically and find the opportunity in the situation. First, we have to survive and stop the bleeding. Then you need to get yourself together and regroup. Think about how you can actually grow and take advantage of the situation! “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”  - Winston Churchill ]]]\n\n15 minutes: Activity\n10 minutes: Group discussion\nBreak into groups of 3-5 people\nAsk: How is risk management connected with decision making? (Encourages discussion on how crisis decisions require balancing risk and opportunity.)\nAsk: What decisions need to be made immediately when there is a crisis? (Focus on short-term vs. long-term decision-making.)\nAsk: Who will be in charge of implementing those decisions? (Encourages thinking about leadership and delegation in high-pressure situations.)\n\n5 minutes: Share\nBring everyone back to the room and discuss:\nWhat were some of the key takeaways from your discussion?\n13\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\nWrap up: 5 minutes!\n14\n"

How are you doing today? \nThe session today will be a bit lighter than the others. We want to make sure that we are not giving you too much work or overwhelming you before the pitch. Although this wont be a heavy session, we will cover very important points that all entrepreneurs should know about in this context we are operating in. \n1\n\nGo over some entrepreneurship and tech trends around the world and in the MENA region, \nIdentify challenges and opportunities in the region and place your business in the current context,\nDiscuss the different key actors in the region and brainstorm ways to work with the current players.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nGo over some entrepreneurship and tech trends around the world and in the MENA region, \nIdentify challenges and opportunities in the region and place your business in the current context,\nDiscuss the different key actors in the region and brainstorm ways to work with the current players.\n\n\nMENA CONTEXT\n15 minutes: Discussion\n\nUp to this point, you all have been through Ignite, you have done research, you have spoken to business people, and you have been working on your businesses for a while now. \nAsk: How do you see the landscape? Is this business environment conducive to starting a business? What are some of the challenges and opportunities that you see?\nPotential answers might include points that are on the following slides or topics that aren’t mentioned at all. Let the conversation flow even if it will repeat points later on. \n\nCHALLENGES IN IRAQ\nLegal barriers\nOnline Payments\nKnowledge & skills gap\nLack of Funding\nBusiness Operational Challenges\n4\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nRecap from the brainstorm earlier to highlight these points:\nLegal barriers: There is an unclear legal process for startups. Especially tech businesses have a very difficult time registering their businesses because there is no official legal framework that innovative businesses fit into.\nOnline Payments: The challenge is that not many people actually use these systems. Therefore, businesses don’t usually integrate them into their business model. The more frequently that businesses offer the opportunities to use them, the more likely people will use them. \nKnowledge & skills gap: There are some technical skills gaps here. Coding talent for example is rare to find. Either people are recently learning and are a it inexperienced, or they are so expensive because they are the only options available. \nLack of Funding: Most of the funding for startups has been coming from NGOs or outside organizations. Banks offer very high interest rates so it can be unreasonable for a startup to take out a loan and survive under the debt. Investment is rare as well, but there has been an increasing number of local and international investment interest in the past few years!\nBusiness Operational Challenges: Many startups struggle with inefficiencies in supply chains, logistics, and process management, making it harder to scale.\n\n4\n\nOPPORTUNITIES IN IRAQ\n5\nEconomic growth\nMarket gaps\nInternational interest\nIncreasing local investment\nPassionate youth\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nAlthough there are some obvious challenges and hurdles that you guys have to get through, there are many opportunities as well.\nRecap from the brainstorm earlier to highlight these points:\nEconomic growth: As the economy strengthens, there is more disposable income and more free flowing money. We can see that the economy is starting to bounce back which shows a high probability that we will see faster business growth and even more investments. \nMarket gaps: With visible market gaps, there are clear areas of opportunity. The more challenges that are around is directly correlated with the amount of opportunities. Additionally, because Iraq lags behind some other countries in filling these gaps, there is an opportunity to mimic best practices and apply concepts here.\nIncreasing international interest: As we saw in the previous slides, there has been a clear growth of investment in the region. Although those numbers were regional and not based in Iraq, it is showing that people are interested. These investments are starting to trickle over here as we are starting to see more and more interest from international and local investment deals being made, plus more of an interest from other organizations such as the world bank.\nIncreasing local investment: 2019 was a record year by number of deals in MENA-based startups - The MENA region surpassed 550 deals for the first time ever - The number of deals increased by 31% in the MENA region from 2018 to 2019. 70-75% of these investments are actually from regional investors and not international (this information is from Magnitt, an online resource with lots of regional research and data). It is really great to see the regional investors growing in numbers because you need to have local buy in on startups. Local investors typically have a better understanding of the local context and could be a better source of support for a local business.\nPassionate youth interested in entrepreneurship: A huge opportunity is the fact that there are so many people who are interested in entrepreneurship. You guys (the entrepreneurs sitting in the room) are the ones that are going to bring new and innovative solutions to todays problems. There are s many of you applying to our programs, going through Ignite, joining webinars, working with our partner organizations, etc… You all have so many great ideas. As long as there are passionate people with ideas, there are so many opportunities.\n5\n\nINVESTMENT IN MENA\nGrowing investments\nCOVID impacted investment\nEgypt leads investment\n$251M\n$210M\n$261M\n$140M\n$43M\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nLets take a look at the MENA region and see what investment actually looks like here.\nGive some key highlights of the Magnitt 2020 investment report:\n$277M was invested in 108 startup investment deals in MENA, an increase of 2% in total funding from Q1 '19 to Q1 '20;\nA 22% drop in number of deals from Q1 '19 to Q1 '20;\nMarch saw a significant drop in deal announcements due to the spread of COVID-19.\nA staggering majority (82%) of all investments in the first quarter were at the early stage. The report highlights a gradual increase in later-stage deals since 2015, suggesting that the ecosystem is maturing.\nHowever, there is no doubt that pandemic took its toll on the quarter. March alone saw a 67% decrease in number of deals compared to March 2019, as an early sign of the COVID-19 impact on investments.\nCompared to last year’s H1 report, MAGNiTT has pointed out an increase of 66% in total funding and 28% in number of deals, while, in terms of sectors, fintech maintains its top position as the most active industry with 17% of the deals made, followed by e-commerce at 12%, and delivery and transport at 8%. \n\nAsk: What do you think are the factors that typically affect investment? What about right things happening right now? \nGlobal political factors\nGlobal economy\nCoronavirus: While investors highlighted to MAGNiTT that they are still actively looking to invest, the true ramifications of the crisis are not expected to be seen until several months after the start of the crisis. The fundraising exercise often takes several months for founders and investors, delaying the impact of the current situation. \n\nMost information is from this report: https://magnitt.com/news/51728/magnitt-intelligence-q1-2020-increase-funding-deals-took-hit-march\n\n\n\n6\n\nINVESTMENT IN MENA\n7\nTHE TOP 5 FUNDING ROUNDS ACCOUNTED FOR 61% OF ALL MENA STARTUP FUNDING IN Q1 2020\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nRead the text on the slide: “The top 5 funding rounds accounted for 61% of all MENA startup funding in Q1 2020.\nAsk: What does this mean? \nMost of the money is going to a few players. \nThese companies are getting huge deals, but that isn’t the norm\nit can be seen that the majority of the top 5 funding rounds were announced before the crisis forced many countries into lockdown. Kitopi, Vezeeta, and SellAnyCar, who together raised $135M, all raised their funding rounds in February 2020, with only Halan announcing its funding round during the lockdown period.\n\nShare some information about these regional success stories: \nKitopi: Cloud kitchen platform that partners with restaurants to expand their reach based in Dubai\nVezeeta: Healthcare booking platform based in Egypt.\nSellanycar.com: A site to buy and sell cars based in Dubai\nNana: Online grocery platform based in Saudi Arabia\nHalan: Ride hailing app that also does logistics and deliveries for businesses based in Egypt.\n\nAsk: What are the leading factors leading to investment in 2020? What businesses are being invested in now? \nIn a recent report that Magnitt published, figures show that $277 million were invested in the Middle Eastern startup ecosystem in Q1 Y2020. \nThe Egyptian ecosystem enjoyed the biggest chunk of deals, accounting for 37% of deals that occurred during the past three months, followed by the United Arab Emirates that accounted for 25%. Startups based in the UAE raised 51% of total funding in the quarter, followed by those based in Egypt who raised 27%. \nMeanwhile, startups based in the emerging entrepreneurial empire of Saudi Arabia accounted for 10% of overall funding, mainly attributed to Nana’s $18 million deal.\nAccording to the report, the UAE is the most active ecosystem in the region, having secured 26% of the deals made in H1, followed by Egypt at 21%, and Lebanon at 13%. MAGNiTT has earmarked Saudi Arabia as one of the fastest growing ecosystems, having recorded 26 investments for the same period.\nIn the time of coronavirus it comes by no surprise that Fin-tech remains on top of the ecosystem, in its grip 15% of investment deals in the past three months. With almost a tie, Delivery & Transport follows, then comes E-commerce with 13% of the deals and Food & Beverage with 9%.\nSpeaking of which, the Food & Beverage industry witnessed the highest total funding of $74 million, making up 27% of funding in the MENA region – thanks to Kitopi’s $60 million deal.\n\nWhat these startups are saying:\nHalan: He explained that there are no tech-based competitors providing services to their target market, “We’re really competing with the local tuk-tuk drivers and the local stores that sell products. We want to be present in every village in the country.” Halan’s CEO in his Wired interview said that they expect to break even in 2024 with the focus on sustainable growth for now, “Our unit economics have been improving dramatically since the start of 2019. Profitability is a key target in our strategy—it’s just not an immediate one.”\n\nNana: “Scale is the name of the game,” the founder of Nana adds. “Startups will need to learn how to be efficient with their capital, and benefit from government programs to be able to set up in multiple jurisdictions to become interesting for investment rounds at later stages. Hiring talent remains a key issue, especially in the UAE. \n\n\nMost information is from this report: https://magnitt.com/news/51728/magnitt-intelligence-q1-2020-increase-funding-deals-took-hit-march\n\n7\n\nSUCCESS STORIES IN IRAQ\n8\nMiswag\nSandoog\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nLocal success stories:\nOver the past few years we have been seeing more and more businesses tackle these challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that are here. There are several startups who have been embraced by the market and are growing rapidly. Some have even received investment. To name just a few successful stories, we can look at Sandoog, Lezzo, and Miswag.\nBriefly discuss these success stories:\nAsk: Do you know these companies? What do they do? How are they perceived in the market? What makes them so successful?\nSandoog is a last mile delivery company. Their business has started from Baghdad and now they are slowly expanding. Although Sandoog is a tech company, the founder (Mustafa) has pointed out how important it is to get the operations of your business running smoothly before you begin to expand (he said this in a CEO talk to our Tech-Incubator participants). There are so many details that you need to control operationally and on the ground. \nLezzoo is a food delivery company. Since they have started they have taken over the market. They were able to look at the gap in the market and do things differently to meet the needs of their customers. The user experience is really easy and intuitive which makes their product great. Since their launch, they have added several new features to better meet customers needs. These features were added slowly and strategically as to not overwhelm their customers or their own operational capabilities. They have been able to expand very quickly to operate in Erbil, Duhok, and Sulaimani.\nMiswag is the first e-commerce service in Iraq. Miswag was developed from scratch by Iraqi entrepreneurs and experts to best fit the young market's requirements. This is another example of a business that started quite small and has been able to expand over time. They are operating their delivery service to all major Iraqi cities. (I got this from their Linked-in page). \n8\n\nKEY ACTORS\n9\nEntrepreneurship\nTech\nDonors & Sponsors\n10 minutes: Discussion \n\nGo over some of the key actors in the region and talk about the role they play in the MENA context and how they help entrepreneurs. \nAsk: How are these businesses helping entrepreneurs navigate the challenges and opportunities we discussed earlier?\nAllow entrepreneurs to discuss the ones they know about. \nBuild off of the conversation by sharing what they do, how they can help entrepreneurs, and how they can get into contact with them (social media, their website, maybe they had someone visit as a judge or CEO talk, etc…)\nYou don’t have to do this for each of them, but pick some of the most important ones and share. \nExplain the link between the organizations focused on entrepreneurship vs tech and how they can work together. \nShare some ideas on ways to work with some of these current players.\nThis can be a brainstorm activity on a Jamboard or the whiteboard.\n9\n\nSPEAKING TO INVESTORS\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Has anyone ever spoken to an investor before? Has anyone been granted funding from another organization? What does the process look like? What are things that you should know or prepare ahead of time? \nLet entrepreneurs share their thoughts on this point.\nThey might come up with something like this:\nApply or reach out to someone who is providing funding\nGive some initial information (maybe it is an executive summary, they saw you pitch, a short meeting, etc…)\nIf they are interested, you might have a second meeting or call to give more information. Details of the business, where the business is going, strategy, competitive advantages, etc…\nInvestors will also assess how efficiently your business operates and how well it manages risk.\nInvestors often prioritize businesses that show clear long-term viability.\nMore formal due diligence process (this can take a while to go back and forth to answer questions and provide details and documents)\nAgreement and signing of a contract or term sheet\nImplementation of plan\nFollow up (there could be several follow ups throughout your agreement to make sure you are reaching your milestones and making progress) \nClose. It could be a short term agreement (granting organizations, banks giving out loans, etc…) or it can be longer term (an investor who is looking 10-20 years down the line). Either way, there should be some conclusion or exit for the investor/grantor. \n\nTransition: In the next slides, we will talk about how to understand investors and what they want, go through a due diligence process, and then actually spend some time preparing some key metrics investors might want to see. \n10\n\nSales \nPromotion\nWHAT DO THEY WANT?\nOR\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nRemember, these people/organizations all have a motive. Nobody is just giving out money because they feel like it. Therefore, when speaking to these people/organizations, make sure you think about why they are giving money out. In order to make a good deal (or get accepted for the grant/loan), make sure that you know what the other person wants! If you know what they want, you can negotiate better with them. Make sure that you know what the other person wants. To get them to accept your business, you should communicate in a way that is tailored to their needs. Don’t lie, just know the right points to highlight. \nGet a discussion going on how to tailor your communication with funders to increase the likelihood of them funding your business.\nAsk: To get them to accept you, what should you consider? \nHow much money are they able to give?\nHow much involvement to they want?\nDay to day involvement\nMonthly updates\nBroader decision making abilities\nSilent relationship\nEtc…\nWhat do they value?\nFinancial returns\nCreating jobs\nSupporting vulnerable people\nThe environment?\nLooking “good” (people who do things just for their ego)\n\nBeing clear on what they want/need will help you make a better decision on if you should even work with them or not. Don’t just take anyone's money! Consider the ramifications of your relationship. \nAsk: Before you accept them, what should you consider? \nWhat are they bringing to the table?\nA strong network\nIndustry knowledge\nBusiness experience\nConnections\nLegal support\nEtc…\nWhat do they want from you?\nHow would they like their returns?\nIs there a payback period? What does that look like and how realistic is it?\nAre you required to do certain things? Are you able/willing to do this?\nHiring requirements, for example\nHow often would they like to communicate? What kind of updates do they require? Are you able/willing to do this?\nIs this something you really want/need?\nDoes this person/organization align with your values?\nDo they fit in with your company culture?\nAre there other options available?\n\nTransition: First, you have to know what they want so that you can be prepared to give them what they want in the due diligence process.\n\n\n\n11\n\nDUE DILIGENCE\u000b\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: Has anyone heard of due diligence before? What does it consist of? Why is it an important step? Who is involved?\nDue diligence is all the research that goes into making a deal. Before any partnership, you need to make sure that you are a good match, you have common end goals, and that both groups are able to contribute useful and forwarding support. \nInvestor DD: Investors (or grantors) want to make sure they are making a wise investment. They need to see that you are the right person to give money to (compared to other startups)\nAsk: What do you think investors (or granting organizations) would like to see from you and your business? Remember they want to protect themselves from risky decisions while also achieving some goal (financial returns or some type of social impact for example) \nPotential answers:\nFinancial history to show that you have made traction and prove that people are actually interested in buying your product/service\nFuture projections to show where you plan to be in the coming years. How you will use the investment. How is the money tied into your growth and sales objectives? What is your action plan to actually get there? \nOperational efficiency – Investors look at how well you manage costs, optimize resources, and ensure smooth processes.\nRisk mitigation strategies – Investors want to see that you understand potential risks and have plans to address them.\nStrong competitive advantages to ensure that you are not easily copied (IP, exclusivity agreements, strategic partnerships, unique technology, etc…). This can help investors see long term and sustainable growth. \nA tested prototype, MVP, or final product/service\nProven business model\nBig market potential\nA strong team that will help you implement your plan and grow (remember that the one man show can be very scary for investors!)\n\nEntrepreneur DD: In addition to investors doing their research on you, you should also do your research on them as well. \nAsk: What would you want to research about a potential investor before making a deal? What are things you could ask them for? \nPotential answers:\nFrequency of meetings and updates that they expect from you\nLevel of involvement for the day to day business activities. If no involvement there, what about the bigger strategic decisions? \nOther businesses they have invested in\nWork history, expertise, industry knowledge\nValues and mission\nWhat is their risk tolerance?\nWhat else can they offer you other than money?\nMentorship\nAdvisory\nNetwork\nLegal support\nEtc… \n\n12\n\nSales Promotion\nReturn on Investment (ROI)\nJobs Created\nSales Secured\nCustomer Acquisition Cost (CAC)\nNet Profit Margin\nRetention/churn Rates\nMeasurable Impact\nBE PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT\n1 hour and 15 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\nAs you continue to build your network, attend events, and grow your business, you might meet someone who is interested in supporting your business (through investment or otherwise). If that happens, you need to be prepared to impress them from the very start. \nAsk: What are the things that you should be able to talk about right off the bat when meeting a potential investor or grantor? \nWrite all of the ideas on the whiteboard and discuss ways to capture and record them. Highlight the WHY behind these points. Why do investors want to see these numbers and in what situations you might want to use these figures.\nPotential answers:\nGo to market strategy\nValue proposition\nTraction\nSales secured\nMeasurable impact\nEtc… \nMake sure to include how to calculate some/all of the points below as well (if you are uncomfortable explaining exactly how to calculate a particular point, remove it from the slide): \nReturn on Investment (ROI): ROI=(net profit/cost of investment)x100. \nMake sure that you know how an investment would impact the business financially. What returns are expected from this money? This is used to compare different investment opportunities. Investors usually look for high returns on their investments.  \nCustomer Acquisition Cost (CAC): CAC=Marketing expenses/# of customers acquired. \nCAC measures the cost of acquiring a new customer. The easiest way to calculate CAC is to pick a specific time period and then divide your cost of marketing and sales by the number of customers you gained. For example, if you spent $1,000 to get 20 customers, your CAC is $50. CAC=Marketing expenses/# of customers acquired.\nChurn Rate: Churn rate = (users at the beginning of a period-users at the end of a period)/users at the beginning of a period.\nAlso known as churn rate, retention rate evaluates the percentage of customers that stay with you and the percentage that leave over a given time period. (That's why it's particularly relevant for subscription business models.)\nFor example, if you started the month with 10 customers, gained five new ones, and lost two, the calculation is 13 (total customers at the end of the month) minus five (new customers) equals eight, divided by 10 equals .8, or 80 percent. That means your retention rate is 80 percent -- you kept 80 percent of your customers.\nOr, if you prefer, you can calculate churn rate in very simple terms: If you have 100 customers at the start of the month and at the end of the month have 97, that means your churn rate is three percent.\nNet Profit Margin: Net Income/Revenue=Net Profit\nThis shows how much the company made in OVERALL profit for every $1 it generates in sales.  It’s calculated as: Net Income/Revenue=Net Profit\nIf a store earned $9,750 in net profit on $50,000 revenue so the net profit margin is %19.5\n\n1 hour: Activity\n50 minutes: Activity\nWork individually to start calculating some of these key metrics.\nGo to the last tab of the financial modeling template. Entrepreneurs can work on the “interesting metrics” section.\nWhat story are you telling around these points? \nA trainer will be around to help answer questions or clarify calculations.\nEntrepreneurs should feel free to support each other as well and work where they are comfortable.\nMake sure to note that they do not need to calculate all of the financial ratios shown. They are there just as an additional resource for them if they are interested. \n\n10 minutes: Share\nCome back into the room and share any new ideas or insights you have. \nWere there any challenges? Talk through any difficulties the entrepreneurs faced\n\n13\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nKeep working on your business plan. Make sure to include the points we discussed about due diligence.\n\nPractice your pitch! – Send Google Slides no later than 5:00 pm on Thursday!\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up!\n14\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nANY QUESTIONS?\n]]]"
