Joe Edelman is my friend, use what you know about him and the content I provide to write a great recommendation letter from Joe to the UK visa office:\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to endorse Bilal as an exceptional talent and recognized leader in the field of technology, specifically in the areas of tech innovation spaces and education technology. I have known Bilal since 2014 and have had the pleasure of witnessing his exceptional work in these areas.\n\nAs the founder of the School for Social Design, I have worked extensively in the fields of technology and design. I developed the meaning-based organizational metrics at Couchsurfing.com, co-founded the Center for Humane Technology with Tristan Harris, and coined the term “Time Well Spent” for a family of metrics adopted by teams at Facebook, Google, and Apple. My previous career was in HCI and programming language design.\n\nBilal has been an integral part of the tech innovation and education technology space, and I have been impressed with his work in these areas. His dedication to promoting meaningful technology has been inspiring, and his efforts in building community technology spaces and developing educational software have had a significant positive impact on the communities he serves.\n\nIn my opinion, Bilal is an exceptional talent and a recognized leader in his field. He has a unique set of skills and experiences that make him an asset to any organization. I am confident that he will continue to excel in his career and make significant contributions to the community.\n\nTherefore, I highly recommend Bilal for the UK's Global Talent endorsement process. He is a standout candidate who has demonstrated exceptional talent, leadership, and dedication throughout his career. I have no doubt that he will be an asset to any organization and make significant contributions to the UK's economy and community.\n\nThank you for considering Bilal for this endorsement, and please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoe Edelman\n\n\n\nbg@bilalghalib.com\ncan you make it more concise and sound more natural.

You can contact me on twitter.\n\nWelcome\nComputation\nPhilosophy\nGame Design\nBackground\nBuilding a Second Heart / Augmenting Human Souls, 2021 A research demo for a writing interface backed by a database of values.\n\nSocial Programming Considered as a Habitat for Groups, 2019 A new way to code up social apps and information systems emerges from studying how people use ordinary speech to set up social roles and obligations.\n\nTech Products (that Don't Cause Depression and War), 2021 An introduction to the Values-Based Social Design method.\n\nFour Ideas for Better Human Systems, 2016 A summary of some technological applications of my research.\n\nChoicemaking and the Interface, 2014 Theories of choice from economics and philosophy suggest information requirements for good choices. In view of these requirements, we can see why current menus lead toward regrettable and isolating choices.\n\nWelcome\nComputation\nPhilosophy\nGame Design\nBackground\nValues, Preferences, Meaningful Choice, 2022 I present a conception of values as attention policies resulting from constitutive judgements, and use it to build an alternative preference relation, Meaningful Choice, which retains many desirable features of revealed preference.\n\nMaking Values Concrete, 2021 Values as constitutive attentional policies.\n\nHow to Design Social Systems (Without Causing Depression and War), 2018 A model of human choicemaking in terms of evolving and practicing values, and a design method to go with it.\n\nNothing to be Done, 2017 Intellectual history of the west, from a designers' standpoint, as a succession of approaches to human systems.\n\nIs Anything Worth Maximizing, 2016 About how metrics affect the structure of organizations and societies, how they change the economy, how we’re doing them wrong, and how we could do them right.\n\nWelcome\nComputation\nPhilosophy\nGame Design\nBackground\nFind my games on meaning.supplies\n\nWelcome\nComputation\nPhilosophy\nGame Design\nBackground\nMy philosophy work descends clearly from Amartya Sen, Charles Taylor, David Velleman, and Ruth Chang.\n\nIn tech, I was lucky to learn from people like Alan Kay, Terry Winograd, and Bill Verplank at Interval Research, from Casey Fenton at CouchSurfing (where I developed the metrics which guided the company), from Howie Shrobe and Marvin Minksy at MIT. And more recently through conversations with Bret Victor and Rob Ochshorn.\n\nMy tactic of running social experiments through games and performance emerged from study with Christian Wolff (partipatory music) and Peter Parnell (playwriting) at Dartmouth, and then various improvisational scores with Nancy Stark Smith, Mike Vargas, Ruth Zaporah, and others. I had the great fortune to work alongside Albert Kong and Catherine Herdlick on the real world games festival Come Out and Play.\n\nFinally, I've benefited from conversations with Tristan Harris, Ellie Hain, Nathan Vanderpool, and Anne Selke.\"\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to endorse Bilal as an exceptional talent and recognized leader in the field of technology, specifically in the areas of tech innovation spaces and education technology. I have known Bilal since 2014, and his work in these areas has been truly exceptional.\n\nAs a philosopher, game designer, and programmer, I have extensive experience in the fields of technology and design. I am impressed with Bilal's dedication to promoting meaningful technology and his efforts in building community technology spaces and developing educational software internationally.\n\nBilal's work has had a significant positive impact on the communities he serves, and I believe that he is an exceptional talent and a recognized leader in his field. I highly recommend Bilal for the UK's Global Talent endorsement process, and I am confident that he will make significant contributions to the UK's economy and community.\n\nThank you for considering Bilal for this endorsement, and please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoe Edelman",
