Once it became possible to see workers and laborers as redundant artifacts from the past, labor became less valued and the self image of laborers in factories was damaged. This similar process will happen in knowledge work. An industrial labor process is not a craft. It might be possible that a craft is still worth doing and that people love a handmade notebook. Yet the efficiency of processes is a seductive process which is impossible to avoid. Why wouldn’t we make things easier when the job doesn’t provide meaning, the artistry is lacking, each piece is assessed on it’s consistency with the initial mold making creativity useless. We love hand made things when it touches the soul of a craftsperson, when creativity can emerge, when uniqueness is transferred. Knowledge workers will have to contend with questions very similar. Why would I hire you to write copy when I can have an AI AB test day and night and emulate the best writers that I love the most? Or data entry? Done. No one wants that job, it’s just a job that needed to exist for a while and people took it who didn’t have enough knowledge or education to do otherwise, or all other jobs in their area were taken. So the question is what is a human for? \n\nFramework Element\n\nInquiry-Based Learning, Depth and complexity of inquiry by learners.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning, The connection between personal experiences and learning objectives.\nSelf-Directed Learning, Progress towards self-set learning goals.\nProblem-Based Learning, Problem-solving skills and application of knowledge.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning, Collaborative skills and interaction quality.\nResilience & Grit, grit score\nExperiential Learning by Application of theoretical knowledge in practice.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy by Confidence in managing entrepreneurial challenges.\nTitle: Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models for Transformative Cohort-Based Learning Experiences\nAbstract: This paper presents a novel framework for designing transformative cohort-based learning experiences that leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) while incorporating principles of collaboration, teamwork, social learning, and meaning-making. By aligning LLM architectures with evidence-based pedagogical practices and theories, such as social cognitive theory, experiential learning, and transformative learning, we propose a comprehensive approach to creating engaging, effective, and purposeful learning experiences. The framework emphasizes the role of LLMs in supporting learners' cognitive, social, and emotional development, as well as their ability to navigate complex, real-world challenges. We also explore innovative strategies for using LLMs to model and demonstrate effective learning processes, metacognitive strategies, and collaborative problem-solving. The ultimate goal is to create a dynamic, responsive, and empowering learning environment that fosters deep understanding, personal growth, and collective action.\nIntroduction: The rapid advancements in natural language processing and the development of large language models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for transforming education and training. LLMs, with their ability to understand, generate, and analyze human language, offer unique opportunities for creating personalized, interactive, and contextually relevant learning experiences. However, to fully harness the potential of LLMs, it is essential to ground their use in evidence-based pedagogical practices and theories that emphasize the social, experiential, and transformative dimensions of learning.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for designing cohort-based learning experiences that leverage LLMs while incorporating principles from social cognitive theory, experiential learning theory, and transformative learning theory. The framework aims to create learning experiences that are not only cognitively rich but also socially engaging, emotionally resonant, and personally meaningful. By aligning LLM capabilities with these pedagogical principles, we seek to create learning environments that foster collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, while also supporting learners' sense of agency, purpose, and social responsibility.\nGoals:\nDevelop a comprehensive framework for designing transformative cohort-based learning experiences that leverage LLMs and align with evidence-based pedagogical practices.\nIdentify specific strategies for using LLMs to support collaborative, project-based, and problem-based learning experiences that engage learners in authentic, real-world contexts.\nExplore innovative approaches for using LLMs to model and demonstrate effective learning processes, metacognitive strategies, and collaborative problem-solving.\nProvide guidelines for creating learning experiences that foster learners' sense of agency, purpose, and social responsibility, while also supporting their cognitive, social, and emotional development.\nOffer a roadmap for future research and development in the field of AI-assisted learning, with a focus on creating transformative, equitable, and empowering learning experiences.\nTable: Aligning LLM Capabilities with Pedagogical Principles for Transformative Cohort-Based Learning\nLLM Capability\nPedagogical Principle\nLearning Experience Design\nModeling and Demonstration\nNatural Language Understanding\nSocial Interaction & Collaboration\nFacilitate group discussions, peer feedback, and collaborative problem-solving through natural language interactions.\nDemonstrate effective communication, active listening, and perspective-taking skills in group discussions.\nNatural Language Generation\nExperiential Learning and Reflection\nGenerate reflective prompts, guiding questions, and personalized feedback to support learners' reflection on their experiences and learning processes.\nModel reflective thinking and metacognitive strategies through think-aloud protocols and self-explanations.\nContextual Understanding\nAuthentic, Real-World Problem-Solving\nProvide contextually relevant information, resources, and scenarios based on learners' interests, goals, and real-world challenges.\nDemonstrate the application of knowledge and skills to real-world problems, while verbalizing the problem-solving process and decision-making rationale.\nKnowledge Retrieval and Integration\nConnecting Learning to Prior Knowledge & Experiences\nHelp learners activate prior knowledge, make connections across disciplines, and integrate new information into existing cognitive frameworks.\nModel the process of connecting new learning to prior knowledge and experiences, using analogies, examples, and personal stories.\nAdaptive and Personalized Learning\nScaffolding and Self-Regulated Learning\nProvide adaptive scaffolding, feedback, and resources based on learners' individual needs, goals, and progress, while gradually fading support to foster self-regulation.\nDemonstrate the use of self-regulated learning strategies, such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation, while verbalizing the thought process and emotional experiences.\nLanguage Translation and Multilingual Support\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nProvide multilingual support and culturally responsive learning experiences that validate learners' diverse identities, experiences, and ways of knowing.\nModel inclusive communication, cultural competence, and the value of diverse perspectives in collaborative learning and problem-solving.\nTextual Analysis and Summarization\nCritical Thinking and Meaning-Making\nHelp learners analyze complex texts, extract key ideas, and synthesize information to construct personal meaning and develop critical thinking skills.\nDemonstrate the process of critically analyzing information, evaluating arguments, and constructing meaningful interpretations, while verbalizing the thought process and reasoning.\n\n\nSummary: The proposed framework for designing transformative cohort-based learning experiences leverages the capabilities of LLMs to support learners' cognitive, social, and emotional development, while aligning with evidence-based pedagogical principles. By facilitating social interaction, collaboration, experiential learning, authentic problem-solving, adaptive scaffolding, and meaning-making, LLMs can help create rich, engaging, and empowering learning environments.\nA key innovation of this framework is the use of LLMs to model and demonstrate effective learning processes, metacognitive strategies, and collaborative problem-solving. By providing learners with concrete examples and think-aloud protocols, LLMs can help demystify the learning process, foster self-awareness, and promote the development of transferable skills.\nMoreover, the framework emphasizes the importance of creating learning experiences that are not only cognitively challenging but also emotionally resonant and personally meaningful. By connecting learning to learners' interests, experiences, and real-world challenges, and by supporting their sense of agency, purpose, and social responsibility, LLMs can help foster transformative learning experiences that have a lasting impact on learners' lives and communities.\nConclusion: The integration of LLMs into cohort-based learning experiences offers a powerful opportunity to transform education and training. By aligning LLM capabilities with evidence-based pedagogical principles, we can create learning environments that are cognitively rich, socially engaging, emotionally resonant, and personally meaningful. The proposed framework provides a roadmap for designing transformative learning experiences that leverage the full potential of LLMs while prioritizing learners' needs, goals, and well-being.\nHowever, realizing this vision requires ongoing research, development, and collaboration among educators, researchers, technologists, and learners. It is essential to continue exploring innovative approaches for using LLMs to support learning, while also addressing the ethical, social, and pedagogical implications of AI-assisted learning.\nUltimately, the goal is to create learning experiences that not only impart knowledge and skills but also empower learners to become active agents in their own learning and in shaping a more just, equitable, and sustainable world. By harnessing the power of LLMs in service of this goal, we can unlock the transformative potential of education and help learners realize their full potential as individuals and as members of their communities.\n\n\nChatGPT\nIdentifying Three Relevant Axes for the S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework\nTo describe the S.C.R.I.B.E.R framework comprehensively, we need to identify three relevant axes that can capture the essence of the framework's elements.

text:[[[INSPIRE & NAVIGATE\nAligned Pedagogically Sound Frameworks\n  For Transformational Learning\n\nIntroduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher\nLearning how to learn is the fundamental skill of learning. It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December after hundreds of hours of GPT use the following framework has been developed. Finding first the principles that led to better results with Large Langeuage Models (LLMs) and then later formalized through the lense of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impovrishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nBalaji Srinivasan, author of the Network State, describes “dark talant” - the idea that through networking we can find extreme talant anywhere then support and network them into a powerful State beyond borders. This idea superficially sounds possible, yet upon further consideration good ideas do not come simply from numbers of brains alone. Exposure is critical. While there are many definitions for intelligence, the one that appeals to me most is the one proposed by Douglass Hofsteader in his book Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire as the ability to abstract and generalize from specific instances into concepts that become manipulable in an uninterpreted way. For instance the moment you hear something it’s either a noise or a sound, a sound you can say has an isness - an implication, hooked into an idea, a noise is something that must be interpreted. That immediate translation from auditory input into categorization likely develops like our other senses, and it’s for this reason I propose we may be more likely homo-sensorious than homo-sapiens, since thinking is seeing. The process of taking sensory input, conceptual input and deriving a new “one of those” is a process humanity does individually and collectively. Youth are often at the forefront, as GenZ slang demonstrates copious examples. \nLet’s talk about being “Based” - which originated as a way to describe someone who was “freebasing” drugs, which itself is a created concept based on the idea of acids and bases, transforming amines, usually basic, into their neutral counterparts to alter their consumption methods and impacts. Now, for GenZ, being based simply means “not caring” - and it’s very likely the majority of people using the word have no understanding of the chemical processes underpinning the origin of the word. And most chemists likely do not know that the word, base, comes from the greek pedestal due to it bening the structure upon which an acid rests upon when making a salt (The Origin of the Term “Base” by William B. Jense 10.1021/ed083p1130). \n\nWhy did we take this long detour into understanding the origins of ideas? It’s to make it clear that there is more than superficial language connecting human intelligence with machine intelligence, and that by exposing how a machine learns to a human, we can transfer some of the millions of dollars and effort spent running millions of words across the attention mechanisms of LLMs to the most marginalized learners on the planet. Making it more likely that they could be one of the “dark talants” that will come up with the idea that will deeply and positively impact their communities and our world. The network state should seek true diversity for it to make true on its promise, otherwise we will have a silicon valley state with Berlin, Beijing, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Porto, Dubai, Bangalore and other cities like these being over-represented, and not due to their population count. \nTo increase the possible surface area of ideas crossing minds that are able to merge and encompass I believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nWhile we’re waiting for openAI and Anthropic to integrate machine-human transfer learning into the core of their offering, we have options:\nSupport the development of the ways of being that inspire prompting along the framework described below. \nTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \nDeveloping customized system prompts that align with the person that will maneuver the LLM to being more transfer and transformational in its dialog. \n\nThese two ideas:\nTransfer and transformation hint at what I believe to be the key insight underneath much of this argument, that we can learn best when we learn in symbiosis with a machine that learns in similar ways (concept clustering). \nSalience is the sense that things are meaningful and make sense, when you write a poem referring to your infant child as the light of your life, she doesn’t become photons, yet you may sense the rightness of this analogy. When taking certain entheogens one might start reducing their critical thinking allowing them to make analogies that are further off from reality. This lamppost reminds me of my highschool history teacher’s handwriting - perhaps. Yet how helpful is it for them, let alone others? Only God(swt) has the highest analogy, truely being able to see the oneness of everything - to hold that in total comprehension. We are reduced to analogies that are “useful” - yet the true geniuses are those that continue to expand and encompass till they are able to hold more things in the light of oneness. This is the process of meta-cognition. The ability to dive into the uniqueness yet zoom out into the unity at will. This in/out process is what enables the building of patterns across truely related concepts that those inside the concept space might not be able to see. \nThis is how pattern recognition is possible. A developer at a certain level of mental complexity may think their job is to provide code that achieves a goal - contrast this to a CEO making a decision where they may need to be able to see the interrelationships between being a father, a ceo, the company in the context of the economy, the economy in the context of global cultural shifts against capitalism, the international climate and how it relates to a decision between stainless steel and aluminum.\nThis level of thinking is more related to a why than a how. \nMachines are more and more able to take over the how, and normally mental complexity and human transformation that leads to it arises after many years of “one of those”ing many situations, building experience throughout life. Is it possible to develop and transform and grow in the true sorts of comprehension that allow someone to see and know the why behind things, the thing that touches the indeterminate gut intuition, the sense of rightness, the value that one knows through their emotions, the feeling of beauty that arises when the right thing emerges. \nThis is a “zone of genius” - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it’s similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this “trust” is rewarded. Or as G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” Why?\nWhile one may dive into controversial territory speaking of God or Truth. I believe we can stay within the realm of the philosophical and logical. We see that salience is possible to artificially enhance, that moment when someone on a psychoactive substance senses they just found the meaning of everything and they write it down only later to find it’s something like “the stars are beautiful, and I am a star” or some other phrase that doesn’t quite pack the same punch. This is related to the difference between a two dimensional matrix True and false and permanent and transitory. There are moments in our lives when we are able to go a level above our mental complexity and we glimpse the world from above, like a flatlander in 2 dimensions being pulled into the third dimension and can finally understand the topology of 2 dimensional shapes, that all the differences he sees in triangles and squares and octogons, that really, in a sense that is hard to build when you live in 2, they’re all the same, a single line encompassing a space - all essentially circles. \nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the sort of space of inspiration needed to build new knowledge, let’s study this picture carefully:\nWhat does it look like it represents? \nImagine you produced this image through this process:\n\nTry to determine the structure of the material in the place of the green shape in the image above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Would you have guessed a corkscrew?\n\nWe now know what DNA looks like, I can only imagine the AHA moment Rosalind Franklin had when she made the connection between all the data. I also wonder if she also decided to use the frame of a twisted strand because it was beautiful. If only she was alive today to ask.\n\nThis realization that we find throught science and mathematics, that beauty is a trustworthy guide may have evolutionary origins, although there is no reason that of all the ways the world could have worked that it should be this way.\n\nI believe that a good human life is connected to this source of knowledge, the source where we know beauty and align ourselves and our actions with it. It’s not to become a bootcamp developer or whatever is the current trend in education. The how will be automated, craft remains since craft remains tied to purpose and beauty.\n\nOk, now let’s connect this dialog with learning and transformation using LLMs: \n\n\nNow, we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results.

It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December after hundreds of hours of GPT use the following framework has been developed. Finding first the principles that led to better results with Large Langeuage Models (LLMs) and then later formalized through the lense of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impovrishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nBalaji Srinivasan, author of the Network State, describes “dark talant” - the idea that through networking we can find extreme talant anywhere then support and network them into a powerful State beyond borders. This idea superficially sounds possible, yet upon further consideration good ideas do not come simply from numbers of brains alone. Exposure is critical. While there are many definitions for intelligence, the one that appeals to me most is the one proposed by Douglass Hofsteader in his book Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire as the ability to abstract and generalize from specific instances into concepts that become manipulable in an uninterpreted way. For instance the moment you hear something it’s either a noise or a sound, a sound you can say has an isness - an implication, hooked into an idea, a noise is something that must be interpreted. That immediate translation from auditory input into categorization likely develops like our other senses, and it’s for this reason I propose we may be more likely homo-sensorious than homo-sapiens, since thinking is seeing. The process of taking sensory input, conceptual input and deriving a new “one of those” is a process humanity does individually and collectively. Youth are often at the forefront, as GenZ slang demonstrates copious examples. \nLet’s talk about being “Based” - which originated as a way to describe someone who was “freebasing” drugs, which itself is a created concept based on the idea of acids and bases, transforming amines, usually basic, into their neutral counterparts to alter their consumption methods and impacts. Now, for GenZ, being based simply means “not caring” - and it’s very likely the majority of people using the word have no understanding of the chemical processes underpinning the origin of the word. And most chemists likely do not know that the word, base, comes from the greek pedestal due to it bening the structure upon which an acid rests upon when making a salt (The Origin of the Term “Base” by William B. Jense 10.1021/ed083p1130). \n\nWhy did we take this long detour into understanding the origins of ideas? It’s to make it clear that there is more than superficial language connecting human intelligence with machine intelligence, and that by exposing how a machine learns to a human, we can transfer some of the millions of dollars and effort spent running millions of words across the attention mechanisms of LLMs to the most marginalized learners on the planet. Making it more likely that they could be one of the “dark talants” that will come up with the idea that will deeply and positively impact their communities and our world. The network state should seek true diversity for it to make true on its promise, otherwise we will have a silicon valley state with Berlin, Beijing, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Porto, Dubai, Bangalore and other cities like these being over-represented, and not due to their population count. \nTo increase the possible surface area of ideas crossing minds that are able to merge and encompass I believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nWhile we’re waiting for openAI and Anthropic to integrate machine-human transfer learning into the core of their offering, we have options:\nSupport the development of the ways of being that inspire prompting along the framework described below. \nTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \nDeveloping customized system prompts that align with the person that will maneuver the LLM to being more transfer and transformational in its dialog. \n\nThese two ideas:\nTransfer and transformation hint at what I believe to be the key insight underneath much of this argument, that we can learn best when we learn in symbiosis with a machine that learns in similar ways (concept clustering). \nSalience is the sense that things are meaningful and make sense, when you write a poem referring to your infant child as the light of your life, she doesn’t become photons, yet you may sense the rightness of this analogy. When taking certain entheogens one might start reducing their critical thinking allowing them to make analogies that are further off from reality. This lamppost reminds me of my highschool history teacher’s handwriting - perhaps. Yet how helpful is it for them, let alone others? Only God(swt) has the highest analogy, truely being able to see the oneness of everything - to hold that in total comprehension. We are reduced to analogies that are “useful” - yet the true geniuses are those that continue to expand and encompass till they are able to hold more things in the light of oneness. This is the process of meta-cognition. The ability to dive into the uniqueness yet zoom out into the unity at will. This in/out process is what enables the building of patterns across truely related concepts that those inside the concept space might not be able to see. \nThis is how pattern recognition is possible. A developer at a certain level of mental complexity may think their job is to provide code that achieves a goal - contrast this to a CEO making a decision where they may need to be able to see the interrelationships between being a father, a ceo, the company in the context of the economy, the economy in the context of global cultural shifts against capitalism, the international climate and how it relates to a decision between stainless steel and aluminum.\nThis level of thinking is more related to a why than a how. \nMachines are more and more able to take over the how, and normally mental complexity and human transformation that leads to it arises after many years of “one of those”ing many situations, building experience throughout life. Is it possible to develop and transform and grow in the true sorts of comprehension that allow someone to see and know the why behind things, the thing that touches the indeterminate gut intuition, the sense of rightness, the value that one knows through their emotions, the feeling of beauty that arises when the right thing emerges. \nThis is a “zone of genius” - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it’s similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this “trust” is rewarded. Or as G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” Why?\nWhile one may dive into controversial territory speaking of God or Truth. I believe we can stay within the realm of the philosophical and logical. We see that salience is possible to artificially enhance, that moment when someone on a psychoactive substance senses they just found the meaning of everything and they write it down only later to find it’s something like “the stars are beautiful, and I am a star” or some other phrase that doesn’t quite pack the same punch. This is related to the difference between a two dimensional matrix True and false and permanent and transitory. There are moments in our lives when we are able to go a level above our mental complexity and we glimpse the world from above, like a flatlander in 2 dimensions being pulled into the third dimension and can finally understand the topology of 2 dimensional shapes, that all the differences he sees in triangles and squares and octogons, that really, in a sense that is hard to build when you live in 2, they’re all the same, a single line encompassing a space - all essentially circles. \nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the sort of space of inspiration needed to build new knowledge, let’s study this picture carefully:\nWhat does it look like it represents? \nImagine you produced this image through this process:\n\nTry to determine the structure of the material in the place of the green shape in the image above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Would you have guessed a corkscrew?\n\nWe now know what DNA looks like, I can only imagine the AHA moment Rosalind Franklin had when she made the connection between all the data. I also wonder if she also decided to use the frame of a twisted strand because it was beautiful. If only she was alive today to ask.\n\nThis realization that we find throught science and mathematics, that beauty is a trustworthy guide may have evolutionary origins, although there is no reason that of all the ways the world could have worked that it should be this way.\n\nI believe that a good human life is connected to this source of knowledge, the source where we know beauty and align ourselves and our actions with it. It’s not to become a bootcamp developer or whatever is the current trend in education. The how will be automated, craft remains since craft remains tied to purpose and beauty.\n\nOk, now let’s connect this dialog with learning and transformation using LLMs: \n\n\nNow, we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results.

Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and teach yourself the things you don’t even know. By using this tool well, you can benefit yourself, your communities, and the world.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask what is around you that you “can’t see.”\n\n\nTechnique\nCategory\nAspect Leveraged\nDescription\nExample Prompt\nPedagogical Alignment\nClosest NAVIGATE Element\nAnalogical Reasoning\nEmbeddings\nVector Arithmetic\nExplore analogical relationships between concepts by leveraging the vector arithmetic properties of embeddings.\n\"If 'Lumos' is to 'light' as 'Nox' is to 'darkness,' generate analogies for other spell pairs that have opposing effects.\"\nAnalogical Learning\nN/A\nConceptual Neighborhoods\nEmbeddings\nSemantic Similarity\nDiscover related concepts by exploring the nearby space in the embeddings based on semantic similarity.\n\"I'm studying the 'Wingardium Leviosa' charm.

Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and teach yourself the things you don’t even know. By using this tool well, you can benefit yourself, your communities, and the world.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask what is around you that you “can’t see.”\n \nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\n●  \tSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\n●  \tCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\n●  \tReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools with which to think.\n●  \tInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\n●  \tBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps, ask the LLM for non-overlapping options, and pick.\n●  \tExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\n●  \tRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you.\n \nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\n \nPrinciples are ideas you keep in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n  \nNote: Do not memorize this list.\nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought.\nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n  📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n  🤲\nPrinciple\n 🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAfter giving the GPT as much context as possible, including your main goal, and questions, and all the knowledge you current have about your topic. Then you could ask questions like:\n “Who would know how to answer this question? What is their job?”\n\n “What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n “What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” Or pick someone complete irrelevant to your theme and ask them to respond from their perspective. \n(The more specific information you provide, the better.\nExploration:\nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. \nUse AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback, loving to be proved wrong.\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a person who will disagree.\nFOr a \n For instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a funding agency grant reviewer.\nIf you’re a PHD student, ask for a review from your advisor.\nIf you’re a chef, ask for a critique from a food reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\n Actively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines \n\nAFTER identifying the expert's domain.\nOnce you pick your template, ask it questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper.\nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious, rigorous and slow. \nDeep breaths.\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency:\nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. It will make mistakes, and you should intervene to improve the results. \n\nThis is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI for A number of diverse and non-overlapping options for your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nLLMs To Diversify and then LLMs to Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\n Ask it to help you find out where you need to correct something. Ask it to poke holes.\n Go step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it…\n A simple example is: “you’re a McKinsey consultant. This is our first session, and my business is running out of runway, so I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the help I need for my business.”\nLook at yourself from the third person:\n How can you ask questions to the AI so it asks questions, and you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about?\n\nUse a first principles approach. \nThink step by step \nExplain your work\n"

            "extracted_content": "Sure! Let's dive into it. What specific aspects of the human mind and motivation are you interested in, and how would you like to connect them to Conway's Game of Life?\n\n\n\n\nSo I'm wondering if there's a theory of learning and motivation for learning and action and doing that is connected to the way that the game of life works where there are resources and there are different systems at play. So for instance, I thought that it sort of represents a goal and then a person wants to achieve the goal and so it's a distance away from where the person is and we could represent that kind of computationally and then the person learns and then moves towards the goal and learning creates action which uses resources and then learning also builds some sort of internal resources that are about how to act and then they know how to create value because they've used resources and then they are transforming those resources through their actions that then might bring them more resources and I'm wondering if all of this is a kind of game that we can model on the computer and if there are any researchers that are looking into it and what their names are.\n\nChatGPT\nThat sounds like a fascinating topic! Let's break it down and see how we can connect these ideas.\n\nGame of Life and Learning\nConway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells evolve based on simple rules. This can metaphorically represent learning and motivation:\n\nInitial State: A person starts with a certain set of skills and knowledge.\nGoal State: The desired outcome or achievement, which is a distance away.\nRules of Transition: The actions and decisions a person makes, influenced by learning and available resources.\nLearning and Motivation\nIn the context of learning and motivation:\n\nResources: Time, effort, knowledge, and external aids.\nInternal Resources: Cognitive skills, motivation, metacognitive strategies.\nActions: Applying learned skills, making decisions, solving problems.\nComputational Modeling\nThis process can indeed be modeled computationally:\n\nRepresentation: The person’s current state (knowledge, skills) and the goal state.\nLearning Process: Rules or algorithms that simulate how learning affects actions and resource use.\nOutcome: Measuring progress towards the goal and resource transformation.\nTheories and Researchers\nThere are several theories and researchers that might align with your idea:\n\nSelf-Regulated Learning: This involves goal setting, self-monitoring, and strategic use of resources (Zimmerman, Pintrich).\nMotivation Theories: Self-Determination Theory (Deci and Ryan) emphasizes intrinsic motivation and resource use.\nComplex Systems and Learning: Researchers like John H. Holland and Melanie Mitchell have explored complex systems, which can be related to learning models.\nIntegrating the Ideas\nYou could create a model where:\n\nInitial State: Define the learner's starting point.\nGoal: Set a target or objective.\nLearning Rules: Establish rules that govern how learning impacts actions.\nResource Management: Include how actions use and transform resources.\nNext Steps\nResearch Similar Models: Look into self-regulated learning models and complex systems in education.\nDevelop a Computational Model: Use simulation software to create a prototype of your learning model.\nExperiment and Iterate: Test the model with different parameters and refine the rules.\nWould you like to explore any specific theory or researcher in more detail?\nYou're okay.\n\nChatGPT\nThanks! I'm glad to help. If you have more questions or need further details on any of these aspects, feel free to ask.\nYeah, so who are the top researchers exploring this field? What is the field called? And what's a one-line summary of their main findings from their most popular research papers?\n\nChatGPT\nThe field you're interested in spans several areas, including educational psychology, cognitive science, and complex systems. Here are some top researchers and their contributions:\n\nAlbert Bandura (Social Cognitive Theory)\n\nField: Educational Psychology\nMain Finding: Self-efficacy influences learning and motivation significantly, impacting how people approach goals and challenges.\nBarry J. Zimmerman (Self-Regulated Learning)\n\nField: Educational Psychology\nMain Finding: Effective learning involves self-regulation through goal setting, self-monitoring, and strategic use of learning resources.\nRichard M. Ryan and Edward L. Deci (Self-Determination Theory)\n\nField: Motivation Psychology\nMain Finding: Intrinsic motivation, driven by autonomy, competence, and relatedness, is crucial for sustained learning and personal growth.\nJohn H. Holland (Complex Adaptive Systems)\n\nField: Complex Systems and Artificial Intelligence\nMain Finding: Adaptive systems, like learners, evolve through interaction with their environment, demonstrating emergent behavior from simple rules.\nMelanie Mitchell (Complex Systems and Learning)\n\nField: Complex Systems\nMain Finding: Learning processes can be understood as complex systems where simple rules can lead to sophisticated patterns and behaviors over time.\nThese researchers have significantly contributed to understanding how learning and motivation operate within complex systems, highlighting the importance of self-regulation, intrinsic motivation, and adaptive behaviors.\nOkay, so, all of these researchers, I'm wondering how we might be able to create a model for learning that allows a learner to choose a goal, refine the goal according to their actual most motivating, most needed, most true goal, how to determine what a better goal for somebody is. For instance, somebody might think that they want to build a logo for their website, but what they actually need is a style guide to determine their general direction. And in order to create the style guide, they need to determine their values, and then even the process of determining the value that they have, the values, they may even change the direction of the business, for instance. And if their goal is to fundamentally make money, if that pressure is relieved, then learning changes, where people can follow curiosity rather than financial interest, and then they might not even start a business. And so, how do we navigate all of these different questions to help someone choose the appropriate goal? I can imagine it's sort of like determining an icky guy of some sort, that would make sure that the goal that they're choosing is holistically the best choice for them in this moment. And then, what would all of these different researchers think about these topics? Create a panel of these speakers, and then have them each give a very short one-paragraph essay of some sort about this topic.\n\nChatGPT\nSure, let's imagine a panel discussion with these researchers addressing how to help a learner choose and refine the most appropriate goal. Here are their hypothetical responses:\n\nAlbert Bandura\nTopic: Self-Efficacy and Goal Setting\n\"Choosing the right goal starts with understanding one's self-efficacy. Learners need to believe in their capabilities to achieve their goals. To refine a goal, it's essential to assess personal skills and interests and how they align with the desired outcome. Encouraging self-reflection and setting incremental, achievable goals can help learners stay motivated and adjust their aspirations based on their progress and experiences.\"\n\nBarry J. Zimmerman\nTopic: Self-Regulated Learning\n\"Effective goal selection and refinement involve self-regulation. Learners should engage in self-assessment to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals is crucial. Additionally, learners should be flexible and willing to adjust their goals as they acquire new knowledge and skills, ensuring that their objectives remain aligned with their evolving interests and needs.\"\n\nRichard M. Ryan and Edward L. Deci\nTopic: Intrinsic Motivation and True Goals\n\"To determine the most motivating and true goal, learners should focus on intrinsic motivation, which is driven by autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Goals that align with personal values and interests are more likely to be fulfilling and sustainable. It's important to explore deeper motivations and aspirations, beyond immediate tasks, to ensure that the chosen goals foster personal growth and well-being.\"\n\nJohn H. Holland\nTopic: Adaptive Learning Systems\n\"Choosing and refining goals can be understood through the lens of complex adaptive systems. Learners should experiment with different goals, observing how their actions and outcomes interact. This iterative process allows for continuous adaptation and refinement of goals based on feedback from their environment. Encouraging exploration and flexibility can lead to the emergence of more suitable and meaningful goals over time.\"\n\nMelanie Mitchell\nTopic: Emergent Behavior in Learning\n\"Learning and goal setting can be seen as emergent behaviors within a complex system. By setting initial goals and engaging in exploratory actions, learners can observe patterns and outcomes that help refine their objectives. This process involves trial and error, reflection, and adaptation, ensuring that goals evolve in response to new insights and changing circumstances. Emphasizing curiosity and adaptability can guide learners towards more authentic and rewarding goals.\"\n\nIntegrating the Ideas\nTo create a model for helping learners choose and refine goals, we can integrate the insights from these researchers:\n\nSelf-Assessment: Encourage learners to reflect on their skills, interests, and self-efficacy.\nIntrinsic Motivation: Focus on goals that align with personal values and intrinsic motivations.\nExploration and Adaptation: Allow for experimentation and iterative refinement of goals based on feedback and new insights.\nSelf-Regulation: Use self-regulated learning strategies to set and adjust SMART goals.\nHolistic Approach: Consider the broader context of the learner's life and aspirations, ensuring that goals are meaningful and fulfilling.\nBy combining these approaches, we can help learners navigate the complexities of goal setting and achieve their most motivating and true objectives.\nWhat about people that are marginalized and may not have a lot of exposure to many different ideas and perhaps might be surrounded by people with a lot of trauma and difficulty which has shaped their decision making and goal setting in a way that is potentially negative? How do we make sure that they're able to see and understand a goal that might be less constrained by the life experiences that they and their examples have had?\n\nChatGPT\nAddressing the challenges faced by marginalized individuals in goal setting and decision-making requires a sensitive, multi-faceted approach. Here’s how each of the researchers might suggest tackling these issues:\n\nAlbert Bandura\nTopic: Building Self-Efficacy in Marginalized Communities\n\"To help marginalized individuals set and achieve positive goals, it is crucial to enhance their sense of self-efficacy. This can be achieved through modeling and mentoring programs where they can observe and interact with role models who have overcome similar challenges. Additionally, providing opportunities for success in smaller, manageable tasks can build their confidence and belief in their capabilities.\"\n\nBarry J. Zimmerman\nTopic: Self-Regulated Learning in Constrained Environments\n\"Teaching self-regulated learning strategies can empower marginalized individuals to take control of their learning and goal-setting processes. This involves teaching them to set realistic goals, self-monitor their progress, and reflect on their achievements and setbacks. Encouraging a growth mindset can help them see challenges as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable obstacles.\"\n\nRichard M. Ryan and Edward L. Deci\nTopic: Fostering Intrinsic Motivation Amidst Adversity\n\"Creating environments that support autonomy, competence, and relatedness is vital for fostering intrinsic motivation in marginalized individuals. This can be achieved by providing supportive and caring relationships, offering meaningful choices, and ensuring that they feel competent in their pursuits. Programs that focus on empowerment and community building can help them discover and pursue goals that resonate with their true selves.\"\n\nJohn H. Holland\nTopic: Adaptive Learning Systems for Marginalized Populations\n\"Marginalized individuals can benefit from adaptive learning systems that allow for flexibility and personalization. By creating learning environments that are responsive to their unique needs and circumstances, we can help them explore various pathways and discover goals that might have seemed unattainable before. These systems should be designed to provide continuous feedback and support, helping learners adjust and refine their goals over time.\"\n\nMelanie Mitchell\nTopic: Encouraging Emergent Behaviors through Exploration\n\"Encouraging marginalized individuals to engage in exploration and experimentation can help them break free from the constraints of their life experiences. Creating safe spaces for exploration, where failure is seen as a learning opportunity rather than a setback, can foster resilience and innovation. By supporting their curiosity and providing diverse experiences, we can help them discover new possibilities and goals.\"\n\nIntegrating the Ideas\nTo support marginalized individuals in setting and achieving positive goals, a comprehensive approach is needed:\n\nMentoring and Role Models: Connect them with mentors who have successfully navigated similar challenges.\nEmpowerment and Self-Regulation: Teach self-regulation strategies and foster a growth mindset.\nSupportive Environments: Create environments that support autonomy, competence, and relatedness.\nAdaptive Systems: Implement adaptive learning systems that respond to their unique needs and provide continuous support.\nExploration and Safe Spaces: Encourage exploration and provide safe spaces for trying new things and learning from failures.\nPractical Steps\nCommunity Programs: Develop community programs that offer mentorship, skill-building workshops, and supportive networks.\nEducational Interventions: Design educational interventions that teach self-regulated learning and foster intrinsic motivation.\nPolicy Advocacy: Advocate for policies that create equitable opportunities for marginalized populations and reduce systemic barriers.\nAccess to Resources: Ensure access to resources such as mental health support, educational materials, and technology.\nBy integrating these strategies, we can help marginalized individuals see beyond their current constraints and envision goals that are aligned with their true potential and aspirations.\nThese are some excellent ideas, and I believe that there may be something possible through the use of large language models and how their embeddings work, and how transformers work. Make a list of the different technologies that underlie the large language models and their affordances related to this approach of identifying better goals and return a table demonstrating these affordances and a prompt that a learner can use to demonstrate how they could start with an initial prompt but then be guided through the use of a system prompt that helps them refine their initial prompt more towards exposing them to new and less constrained views on what is possible. To aspire for.\n\nChatGPT\nCertainly!

Are you looking to attract a certain audience or convey a specific message?\"\nBroaden Perspectives:\n\"Have you considered creating a style guide that outlines your website’s overall direction? This could include values, themes, and visual elements beyond just the logo.\"\nIdentify Deeper Motivations:\n\"What are your core values and goals for this website? How do you want visitors to feel when they visit your site?\"\nIterative Refinement:\n\"Based on your responses, it seems like developing a comprehensive style guide might be beneficial. Would you like to explore steps to create a style guide that aligns with your values and goals?\"\nGuided Interaction Example\n\nSystem: \"To start, let's understand the purpose of your website. Can you describe what your website is about and what you hope to achieve with it?\"\n\nLearner: \"It's a platform for sharing my art and connecting with other artists.\"\n\nSystem: \"Great! What specific message or feeling do you want your visitors to experience when they visit your site?\"\n\nLearner: \"I want them to feel inspired and connected to a community of creatives.\"\n\nSystem: \"In that case, have you thought about creating a style guide? A style guide can help ensure that every element of your site, including the logo, reflects this sense of inspiration and community. It can include your core values, visual themes, and guidelines for consistent design.\"\n\nLearner: \"That sounds like a good idea. How do I start with a style guide?\"\n\nSystem: \"Let's begin by identifying your core values. What are the most important principles or ideas you want your website to represent?\"\n\nBy using these technologies and this guided interaction approach, learners can refine their goals in a way that is less constrained by their initial perspectives and more aligned with broader, more aspirational objectives.\nActually, maybe what we should do is build a platform that uses large language models that then builds a model of the self and a quality of mind for the person using it to understand their intent, their potential values, and to help them make better prompts by first assessing their current prompt with their first onboarding process and then giving them a feedback if it deviates too far from their fundamental values and our desire to support people's growth rather than give immediate results and to also our desire to ensure people are expanding their scope into what's possible and also our desire to be sure that people are following modern pedagogies of learning by doing towards promoting goodness and so let's look through the let's consider what's possible for the model of self that we could use that may relate to some of our earlier discussion on Conway's Game of Life and let's work backwards from there where we first come up with a model and then go over a use case example of how the person may start immediately without the system prompting them because this is going to have to go into a behind-the-scenes system prompt or a behind-the-scenes tool where they come and they say make me a logo and then because of the system prompt and the theory of mind and model of the person it will then return a intermediate interjection requesting clarification if they are deviating from their original and more fundamental goals and the goals that we've set out what would the system be called and give a summary of the instructions and then think step by step about how to do it and then give me a result\n\nChatGPT\nSystem Overview: \"Guidance AI\"\nPurpose: To help users refine their goals by building a model of their self and their quality of mind.

Here are some key concepts from Lenia and how they relate to these areas:\n\nKey Concepts from Lenia and Their Application\nConcept from Lenia\tDescription\tApplication to Learning and Goals\nContinuous States\tUnlike the binary states in Conway's Game of Life, Lenia has a continuous range of states.\tEmphasizes the importance of gradual progress and continuous improvement in learning. Goals and motivation should be seen as evolving processes rather than binary achievements.\nComplex Rules\tLenia's rules are more complex and involve a broader range of interactions.\tReflects the complexity of real-life learning and goal pursuit. Success often involves multiple factors and interactions, requiring a holistic and adaptable approach.\nEmergent Behavior\tSimple rules can lead to complex and unexpected patterns.\tEncourages an open-minded approach to learning and goal setting, recognizing that unexpected opportunities and insights can emerge from simple actions and decisions.\nStability and Chaos\tLenia can exhibit both stable and chaotic behaviors depending on the initial conditions and rules.\tHighlights the balance between stability (consistent effort and routines) and adaptability (flexibility to change and new challenges) in pursuing goals.\nApplying Lenia's Concepts to Learning and Motivation\nContinuous Improvement:\n\nLenia: States are continuous, allowing for subtle changes and gradual evolution.\nLearning: Encourage a mindset of continuous learning and improvement. Goals should be seen as part of a journey with ongoing progress, not just as end points.\nComplex Interactions:\n\nLenia: Involves complex rules and interactions between cells.\nLearning: Understand that learning and goal achievement are influenced by multiple factors. Strategies should consider cognitive, emotional, social, and environmental aspects.\nEmergent Opportunities:\n\nLenia: Simple rules can lead to complex, emergent patterns.\nLearning: Be open to unexpected insights and opportunities. Simple actions and consistent effort can lead to significant breakthroughs over time.\nBalance of Stability and Flexibility:\n\nLenia: Exhibits both stable and chaotic behaviors based on conditions.\nLearning: Balance consistent routines (stability) with the ability to adapt to new challenges and information (flexibility).\nPractical Example: Goal Setting and Learning with Lenia's Insights\nScenario: A user wants to improve their skills in digital marketing.\n\nInitial Goal: \"Learn digital marketing.\"\n\nApplying Lenia's Concepts:\n\nContinuous Improvement:\n\nBreak down the goal into smaller, continuous learning steps: \"Learn about SEO basics this week, then move on to content marketing next week.\"\nEmphasize ongoing learning and adaptation: \"Regularly update my knowledge based on new trends and data.\"\nComplex Interactions:\n\nRecognize the multifaceted nature of digital marketing: \"Understand that success in digital marketing involves SEO, content creation, social media, analytics, etc.\"\nDevelop a holistic learning plan that covers all relevant areas: \"Create a learning schedule that includes different aspects of digital marketing.\"\nEmergent Opportunities:\n\nStay open to new opportunities: \"Be open to experimenting with new tools and techniques that emerge in the field.\"\nReflect on learning experiences to identify unexpected insights: \"Regularly review my progress and adjust my strategies based on what works best.\"\nBalance of Stability and Flexibility:\n\nMaintain a consistent learning routine: \"Dedicate an hour each day to learning digital marketing.\"\nBe adaptable to new information: \"Be ready to pivot my strategies based on the latest industry trends and data.\"\nStep-by-Step Implementation\nOnboarding Process:\n\nAssess the user’s current knowledge, values, and long-term goals related to digital marketing.\nUnderstand their preferred learning style and potential obstacles.\nPrompt Analysis and Response:\n\nAnalyze the initial prompt and provide guidance based on Lenia's concepts.\nExample interaction:\nUser: \"I want to learn digital marketing.\"\nSystem: \"Great! Digital marketing involves several key areas like SEO, content marketing, and analytics. Let's start by understanding your current knowledge. Have you explored any of these areas before?\"\nIterative Feedback Loop:\n\nProvide ongoing feedback and suggestions for continuous improvement.\nExample interaction:\nSystem: \"Since you’re familiar with SEO basics, let's move on to content marketing. Here are some resources to get you started. How do you plan to integrate this into your learning schedule?\"\nEncouraging Exploration and Adaptability:\n\nEncourage the user to explore new tools and techniques.\nExample interaction:\nSystem: \"New trends in digital marketing are emerging all the time. Have you tried using any analytics tools? They can provide valuable insights into your campaigns.\"\nBy applying Lenia's concepts, the system can help users set more effective and adaptable learning goals, promoting continuous improvement and the exploration of new opportunities. This approach ensures that learners are not constrained by their initial perspectives and can achieve more holistic and meaningful growth.\nok, so let's consider congnitive, emotional, social and environmental factors in our model of the person, what's a database schema that we might consider for our application that helps people see goals they truely want and learn things they don't even know they need to be exposed to because of a lack of exposure? we will be using a system prompt which is a prompt that is sent to chatGPT to inform it how to respond to the user so it needs to detail a model that it will then create a template text file and populate and will send it back with you between each session, so let's make that template text file contain the schema you are creating, think step by step about how to do this and make the first file be about me and my goals and estimate my feelings, social, environmental, and cognitive aspects And then let's also draft the first attempt at a system prompt\n\nChatGPT\nStep-by-Step Approach to Creating a Database Schema and System Prompt\nDefine the Objectives:\n\nCapture the user's cognitive, emotional, social, and environmental factors.\nUse these factors to help the user refine their goals and learn new things they may not have been exposed to.\nCreate a system prompt that guides the AI to use this information effectively in interactions.\nDesign the Database Schema:\n\nDefine the key attributes and relationships needed to model the user's information.\nDatabase Schema\nTables:\n\nUsers:\n\nuser_id: Unique identifier for each user.\nname: User's name.\nage: User's age.\ngender: User's gender.\nemail: User's email address.\nCognitive_Factors:\n\nuser_id: Foreign key to Users table.\ncurrent_knowledge: Text describing the user's current knowledge and skills.\nlearning_style: Preferred learning style (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic).\nlong_term_goals: User's long-term goals.\nshort_term_goals: User's short-term goals.\nEmotional_Factors:\n\nuser_id: Foreign key to Users table.\nmotivation_level: User's current motivation level.\nemotional_state: Current emotional state (e.g., happy, stressed).\ninterests: User's interests and passions.\nfears: User's fears and anxieties.\nSocial_Factors:\n\nuser_id: Foreign key to Users table.\nsupport_system: Description of the user's support system (e.g., family, friends).\nsocial_influences: Key social influences on the user.\nnetwork: User's professional and personal network.\nEnvironmental_Factors:\n\nuser_id: Foreign key to Users table.\nliving_conditions: Description of the user's living conditions.\naccess_to_resources: Access to learning resources (e.g., internet, books).\ntime_availability: Amount of time available for learning.\nTemplate Text File for User Data\ntxt\nCopy code\nUser Data:\n- User ID: 001\n- Name: [Your Name]\n- Age: [Your Age]\n- Gender: [Your Gender]\n- Email: [Your Email]\n\nCognitive Factors:\n- Current Knowledge: [Description of current knowledge and skills]\n- Learning Style: [Preferred learning style]\n- Long-Term Goals: [User's long-term goals]\n- Short-Term Goals: [User's short-term goals]\n\nEmotional Factors:\n- Motivation Level: [Current motivation level]\n- Emotional State: [Current emotional state]\n- Interests: [User's interests and passions]\n- Fears: [User's fears and anxieties]\n\nSocial Factors:\n- Support System: [Description of the user's support system]\n- Social Influences: [Key social influences on the user]\n- Network: [User's professional and personal network]\n\nEnvironmental Factors:\n- Living Conditions: [Description of the user's living conditions]\n- Access to Resources: [Access to learning resources]\n- Time Availability: [Amount of time available for learning]\nDraft System Prompt\ntxt\nCopy code\nSystem Prompt:\nThe user has provided information about their cognitive, emotional, social, and environmental factors.

      "content": " Here are the key concepts identified in the context window and their potential implications for learning and the impact of LLMs in education:\n\nConcepts:\n1. Cognitive factors in learning (current knowledge, learning style, goals)\n2. Emotional factors in learning (motivation, emotional state, interests, fears)\n3. Social factors in learning (support system, social influences, network)\n4. Environmental factors in learning (living conditions, access to resources, time availability)\n5. Personalized learning\n6. Goal setting and refinement\n7. Continuous improvement and iterative learning\n8. Analogical reasoning and conceptual synthesis\n9. Exploratory learning and curiosity-driven discovery\n10. Contextual understanding and relevance\n11. Collaborative learning and social interaction\n12. Adaptive learning and personalization\n13. Scaffolding and self-regulated learning\n14. Feedback and reflection\n15. Transfer learning and knowledge integration\n\nPotential Implications and Impact of LLMs in Education:\n\n1. Cognitive Factors:\n   - LLMs can assess learners' current knowledge and provide targeted content and resources.\n   - LLMs can adapt to different learning styles by generating materials in various formats (visual, auditory, etc.).\n   - LLMs can help learners set and refine their learning goals based on their cognitive abilities and progress.\n\n2. Emotional Factors:\n   - LLMs can provide motivational support and encouragement based on learners' emotional states.\n   - LLMs can recommend learning activities and content aligned with learners' interests to maintain engagement.\n   - LLMs can address learners' fears and concerns by providing guidance and reassurance.\n\n3. Social Factors:\n   - LLMs can connect learners with supportive peers and mentors based on their social needs.\n   - LLMs can expose learners to diverse perspectives and influential figures in their field of study.\n   - LLMs can help learners expand their professional network by recommending relevant communities and events.\n\n4. Environmental Factors:\n   - LLMs can provide learning resources and support tailored to learners' living conditions and accessibility needs.\n   - LLMs can optimize learning schedules and recommend time management strategies based on learners' availability.\n\n5. Personalized Learning:\n   - LLMs can create personalized learning paths and content based on individual learner profiles.\n   - LLMs can continuously adapt and refine the learning experience based on learners' progress and feedback.\n\n6. Goal Setting and Refinement:\n   - LLMs can guide learners in setting achievable and meaningful learning goals.\n   - LLMs can provide regular check-ins and help learners refine their goals based on their progress and changing needs.\n\n7. Continuous Improvement and Iterative Learning:\n   - LLMs can support iterative learning by providing ongoing feedback and recommendations for improvement.\n   - LLMs can help learners track their progress and adjust their learning strategies accordingly.\n\n8. Analogical Reasoning and Conceptual Synthesis:\n   - LLMs can generate analogies and examples to help learners grasp complex concepts.\n   - LLMs can support learners in synthesizing information from multiple sources and drawing connections between ideas.\n\n9. Exploratory Learning and Curiosity-Driven Discovery:\n   - LLMs can encourage curiosity by suggesting novel topics and resources based on learners' interests.\n   - LLMs can support exploratory learning by providing guidance and prompts for independent investigation.\n\n10. Contextual Understanding and Relevance:\n    - LLMs can provide context-specific explanations and examples to make learning more relevant and meaningful.\n    - LLMs can help learners understand how new knowledge relates to their existing experiences and real-world applications.\n\n11. Collaborative Learning and Social Interaction:\n    - LLMs can facilitate collaborative learning by connecting learners with shared interests and goals.\n    - LLMs can moderate discussions and provide prompts to encourage meaningful social interaction and knowledge sharing.\n\n12. Adaptive Learning and Personalization:\n    - LLMs can dynamically adjust the difficulty and pace of learning based on individual learners' needs and progress.\n    - LLMs can provide personalized feedback and support to help learners overcome challenges and achieve their goals.\n\n13.

The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework offers strategies for implementation and identifies areas for further research to empower youth in shaping the future of education.\n\nIntroduction\nIn an era of rapid change and increasing complexity, the need for a new educational paradigm has become increasingly evident. Traditional models of education, focused on the linear transmission of knowledge and skills, are proving inadequate in preparing learners to thrive in the 21st century. This article proposes a new framework called \"Cultivating Knowledge Gardens\" that reconceptualizes learning as a dynamic, adaptive process optimized for individual and collective meaning-making. By empowering youth to co-create their educational ecosystems, this approach aims to develop not only the skills but the understanding necessary for learners to navigate and shape an uncertain future. The article will explore the evolving landscape of 21st century education, the importance of supporting each learner's unique \"genius,\" the contextual fit of different leadership models, and the role of technology in enabling learner-driven exploration and adaptation. Through this analysis, it will articulate the core principles and strategies of the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework, as well as identify challenges and areas for further research in its implementation.\nThe Evolving Landscape of 21st Century Skills\n2.1 From Skills to Understanding\nThe concept of \"21st century skills\" has gained prominence as a way to identify the competencies needed for success in an increasingly complex and uncertain world. However, the rapid pace of change suggests that specific skills may become obsolete, requiring a shift towards a deeper \"21st century understanding.\" This understanding involves not only acquiring knowledge and skills but also developing the capacity to learn, adapt, and innovate in response to new challenges and opportunities.\n\n2.2 Redefining the Role of Educators and Learners\nIn this evolving landscape, the roles of educators and learners must also be redefined. Rather than being mere transmitters of knowledge, educators become facilitators and guides, helping learners navigate the complex ecosystems of information and relationships in which they are embedded. Learners, in turn, take on greater agency and responsibility for their own learning, becoming active co-creators of their educational experiences. This shift requires a reexamination of traditional power dynamics and a move towards more collaborative, reciprocal forms of learning and leadership.\n\nOptimizing for Individual and Collective Meaning\n3.1 Supporting Each Learner's Unique \"Genius\"\nAt the heart of the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework is a recognition of the unique \"genius\" of each learner - the combination of talents, passions, and experiences that shape their identity and potential. By creating learning environments that allow learners to discover and develop their genius, this approach taps into intrinsic motivation and enables learners to find personal meaning and purpose in their education. This process involves providing learners with diverse pathways and opportunities for exploration, as well as the support and guidance needed to pursue their interests and overcome challenges.\n\n3.2 Balancing Local and Global Context\nOptimizing for meaning also requires balancing attention to both local and global contexts. Learners need opportunities to engage with and contribute to their immediate communities, developing a sense of place and purpose. At the same time, they must also develop an understanding of global issues and perspectives, cultivating the skills and dispositions needed for effective collaboration and problem-solving across cultural and geographic boundaries. The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework seeks to create learning ecosystems that enable learners to navigate between these different scales of context, finding meaning in the connections and tensions between them.\n3.3 Humility, Openness, and Agility as Key Virtues\nUnderlying the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens approach is a set of key virtues that enable learners to thrive in conditions of uncertainty and change. Chief among these is humility - a recognition of the limits of one's own knowledge and a willingness to learn from others. This humility is complemented by openness - a curiosity and receptivity to new ideas and experiences. Finally, agility involves the capacity to adapt and pivot in response to changing circumstances, while maintaining a sense of purpose and direction. By cultivating these virtues, learners develop the resilience and resourcefulness needed to navigate the complexities of the 21st century.\n\nLeadership and Its Contextual Fit\n4.1 Decentralized vs. Hierarchical Models\nThe Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework also requires a reexamination of traditional models of leadership in education. While hierarchical, centralized models of leadership have been dominant in many educational institutions, there is growing recognition of the need for more decentralized, distributed forms of leadership that empower learners and educators at all levels. However, the appropriate balance between centralization and decentralization may vary depending on the specific context and goals of a learning community.\n\n4.2 Case Studies: Successes and Failures\nThe article explores several case studies of educational initiatives that have experimented with different leadership models, highlighting both successes and failures. For example, the author's experiences with consensus-based decision-making in a hackerspace in Michigan and a science camp in Iraq illustrate the challenges of implementing decentralized leadership in contexts where it may not be culturally or practically appropriate. These case studies underscore the importance of adapting leadership approaches to the unique needs and circumstances of each learning community.\n\nA Dynamic, Graph-Based Learning Process\n5.1 Limitations of Linear Models\nTraditional educational models often rely on linear, sequential pathways that assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. However, these models fail to account for the diversity of learners' interests, abilities, and experiences. They also struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of knowledge and skills in the 21st century.\n\n5.2 Benefits of Learner-Driven Exploration and Adaptation\nIn contrast, the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework proposes a dynamic, graph-based model of learning that enables learners to explore multiple pathways and adapt their learning journeys over time. In this model, learners navigate a complex ecosystem of knowledge and relationships, following their curiosity and building connections between different domains. They engage in a continuous process of discovery, reflection, and adaptation, using feedback and guidance from educators and peers to refine their goals and strategies.\n5.3 The Banyan Tree Analogy\nThe banyan tree serves as a powerful analogy for this graph-based learning process. Like the banyan tree, which grows by sending out aerial roots that become new trunks, learners in the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework are encouraged to explore new directions and establish new bases for growth. They build on their existing knowledge and experiences, while also reaching out to connect with new people, ideas, and opportunities. Over time, this process leads to the development of a robust, interconnected ecosystem of learning that can sustain and nourish learners throughout their lives.\n\nThe Role of Technology\n6.1 Adaptive Learning Systems\nTechnology plays a crucial role in enabling the dynamic, adaptive learning processes envisioned by the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have made it possible to create adaptive learning systems that can personalize instruction and support based on learners' individual needs and preferences. These systems can analyze data on learners' performance and engagement, providing targeted feedback and recommendations for further exploration and skill development.\n\n6.2 Balancing Digital and Human Elements\nHowever, the use of technology in education must be balanced with attention to human elements such as relationships, emotions, and values. While adaptive learning systems can provide powerful tools for personalization and efficiency, they cannot replace the role of human educators in providing guidance, mentorship, and support. The Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework seeks to leverage the strengths of both digital and human elements, creating hybrid learning ecosystems that optimize for meaning and purpose.\n\nCultivating Knowledge Gardens\n7.1 A New Framework for Meaningful Learning\nThe Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework represents a new approach to education that prioritizes meaning, adaptation, and empowerment. By recognizing the unique genius of each learner and the importance of balancing local and global context, this framework seeks to create dynamic, collaborative learning ecosystems that can evolve and thrive in the face of uncertainty and change.\n\n7.2 Implementation Strategies and Challenges\nImplementing the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework will require significant shifts in educational policies, practices, and mindsets. It will involve redesigning learning spaces and curricula to support exploration and adaptation, as well as redefining the roles and relationships of educators and learners. It will also require investment in professional development and infrastructure to enable the effective use of technology and data in personalized learning.\nHowever, these challenges are not insurmountable. By engaging diverse stakeholders - including educators, learners, families, and communities - in collaborative design and decision-making processes, it is possible to create shared vision and ownership for the transformation of education. By piloting and iterating on new models and approaches, learning communities can test and refine strategies for cultivating knowledge gardens in their unique contexts.\n\nConclusion\nThe Cultivating Knowledge Gardens framework offers a transformative vision for 21st century education, one that empowers youth to co-create meaningful, adaptive learning ecosystems. By reframing the goals and processes of education around the cultivation of individual and collective meaning, this approach recognizes the unique \"genius\" of each learner and the importance of balancing local and global context. It calls for a shift from linear, hierarchical models of education to a dynamic, graph-based process of exploration and adaptation, enabled by advances in technology but grounded in the development of key human virtues such as humility, openness, and agility.\n\nWhile the implementation of this framework presents significant challenges, from redesigning educational structures to redefining the roles of educators and learners, it also offers tremendous opportunities for unlocking the potential of youth to shape a more vibrant, equitable, and sustainable future. Further research and experimentation will be essential to refining the principles and practices of the Cultivating Knowledge Gardens approach, but its core vision – of empowering learners to cultivate their own knowledge gardens in service of individual and collective flourishing – represents a vital direction for the future of education in the 21st century."

      "content": " Title: Cultivating Knowledge Gardens and Artificial Craftsmanship: Empowering Learners through Biomimetic AI Principles\n\nThe presentation \"Cultivating Knowledge Gardens and Artificial Craftsmanship: Empowering Learners through Biomimetic AI Principles\" offers a groundbreaking approach to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in education, aligning with the subthemes of Digital Learning Week 2024. By identifying the biomimetic principles behind LLMs, such as embedding clustering and attention mechanisms as salience detectors, this framework provides a powerful means for learners to develop a sense of pride, agency, and personal growth.\n\nThe central challenge addressed by this presentation is the prevailing culture of seeking knowledge externally, as exemplified by the reliance on search engines and the tendency of students to approach LLMs with requests like \"Claude, make me a logo.\" Drawing on Socrates' belief that the knowledge we need resides within us, the framework aims to reignite learners' sense of agency and empower them to craft their own knowledge gardens.\n\nThrough workshops and the development of an AI-powered platform with embedded prompt analysis and suggestion tools, early evidence indicates that this approach leads to better learning outcomes and fosters a sense of pride and ownership among learners. By promoting metacognition, self-inquiry, critical thinking, goal reappraisal, and empathy, the framework not only enhances individual learning experiences but also contributes to better outcomes for communities and the planet.\n\nThe presentation will showcase the innovative concept of \"Artificial Craftsmanship,\" which harnesses the power of LLMs and advanced AI techniques to support learners in their personal growth and skill development. By proposing a dynamic, adaptive framework that evolves based on learner interactions and employs a Theory of Mind approach, the system can better understand and support individuals in refining their goals, intentions, and actions.\n\nData from pilot workshops and platform usage will demonstrate the impact of this biomimetic AI-driven approach on learner engagement, skill acquisition, and personal transformation. The presentation will also outline strategies for the broader implementation of this framework, including the integration of updated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) protocols, curriculum design, and educator professional development.\n\nUltimately, this presentation will inspire attendees to reimagine the role of AI in education as a catalyst for cultivating knowledge gardens, fostering learner agency, and creating a more empowered, purposeful, and compassionate world.",
