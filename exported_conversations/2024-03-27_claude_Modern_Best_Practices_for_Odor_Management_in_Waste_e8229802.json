One option is air scrubbing, which involves removing odor-causing compounds from the air using various techniques such as chemical reactions or absorption [1]. Another method is biofiltration, which utilizes microorganisms to degrade and remove odorous compounds from the wastewater [1]. Additionally, activated carbon can be employed to adsorb and remove odor-causing substances from the air or water [1].\n\nIn the context of a Treatment Shaft-based wastewater treatment plant in Iraq, it is important to gather information on locally preferred options. However, there is a limited amount of specific research available on odor management options for treatment shafts with a 100m diameter lid in Iraq. Therefore, it is necessary to compare global best practices with methods available in Iraq to make an informed decision.\n\nWhile there is a lack of data specific to Iraq, it is essential to consider the expertise and experience of professionals in the field. Expert quotes from the last 20 years can provide valuable insights into odor management options for treatment shafts.

      "content": " Thank you for providing those details. Here are the short paragraphs for each odor management technique, tailored to your project:\n\n1. Biofilters: Biofilters use a bed of organic material (such as wood chips, peat, or compost) to support a population of odor-degrading microorganisms. As odorous air passes through the filter, the microbes break down the odorous compounds. Biofilters could be integrated into the treatment shafts as a standalone unit to treat odorous air before it is released.\n\n2. Biotrickling filters: Similar to biofilters, biotrickling filters use microorganisms to degrade odorous compounds. However, they use an inert packing material (such as plastic or ceramic) instead of organic media, and a liquid nutrient solution is trickled over the packing to support microbial growth. Biotrickling filters could be installed as a standalone unit to treat odorous air from the treatment shafts.\n\n3. Chemical scrubbers: Chemical scrubbers use a liquid solution to absorb odorous compounds from the air. The most common types are wet scrubbers, which use a caustic solution (such as sodium hydroxide) to remove hydrogen sulfide and other acidic gases. Chemical scrubbers could be integrated into the treatment shafts' ventilation system to treat odorous air before it is released.\n\n4. Activated carbon adsorption: Activated carbon is a highly porous material that can adsorb odorous compounds from the air. The odorous air is passed through a bed of activated carbon, which removes the odors. Activated carbon systems could be installed as standalone units to treat air from the treatment shafts before it is released.\n\n5. Biofiltration with activated sludge: In this approach, a portion of the activated sludge from the bioreactor is used as a media for biofiltration. The odorous air is passed through the sludge, and the microorganisms in the sludge degrade the odorous compounds. This technique could be integrated into the existing bioreactor system.\n\n6. Ionization: Ionization systems use an electrical charge to generate negatively charged ions, which attach to odorous particles in the air and neutralize them. Ionization units could be installed in the ventilation system of the treatment shafts to treat odorous air before it is released.\n\n7. Masking agents and neutralizers: Masking agents are chemicals with a strong, pleasant odor that can overwhelm and conceal the offensive odors. Neutralizers are chemicals that react with odorous compounds to form less odorous substances. These chemicals could be added directly to the wastewater or applied as a mist in the headspace of the treatment shafts.\n\n8. Covering and containment: Since the treatment shafts already have a lid that remains closed during operation, this serves as a form of covering and containment. Ensuring that the lids are properly sealed and maintained can help to minimize the release of odors.\n\nBased on your preference for simple, local, and natural solutions, biofilters or biofiltration with activated sludge may be the most suitable options for your project. These techniques rely on naturally occurring microorganisms and can be integrated into the existing system or installed as standalone units. They also have a relatively small footprint and low energy requirements compared to some of the other options.",

While the outline covers many important aspects, there are a few areas that need further clarification and improvement. Here are my questions and critiques:\n\n1. In section 2, \"Wastewater Characteristics and Odor Sources,\" you've identified the main odor-causing compounds and potential odor sources within the treatment plant. However, have you considered the specific characteristics of the wastewater in Baghdad, such as temperature, pH, and organic loading? These factors can significantly influence the generation and intensity of odors. Please include a subsection addressing these site-specific wastewater characteristics and their potential impact on odor generation.\n\n2. In section 3, \"Odor Control Regulations and Standards,\" you've mentioned the Iraqi Ministry of Environment's role and the National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan for Iraq. However, are there any specific odor emission limits or standards that the Medical City wastewater treatment plant must comply with? If such limits exist, please include them in this section. If not, discuss how the WHO guidelines can be used as a reference to establish performance targets for the odor control system.\n\n3. In section 4, \"Odor Control Technologies,\" you've listed several technologies and mentioned that you'll include case studies of successful implementation in the MENA region. While this is valuable information, it's also essential to discuss the specific design considerations and sizing criteria for each technology based on the Medical City plant's requirements. Can you add a subsection for each technology that addresses these design aspects, such as the required footprint, media volume, empty bed residence time (EBRT), and other relevant parameters? This will help the design team better understand the practical implications of implementing each technology.\n\n4. In section 6, \"Recommendations for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant,\" you've mentioned a phased implementation plan considering budget and timeline. Can you provide more details on how you'll prioritize the implementation of odor control technologies? Will you consider a combination of technologies to target different odor sources, or will you recommend a single, comprehensive solution? Please elaborate on the decision-making process and criteria for selecting the most appropriate odor control strategy for the Medical City plant.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest adding a section between sections 5 and 6 that discusses the potential challenges and limitations of implementing odor control technologies in the context of Baghdad. This could include factors such as the availability of skilled personnel for operation and maintenance, the reliability of power supply, and the potential impact of dust, high temperatures, and other environmental conditions on the performance of the odor control systems.\n\nPlease address these questions and incorporate the suggested improvements into the outline. Once you've made these changes, I believe the research document will be more comprehensive and better suited to guide the design team in selecting and implementing an effective odor control strategy for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant.",

Introduction\n\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq, is a critical facility serving the healthcare complex and surrounding areas. With a daily wastewater flow rate of 150,000 m³, effective odor control is essential to maintain a healthy and pleasant environment for the community and the plant's operators. This research document aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local regulations, and available technologies.\n\n## 2. Wastewater Characteristics and Odor Sources\n\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant receives a daily flow of 150,000 m³, containing various odor-causing compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), ammonia (NH₃), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and mercaptans. These compounds are generated through the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the wastewater. The main potential odor sources within the plant include:\n\n- Headworks (screens, grit removal)\n- Primary clarifiers\n- Aeration basins\n- Sludge handling and treatment units\n\nThe site-specific wastewater characteristics, such as temperature, pH, and organic loading, can significantly impact odor generation. Higher temperatures and organic loading can increase odor generation, while low pH can promote the formation of hydrogen sulfide. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for designing an effective odor control system.\n\n## 3. Odor Control Regulations and Standards\n\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Environment is responsible for setting and enforcing environmental regulations, including those related to odor emissions from wastewater treatment plants. The National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan for Iraq (2013-2017) highlights the need for developing and implementing odor control regulations.\n\n(Specific odor emission limits or standards for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, if applicable)\n\nIn the absence of specific local standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for odor management in wastewater treatment plants can be used as a reference to establish performance targets for the odor control system.\n\n## 4. Odor Control Technologies\n\nSeveral odor control technologies are available for wastewater treatment plants, each with its advantages, limitations, and design considerations. The most relevant technologies for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant include:\n\n### 4.1 Biofilters\n\nBiofilters use a bed of organic media, such as wood chips or compost, to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. As odorous air passes through the media, the microorganisms break down the odorous compounds, converting them into harmless products. Biofilters are effective for treating a wide range of odorous compounds and have low operating costs. However, they require a relatively large footprint and regular media replacement.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biofilters include:\n- Media type and depth\n- Airflow rate and empty bed residence time (EBRT)\n- Moisture content and pH control\n- Nutrient supply and irrigation system\n\n(Case studies of successful biofilter implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.2 Biotrickling Filters\n\nBiotrickling filters are similar to biofilters but use an inert media, such as plastic or ceramic, instead of organic media. A nutrient solution is continuously trickled over the media to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. Biotrickling filters are effective for treating high-concentration odorous air streams and have a smaller footprint compared to biofilters. However, they require more complex operation and maintenance, including pH control and nutrient dosing.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biotrickling filters include:\n- Media type and surface area\n- Airflow rate and EBRT\n- Nutrient solution composition and flow rate\n- pH control and monitoring\n- Biomass control and removal\n\n(Case studies of successful biotrickling filter implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.3 Chemical Scrubbers\n\nChemical scrubbers use a liquid solution, typically containing chemicals such as sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite, to absorb and remove odorous compounds from the air. They are effective for removing specific compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, but may not be suitable for a wide range of odors. Chemical scrubbers have a relatively small footprint but require careful handling and storage of chemicals, as well as regular maintenance and monitoring.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for chemical scrubbers include:\n- Scrubber type (packed tower, spray tower, or venturi)\n- Chemical selection and concentration\n- Airflow rate and contact time\n- pH control and monitoring\n- Corrosion-resistant materials and equipment\n\n(Case studies of successful chemical scrubber implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.4 Activated Carbon Adsorption\n\nActivated carbon adsorption systems use granular or pelletized activated carbon to remove odorous compounds from the air. The odorous compounds are adsorbed onto the surface of the activated carbon, which has a high surface area and porosity. Activated carbon systems are effective for removing a wide range of odorous compounds but require periodic replacement or regeneration of the carbon media.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for activated carbon adsorption systems include:\n- Carbon type and quality\n- Airflow rate and contact time\n- Relative humidity and temperature\n- Pretreatment for dust and moisture removal\n- Carbon replacement or regeneration frequency\n\n(Case studies of successful activated carbon adsorption system implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.5 Biofiltration with Activated Sludge\n\nBiofiltration with activated sludge involves the use of a portion of the activated sludge from the wastewater treatment process to treat odorous air. The odorous air is bubbled through a tank containing the activated sludge, where odor-degrading microorganisms break down the odorous compounds. This method utilizes the existing resources of the treatment plant but requires careful integration with the activated sludge process and proper aeration.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biofiltration with activated sludge include:\n- Activated sludge characteristics and concentration\n- Airflow rate and bubble size\n- Aeration and mixing requirements\n- Sludge recirculation and wasting\n- Foam control and monitoring\n\n(Case studies of successful biofiltration with activated sludge implementation in the MENA region)\n\n## 5. Comparative Analysis of Odor Control Technologies\n\nTo select the most appropriate odor control technology for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, a comparative analysis of the available options is necessary. The following factors should be considered:\n\n- Odor removal efficiency\n- Capital and operating costs\n- Environmental impact\n- Compatibility with existing treatment processes\n- Ease of operation and maintenance\n- Availability of local materials and expertise\n\n(Table comparing the odor control technologies based on the above factors)\n\n## 6. Challenges and Limitations of Implementing Odor Control Technologies in Baghdad\n\nImplementing odor control technologies in Baghdad may face several challenges and limitations, including:\n\n- Availability of skilled personnel for operation and maintenance\n- Reliability of power supply\n- Impact of dust, high temperatures, and other environmental conditions on the performance of odor control systems\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful planning, training, and adaptation of the selected odor control technology to the local context.\n\n## 7. Recommendations for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\nBased on the comparative analysis and considering the site-specific conditions and challenges, the following recommendations are made for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant:\n\n(Prioritized list of odor control technologies)\n\nThe prioritization and decision-making process should consider:\n- Combining technologies to target different odor sources\n- Criteria for selecting the most appropriate odor control strategy, such as effectiveness, cost, environmental impact, and ease of implementation\n\nA phased implementation plan, considering budget and timeline, should be developed to ensure the gradual and successful integration of the selected odor control technologies with the existing treatment processes. Regular monitoring and performance evaluation should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the implemented odor control system and identify areas for improvement.\n\n## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis research document has provided a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq. By considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local regulations, and available technologies, the document has outlined a prioritized list of recommendations for effective odor control.\n\nImplementing the recommended odor control technologies will require careful planning, design, and adaptation to the local context. Ongoing odor management and continuous improvement are essential to ensure the long-term success of the odor control system and maintain a healthy and pleasant environment for the community and the plant's operators.\n\nThe next steps for implementation include:\n- Detailed design and engineering of the selected odor control technologies\n- Procurement of necessary equipment and materials\n- Construction and installation of the odor control system\n- Commissioning and performance testing\n- Training of plant operators and maintenance personnel\n- Regular monitoring and evaluation of the odor control system's performance\n\nBy following the recommendations and guidance provided in this document, the Medical City wastewater treatment plant can effectively manage odors and contribute to the well-being of the surrounding community.\n\n## References\n\n(List of cited sources, including case studies, research papers, and regulatory documents)\n\n## Appendices\n\n(Detailed cost estimates for recommended odor control technologies, technical specifications and design considerations, vendor information and quotations, if applicable)",

Introduction\n\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq, is a critical facility serving the healthcare complex and surrounding areas. With a daily wastewater flow rate of 150,000 m³, effective odor control is essential to maintain a healthy and pleasant environment for the community and the plant's operators. This research document aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local regulations, and available technologies.\n\n## 2. Wastewater Characteristics and Odor Sources\n\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant receives a daily flow of 150,000 m³, containing various odor-causing compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), ammonia (NH₃), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and mercaptans. These compounds are generated through the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the wastewater. The main potential odor sources within the plant include:\n\n- Headworks (screens, grit removal)\n- Primary clarifiers\n- Aeration basins\n- Sludge handling and treatment units\n\nThe site-specific wastewater characteristics, such as temperature, pH, and organic loading, can significantly impact odor generation. Higher temperatures and organic loading can increase odor generation, while low pH can promote the formation of hydrogen sulfide. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for designing an effective odor control system.\n\n## 3. Odor Control Regulations and Standards\n\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Environment is responsible for setting and enforcing environmental regulations, including those related to odor emissions from wastewater treatment plants. The National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan for Iraq (2013-2017) highlights the need for developing and implementing odor control regulations.\n\n(Specific odor emission limits or standards for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, if applicable)\n\nIn the absence of specific local standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for odor management in wastewater treatment plants can be used as a reference to establish performance targets for the odor control system.\n\n## 4. Odor Control Technologies\n\nSeveral odor control technologies are available for wastewater treatment plants, each with its advantages, limitations, and design considerations. The most relevant technologies for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant include:\n\n### 4.1 Biofilters\n\nBiofilters use a bed of organic media, such as wood chips or compost, to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. As odorous air passes through the media, the microorganisms break down the odorous compounds, converting them into harmless products. Biofilters are effective for treating a wide range of odorous compounds and have low operating costs. However, they require a relatively large footprint and regular media replacement.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biofilters include:\n- Media type and depth\n- Airflow rate and empty bed residence time (EBRT)\n- Moisture content and pH control\n- Nutrient supply and irrigation system\n\n(Case studies of successful biofilter implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.2 Biotrickling Filters\n\nBiotrickling filters are similar to biofilters but use an inert media, such as plastic or ceramic, instead of organic media. A nutrient solution is continuously trickled over the media to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. Biotrickling filters are effective for treating high-concentration odorous air streams and have a smaller footprint compared to biofilters. However, they require more complex operation and maintenance, including pH control and nutrient dosing.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biotrickling filters include:\n- Media type and surface area\n- Airflow rate and EBRT\n- Nutrient solution composition and flow rate\n- pH control and monitoring\n- Biomass control and removal\n\n(Case studies of successful biotrickling filter implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.3 Chemical Scrubbers\n\nChemical scrubbers use a liquid solution, typically containing chemicals such as sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite, to absorb and remove odorous compounds from the air. They are effective for removing specific compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, but may not be suitable for a wide range of odors. Chemical scrubbers have a relatively small footprint but require careful handling and storage of chemicals, as well as regular maintenance and monitoring.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for chemical scrubbers include:\n- Scrubber type (packed tower, spray tower, or venturi)\n- Chemical selection and concentration\n- Airflow rate and contact time\n- pH control and monitoring\n- Corrosion-resistant materials and equipment\n\n(Case studies of successful chemical scrubber implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.4 Activated Carbon Adsorption\n\nActivated carbon adsorption systems use granular or pelletized activated carbon to remove odorous compounds from the air. The odorous compounds are adsorbed onto the surface of the activated carbon, which has a high surface area and porosity. Activated carbon systems are effective for removing a wide range of odorous compounds but require periodic replacement or regeneration of the carbon media.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for activated carbon adsorption systems include:\n- Carbon type and quality\n- Airflow rate and contact time\n- Relative humidity and temperature\n- Pretreatment for dust and moisture removal\n- Carbon replacement or regeneration frequency\n\n(Case studies of successful activated carbon adsorption system implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.5 Biofiltration with Activated Sludge\n\nBiofiltration with activated sludge involves the use of a portion of the activated sludge from the wastewater treatment process to treat odorous air. The odorous air is bubbled through a tank containing the activated sludge, where odor-degrading microorganisms break down the odorous compounds. This method utilizes the existing resources of the treatment plant but requires careful integration with the activated sludge process and proper aeration.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biofiltration with activated sludge include:\n- Activated sludge characteristics and concentration\n- Airflow rate and bubble size\n- Aeration and mixing requirements\n- Sludge recirculation and wasting\n- Foam control and monitoring\n\n(Case studies of successful biofiltration with activated sludge implementation in the MENA region)\n\n## 5. Comparative Analysis of Odor Control Technologies\n\nTo select the most appropriate odor control technology for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, a comparative analysis of the available options is necessary. The following factors should be considered:\n\n- Odor removal efficiency\n- Capital and operating costs\n- Environmental impact\n- Compatibility with existing treatment processes\n- Ease of operation and maintenance\n- Availability of local materials and expertise\n\n(Table comparing the odor control technologies based on the above factors)\n\n## 6. Challenges and Limitations of Implementing Odor Control Technologies in Baghdad\n\nImplementing odor control technologies in Baghdad may face several challenges and limitations, including:\n\n- Availability of skilled personnel for operation and maintenance\n- Reliability of power supply\n- Impact of dust, high temperatures, and other environmental conditions on the performance of odor control systems\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful planning, training, and adaptation of the selected odor control technology to the local context.\n\n## 7. Recommendations for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\nBased on the comparative analysis and considering the site-specific conditions and challenges, the following recommendations are made for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant:\n\n(Prioritized list of odor control technologies)\n\nThe prioritization and decision-making process should consider:\n- Combining technologies to target different odor sources\n- Criteria for selecting the most appropriate odor control strategy, such as effectiveness, cost, environmental impact, and ease of implementation\n\nA phased implementation plan, considering budget and timeline, should be developed to ensure the gradual and successful integration of the selected odor control technologies with the existing treatment processes. Regular monitoring and performance evaluation should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the implemented odor control system and identify areas for improvement.\n\n## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis research document has provided a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq. By considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local regulations, and available technologies, the document has outlined a prioritized list of recommendations for effective odor control.\n\nImplementing the recommended odor control technologies will require careful planning, design, and adaptation to the local context. Ongoing odor management and continuous improvement are essential to ensure the long-term success of the odor control system and maintain a healthy and pleasant environment for the community and the plant's operators.\n\nThe next steps for implementation include:\n- Detailed design and engineering of the selected odor control technologies\n- Procurement of necessary equipment and materials\n- Construction and installation of the odor control system\n- Commissioning and performance testing\n- Training of plant operators and maintenance personnel\n- Regular monitoring and evaluation of the odor control system's performance\n\nBy following the recommendations and guidance provided in this document, the Medical City wastewater treatment plant can effectively manage odors and contribute to the well-being of the surrounding community.\n\n## References\n\n(List of cited sources, including case studies, research papers, and regulatory documents)\n\n## Appendices\n\n(Detailed cost estimates for recommended odor control technologies, technical specifications and design considerations, vendor information and quotations, if applicable)",

Introduction\n\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq, is a critical facility serving the healthcare complex and surrounding areas. With a daily wastewater flow rate of 150,000 m³, effective odor control is essential to maintain a healthy and pleasant environment for the community and the plant's operators. This research document aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local regulations, and available technologies.\n\n## 2. Wastewater Characteristics and Odor Sources\n\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant receives a daily flow of 150,000 m³, containing various odor-causing compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), ammonia (NH₃), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and mercaptans. These compounds are generated through the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the wastewater. The main potential odor sources within the plant include:\n\n- Headworks (screens, grit removal)\n- Primary clarifiers\n- Aeration basins\n- Sludge handling and treatment units\n\nThe site-specific wastewater characteristics, such as temperature, pH, and organic loading, can significantly impact odor generation. Higher temperatures and organic loading can increase odor generation, while low pH can promote the formation of hydrogen sulfide. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for designing an effective odor control system.\n\n## 3. Odor Control Regulations and Standards\n\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Environment is responsible for setting and enforcing environmental regulations, including those related to odor emissions from wastewater treatment plants. The National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan for Iraq (2013-2017) highlights the need for developing and implementing odor control regulations.\n\n(Specific odor emission limits or standards for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, if applicable)\n\nIn the absence of specific local standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for odor management in wastewater treatment plants can be used as a reference to establish performance targets for the odor control system.\n\n## 4. Odor Control Technologies\n\nSeveral odor control technologies are available for wastewater treatment plants, each with its advantages, limitations, and design considerations. The most relevant technologies for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant include:\n\n### 4.1 Biofilters\n\nBiofilters use a bed of organic media, such as wood chips or compost, to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. As odorous air passes through the media, the microorganisms break down the odorous compounds, converting them into harmless products. Biofilters are effective for treating a wide range of odorous compounds and have low operating costs. However, they require a relatively large footprint and regular media replacement.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biofilters include:\n- Media type and depth\n- Airflow rate and empty bed residence time (EBRT)\n- Moisture content and pH control\n- Nutrient supply and irrigation system\n\n(Case studies of successful biofilter implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.2 Biotrickling Filters\n\nBiotrickling filters are similar to biofilters but use an inert media, such as plastic or ceramic, instead of organic media. A nutrient solution is continuously trickled over the media to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. Biotrickling filters are effective for treating high-concentration odorous air streams and have a smaller footprint compared to biofilters. However, they require more complex operation and maintenance, including pH control and nutrient dosing.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biotrickling filters include:\n- Media type and surface area\n- Airflow rate and EBRT\n- Nutrient solution composition and flow rate\n- pH control and monitoring\n- Biomass control and removal\n\n(Case studies of successful biotrickling filter implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.3 Chemical Scrubbers\n\nChemical scrubbers use a liquid solution, typically containing chemicals such as sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite, to absorb and remove odorous compounds from the air. They are effective for removing specific compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, but may not be suitable for a wide range of odors. Chemical scrubbers have a relatively small footprint but require careful handling and storage of chemicals, as well as regular maintenance and monitoring.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for chemical scrubbers include:\n- Scrubber type (packed tower, spray tower, or venturi)\n- Chemical selection and concentration\n- Airflow rate and contact time\n- pH control and monitoring\n- Corrosion-resistant materials and equipment\n\n(Case studies of successful chemical scrubber implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.4 Activated Carbon Adsorption\n\nActivated carbon adsorption systems use granular or pelletized activated carbon to remove odorous compounds from the air. The odorous compounds are adsorbed onto the surface of the activated carbon, which has a high surface area and porosity. Activated carbon systems are effective for removing a wide range of odorous compounds but require periodic replacement or regeneration of the carbon media.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for activated carbon adsorption systems include:\n- Carbon type and quality\n- Airflow rate and contact time\n- Relative humidity and temperature\n- Pretreatment for dust and moisture removal\n- Carbon replacement or regeneration frequency\n\n(Case studies of successful activated carbon adsorption system implementation in the MENA region)\n\n### 4.5 Biofiltration with Activated Sludge\n\nBiofiltration with activated sludge involves the use of a portion of the activated sludge from the wastewater treatment process to treat odorous air. The odorous air is bubbled through a tank containing the activated sludge, where odor-degrading microorganisms break down the odorous compounds. This method utilizes the existing resources of the treatment plant but requires careful integration with the activated sludge process and proper aeration.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biofiltration with activated sludge include:\n- Activated sludge characteristics and concentration\n- Airflow rate and bubble size\n- Aeration and mixing requirements\n- Sludge recirculation and wasting\n- Foam control and monitoring\n\n(Case studies of successful biofiltration with activated sludge implementation in the MENA region)\n\n## 5. Comparative Analysis of Odor Control Technologies\n\nTo select the most appropriate odor control technology for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, a comparative analysis of the available options is necessary. The following factors should be considered:\n\n- Odor removal efficiency\n- Capital and operating costs\n- Environmental impact\n- Compatibility with existing treatment processes\n- Ease of operation and maintenance\n- Availability of local materials and expertise\n\n(Table comparing the odor control technologies based on the above factors)\n\n## 6. Challenges and Limitations of Implementing Odor Control Technologies in Baghdad\n\nImplementing odor control technologies in Baghdad may face several challenges and limitations, including:\n\n- Availability of skilled personnel for operation and maintenance\n- Reliability of power supply\n- Impact of dust, high temperatures, and other environmental conditions on the performance of odor control systems\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful planning, training, and adaptation of the selected odor control technology to the local context.\n\n## 7. Recommendations for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\nBased on the comparative analysis and considering the site-specific conditions and challenges, the following recommendations are made for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant:\n\n(Prioritized list of odor control technologies)\n\nThe prioritization and decision-making process should consider:\n- Combining technologies to target different odor sources\n- Criteria for selecting the most appropriate odor control strategy, such as effectiveness, cost, environmental impact, and ease of implementation\n\nA phased implementation plan, considering budget and timeline, should be developed to ensure the gradual and successful integration of the selected odor control technologies with the existing treatment processes. Regular monitoring and performance evaluation should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the implemented odor control system and identify areas for improvement.\n\n## 8.

STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 3 | 64\n1 SCOPE OF THE REPORT\nThe aim of the report is to provide the Client with the actions and activities taken in order to set up and prepare\nthe ground for a correct and successful development of the assessment for the Al-Kanshaa in Baghdad. The\nreport was prepared by STECI s.r.l. under a contract with the Baghdad Majoralty – Baghdad Sewerage Service.\nMain aim of the report is setting up the Design Concept/Parameters for the treatment of wastewater flows from\nboth the present conveyance area limits and the future hypothetical improvements of the areas within the\nplanning horizon for design that it is assumed to be 200,000 m\n3\n/day.\n1.1 BACKGROUD: BRIEF DEFINITION OF THE PROJECT AND THE MISSION\nIn the beginning of the 1980s were prepared designs for the main sewerage line north Eastern (Al-Kanshaa line)\nwhere the line starts from Alhabibiyah station to the treatment project in Rustimya serving also the area passing\nby (Alsahafeen, Alubeidi, Kamaliya, Fudhaylia, alrashad, Alnasr neighborhoods and all the facilities and shops\nlocated in these areas), provided that the assimilation and capacity of Alrustimya shall be increased by creating\na fourth expansion, and due to a lot of overtaking on the track of the above mentioned line most of which were\nmade after the commencement of executing the line and it wasn’t possible to remove those overtaking cases,\nthat is why a proposal was presentend to cancel part of the line which passes through the area of overtaking\nwithin the district of Baghdad Al-Jideedah Municipality and just to be enough with the track of the line within\nthe area of Fudhaylia with setting up lift station and to treat sewage in the area of Fudhaylia because it is close\nto the river Dyala to be a treatment project as an alternative for the forth expansion project proposed to be\nconstructed in Alrustamiya.\nAfter the track of the main sewage line North Eastern has been amended (Al-Kanshaa line) and for the reasons\nstated above, it is required to prepare designs to construct lift station and sewage water treatment.\nThe objective of implementing the project is lift the sewage coming from the above sewage line and to be treated\nand drained to Dyala river. After treatment there will be the possibility of benefiting from treated waters for\nother reasons such irrigation, also, the possibility of using the waste resulting from WWTP to be used as organic\ncompost in the agricultural fields.\nThe nature of the service to be provided within this project is designing a lift station with minimum 200.000\nm\n3\n/day flow rate to supply the binary treatment plant (physical + biological) in project.\nThe major components of the Proposed WWTP, for which an EIA study will be carried out in next Third Phase,\nare:\n• Treatment capacity: 200,000 m\n3\n/day\n• Treatment process: activated sludge treatment with oxidation, nitrification and denitrification\n• Sludge treatment process: thickening, digesting, drying, landfill or reuse\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 4 | 64\n2 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AREA\nThe proposed facility will be located in west bank of Tigris river in Baghdad.\nThe city had a remarkable urban development, but at the same time chaotic also as a consequence of the difficult\nwar conditions, which allowed the phenomenon of illegal building. A phenomenon that, in fact, not taking into\naccount the urban planning tools, has left an important scar on the territory not only from the point of view of\nthe disorganization of the building but also of the insufficiency of the services offered.\nIn the recent remarkable reconstruction and order work that the Iraqi state is carrying out, an important part\nare the hygienic works and the purification service.\nAn important portion of the city's urban waste is absorbed by the Al-Kanshaa platform which currently reaches\nthe Tigris river without purifying actions.\nThe new treatment plant will receive the sewage from the eastern portion of the big city with an important\npopulation density estimated at around 1,000,000 inhabitants. The new Al-Kanshaa plant will, due to its location\nand urban structure, become an integral part of the territory with the necessary attention to urban,\nenvironmental, historical and landscape data. The requirements will accommodate projected wastewater flows\nfrom both the present conveyance area limits and the future hypothetical improvements of the areas within the\nplanning horizon for design that it is assumed to be 200,000 m \n3\n/day.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 5 | 64\nThe objective of implementing the proposed facility is lift the sewage waters coming from sewage line North\nEastern and to be treated and drained to Dyala river after treatment with the possibility of benefiting from\ntreated waters for other reasons such irrigation, also, the possibility of using the waste resulting from treatment\nproject to be used as organic compost in agricultural fields.\nConsidering the serious criticalities of the purification platform, and considering the ambitious goal of\nguaranteeing the quality of the waters of Dyala and Tigris rivers, STECI srl wants to face the design through the\nuse of modern and effective analysis tools and software that take into consideration the parameters\ncharacteristic of the local reality in which the intervention is prefigured.\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) will be carried out in accordance with the Iraqi Environmental\nProtection and Enhancement Law No. 27 for 2009 in next Third Phase.\nOn 9 \nth \nof December, 2021 Baghdad Majoralty send officially reserved land vertices reproduced in the following\ntwo images showing the project area that is available.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 6 | 64\nThe service area for the wastewater collection system is presented in the next figure.

The Diyala River originates near\nSanandaj in the Zagros Mountains in Iran, forming the Iran-Iraq border for over 30 km. With a total length of\n574 km, 17 the river has a drainage area of 33,240 km\n2\n, of which 25% are located in Iran and 75% in Iraq (see\nnext Overview Map). The Diyala joins the Tigris 15 km south of Baghdad (see next Overview Map). Its principal\ntributaries are the Tanjeru, Sirwan and Wand Rivers.\nThe Diyala stream-flow is very similar to that of the Lesser Zab. It is characterized by peak flows in April and a\nlow-flow season from July until November.\nDiyala river, downstream tributary to the south of Baghdad of Tigris river, has a mean daily flow of 182 m \n3\n/s at\nthe confluence with Tigris.\nFrom: UN-ESCWA and BGR (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia;\nBundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe). 2013.

Rapid\ngrowth of population, urbanization, industrialization, and agriculture activities increase its exploitation, reduce\navailability, and enhance vulnerability to contaminate the quality of water.\nAn attempt has been made to assess the overall groundwater quality and identify major variables affecting the\ngroundwater quality in the urban area of Baghdad. Groundwater samples from tube wells were analyzed for the\nmajor physicochemical variables by Alhassan H. Ismail, Muntasir A.H. and Reem J. Channo who published their\nresults in Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical\nTechniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part (A),No.2, 2015.\nThe Authors, from the Hill–Piper trilinear diagram observed that the majority of ground water from sampling\nsites are Ca2+ -Mg2+ -Cl- -SO 42- type and Na2+ -K+ -Cl- -SO 42- type water. Hill (1940) has developed a pattern\ndiagram and later improved by Piper (1944, 1953) to form of trilinear diagram, which is an effective tool in\nsegregating analysis data with respect to sources of the dissolved constituents in groundwater.\nMultivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis and cluster analysis were applied to identify the major\nfactors (variables) corresponding to the different source of variation in groundwater quality of Baghdad. Factor\nanalysis identified three major factors explaining 82.506% of the total variance in water quality; and the major\nvariations are related to degree of mineralization of the geological components of soils, irrigation return flow,\nagricultural activities and mixing of wastewater. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three different groups of\nsimilarities between the sampling sites, reflecting different physicochemical properties and pollution levels in\nthe groundwater quality.\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part\n(A),No.2, 2015.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 10 | 64\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part\n(A),No.2, 2015.\nThree latent factors were identified as responsible for the data structure, explaining 82.506% of total variance\nin the data set. The first factor explained 59.627% of the total variance and mainly related to mineralization and\nirrigation return flow. The second factor explained 11.569% which represents the agricultural activities from\nagricultural areas such as fertilization and mixing of wastewater whereas, the third factor explained 11.309% of\nthe variances and reflects the acidity–alkalinity scale in groundwater.\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part\n(A),No.2, 2015.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 11 | 64\n2.3 CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY\nBaghdad has geographical coordinates 333°N and 44.4°E. Winds reaching the city are generally dry and because\nof the aridity and the relatively cloudless skies, there are large variations in daily temperature as well as between\nseasons and regions.\nClimate and meteorology are studied in order to have environmental parameters as guide for WWTP\ntreatments.\nThe climate of Baghdad is arid, subtropical, and continental. The mean maximum temperature in July and August\nis about 43°C, which could reach up to 49°C in hot seasons. Dust storms are common in summer and the winter\nis chilly. The mean annual rainfall ranges from about 120 mm in the south to about 160 mm in the northeast.\nPrevailing wind direction is Northwestern. And an exceptional flood is expected every 30 years.\nTEMPERATURE\nBilal, Al-Jumaily, A.Habbib, 2013 in their published study examined the trends of the monthly, seasonal and\nannual T\nmin \n, T\nmax\n, and T\nmean \ntime series for Baghdad, for the period 1941–2000. The most important aspects of\ntheir results are the significant increase in T\nmax \nand T \nmean \nduring the spring season and a significant decrease in\nall three temperatures during the autumn season.\nFrom: Dheyaa A.

The behavior of air temperature for Baghdad city during the summer months\ntends to increase despite the fluctuations between the increase and decrease. Such observations are consistent\nwith global trends in temperature.\nAnalyzing temperature data from hydrologic years is possible to calculate maximum, minimum and mean\ntemperature values.\nRAINFALL\nThe present chapter aims to analyze the trend and forecast annual rainfall in Baghdad for the period of 1979-\n2019. Abd Al-Ghani and Mohammed Ali (2020) study Trend of Rain in Iraq show that rainy season tends to\ndecrease in almost stations but Baghdad station tended to rise, as the rate of change in it reached (21.6+, 10.9\n+) mm during the fall and spring seasons respectively.\nData have been acquired a mainly monthly average of rainfall data from the Iraqi Meteorological Organization\nand seismology (IMOS). The long-term data of the monthly average rainfall for the time period 1979-2019 were\ncollected from the Baghdad station. Monthly rainfall for 39 years for Baghdad city is available which covers 24\nyears are continuous data from 1979 to 2002, two years missing (2003-2004) and 15 years to 2019 are\ncontinuous. The daily rainfall behavior varies widely from the extreme values 89 mm in Baghdad to the minimum\n0.2 mm in addition to the persisting of rain for one day and up to more than four days but most of the non-rainy\ndays in the year (Abd, Abdulkareem, 2020). The behavior of annual rainfall in Baghdad varies greatly as shown\nin next figure.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 16 | 64\nAnnual rainfall series for Baghdad city (1979-2019)\nFrom: Khtan, Al-Atabi - Analyzing and prediction of rainfall trends over Baghdad city\nAnalyzing precipitation data from hydrologic years is possible to calculate maximum, minimum and mean annual\nprecipitation values:\n• Maximum: 296.7 mm\n• Minimum: 57.6 mm\n• Mean: 125.3 mm\nMonthly, seasonal, and annual data of precipitation for the study period were used to calculate percentile-based\nindices. Precipitation data were represented by the 25th percentile to describe extreme dry conditions and the\n90th for extreme wet conditions. Results show that precipitation amounts between 10 and 20 mm had the\ngreatest frequency; daily precipitation amounts between 90 and 100 mm occurred only once at Baghdad station\n(Naqi, Al-Jiboori, Al-Madhhachi, 2021). The 90th percentile was 17 mm while the total accumulated precipitation\nduring the period was 2380.2 mm.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 17 | 64\n2.4 LAND USE / LAND COVER\nCharacterization of land use/ land cover over large areas is an essential task in any environmental design because\nit provides a baseline for designers to seek sustainable livelihoods in harmony with ecosystems.\nDeriving land cover information from satellite data is one of the most common applications employed to\nmonitor, evaluate, and manage the environment.\nIn the next figure is presented the result of a study, that classified Landsat-8 satellite images with spatial\nresolution of 30m, obtained from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) according the Maximum Likelihood Classifier\nmethod that is considered among the most established algorithms for land cover change detection studies.\nApplying classification method the land cover was classified into four classes, namely:\n• vegetation\n• water\n• urban area\n• barren soil\nFor the year 2020, the percentages were as follows: Urban area represents 42.8%, vegetation represents 36.2%,\nwater represents 3%, and barren soil represents 18%.\n-Classification of land cover /land use for Baghdad city at 2020\nFrom: L.K.

The land is considered highly flat with no clear natural drainage pattern. Baghdad\nhas a Calcaric Fluvisols soil type with about 20% of lime. Most soils of Baghdad area are therefore secondary\nsoils (residual soils) derived from the above regions, transported from place of weathering and accumulated as\na result of sedimentation. Besides, Baghdad soil strata are affected by river course changes during previous\ndecades leading to coarse silt deposits and giving different depositional stratigraphy each few meters, thus\nBaghdad strata are erratic, somewhat are nonhomogeneous with a water table near ground. This soil in generally\nis alkaline with poor permeability (NCCL, 1986; Karim and Schanz, 2006). Organic matter content is low and the\ncarbon nitrogen ration is narrow.\nThe main stratigraphic units of Baghdad soil are: landfill layer consists of cohesive and non-cohesive materials;\nthe upper natural sub-soil strata consists mainly clay or brown silty clay or clayey silt sometimes with sand or a\nlittle amount of gravel; while the lower layer is the natural soil strata consists of medium dense to very dense\nbrown to grey sand mixed with gravel or lenses of clay or silty clay (NCCL, 1986; Karim and Schanz, 2006). The\ndepositional conditions of Baghdad area during geological times, such as and human activities, affect the nature\nof Baghdad soil and its groundwater quality.

The strength of wastewater is normally expressed in terms of\npollution load, which is determined from the concentrations of significant physical, chemical and biological\ncontents of the wastewater.\nThe characteristics or the quality of wastewater is expressed in terms of its physical, chemical and biological\ncharacteristics on the basis of the parameters given in the proper chapter.\nOne of the most important physical characteristics of wastewater is its content of solids, which consists of\nfloating matter, sediment, suspended material and soluble matter. Other physical properties are temperature,\ncolour and degree of turbidity. In addition, for chemical characteristics, it includes organic materials and\ninorganic substances.\nOrganic substances consist of a mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen, as well as other\nimportant elements such as sulphur, phosphorus and iron. Regarding to organic substances, many inorganic\nindicators of wastewater are important for the development and control of wastewater quality standards.\nConcentrations of inorganic compounds are increased due to the natural evaporation process, which disposes\nof some of the water, leaving the inorganic materials in the wastewater\nSewage is generated from multiple sources. It is a mixture of toilet water, washing water, ice, bathing, washing\nclothes, and all cleaning work at home, institutions, streets and rainwater. It consists of more than 95 percent\nwater, only 5% of pollutants of different types, nature and quantity. This diversity in the sources it generates\nleads to the multiplicity of types of contaminants it contains.\nWastewater treatment is designed to improve water quality to meet the specific safety and safety requirements\nof the wastewater after treatment. Different treatment processes reduce the concentration of pollutants in\nwater.\nThe wastewater treatment plant will be designed adopting the characteristics of effluent of wastewater given\nby Iraqi National Standards for Discharge of Treated Municipal Wastewater to surface water courses. Based on\nthese guidelines, the treatment processes must reduce BOD5, ammonia and total nitrogen accordingly.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 21 | 64\n3.1 DESIGN FLOWS\nFollowing wastewater design flows will be used to design the WWTP facilities:\n• Average daily flow is applied to estimate the operation and maintenance (O/M) costs and pollution\nloads reduction at the WWTP\n• Maximum daily flow is applied to the design of the treatment facilities at the WWTP\n• Maximum hourly flow is applied to the design of pumping stations and preliminary treatment facilities\nat the WWTP\n3.2 WASTEWATER AND SLUDGE TREATMENT PROCESSES\nThe major components of the WWTP are:\n• Treatment capacity: 200,000 m\n3\n/day\n• Treatment process: activated sludge treatment with oxidation, nitrification and denitrification\n• Sludge treatment process: thickening, digesting, drying, landfill or reuse\nThe WWTP disposal scheme is composed by 25 main functional block units:\n1) Coarse screening, main lift station and fine screening\n2) Grit and grease removal unit\n3) Primary settling tank\n4) Anaerobic treatment unit\n5) Oxidation unit: carrousel\n6) Final settling tank\n7) Disinfection tank and storage and dosing unit\n8) Flocculant storage\n9) Sludge pumping station\n10) Sludge thickening unit\n11) Sludge handling and heating building\n12) Primary digestor\n13) Secondary digestor\n14) Gasometer\n15) Biogas torch\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 22 | 64\n16) Air production building\n17) Electrical transformer room and generating set\n18) Sludge dewatering room\n19) Administration, workshop and laboratory building\n20) Biofilter for air deodorization\n21) Reception room\n22) Outlet system\n23) Emergency electrical power\n24) Fire network service group\n25) Control tower\nOnce defined the wastewater treatment plant scheme of process given the officially reserved land by BM we\norganized within the authorized area the functional block units.\nProposed scheme uses the entire surface amount of available authorized area.\nNevertheless, general conditions of the future work area create hard difficulties due to:\n• the presence of the power station, that will have to be relocate;\n• the HT electric line with its pylons, that will have to be relocate.\nThe WWTP disposal scheme is composed by 25 main functional block unit facilities to be constructed. Final\nsolution scheme doesn’t use the portion of the area beyond the embankment in an area with lower altitude\ncompared the surroundings areas; In that area there will be only the outlet system.\nThe plant layout would facilitate all the operations. In particular, some concerns may be related to the following\nelements:\n• Sludge Treatment Line: the position of the sludge treatment line comprised of sludge pumping station,\nsludge thickening units, sludge handling and heating building and sludge dewatering room it is placed next\nto the WWTP’s entrance. This scheme is an optimization because the initial pumping, the screening units\nand the sand and grease removal units have been placed at the WWTP’s entrance as well. By doing so, the\nwithdrawal of wastes such as sludge, sands, oils, grease would be easier. As consequence, also the hydraulic\nconnections would be shorter, resulting in a reduction of costs of installation and O&M.\n• Final sedimentation and Primary sludge pumping: as the final layout described above, the final\nsedimentation and the primary sludge pumping are relocated in the lower part of the WWTP area, in an\neffort of minimizing tank’s dimensions. Furthermore, internal road’s width should not exceed 4 meters.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 23 | 64\n• Denitrification – Oxidation (Carrousel system): with the shifting of the final sedimentation units, the\nbiological tanks will be placed in a parallel manner, and, if possible, place them in one row only. Roads\nbetween these tanks should be not smaller than 4 meters.\n• Buildings: as a result of the aforementioned displacements buildings are located near the WWTP entrance.\n• Disinfection: the disinfection unit will be placed out of the river levee, leaving just the outlet system on the\nriverbank.\nThe following figure represents the treatment process scheme adopted for the new WWTP:\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 24 | 64\nQUALITY STANDARDS TO BE OBTAINED WITH TREATMENT\nThe plant must reach the following three results:\nA. the treated wastewater produced by the plant must comply with the following discharge limits, given\nby the Iraq Regulations\nB. the produced sludge of the WWTP must be stabilized to the point of not producing bad odors and they\nmust be adequately dehydrated to facilitate transportation to the disposal landfill\nC. the treated effluent must be usable for irrigation\n3.3 DESIGN CRITERIA: WASTEWATER TREATMENT PROCESS TECNOLOGY\nThe treatment technology must be chosen among those most suitable for large installations with similar\ncharacteristics considering also the limits of acceptability to be met:\n• to achieve the compliance with the limit on BOD and with the limit on Total Nitrogen (nitrification and\ndenitrification) the treatment cycle should include a biological type process;\n• to achieve the limit on phosphorous, as the predicted phosphorus content in the sewage to be treated\nis quite high, the biological treatment alone could not be enough to achieve that minimum value and\nthe phosphorus reduction capacity shall be enhanced also through a chemical treatment;\n• to respect the limit on suspended solids, a final clarifier adequately sized will be sufficient, making a final\na filtration stage not necessary.\nBIOLOGICAL TREATMENT\nThe large availability of land for the new plant makes it unnecessary the use of innovative technologies\n(Membrane Biological Reactors MBR, Moving Bed Biological Reactor MBBR, Cycle Activated Sludge Technology\nCAST and similar) which are much more expensive than the conventional systems (not only in terms of\nconstruction costs but especially in terms of operation costs) and are useful only in scenarios where the lack of\navailable areas requires the use of compact technologies.\nUltimately, the wastewater treatment technologies treatment process to be chosen must include an activated\nsludge treatment with oxidation, nitrification and denitrification, preceded or not by a primary sedimentation\nand followed by a final clarification section.\nThe technology to be applied the oxidation phase of the biological treatment could be:\n• surface-aerated basin system;\n• air diffuser system with a carpet of diffusers;\n• carrousel system.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 25 | 64\nThe first system in respect to the other two is less expensive when it comes to construction, but it has a high\noperating cost. It consumes at least 50% more electrical energy; furthermore, the surface-aerated basin has\nproblems of aerosol whose mitigation can result very difficult.\nThe other two systems are quite comparable in terms of construction and operation costs while in terms of\nprocess efficiency the Carrousel system is more akin to the need of implementing a denitrification process.\nPHOSPHOROUS REMOVAL\nThe treated effluent characteristics require compliance with a maximum Regulation limit for phosphorus while\nin the case that influent wastewater presents a phosphorus level higher than the limit; since biological treatment\n(bacterial synthesis in the oxidation and \"luxury uptake rate\" in the anoxic stages) shall reach a fixed maximum\nP removal, maybe it will be needed to add flocculation agents for chemical-physical removal of residual\nphosphorus; the implementation of this chemical-physical reduction will be achieved dosing poly aluminium\nchloride to obtain a co-precipitation of phosphorous, together activated sludge, in final sedimentation.\nFINAL SEDIMENTATION\nTo respect the limit on suspended solids, the final sedimentation will be dimensioned with a diameter large\nenough to obtain a load flow on the surface on average less than 0.50 m/h and, at the peak flow rate, not greater\nthan 0.90 m/h.\nSLUDGE TREATMENT PROCESS TECHNOLOGY\nThe process of sewage treatment produces a sludge consisting of the suspended solids not biodegradables, of\nthe excess activated sludge and of the chemical precipitation of phosphorous.\nIn this mixture, only the excess activated sludge contains a percentage of organic fraction that is relatively limited\nbut that, however, is such as to make putrescible the sludge; fact, even if the nitrification process makes it\nnecessary to the achievement of an age of sludge rather high, to make the sludge not putrescible is necessary\nto bring it to an age of at least 20 - 22 days.\nThe reasons for which it is preferred to limit the volumes of the compartments of biological treatment to those\nnecessary for the oxidation and nitrification and establishing Aerobic stabilization facility instead of extending\nup to the point of obtaining directly a surplus sludge stabilized are the following.\nThe volumes of the phases of biological treatment are calculated by applying the algorithms described in Metcalf\nand Eddy and the detention times are calculated only for the purpose of verifying that they are compatible with\nthe guide values generally described in the literature.The reference parameter for these algorithms is the sludge\nload (or Cf) which is defined by the ratio between the quantity of BOD treated daily and the quantity of activated\nsludge content in overall biological reactors and is assimilable to the inverse of parameter called sludge age. The\nalgorithms applied allow to determine, depending on the quantity of activated sludge content in overall\nbiological reactors – which is given by the result of the multiplication (reactor volume) x (concentration of\nactivated sludge in the reactors themselves) – the values of the effluent BOD, the effluent ammonia nitrogen\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 26 | 64\nand nitric nitrogen nitrified down. Finally, speaking of the opportunity to enter a phase of Aerobic Stabilization,\nthe choice that will be adopted depends on the consideration that, while to obtain good results from the process\nof oxidation and nitrification is sufficient that the value Cf is between 0.1 and 0.15, to obtain a well stabilized\nexcess sludge (ie such as to be non-putrescible) it is necessary that the Cf present a value not greater than 0.05\nwhich roughly corresponds to a sludge age of 20 days. Therefore, recalling that:\n• the total amount of activated sludge contained in the biological reactor is given by the result of\nthe multiplication (reactor volume) x (concentration of activated sludge in the reactors themselves),\n• the concentration of activated sludge in the tanks of oxidation and nitrification should not be\nmuch higher than 4.5 kg/m\n3 \nto avoid that the final sedimentation functions badly,\n• the concentration of activated sludge in the tanks of Aerobic Stabilization can be easily\nmaintained on the value of 40 kg/m\n3\n.\nwe can see that:\n• to obtain the stabilization of excess sludge directly into the tanks of oxidation and nitrification, it would\nbe necessary to have a volume of tanks equal to 1 / (4,5 x0,05) = 4.44 m \n3 \nper kg of BOD from breaking\ndown,\n• to obtain separately in a tank an effective phase oxidation and nitrification, and in a second tank the\nphase of aerobic stabilization, we have that for the first tank is sufficient to have a volume equal to 1 /\n(4,5 x0,125) = 1,78 m \n3 \nper kg of BOD to break down, and that, to achieve stabilization of the excess\nsludge, just that the second tank determines a detention time of the sludge in excess sufficient to\ncomplete the process and that is, that has a volume equal to 1 / (40x0, 05) = 0.5 m\n3 \nper kg of BOD\n• ultimately, the total volume of the two separate phases is 1.78 + 0.5 = 2.28 m \n3 \nper kg of BOD to break\ndown with a reduction of (4.44-2.28) / 4.44 = 48% compared to the solution to obtain the stabilization\nof the sludge together with the oxidation and nitrification.\nAll these criteria will be applied in the calculation of Carrousel units.\nTherefore, the chain of treatment of the sludge will be based on a phase of aerobic stabilization of sludge whose\ndimensions will be optimized by using a preliminary step of thickening. Finally, the stabilized sludge is subjected\nto a dehydration treatment in order to make it quite poor in water as to be easily transported to landfill.\nODOUR EMISSION CONTROL\nThe treatment stages from which odours can be generated are: the initial pumping station, the screening, the\nsand removal, the thickener and the areas of the plant in which sludge handling allows its contact with the\natmosphere. To avoid that the issues related to the generation of bad odours, the design will be optimized so as\nto avoid or, at least, minimize the places from which odours can be produced.\nHowever, considering that the generation of bad odours occurs when an intense agitation (air insufflation,\ndischarge from an overflow threshold, etc.) determines the stripping of odoriferous substances dissolved in the\nwater, in each places from which odours can be generated the design will provide for aspiration systems which\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 27 | 64\nwill convey the gases and aerosols produced by the wastewater to filtering facilities which will to break down\nodoriferous substances contained therein.\nDESIGN CRITERIA: HYDRAULIC ASPECTS\nHydraulic aspects (the ones associated with the water flow through the various treatment stages) are as\nimportant as the treatment process, especially if, as in this case, the installation must be developed on several\nlines operating in parallel.\nIn fact, a correct hydraulic sizing contributes significantly both to the economic viability of the plant operation\nand to its optimal functioning, because it best limits head losses (resulting in lower consumption of electricity\nfor pumping) and guarantees a proper distribution of the wastewater to the parallel treatment lines. The\nwastewater distribution, if properly implemented, makes every treatment line to function in the same way,\nleading to an optimization of the operation and to a reduction of the efforts to be made by the management\nstaff which shall not be forced to follow, adjust and regulate each treatment line as if it were a separate plant.\nThe development of the detailed design shall allow to define plant improvements capable of optimizing its\nhydraulic behaviour.\nDISTRIBUTION OF FLOW TO BE TREATED\nThe optimization of the wastewater distribution into equal parts will be obtained by:\n• introducing, at the beginning of the chain of treatment, a system of correct subdivision of the flow\nconsists of a sump equipped with two triangular weirs which will also act as flow meter treated\n• building each sand and grease removal unit always aerated type but as a circular basin instead of the\nmore common linear type unit: this solution is preferable as it makes it possible to reach a perfect\ndistribution of the loads simply by dividing into two equal parts the discharge canal which, being circular,\noffers the most suitable symmetry conditions to obtain a perfect splitting of the effluent wastewater\ninto each of the lines of biological treatment.\nOPERATING COST REDUCTION FROM CORRECT DISTRIBUTION OF FLOW\nThe wastewater distribution system described above, besides ensuring a perfectly equal distribution on each\ntreatment line, minimizes the plant’s head losses on each of the distribution devices because the overflow\nsystems which determine the distribution coincide with those that regulate the outflow from the treatment\nstages: as already mentioned above, this reduces the total head of the lifting pumps and, consequently, allows\na considerable reduction of electricity consumption.\nConsidering also that the process requires a dosage of flocculant to achieve the required P removal, the adopted\nwastewater distribution system allows to add the flocculants in a single location (the sump divider). This will\nguarantee an optimal mixing of the chemicals in the whole wastewater to be treated and will make it\nunnecessary to dose the P removal chemicals on several lines: this setting will determine a better efficiency of\nthe flocculation agents and consequently a reduction in the chemical expenses.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 28 | 64\nFinally, the plant configuration minimizes the needs in terms of operating staff, because the optimal wastewater\ndistribution achieved by the adoption of such a configuration will guarantee that all the lines will operate in a\nsimilar way: the operation staff can count on the fact that the controls done on one of the treatment lines, will\ncover almost completely also the similar controls to be done on the other lines; therefore, the operation staff\ncan focus on the management of one line per day instead of having to work every day on all lines.\n3.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL SCHEME\nWWTP phases will be composed as in following paragraphs.\nDESCRIPTION OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\nThe WWTP disposal scheme is composed by 25 main functional block units facilities to be constructed:\n26) Coarse screening, main lift station and fine screening\n27) Grit and grease removal unit\n28) Primary settling tank\n29) Anaerobic treatment unit\n30) Oxidation unit: carrousel\n31) Final settling tank\n32) Disinfection tank and storage and dosing unit\n33) Flocculant storage\n34) Sludge pumping station\n35) Sludge thickening unit\n36) Sludge handling and heating building\n37) Primary digestor\n38) Secondary digestor\n39) Gasometer\n40) Biogas torch\n41) Air production building\n42) Electrical transformer room and generating set\n43) Sludge dewatering room\n44) Administration, workshop and laboratory building\n45) Biofilter for air deodorization\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 29 | 64\n46) Reception room\n47) Outlet system\n48) Emergency electrical power\n49) Fire network service group\n50) Control tower\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 30 | 64\nCOARSE SCREEN, BY-PASS, MAIN LIFTING AND SCREENING STATION\nThe coarse screen will be designed with bars having a spacing of 50 mm and equipped with a mechanical system\nfor the extraction of the retained material. The coarse screen is located at sewage receipt just before the by-\npass so as to protect pumps and to assure that by-pass flow rates do not contain coarse material.\nBy-pass is located downstream of the coarse screen. The by-pass shall be used as an emergency relief device in\ncase of a serious failure of the main lift, and as an overflow for the excess flow rate according to WWTP\ndimensioning values.\nThe sewage is first pumped up to preliminary treatment by a main lift station; main lift station is designed on\nthe basis of the peak flow that shall possibly be treated.\nDownstream of the lifting station, which is structurally bonded to the same, is provided for the section of\nautomatic fine screen of the sewage.\nThe section will be made up with channels in which automatic fine screens will be sited having a spacing of\nfiltration equal to 10 mm, with nominal maximum flow rate for each grid equal to a third of maximum flow to\ntreat, each screen will be equipped with manual shut-off gates located before and after the grid so that it obtains\nthe interception of each individual channel and to allow the necessary operations for extraordinary maintenance\nof the screens.\nIn functional terms the section of screening will be completed by the collection, removal and compaction system\nof the screened material, consisting of a horizontal screw and a compactor, which will supply a bin in which it\nwill be collected the screened material.\nTowards the containment of malodorous emissions will be provided the following precautions and safeguards:\n• the way about how supplying of wastewater to the channels of screening have been designed to\nminimize stripping of the aeriform substances present in the sewage, the terminals of the pressure pipes\nmade to \"T\" with controlled vents shaping of the bottom of the feeding channels;\n• all the openings of the building will be equipped with covers for containing the malodorous emissions\npreventing its dispersion to the outside;\n• the screened and compacted material will be contained in appropriate containers in plastic material\n(continuous bagging);\n• the interior of screening building will be placed under suction through dedicated fan, dimensioned to\nensure at least 10 hours parts of air, the discharge of the fan through suitably dimensioned ducts will be\nconnected to the deodorization system.\nSUMP DIVIDER\nThe effluent from the screening system will be put in a sump divider equipped with triangular weirs.\nThe scale of flow defined by the two triangular weirs will serve both to divide the flow into two equal parts, both\nto measure the flow treated.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 31 | 64\nThe sump divider shall also receive flocculant for phosphorus removal, which will react in biological treatment\nand take place as co-precipitation in final sedimentation. To sure efficient and homogeneous distribution, the\nflocculant will be sited upstream of grit removal, inside the pit outlets from the screening section.\nSAND AND GREASE REMOVAL UNIT\nThe streams produced by the sump divider will be fed into the tanks for the grit removal and de-oiling to separate\nwaste water from any sand and similar (heavy) particles, so as to avoid any deposit in conduits and pipes,\nabrasion of pumps and electro-mechanical appliances and troubles to further treatment steps. Fats contained\nin incoming sewage must also be removed because they interfere with aerobic and biologic treatment; these\nsubstances have a lower density with respect to water and are separated by flotation.\nSand and grease removal will be obtained with a circular sand and grease removal unit instead of the more\ncommon linear type unit.\nWe have adopted grit chambers circular (radial flow) as this technology has several advantages compared to the\nlongitudinal technology: surface being equal, circular technology has higher efficiency; can be served by cranes\nwith circular motion that require easiest and economical maintenance in front to cranes with forward – back\nmovement; threshold overflow placed on the circumference determines load losses minors and allows a perfect\nhydraulic distribution to the successive stages of treatment.\nAir flow requested will be the necessary value to transfer energy equivalent to 15 W/m\n3\n.\nThe process air, trough a distribution system of big bubbles will be delivered from the compressor building sited\nin common with the biological treatment.\nThe air blown carries for flotation fats and oils on the surface of the tank and the water flow drags them towards\nthe periphery.\nAt the periphery of the tank is disposed a scum box for collected oils and grease alimented from the drilling\nblade of sand removal bridge.\nThe scum box will lead into a tube connected with a collecting sump in which is positioned a pump.\nIn this well the water and oils collected from the small channel are layered in the well (under water and oils\nabove).\nAt the end of the discharge pipe of the pump is positioned a switch through which the fluid can be routed to the\ninternal sewer (and brought back to treatment) or directed to the container that must be provided by those who\nwill carry out the disposal of waste oils.\nIn this way, the water collected from the scum box will return to the treatment and the oils may be sent to the\nwaste disposal system.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY -

Pag. 33 | 64\nOxidation areas shall be equipped with fine bubble systems, moreover before entering this area to support\nsewage circulation in the tank four submersible agitators (two on each side) are installed to avoid areas with no\nhandling and subsequent generation of putrefaction sludge in the long run.\nWhen sewage reaches the elongated areas it can take up oxygen and nitrify; then, once beyond the air injection\nportion and after a period of oxygen shortage, anoxic/anaerobic conditions typical of denitrification will occur.\nWhen sewage reaches once again the air injection portion aerobic conditions will occur and so on.\nThe volumes of the phases of biological treatment are calculated by applying the algorithms described in Metcalf\nand Eddy and the detention times are calculated only for the purpose of verifying that they are compatible with\nthe guide values generally described in the literature.\nThe algorithms used are part of the know-how that, in the during years experience, Steci srl has developed and\nperfected by assembling both the information from the various sources of literature and the results of scientific\nresearch, both the direct experiences that technicians Steci srl have developed checking the functioning of\nnumerous WWTP made according to the plans drawn up by Steci srl.\nThe reference parameter for these algorithms is the sludge load (or Cf) which is defined by the ratio between\nthe quantity of BOD treated daily and the quantity of activated sludge content in overall biological reactors and\nis similar to the inverse of parameter called \"sludge age \".\nThe algorithms allow to determine, depending on the quantity of activated sludge content in overall biological\nreactors – which is given by the result of the multiplication (reactor volume) x (concentration of activated sludge\nin the reactors themselves) – the values of the effluent BOD, the effluent ammonia nitrogen and nitric nitrogen\nnitrified down.\nThe output way of the sewage from the basins will be optimized in order to allow a homogeneous distribution\nof the flow even in conditions of maintenance of the subsequent final sedimentation tanks, and for this purpose\nthe pits effluents of tanks will be equipped with the necessary gates of interception.\nThe quantity of air for the oxidation process will be provided by special blowers, installed in a separate building;\nthe same will also provide the necessary air for grit removal.\nIt will be installed a total of 5 blowers (four of which are in continuous operation and one at stand-by), each able\nto provide 10,000 Nm ³ / h of air.\nAs air flow must be adapted to the oxygen required, blowers will be regulated by inverters in relation to the\nmeasure of dissolved oxygen in oxidation tank.\nThe building of housing of the blowers will be equipped with a fan for the exchange of air in the room and from\nthe filtration and soundproofing device.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 34 | 64\nFINAL SEDIMENTATION\nEach oxidation line will feed one final sedimentation tank.\nEach final sedimentation basin has a diameter large enough to obtain a load flow on the surface on average less\nthan 0.50 m/h and, at the peak flow rate, not greater than 0.90 m/h.\nEach final sedimentation basin is equipped with a peripheral traction double scraper bridge with scraper blade\nto remove sludge deposits on the bottom of the tank and a blade for removing any floating material from\nwastewater table at this stage. Sludge deposits on the bottom of the tank and floating material are conveyed to\nthe storage tank of return and surplus activated sludge.\nFinal sedimentation effluent is conveyed through pipes (one per tank) to the recharge well of following\ndisinfection stage.\nDISINFECTION\nBefore its final discharge effluent is submitted to final disinfection treatment with chlorine.\nEach tank receives the chlorine that comes into contact with the final effluent. The tank is equipped with\npartition walls so that the mixture must follow a winding path and is submitted to continuous mixing, with the\naim of improving the process and the performance of bactericidal ability of the disinfectant.\nTo ensure good mixing input of the disinfection will be realized a first inlet compartment in which wastewater\nand chlorine are well mixed through the use of a submersible mixer.\nThe values of contact time that the specialistic literature indicates in 20 - 25 minutes on the peak flow and in 30\n- 35 minutes on the average flow, are determined as a function of the fact that the activities performed by the\nchlorine disinfection takes place in a few minutes but only after the chlorine dosed into the water was\ncompletely mixed.\nWhen the mixing is obtained simply by effect of the motion to chi-canes (as occurs in contact tanks commonly\nused) it must be considered that the mixing can take place completely in at least 10 - 15 minutes.\nTherefore, considering leaving for disinfecting a real reaction time (all to the advantage of safety) is indicated in\nanother 15 - 20 minutes, you get to values of contact time total (just) at 30 - 35 minutes.\nInstead, the solution adopted by us is an improvement over the contact tanks commonly used because we have\ninserted into the first part of the contact tank a submerged agitator that ensures that the intense and complete\nmixing of the chlorine with the water to be disinfected can happen in a few seconds and, consequently, makes\nsure that the whole volume of the tank of contact remains completely available for disinfection.\nAccording to what described above, it can be stated that, thanks to the plant solution adopted by us, the reaction\ntime useful to ensure disinfection is significantly higher than that indicated by the bibliography as it is equal to\nmore than 15 minutes on the peak flow and more than 25 minutes on average flow.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 35 | 64\nDisinfection will be carried out in two basins, each equipped with its own system of storage and dosing of\nchlorine.\nA by-pass system is provided in these two portions so that in case of maintenance of each one it is possible to\nuse the volume of the other one. In this way the contact time is shorter but the mixing of the disinfectant with\nthe final effluent is guaranteed.\nThe last channel of the disinfection will be equipped with a submersible aerator capable of blow a quantity of\noxygen sufficient to obtain a final aeration of the flow before placing them in the final receptor, in addition to\nthe effect of aeration, the use of this arrangement, will also allow to obtain the effect of the stripping part of\nthe residual chlorine produced by the disinfection process.\nThe effluent of the disinfection tank will be sent to finale receptor by lifting station with proper pumps (3 on\nwork and 1 on stand-by).\nPHOSPHOROUS REDUCTION\nThe two phases of the biological treatment are designed to minimize phosphorus quantity, but since the\npredicted phosphorus content in the sewage to be treated maybe will be high than 4 mg/l, the biological\ntreatment alone could not be enough to achieve the minimum value (only 2 mg/l) of the limits of acceptability\nimposed.\nAs a matter of fact phosphorus quantity reduced by the biological treatment is less than 2 mg/l, so the biological\ntreatment alone could comply with the limit of acceptability imposed only if phosphorus content in the incoming\nsewage is less than 4 mg/l.\nInsofar since phosphorus content in the incoming sewage could be significantly higher than 4 mg/l, the\nphosphorus reduction capacity shall be enhanced also through a chemical treatment.\nFor this purpose the treatment plant shall be equipped with a storage and dosing system of poly aluminium\nchloride: this flocculant shall be dosed in the sump divider where it shall be mixed as in the following phases\nreaction with phosphorus generates floccules which will settle in the final sedimentation.\nThe dose of poly aluminium chloride depends upon the actual phosphorus content in the sewage to be treated.\nThe values of the concentration of phosphorus in the sewage will be obtained from investigations that will be\nconducted.\nRETURN AND SURPLUS ACTIVATED SLUDGE PUMPING\nEach pumping wells of return and surplus activated sludge receive settled sludge from final sedimentation tanks\nto which they are connected; three submersible centrifugal pumps (one stand-by pump) for return activated\nsludge shall be installed in each of units, together with two submersible centrifugal pumps (each one is a stand-\nby pump for the other) for surplus activated sludge.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 36 | 64\nThe return activated sludge pumps shall convey sludge to anaerobic sections before the Carousel tanks, whereas\nsurplus activated sludge pumps shall convey sludge in the thickener.\nAdjusting the flow rate of sludge extracted from the final clarifiers will be adjusted by installing adjustable\nthreshold placed on the wells receiving the sludge, directly connected to the bottom of the final clarifiers.\nTHICKENING TANK\nSludge thickening process is aimed at reducing the quantity of water inside of it so that the sludge will be more\ncompact; this will be certainly useful in the following aerobic stabilization step.\nThe thickening treatment will be obtained in tanks feeded by lift pumps of surplus activated sludge.\nEach thickener will be equipped with by-pass system capable of ensuring the extraction of the surplus activated\nsludge even in conditions of maintenance of the same thickener.\nA central traction scraper bridge is installed in this tank to ensure a continuous sludge handling inside the tank\nand to avoid any excessive thickening and the proliferation of smelly substances.\nMoreover, to avoid any unpleasant odours dispersion in the environment an exhausted air capture system is\nprovided through PRFV covering panels for the tank and air extraction through an aspirator.\nSludge coming from thickening tank is conveyed to aerobic stabilization through pumps installed near the\nthickener and the resulting water is conveyed to internal sewer and then to first pumping section.\nAEROBIC STABILIZATION\nThe sludge produced by the treatment of sewage, coming from a treatment with activated sludge whose age is\nsufficient to ensure the nitrification but is not sufficient to ensure its non putrescibility, must be further treated\nin a phase of aerobic stabilization.\nThe volume of the tank is dimensioned so as to make available for treatment of sludge coming from the thickener\na detention time such that, summing it at the age of sludge reached in the biological treatment, the total age\nwill reach a value greater than 20 days.\nThe aerobic stabilization will be realized in rectangular tanks and the oxygen required for the metabolization of\nsludge will be produced with four submersible aerators for each tank.\nThe submersible aerators provided are self-supporting and so they will simply be resting on the bottom of the\ntank and will remain stable simply by its own weight.\nTherefore, if it will be necessary to extract them for the need of maintenance, will be sufficient to use a car -\ncrane with which to take a ring placed on top of a arm (fixed to aerator and dedicated for this purpose) and\nsimply extract the aerator from the tank.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 37 | 64\nSLUDGE MECHANICAL DEWATERING\nThe mechanical drying technologies available today (filter-presses, belt-presses and centrifuges) are all very\nsimilar in terms of final water content in the dehydrated sludge (28 – 32% of dry weight) when sludge is produced\nfrom a biological treatment, but the exploitation of dehydration stages through centrifugal technology is\nnormally easier and less expensive and, in addition, the use of centrifuges enables a better control over bad\nsmell that may be produced by the sludge.\nIn effect, both (sludge and water separated from sludge) are handled in a closed circuit only using centrifuges\nwhile, using filter-presses or belt-presses, they give origin to sprinkling and aerosol who can produce bad smell.\nMoreover, to manage filter-presses or belt-presses it is necessary to employ more personnel (almost 1 man for\neach unit) than for centrifuges for which 1 man can manage just to 4 – 5 units.\nFor the above indicated reasons, we have chosen centrifuges.\nThe centrifuges are designed to work on 8 hours/d of 5 d/week.\nEach centrifuge will be feed by two volumetric pumps, one as stand-by, each one with a flow variable from 25\nto 40 m \n3\n/h.\nIn support of the centrifuges will be installed two preparation and dosing of polyelectrolyte stations completing\nwith related pumps.\nThe proper function of dewatering centrifuges is ensured by a dosage of 15 g of dry polyelectrolyte at 100% per\nkg of dry sludge produced.\nAccording to the flow of sludge to be treated and the desired concentrations of dry, it is envisaged the use of\npolyelectrolyte concentrate in liquid form. The transfer of the concentrated reagent from the tanks to the group\npreparation and dosing will be through special pumps.\nThe dewatered sludge will be collected and sent to storage bins by means of a system designed for a capacity of\n10 t/h of sludge, comprising: a horizontal screw, which feeds a subsequent inclined screw conveyor, which feeds\na traversing screw allocated to the final discharge of the sludge in the container.\nTowards the containment of odorous emissions the entire building will be located under the intake air system\nthrough pipes with inlet suction points, connected to the dedicated fan sized to provide air exchange of at least\n7 times per hour: the discharge of fan trough appropriately sized pipes will be connected to the deodorization.\nODOUR EMISSION CONTROL\nThe treatment stages from which odours can be generated are: the initial pumping station, the screening, the\nsand removal, the thickener and the areas of the plant in which sludge handling allows its contact with the\natmosphere.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 38 | 64\nTo avoid that the issues related to the generation of bad odours, the design was optimised so as to avoid or, at\nleast, minimize the places from which odours can be produced: to that effect, the configuration which was\nchosen with the aim of optimizing the division into equal parts of the influent wastewater turned out to be\nextremely suitable also in terms of minimization of odours generation.\nHowever, considering that the generation of bad odours occurs when an intense agitation (air insufflation,\ndischarge from an overflow threshold, etc.) determines the stripping of odoriferous substances dissolved in the\nwater, in each places from which odours can be generated the design provides for aspiration systems which will\nconvey the gases and aerosols produced by the wastewater to filtering facilities which will to break down\nodoriferous substances contained therein; the bio filtration technology is adopted for this project.\nThe deodorization system will consist of two independent sections, such as to able the operation, even if partial,\nof the system even in conditions of maintenance of one of the sections.\nIn order to ensure the maximum efficiency in reducing emissions of bad odorous, the entire biolfilter will be\nequipped with cover and put under suction by a fan of dilution, dedicated to the release into the atmosphere of\nthe treated air, and dimensioned for an air flow rate equal to about 4 times the flow of treated air.\nINSTRUMENTATION\nThis project aims at furnishing the plant with all instruments required for mass balance definition and analytical\ninstruments capable of giving at any time the “health check” of the plant. All instruments shall be equipped with\na device for signal transmission to a recording system in control room.\nThe recording system adopted shall be a storage system on magnetic medium and data video display; this system\nwill collect data about measure detection and transfer on a personal computer for required processing.\nANCILLARY STRUCTURES\nThe plant also includes:\n• A room with energy transformers and power generating set to use in case of lack of current\ncoming from the network.\n• A building for fuse-boards of various users with control rooms and sanitary facilities.\n• The organization of plant internal roads shall allow management staff to reach easily all the units\nof the project, even by vehicles.\n• The building with functions of office, laboratory for the analysis of daily monitoring of the\ntreatment process and Workshop for normal repairs carried out directly by the operation staff. While\nother operational functions as control panels, control room, etc., are allocated in other buildings located\nin the most appropriate place related to their functions, the incorporation of above mentioned functions\nin a single building is because those functions are required by all operational areas and the place where\nthey are held must be easily reached from all the sites where the plant process takes place (optimal\nlayout). A further reason is the opportunity to put them both in compliance with the rooms used as\noffices for the staff who will perform the two functions (easier access to the service by staff).

As work for extraordinary maintenance cannot be carried out on site but must be carried\nout by the manufacturers because they require machinery and specialized personnel that cannot be\nmade available in the WWTP site, for the size, the workshop should accommodate a workbench for the\nmaintenance of the parts that can be repaired on site (small size engines, assembly of removable parts,\nwork on motors, etc.) and storage of work tools and small parts.\n• Large areas are provided for standard operations pertaining to wastewater treatment plant\nmanagement (control room and electrical substations, mechanical dehydration etc.).\n• Screening trees provided to hide waste water treatment plant and, if necessary, to play an\nimportant role in avoiding diffusion of any bad smell during treatment.\n• Finally the areas dedicated to working site operations shall be restored after cultivation soil\nrecovery from earthworks, the sowing of selected grasses, fertilization and subsequent recovery of open\nspaces until complete rooting.\n• The area of the new treatment plant shall be fenced in order to avoid access to foreign persons;\nfencing shall be equipped with automatic gate to allow access of service staff and vehicles for standard\nmaintenance operations, loading/unloading of dehydrated sludge containers and so on.\nCOOLING SYSTEM\nFor each building will be given proper dimensions and capacities of cooling system providing proper tables.\n3.5 WASTEWATER QUALITY\nTables presents the wastewater test results related to the area collected to the future WWTP given by BM.\nIn the following tables c represents concentration measured value of specified parameter expressed in mg / l\nwhile F1 and F2 are quality measure control indices.\n• Year 2014\nBOD S.S pH Po4 So4 TN NO3 K\nc F1 F2 c F1 F2 c F1 F2 c F1 F2 c F1 F2 c F1 F2 c F1 F2 c F1 F2\nJan 260 25 32 390 24 30 7.5 7.49 7.63 5.2 4.7 4.5 -

Given the wide variety of\nconstituents that may be found in wastewater, it is common practice to characterize wastewater in terms of its\nphysical properties and its chemical and biologic constituents.\nProper sampling and analytical techniques are of fundamental importance in the characterization of\nwastewater. Sampling techniques, the methods of analysis, the units of measurement for chemical constituents,\nand some useful concepts from chemistry are considered in the following.\nBecause the data from the analysis of the samples will ultimately serve as a basis for designing wastewater\ntreatment plant facilities, the techniques used in sampling program must be such that representative samples\nare obtained.\nReferring to the well know and established manual of Metcalf end Eddy, Fifth Edition, the European Commission\nreport on Minimum quality requirements for water reuse in agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge the\ncharacteristics of the raw sewage that will be considered and analyzed are summarized as follow:\n• Physical characteristics\no Total Suspended Solid TSS\no Settleable solids SS\n• Inorganic chemical characteristics\no Ammoniacal Nitrogen NH \n3 \n-N\no Nitrate Nitrogen NO\n3\n-N\no Total Phosphorous TP\no Metals: Cu, Fe, Cr\no pH\n• Organic chemical characteristics\no Biochemical Oxygen Demand BOD5\no Chemical oxygen demand COD\n• Biological characteristics\no Faecal coliform\nSUMMARY OF SAMPLING METHOD\nAverage - composite sampling will do taking multiple instantaneous samples at appropriate time intervals and\nlater mixing of samples; is achieved through aspiration of the quantity of wastewater withdrawn. The frequency\nand duration of each individual withdrawal are also set according to the final quantity of sample required for\nthe analysis at least 4 liters, the aspirated sample is conveyed to a collection tank where it is mixed and\nhomogenized before being distributed in the various bottles.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 54 | 64\nReferring to European Standards samples for urban wastewater test will be provided every 24-hour in average\nfor a period of 7 days.\nQUANTITY OF SAMPLE TO BE TAKEN AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONTAINERS\nAt the time of sampling, the bottles for chemical analysis must be cleaned and primed 3 times before be filled\nwith the sample sewage water.\nBottles must be filled to overflow.\nContainers intended for microbiological sampling should not be used for intended samples to chemical analysis.\nSamples may be taken in two alternative locations as shown in next figure.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 55 | 64\n4 FEASIBILITY STUDY OF WASTEWATER REUSE FOR IRRIGATION\nNowadays water reuse is implemented in many urban areas in the world to cope with the increasing water\nshortage. Problems related to water are increasingly recognized management is accelerating the depletion of\nsurface water as one of the most critical and serious environmental especially groundwater resources [4].Drivers\nfor treated threats\nDrivers for treated wastewater reuse include increasing demand of water due to population and economical\ngrowth, water stress and adaptation to water scarcity and climate change, overuse of groundwater for\nagricultural purpose and existence of some useful materials like nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous).\nWastewater contains undesirable chemical constituents and pathogens (see next table) so the application of\ninappropriate treated wastewater for agriculture product could endanger human's health.\nType Example\nWaterborne bacteria Salmonella sp, Vibrio cholerae, Legionellaceae\nProtozoa Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium sp\nHelminths Ascaris, Toxocara, Taenia (tapeworm), Ancylostoma (hookworm)\nViruses Hepatitis A virus, Rotaviruses, Enteroviruses\nBiological hazard in wastewater (Ref. USEPA, Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet, EPA832-F-00-022)\nEnvironmental concerns to soil texture, plants, change in groundwater quality and ecosystem were related to\nquality of consumed water for irrigation according German technical reports. Many guidelines have been\ndeveloped by EPA, Washington DC to give a quality criteria, indicators and guidance on how treated wastewater\n(effluents) should be reused for irrigation purposes we will refer to EPA., 2004. Guidelines for Water Reuse,\nMunicipal Support Division Office of Wastewater Management Office of Water Washington, DC. EPA/625/R-\n04/108.\nSuitability of wastewater treatment plant effluent for agricultural irrigation will be studied assuming EPA\nguidelines and FAO-Unesco as leading criteria. Important indexes like sodium content, sodium absorption ratio\nand potential salinity will be taken into account.\nHydrogen Ion Activity (pH) and Alkalinity:\nWill be used typical recommendation values for irrigation water according to SAR index given by FAO-Unesco\nIn order to have a FAO low sodium hazard to soil.\nTurbidity:\nThe effluent will meet the Iraq standard for irrigation.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 56 | 64\nSalinity Hazard:\nThe effluent will meet the FAO standard for irrigation.\nSodium Hazard and Sodicity:\nThe effluent will meet the FAO standard for irrigation.\nNutrient (N and P):\nAnother important parameter in wastewater reuse for irrigation is the concentration of nutrient like N and P.\napproximately all of the experts consider this parameter as a strong point for wastewater reuses. Also EPA\nadvocates wastewater as a nutrient-loaded resource.\nThe effluent will meet the Iraq standard for irrigation.\nHeavy Metals:\nIn the case they will found they will meet the Iraq standard for irrigation.\nMicroorganism:\nTotal coliforms and fecal coliforms are the biological indicator that commonly used in wastewater treatment\nand reuse.\nThe effluent will meet the Iraq standard for irrigation and WHO guidelines for wastewater reuse in agriculture.\nThe limits of acceptability for the treated effluent defined by the Iraq Regulations, are compatible with all\nenacted regulations provided by various regulatory and control bodies in Europe and in the United States and\nby the WHO regarding the usage of wastewater to irrigate farmland.\nIn addition to the above mentioned acceptability limits, according to the WHO procedures, there is a need to\nguarantee, that the effluent produced by the designed treatment plant will respect the limit of 100 MPN of total\ncoli form in 100 ml of water.\nIn any case, always following the WHO instructions, it is advisable to use the treated wastewater only for surface\nirrigation and not for sprinkler irrigation, avoiding in this way risks due to any plant malfunction.\nFurthermore, it would be advisable to make preliminary studies on the pedological characteristics of the\nirrigated lands and on the types of crops (fruit trees, wheat, etc.,) to be irrigated in order to avoid problems of\nincompatibility.\nIn any case, it has to be highlighted that, as suggested by all studies being carried out on this subject, it is always\nadvisable to blend the treated wastewater with water from other sources to prevent that the chemical/physical\ncharacteristics of the wastewater which cannot be altered by a conventional biological WWTP (salinity, SAR,\netc.) may compromise the agronomic and pedological quality of the land to be irrigated.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 57 | 64\n5 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE PLAN\nThe WWTP plant should be operated according to set procedures and standards. A high standard of preventative\nmaintenance will result in good operating conditions and will improve and maintain a high level of service to the\ncustomers by reducing emergency occurrences, thereby rationalizing the annual cost of preventative\nmaintenance programs. Planned preventative maintenance provides a set procedure to be followed and the\nmajor maintenance tasks may be summarized as follows:\n• Preparation of an inventory of facilities\n• Preparation of schedules for specific work units\n• Detailing the tasks to be carried out\n• Collection of information and recording of results\nThere are many important items of equipment to be inspected and maintained, and the manufacturers\nmaintenance recommendations must be followed for electrical and mechanical, and instrumentation items.\nItem Maintenance checks Inspection Frequency\nFence and access gate \nGeneral state of repair with special reference to\nsecurity\nWWTP staff – Daily\nDetailed: Once every year\nAll building structures\nAdministration building and staff\nhousing\nStructural integrity of walls and roof Doors and\nwindows (with special reference to security)\nWWTP staff – Daily\nDetailed: Once every year\nPump chamber \nStructural integrity of walls and roof Doors and\nwindows (with special reference to security)\nWWTP staff – Daily\nDetailed: Once every year\nScreens \nCleaning and removal of screenings\nStructural check and thorough cleaning\nWWTP staff – Daily – or\nas necessary\nDetailed: Once every year\nGrit chamber \nCleaning and removal of grit\nStructural check and thorough cleaning\nWWTP staff – weekly - or\nas necessary\nDetailed: Once every year\nPrimary sedimentation tank \nMonitor for black and odorous sludge \nWWTP staff - continuous\nAeration tank \nBreak up mats and scum \nWWTP staff - continuous\nFinal sedimentation tank \nRoutine cleaning \nWWTP staff - continuous\nSludge treatment process\nSludge thickener\nAnaerobic digester\nSludge dewatering facility\nAs suppliers procedures \nTo suppliers\nrecommendation\nAll M & E Equipment incl.\nAncillary pumps\nPipework, fittings & valves\nSwitchboards\nInstrumentation etc.\nAs suppliers manual \nTo suppliers\nrecommendation\nMains electricity supply By Supply Authority \nTo Authority’s\nrequirements\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 58 | 64\n6 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS\nThe purpose of the financial analysis is to assess the financial viability of the project.\nIn order to do so, the project cash flows (expenses and revenues) will be computed, and financial indicators will\nbe evaluated in order to assess the viability and sustainability of the project. The criteria that have been adopted\nin the financial analysis of this project are presented in the following paragraphs.\n6.1 PROJECT COSTS\nEstimation of the project costs provides the basis for a financing plan and for carrying out the financial evaluation\nof the project. The following paragraphs describe the cost components of the proposed wastewater treatment\nplant.\nCAPITAL COSTS\nCapital costs, generally known as construction costs, comprise structures, equipment, construction materials,\nmachinery …etc., necessary for the construction of the project.\nThe amount will be subdivided in to the following components:\n• WWTP\n• Test running and maintenance equipment for one year\n• Spare parts\n• Machineries for running and maintenance\nImplementation of the WWTP:\nThe WWTP components are: Lifting station and screening; Grit and grease removal unit; Primary settling tank;\nAnaerobic treatment unit; Oxidation unit: carrousel; Final settling tank; Disinfection tank and storage and dosing\nunit; Flocculant storage; Sludge pumping station; Sludge thickening unit; Sludge handling and heating building;\nPrimary digestor; Secondary digestor; Gasometer; Biogas torch; Air production building; Electrical transformer\nroom and generating set; Sludge dewatering room; Administration, workshop and laboratory building; Biofilter\nfor air deodorization; Reception room; Outlet system; Emergency electrical power; Fire network service group\nand Control tower.\nTest running and maintenance equipment for one year:\nSupply required equipment, tools and material for maintenance and running actions (for one year), also includes\nsupplying requirements of occupational safety for all the workers. The item also includes the period of test\nrunning of the project for two months except maintenance period; and all the requirements to produce a good\nwork. The price includes training the staff mentioned in the contractor commitment.\nSpare parts:\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 59 | 64\nSupply spare parts with the maintenance work for one complete year.\nMachineries for running and maintenance:\nPumping vehicle and vehicle with jet nozzle.\nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS\nHereafter there are summarized all the main costs associated to WWTP operations and maintenance.\n6.1.2.1 COSTS FOR DISPOSAL OF WASTE MATERIALS\nAs far as the quantity of waste produced by the screening phase is concerned, typical parameters for the\nproduction of coarse/fine screenings of between 30÷300 l per 1,000 m3 of treated sewage can be adopted,\nbased on typical data from similar plants and specific literature on the subject of WWTP. However, the\nassessment must necessarily be differentiated between coarse screening where the retained material is sent\nto the collection skip and, fine screening where an additional compacting machine is used.\nIt is therefore assumed that with coarse screening, approximately 100 l are retained for every 1,000 m3 of\ntreated water.\nUnder this assumption, therefore, for a daily flow rate of approx. 200,000 m3 a total of 200,000/1,000*0.1 = 20\nm3/d will be retained by the coarse screening.\nThe fine screening at the plant inlet can produce approximately 200 l per 1,000 m3 of treated effluent. The\nwaste from the screening section can therefore be estimated daily at: 200,000/1,000*0,.2 = 40 m3/d.\nDownstream of compaction (i.e. after the watery part estimated at approximately 40%-50% has been\neliminated) this can be reduced to only 20 m3/d.\nThe total amount of screenings products will therefore be about 40 m3/d; therefore, it can be calculated that\nManagement will have to dispose of about: 14,600 m3/y. The average cost for the disposal of the grit products\nis around 160 USD/y, so this results in a cost of: 14,600*160 = 2,336,000 USD/y.\nFor sand removal unit, typical values of extracted sand volumes vary between 30 and 300 l per 1,000 m3 of\ntreated sewage; the maximum value is assumed for safety's advantage (300 l). Therefore, daily extracted sands\nwill be equal to: 200,000/1,000*0.3 = 60 m3/d. The sands once extracted from the grit and grease removal unit\nwill be sent to the classifier-washer where they will be washed and allowed to settle. Through these actions, an\nestimated volume reduction of around 70% can be achieved; therefore, the daily volume of sands is = 18 m3/d.\nAnnually, there will be approximately 6,570 m3/y. The average cost for the disposal of the grit products is\naround 254 USD/m3, therefore, a cost of 1,668,780 USD/y is obtained.\nThe amount of dewatered sludge to be disposed of depends on two main factors: the condition of the sludge\nat the centrifuge inlet and the concentration of a polyelectrolyte, which is appropriate for the condition of the\nsludge to be treated.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 60 | 64\nA precise estimate can be made following a test campaign associating the sludge under different conditions\n(summer and winter) with the most suitable polyelectrolyte. In the first analysis, it can be assumed, for safety's\nsake, that the amount of dry sludge to be disposed of is around 20-25%.\nThus, taking the calculations in the technical process report, which lead to a quantity of dewatered sludge\nproduced of about 177 m3/d, we obtain that about 64,605 m3/y will have to be disposed of annually. With an\naverage cost per landfill of around 120 USD/y, this comes to approximately 7,752,600 USD/y.\n6.1.2.2 COSTS FOR CHEMICAL REAGENTS\nAs far as the flocculant is concerned, this was only foreseen in case the discharge law should become more\nstringent with regard to phosphorous. At present, the discharge parameters already comply with those set by\nthe current law. Therefore, while it is correct to already have a phase for phosphorous abatement in place, thus\navoiding the need to implement it in the future, it does not seem correct to present costs in relation to currently\nunknown limits.\nFor estimation purposes, we consider the typical dosages given in the literature, i.e. a maximum of 2 g of pure\nperacetic acid per m3 of water to be treated (a value to be calibrated during the operational phase according to\nthe results of the measurements taken at the discharge point, which must comply with the legal limits).\nBased on the above, the quantity of peracetic acid to be dosed on the flow rate 200,000*2/24 = 16,666.67 l/h.\nAssuming peracetic acid in 15% commercial solution, this gives:\n16,666.67/(1000×0,15)=111.11 l/h\nTherefore, the annual consumption of peracetic acid is approximately: 973.32 m3/y. Multiplying by an average\nprice of 0.51USD/kg gives: 496.370 USD/y\n6.1.2.3 COSTS FOR ORDINARY MAINTENANCE AND CONSUMABLES\nFor the estimation of costs for routine maintenance (pumps, blowers, overhead travelling cranes, submersible\nagitators, centrifuges, etc.), vehicle and vehicle maintenance, and for the estimation of costs due to\nconsumables, reference was made to costs incurred on plants of a similar size. Annual costs for routine\nmaintenance and consumables can therefore be estimated in the region of USD 10,000,000/y. The cost is\ntherefore 10 USD/PE.\n6.1.2.4 ELECTRICITY COSTS\nThe annual electricity consumption needed to operate the Al-Khansa'a wastewater treatment plant is detailed\nin the specific elaboration; below is the total value, which remains at 40,631,993.70 kW/y. The average cost for\nindustrial plants is 0.06 USD/kW.\nThe annual cost estimated from the consumption shown in the specific elaborate and considering the average\nprice indicated above, is equal: 2,437.920 USD/y.\n6.1.2.5 MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING PERSONNEL COSTS\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 61 | 64\nThe overall personnel cost (manager, director, employee, worker), including social security and taxes was\nassumed to be 70,000 USD/y.\n6.1.2.6 TOTAL COST\nIn summary, the costs to be borne annually by the administration are as follows:\nGRILLED MATERIAL DISPOSAL 2,336,000 USD/y\nSAND DISPOSAL 1,668,780 USD/y\nDEWATERED SLUDGE DISPOSAL 7,752,600 USD/y\nCHEMICAL REAGENT CONSUMPTION 496,370 USD/y\nELECTRICITY COSTS 2,437,920 USD/y\nORDINARY MAINTENANCE AND CONSUMABLES 10,000,000 USD/y\nMANAGEMENT AND OPERATING PERSONNEL 70,000 USD/y\nGRAND TOTAL 44,761,670 USD/y\nThe annual total cost divided by the population equivalent is equal: 24,761,670 /1,000,000 = 24.76 USD/PE,\nwhile divided by the average flow rate treated is equal to: 24,761,670 /365/200,000 = 0.34 USD/m3\nCONTINGECIES\nThere are two types of contingency funds:\n• provision for price increases (price contingency) and\n• provision for an increase in physical works due to unforeseen factors (physical contingency).\nPrice contingency is determined based on the trend of price indices, while physical contingency depends on the\nnature of the project. In the financial evaluation, the allowance for contingencies will be taken as 15% of the\ncapital costs. Included in the contingency amount will be an allowance for provision of a reasonable level of\nsecurity. Contingencies is applied to the investments included in the construction phase.\nRESIDUAL\nResidual values on the investment items, in the final year of the evaluation, will be calculated on the basis of\nstraight-line depreciation, as a percentage of the initial investment cost related to the estimated remaining\nuseful life of the asset. Accordingly, residual values will be credited against the investment cost in the last year\nas a lump sum benefit. Conversely, where asset reaches the end of its useful life during the evaluation period,\ninvestment in a replacement asset is included at the appropriate time.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 62 | 64\nResidual and replacement costs during the evaluation period have been computed based on the following asset\neconomic lives, assuming negligible salvage values:\n• Structural and civil works – 50 years (as per clause 24 of the Contract)\n• Pipelines - 40 years\n• Electrical and mechanical equipment – 25 years\n• Vehicles and maintenance tools - 20 years\nINFLATION\nThe financial analysis, evaluation will be prepared using the year 2021 price quotations. When forecasting future\nconstruction and maintenance costs, an inflation rate of 3.0 % will be used. This is believed to cover most\nimported construction and maintenance items.\nThe O&M costs, on the other hand, involve labour and energy; it would be unrealistic not to offset such increases\nwith higher tariffs. Since the objective is to provide cost recovery, it is more reasonable to assume that it will\nhave to maintain revenue-cost parity, so that overall increases in costs will be matched by general increases in\ntariffs, and as such the latter approach will be adopted in the analysis.\nThe important implication of inflation is that tariffs need to be set periodically in steps that are inflation-linked\nso that they stay ahead of inflationary trends, even though this has social implications if salaries and wages are\nnot also indexed the same way. For the purpose of the financial analysis, an inflation rate of 4% has also been\napplied when forecasting future O&M prices, including salaries, energy, tariff etc.\nDISCOUNT RATES\nA discount rate for evaluating the viability of the project is intended to reflect the scarcity of financial resources.\nThe discount rate helps to rate projects according to their return to the economy. It is often the case that\ndifferent discount rates are used for the various types of projects: infrastructure, energy, social welfare etc.\nreflecting their “essential” or “non-essential” nature. In the financial analysis, a discount rate of 5.0 % will be\nadopted for computing the present worth of future investments in the project.\n6.2 BASIC ASSUMPTIONS\nThe basic assumptions that will be used in evaluating the alternatives are:\n• No import duties and taxes are assumed to be applicable on items used in this project\n• Land required for the treatment plants, pump stations and pipelines will be available at no cost\n• Involuntary resettlement and livelihood restoration are not considered\n• Electric power is available, where required, at cost\n• Other utility services are available, where required\n• The costs of constructing access roads, obtaining the right-of-way… etc, are not included\n• Work will be done largely by local qualified contractors\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nFEASIBILITY STUDY - Pag. 63 | 64\nThe financial and economic analyses will use a “with” and “without” project-methodology.\nA full description of the analyses, a sensitivity and switching analysis, and recommendations for key variables\nwill be provided.\n6.3 FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\nThe financial projection aims to forecast the cashflow associated with the development of waste water\ntreatment plant project. It will present the financial indicators, from which the viability of the project can be\nassessed.\nThis financial projection considers three direct sources of revenue for the project; namely:\n• billings from serviced customers,\n• Ministry capital budget transfer,\n• Ministry operating budget transfer.\nOther quantifiable as well as non-quantifiable benefits that are associated with economic and social benefits\nderived from the project will not be considered in the financial analysis.\nFINANCIAL MODELS: CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS\nA cash flow projection of an investment evaluates, over the economic period of the project, the sustainability of\nthe plan, considering:\n• Total revenues from billings.\n• Total expenses incurred in the operation of the system.\n• Salvage values of plant and equipment\nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is commonly considered as a measure of the financial attractiveness\nof the investment, from an investor’s point of view. The IRR refers to the interest rate at which the net present\nvalue of the cash flow profile representing the project is zero. As such, it is an indicator of the merit of the project\nwhen compared with the minimum acceptable rate of return set by the investor. For an investor or a government\nproject, this indicator helps to rank the projects according to their priorities, when compared with other\ninvestments/projects.\nThe objective that will be set in financial analysis will verify whether it is possible to obtain a return (IRR) of 5%\non the project. For this purpose, a tariff increase will be applied until reaching the goal\nIt is assumed that the willingness to pay water and sewerage services for a family is no more the 4% of the\nhousehold income.\nThe increase in tariff will allow to substantially reduce the transfer from the Ministry to cover the costs of O &\nM. This transfer will be zero starting when the rate will be able to generate a surplus cashflow that can also\ncover capital expenditure.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE

            "extracted_content": "Medical City – Design Test Program\nMarch 17, 2024\nWhile the individual system components proposed for this project are used to treat domestic\nwastewater and have proven to be effective, site-specific wastewater characteristics affect how\nwell they will work and provide insight into sizing. Since a wastewater treatment plant does not\nexist treating the Medical City wastewater, historical data does not exist. The conceptual design\nproposed is based on typical domestic wastewater and assumes fairly conservative design\nparameters. The following test program is proposed as an initial step in the design phase to\ngather site specific data to allow more accurately sizing the key system components that might be\naffected by local wastewater characteristics.\n1. Overview\nA standard approach in a situation such as at Medical City is to conduct pilot or lab testing\nbefore commencing detailed process design. The objective is to provide sufficient\nconfidence in the design parameters used to design the facility in order to assure meeting the\ndischarge limits required by the Municipality.\nThe proposed wastewater treatment plant for Medical City involves screens, grit removal,\nhigh-rate primary clarification using a vertical shaft design, conventional activated sludge,\ndissolved air flotation for final clarification and sodium hypochlorite for disinfection. These\ncomponents have all been used in domestic wastewater treatment facilities. The need for\ntesting is not to demonstrate that the components will work but to optimize sizing to provide\nthe municipality with the best system and to gain confidence that the assumed wastewater\ncharacteristics are correct.\nScreening utilizes screens of a given opening spacing so it is purely a mechanical process and\ndoes not require testing. Although, the raw sewage needs to be tested for fats, oils, and\ngreases to determine whether these are excessive and may blind the screens, however, the\nDAF system selected for the secondary clarifier can remove fat and grease from the waste\nstream.\nGrit removal is also a mechanical process and is designed to remove a grit of greater than a\ngiven size by gravity, so no testing is needed.\nThe vertical shaft primary settling tank uses solids contact to enhance solids removal and\nincrease the overflow rate. The nature of the interaction of the solids in the tank is not\npredictable and depends on the size, structure and charges of the solids involved. Efficiently\nsizing this tank requires pilot testing. This is normally done early in the design phase of a\nproject. Because of the limited site and the lack of other such treatment systems in Iraq\nPage 1\n\n(important because of the size and type of solids in the wastewater are generally\ngeographically unique as a result of local soils and wastewater constituents resulting from\nfood waste) this process is recommended to be pilot tested at the earliest date. The results of\nthis testing will likely have a significant impact on sizing of the first shaft and the second\nshaft. The nature of the proposed testing is described below in the “First Shaft – Pilot Test”\nsection of this document.\nThe second shaft is a conventional activated sludge process. Given a treatable wastewater of\nknown characteristics, it may be designed without pilot or lab testing, however, given that the\nwastewater for the Medical City site is, in part, composed of medical facility wastes, there is\na concern that toxic or inhibitory chemicals may exist in the wastewater. Therefore, lab or\nbench scale testing is recommended to determine whether this is likely true or not true.\nKnowing this early in design can provide the municipality with a warning about the nature of\nthe wastewater with adequate time to address it. The recommended test program is outlined\nin the “Second Shaft – Bench Test” section of this report.\nIn order to fit the treatment plant on the available site, several innovative concept design\ndecisions had to be made. The most important of these was to substitute stacked, dissolved\nair flotation (DAF) for final clarification. DAF performance is, like solids contact\nclarification, influenced by geographic considerations. DAF manufacturers recognize this\nand commonly have portable pilot units to determine the likely performance and chemical\nrequirements for a site before final design is undertaken. We recommend this be done early\nin the design phase of this project. It may be undertaken at a nearby activated sludge plant,\nsuch as at Rustamiyah, this requires coordination with the sewerage department and its\napproval together with the Rustamiyah Plant. Typically, this takes a week to a month and the\npilot unit is operated by the manufacturer supervised by our team and with assistance from\nthe University of Technology team that we already met and discussed their participation in\nthese studies.\n2. First Shaft – Pilot Test\n2.1 Overview\nPrimary clarifiers are used to remove settleable solids, containing pollutants such as BOD\nand phosphorus, when it is more economical to remove them in this process than in the\nbiological portion of the process that almost always follows.\nPrimary clarifiers can take several forms. The first is a simple, shallow settling basin,\neither circular or rectangular, that relies on discrete separation of solids by gravity. These\nare often called standard clarifiers. A second is a solid contact clarifier, usually circular,\nwhich allows the incoming solids containing wastewater to mix with already\nPage 2\n\nconcentrated settled solids to result in enmeshment of finer particles in the larger particles\nand the agglomeration of particles into larger particles. This can result in better removals\nand higher throughput rates. However, these advantages come with greater mechanical\ncomplexity and cost.\nEach of these options has its own economics. Design and performance standards for\nstandard clarifiers treating domestic wastewater are conservative and well known and so\nits economics are fairly predictable. Since wastewater settling data is not known for the\nMedical City wastewater, the concept design assumes conservative design criteria\nrepresentative of that used for a standard clarifier. The WET vertical shaft clarifier is a\nvariant of the solids contact option. It is an innovative and more efficient approach to\nachieve higher removal rates, and its performance is influenced by site specific\nwastewater characteristics. Also optimizing its design and minimizes its footprint. It is\ntherefore prudent to pilot test this option.\n2.2 Pilot Test Outline\nHeinke, et al (1980)\n1 \ndemonstrated that a column 15 cm in diameter or greater minimized\nwall effects to the extent that pilot tests using a column of at least this diameter were\nrepresentative of the results obtained in a full-size clarifier. Thus, we have proposed a 30\ncm minimum diameter column for this and for structural reasons.\nThe WET vertical Treatment Shaft acts as a solid contact clarifier by\nintroducing the influent flow into the lower level of a relatively deep\nshaft, approximately 20 meters (which is the proposed depth of the pilot\ntest column), allowing fine solids to rise through the settling cloud of\nheavier solids and to become enmeshed. This mechanism enhances\nremoval at higher overflow rates. The higher overflow rates reduce the\nrequired surface area. The proposed pilot test is to be run at 55\nl/m2-min, 110 l/m2-min, 165 l/m2-min, and 220 l/m2-min.The basic test\nprocedures are shown in the table below.\n1 \nHeinke, G. W., Joo-Hwa Tay, A., Qazi, M. A., (1980). Effects of chemical addition on the performance of\nsettling tanks, J. WPCF, 52, (12), 2946-2954\nPage 3\n\nTABLE 1 – PILOT TEST OUTLINE\n2.3 Pilot Test Results Analysis\nThe pilot test results will be assumed to be representative of full-scale performance,\nrecognizing that the full-scale plant will precede the first shaft with fine screening and\ngrit removal. The design details of the first and second shaft and aeration equipment will\nbe estimated based on performance at each test overflow rate and the optimized option\nrecommended.\n3. Second Shaft – Bench Test\n3.1 Pilot Test Outline\nTechnical universities commonly will provide bench scale testing of the activated sludge\nprocess used in conventional treatment plants to allow determination of biological\nPage 4\n\nkinetics and to determine treatability of the wastewater. For the Medical City project, the\nprimary concern is treatability since no biological wastewater treatment currently exists\ntreating this wastewater and a portion of the wastewater likely comes from patient\ntreatment and laboratory wastes. Prior to committing to a full-scale biological treatment\nplant, it is prudent to perform testing to confirm that the wastewater is generally\nbiologically treatable. A bench scale system is frequently used to do this and is\nconfigured similar to the system shown in the figure below.\nThis is commonly done at university laboratories using students to set up, maintain, and\nmonitor performance. For the Medical City project, this bench scale test will be\ncompleted at the University of Technology in Baghdad supervised by the university and\nour teams. This typically takes a month or so to reach stable operations. Because of this\nlong lead time it is recommended that this testing begin as soon as possible.\nThe proposed full-scale plant will have a 4-hour\nhydraulic retention time in the aeration basin\nand the proposed mean cell residence time (MCRT) is 10 days. The target food to\nmicroorganism ratio is 0.25 BOD5: MLVSS. The bench scale test would be set up to\nmatch these design criteria. Normally, it will take 2 to 3 MCRT’s to reach stable\noperation.\nDuring the start-up period sampling will be done every 3 days for influent and effluent\nCOD, influent BOD5, and mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS). If the university\nlaboratory is equipped to perform bioluminescence testing this will also be performed.\nThis testing exposes bioluminescent microorganisms to the wastewater, which will\ncontinue to luminesce unless a toxic component of the wastewater is present. This testing\nis not perfect, but provides a high probability estimate of the presence of toxic\ncompounds.\nAfter 3 MCRT’s, 30 days, daily sampling will take place for two weeks. Sampling will\nbe for influent and effluent COD as well as MLSS. If bioluminescence testing is\navailable, it will be continued.\nPage 5\n\n3.2 Pilot Test Results Analysis\nThe test results will be used to estimate the Monod equation constants for the Medical\nCity wastewater and whether toxic or inhibitory compounds are present. If toxic or\ninhibitory compounds are present, a recommendation for testing and discovery of the\nsource will be made.\n4. DAF – Pilot Test\n4.1 Pilot Test Outline\nDAF manufacturers normally test their equipment using small scale, portable units\nincorporating chemical feed systems. These are usually operated by the equipment\nmanufacturer’s staff.\nSince the DAF’s in this project will be used to separate MLSS from plant effluent, it will\nneed to be tested at an activated sludge plant. As described earlier, local circumstances\ncan affect wastewater characteristics. Therefore, testing locally, for instance Rustamiyah\nPlant, would be desirable.\nTypically, test units treat approximately 12 kg/m2-hr of solids. The objective of this\ntesting will be to test solids loadings from 12 to 25 kg/m2-hr.\nTesting will include operating without chemical addition and with polymer addition. Influent\nand effluent total suspended solids will be tested daily during operation.\n4.2 Pilot Test Results Analysis\nPage 6\n\nFor those tests resulting in less than 40 mg/l effluent total suspended solids, the lifecycle\ncost will be analyzed. It is anticipated that higher chemical usage will result in lower\ncapital costs and lower chemical usage will result in higher capital costs and lower\noperational costs, therefore the optimum combination will be selected for final design.\nPage 7"

Winds reaching the city are generally dry and because\nof the aridity and the relatively cloudless skies, there are large variations in daily temperature as well as between\nseasons and regions.\nClimate and meteorology are studied in order to have environmental parameters as guide for WWTP\ntreatments.\nThe climate of Baghdad is arid, subtropical, and continental. The mean maximum temperature in July and August\nis about 43°C, which could reach up to 49°C in hot seasons. Dust storms are common in summer and the winter\nis chilly. The mean annual rainfall ranges from about 120 mm in the south to about 160 mm in the northeast.\nPrevailing wind direction is Northwestern. And an exceptional flood is expected every 30 years.\nTEMPERATURE\nBilal, Al-Jumaily, A.Habbib, 2013 in their published study examined the trends of the monthly, seasonal and\nannual Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean time series for Baghdad, for the period 1941–2000. The most important aspects of\ntheir results are the significant increase in Tmax and Tmean during the spring season and a significant decrease in\nall three temperatures during the autumn season.\nFrom: Dheyaa A.

The behavior of air temperature for Baghdad city during the summer months\ntends to increase despite the fluctuations between the increase and decrease. Such observations are consistent\nwith global trends in temperature.\nAnalyzing temperature data from hydrologic years is possible to calculate maximum, minimum and mean\ntemperature values.\nHUMIDITY\nAtmospheric humidity is a term that describes the amount of water vapor in the air, and the distinction between\ndry and wet air in the atmosphere is through the presence of water vapor or not. Water vapor is the invasive\nstate of moisture in the atmosphere it is the most present condition in the atmosphere, where water is also\npresent in a liquid form, such as cloud droplets or raindrops in a solid state such as snow and hail. The amount\nof moisture in the air varies with humidity, depending on the temperature and air pressure, as the air humidity\nis directly proportional to the temperature and inversely with air pressure. The warmer air, the more water\nvapor it carries because the high air pressure lowers the evaporation process by preventing the evaporated\nparticles from escaping from the water surface to the atmosphere, and when the air contains the maximum\namount of water vapor that can carry it under a certain temperature and pressure, then it is said that the air has\nbeen saturated with water vapor.\n1. Water vapor pressure: It is the partial pressure of water vapor as a gas component of the atmosphere.\n2. Absolute humidity: The amount of weight of water vapor present in the air at a specific temperature.\n3. Specific humidity: It is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the mass of moist air that is associated\nwith it.\n4. Dew point: It is the temperature at which water vapor begins to condense\n5. Mixing ratio: Is the ratio between the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air with which water vapor\nis associated\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT - Pag. 13 | 31\n6. Relative humidity: The ratio of the real vapor pressure to the saturated vapor pressure at air\ntemperature.\nRelative humidity is the most common way of expressing air humidity, as it is a measure of the degree to which\nthe air approaches the saturation of water vapor. If the air contains half of the amount of water vapor that it\ncan carry only, then this humidity equals 50%, and the air is saturated with moisture that associated with\nshrouding in clouds and fog then the relative humidity in this case is 100%. In addition, the lower air layers over\nthe oceans are saturated with humidity that reaches 100%. In the Sahara Desert and the subtropical desert\nregions, the relative humidity drops to only 10%. There are several ways to measure them, including: 1-\nHygrometer with dry and wet probes. 2- The capillary hygrometer.\nThe high temperature with high humidity increases the transform of heat from the air to the body and at the\nsame time impedes evaporation, which makes the body does not cool quickly and its temperature becomes\nannoying. But during cold weather, high humidity increases the transfer of heat from the body to the\nsurrounding atmosphere, which causes the body to lose a portion of its heat at the time when it needs such\nheat. Long periods of heat or long periods of cold have a significant impact on the vital signs of a person. Hence,\nwe conclude that high temperature and extreme cold are harmful to human health because the human body\nwill maintain its internal temperature, which is 37 ºC. Whereas, high and low humidity are also harmful to human\nhealth. The humid atmosphere helps the growth of bacteria, germs, and causes laziness and lethargy, but the\nmoderate-humid air is comfortable and healthy and is better than wet or dry air. The relative humidity of a\nregion differs greatly during the day, even though the amount of water vapor in the air remains the same, and\nin such cases the relative humidity changes when the temperature increases or decreases, the relative humidity\nmay be higher in the morning, when the temperature is low and the air is unable to carry more water vapor than\nit did at that time, but when the temperature increases during the day, the air becomes able to carry more water\nvapor, thus reducing the amount of relative humidity. As the air cools under a specified pressure and a constant\namount of water vapor, it reaches a temperature with which it becomes saturated. This temperature called the\ndew point, but if the temperature is lower than that, the water vapor begins to condense and clouds, fog, or\nDew. Thus, the lower the air temperatures relative to the amount of dew in it, the higher the relative humidity.\nAtmospheric humidity in the atmosphere increases directly with increasing temperature, that is, the higher the\ntemperature, the higher the air humidity. For this reason, the humidity in the tropical regions increases, while\nin the Polar Regions decreases. It also increases in marine areas compared to land areas. The same can be said\nwhen comparing low areas (high humidity) and high areas (low humidity). The temperature is also affected by\nthe humidity. Water vapor is a gas that absorbs thermal energy. The temperature of the gaseous envelope\nsaturated with water vapor decreases by 1 km / 5 ° C, while decreases by 1 km / 10 ° C in case of non-saturated\nwater vapor. In addition, the humidity decreases as the height increases because 90% of the water in the\natmosphere is concentrated in the first five kilometers. This phenomenon is explained by moving away from\nwater sources. The weight of water plays a fundamental role in the presence of this substance near the surface\nof the globe.\nWeather and Climate in Iraq has a hot climate in most of spring, summer, and autumn months. Average\ntemperatures in Iraq range from above 39 ° C in July and August to below zero in January. Figure below shows\nthe annual average temperature in Iraq. Most of the rains occur from November and December until the end of\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT - Pag. 14 | 31\nApril, and the most abundant ones are in the mountainous region in northern Iraq. The summer months are\naccompanied by dry Southern and Southeastern winds, as well as dusty winds that occur from April to June and\nsecond from late September to November and Northern and Northwestern winds prevail from mid-June to mid-\nSeptember, where dust storms accompany these winds. The climate in the Western and Southern desert regions\nis characterized by hot Summers and cold Winters. This region also experiences short violent rainstorms in\nWinter. As for the Southeastern region, most of its rain is accompanied by thunderstorms in Winter and early\nSpring. The average annual average rainfall for this region is around 10-17 cm, and half of the Winter days are\ncloudy, and in Summer the weather is clear except for periods of dust storms in Norther part of Iraq. The\nKurdistan region, there is mountains that extend in the North and Northeast of Iraq, and the region's climate is\ncharacterized by mild Summers and cold Winters, and rain occurs mainly here in Winter and Spring, and is also\naccompanied by falling amounts of snow in many places.\nWIND\nAtmospheric temperature changes due to the effects of solar radiation cause differences in atmospheric\npressure. Therefore, the wind will be created according to the movement of air. The wind is generated by\npressure differences so that air moves from places of high pressure to others with low pressure. Each of the\ndirection, speed, and gustiness are features of the wind. The wind is not seen, so we see things being moved by\nit. Then the movement of objects as air passes them is an indication of wind direction. Anemometers are used\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT - Pag. 15 | 31\nto measure wind speed. Beaufort scale can be used by ordinary people to indicate the speed of the wind from\nits influence on surroundings. The Coriolis force increases when the wind speed increase. The stronger the wind,\nthe greater the deflection. Coriolis force is one of the important factors that affect wind speed. The direction of\nthe wind is an important factor in the siting of a wind energy conversion system. It is reported by the direction\nfrom which it originates. The power that can be extracted from the wind is one of the reliable sources to\nminimize the dependence on fossil fuel-generated electricity. Wind power can be generated by using wind\nturbines. In Iraq, Wind energy can be classified into three zones, 48% of Iraq has low annual wind speed, 35%\nhas annual wind speed 3.1e4.9 m/s, 8% has relatively high annual wind speed, and the residual has calm values.\nThe diurnal pattern of wind speed in Iraq has peak values at mid-day and early hours of the morning, the peak\nvalues of wind speed varies in the range 5e10 m/s. The use of wind as a source of energy is becoming popular\nbecause it is clean and renewable. There is a pressing need in Iraq to develop site-based technology on wind\nenergy, which can be used for the optimal design of wind farms. Therefore, many papers and researches have\nbeen carried out to analyze the statistical wind speed data obtained from measurements along a period of 25\nyears at 9 sites in Iraq, to indicate the superior sites among the selected sites with respect to the wind speed as\nwell as knowing the best periods of wind speed during the year. A lot of research has been done around the\nworld in the field of data mining for site assessment. Data mining using ARIMA or any other technique has been\nemployed to analyzing wind speed data, wind speed prediction, and wind speed modeling for a wind farm and\ncost estimation. The time series for wind speed were used for different parts from Iraq in this work to draw map\ncovering all region of Iraq which is located in the south-west of Asia between (29e37 N) and (39e48 E).\nThe monthly wind speed average data were obtained from Iraqi meteorological organization and seismology\n(IMOS) for (9) Stations. These data were analyzed using an arc map program, which is one of the Geographic\nInformation System programs. Arc map was used to analyze the monthly mean wind speed for several stations\n(Mosul, Kirkuk, Khanqin, Baghdad, Hai, Dewaniya, Amara, Nasiriya, and Basrah), which are located at the north,\nmiddle and south of Iraq respectively for the period from (1985e2010). This period was divided into five parts\nfrom 1985 into 2010. The steps of each part are five years. Every year in this period (1985,1990, 1995, 2000,\n2005, 2010) was divided into four months (Dec., Mar., Jul., Oct.), which correlate to the four seasons.

The long-term data of the monthly average rainfall for the time period 1979-2019 were\ncollected from the Baghdad station. Monthly rainfall for 39 years for Baghdad city is available which covers 24\nyears are continuous data from 1979 to 2002, two years missing (2003-2004) and 15 years to 2019 are\ncontinuous.

The groundwater bodies within the project area were\nfound to have a shallow water table. Thus, water which has percolated into the soil reaches groundwater at a\nhigher rate.\nDIYALA RIVER\nDiyala River is a tributary of Tigris River, it is one of the important rivers in Iraq. The Diyala River originates near\nSanandaj in the Zagros Mountains in Iran, forming the Iran-Iraq border for over 30 km. With a total length of\n574 km, 17 the river has a drainage area of 33,240 km2, of which 25% are located in Iran and 75% in Iraq (see\nnext Overview Map). The Diyala joins the Tigris 15 km south of Baghdad (see next Overview Map). Its principal\ntributaries are the Tanjeru, Sirwan and Wand Rivers.\nThe Diyala stream-flow is very similar to that of the Lesser Zab. It is characterized by peak flows in April and a\nlow-flow season from July until November.\nDiyala river, downstream tributary to the south of Baghdad of Tigris river, has a mean daily flow of 182 m3/s at\nthe confluence with Tigris.\nFrom: UN-ESCWA and BGR (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia;\nBundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe). 2013.

Rapid\ngrowth of population, urbanization, industrialization, and agriculture activities increase its exploitation, reduce\navailability, and enhance vulnerability to contaminate the quality of water.\nAn attempt has been made to assess the overall groundwater quality and identify major variables affecting the\ngroundwater quality in the urban area of Baghdad. Groundwater samples from tube wells were analyzed for the\nmajor physicochemical variables by Alhassan H. Ismail, Muntasir A.H. and Reem J. Channo who published their\nresults in Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical\nTechniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part (A),No.2, 2015.\nThe Authors, from the Hill–Piper trilinear diagram observed that the majority of ground water from sampling\nsites are Ca2+ -Mg2+ -Cl- -SO 42- type and Na2+ -K+ -Cl- -SO 42- type water. Hill (1940) has developed a pattern\ndiagram and later improved by Piper (1944, 1953) to form of trilinear diagram, which is an effective tool in\nsegregating analysis data with respect to sources of the dissolved constituents in groundwater.\nMultivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis and cluster analysis were applied to identify the major\nfactors (variables) corresponding to the different source of variation in groundwater quality of Baghdad. Factor\nanalysis identified three major factors explaining 82.506% of the total variance in water quality; and the major\nvariations are related to degree of mineralization of the geological components of soils, irrigation return flow,\nagricultural activities and mixing of wastewater. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three different groups of\nsimilarities between the sampling sites, reflecting different physicochemical properties and pollution levels in\nthe groundwater quality.\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part\n(A),No.2, 2015.\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT - Pag. 20 | 31\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part\n(A),No.2, 2015.\nThree latent factors were identified as responsible for the data structure, explaining 82.506% of total variance\nin the data set. The first factor explained 59.627% of the total variance and mainly related to mineralization and\nirrigation return flow. The second factor explained 11.569% which represents the agricultural activities from\nagricultural areas such as fertilization and mixing of wastewater whereas, the third factor explained 11.309% of\nthe variances and reflects the acidity–alkalinity scale in groundwater.\nFrom: Groundwater Quality Assessment in Urban Area of Baghdad, Iraq, Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques, Eng. &Tech.Journal, Vol.33,Part\n(A),No.2, 2015.\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT - Pag. 21 | 31\n4.3 SOIL\nIn 1965, the Iraq government formed the State Board for Land Reclamation, which was charged with mapping\nthe soils or Iraq. To date this governmental entity drafted an exploratory map of the entire country.\nThe soil classification revealed the following soil types in Iraq: Aridisol (~45%), Entisol (~20%), Inceptisol (~15%),\nVertisol (~10%), Alfisol (~5%), and Mollisol (~5%). Soils formed near the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers are\ndominated by relatively fertile alluvial soils within the Entisol soil order, while those in the south and western\ndeserts are barren and marginal rangeland soils within the Aridisol soil order. Soils in the northern Zagros\nMountain Range receive up to ten times the annual precipitation as those of the southwestern regions, and as\na result, soils of the Mollisol, Alfisol, and Vertisol soil order can be found in the northern foothills up to the Iraqi-\nIranian border.\nExploratory map of the soils of Iraq\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT - Pag. 22 | 31\nThe Quaternary period (including Pleistocene and Holocene ages) affected the formation and nature of soil in\nIraq. During this period, many processes took place that caused some erosion in the mountains and hills.\nTerraces have been formed along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and their tributaries as a result of changing\nclimate. Rivers and wind filled up the Mesopotamian plain with fine texture sediments. Moreover, secondary\ngypsum crest has been formed and covered large areas of the deserts and the Mesopotamian plain. Almost all\nthe soil of center and southern parts of Iraq became saline due to the natural conditions and the shallow level\nof ground water. Due to repeated flooding and irrigation practices, layers of mud accumulated on the original\nsoil. As a result, most of the basin areas of the rivers are of silty soil. Quaternary sediments are covering nearly\n30% of the Iraqi surface area as it can be noticed on the geological map (Figure below). They are important for\nthe human activities and engineering works\nGeological map of Iraq\nFrom.: Sissakian, V.K. (2000) Geological Map of Iraq. 3rd Edition, State Company of Geological Survey and Mining, Baghdad.\nBaghdad is located in the central part of the country in the middle Mesopotamian plain (Figure above). The area\nis covered by accumulation of the deposits brought by the two rivers (Tigris and Euphrates). The area was\noccupied by humans since the dawn of civilization. Early human activities affected the soil formations because\nthey were depending mainly on agriculture, irrigation and farm practices. These activities made numerous\nchanges in the soil characteristics from one place to another. Over the years, soil became a sequential stratum\nfrom alluvial and sand sediment. The changing course of the river caused changes in the flood plain of the river\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSULTING SERVICES WORK FOR THE PREPARATION OF DESIGNS FOR THE\nLIFTING AND PROCESSING STATION WITH A CAPACITY OF (200,000 M3/DAY) AT THE END OF THE NORTH-\nEASTERN MAIN SEWAGE LINE (AL-KHANSA) ON THE BANKS OF THE DIYALA RIVER WITHIN THE AL-\nFADHILIYA AREA\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT - Pag. 23 | 31\nand thus changing the sequences of the deposited layers. These changes gave the soil at Baghdad unexpected\nand misleading characteristics. Moreover, the soil is saline because of the arid climate. Based on the nature of\nBaghdad, soils are mostly of fluvial origin (clayey and silty) with some gypsiferous soil, and sand.\nGypseous soils are one of the most complex materials that challange the geotechnical engineers. In Iraq it has\nbeen reported that several structures have experienced different patterns of cracks and uneven deformations\ngenerated primearly from the exposion of the supporting gypseous soils to water. It is a well known fact that\ngypseous soils demonstrate high bearing capacity and very low compressibility when they are in the dry state.\nOn the contrary a sudden collapsibile behaviour was reported when the gypseous soils are exposed to water.The\ncollapsibility of gypseous soils results from the direct contact of water. The dissolution of different types of salts\ncontained inside the mass of gypseous soil will generate new pores inside the soil skeleton and loosen the\ncementing bonds between the particles. This process creates a meta stable structure that facilitates the sliding\nof particles into a more dense state. The rate of dissolution of gypsum depends primarily on environmental\nchanges in moisture content generating from fluctuation of ground water table and /or surface water, climate\nchanges typically temperature, permeability and state of flow conditions in addition to the type and content of\ngypsum. (Ref. Challenging Problems of Gypseous Soils in Iraq, Al-Saoudi N.K.S., Al-Khafaji A.N., Al-Mosawi M.J.,\n2013). (FAO 1990), although more recent study (Ismail 1994) reported that gypseous soils cover 31.7 % of the\ntotal area of Iraq. The first map demonstrating the distribution of gypsum in Iraq was presented by (Buringh\n1960) indicating five zones as shown in next figure.\nFirst map of distribution of gypsum in Iraq\nFrom.: Al- Saoudi N.K.S., Al- Khafaji A.N., Al- Mosawi M.J.

The land is considered highly flat with no clear natural drainage pattern. Baghdad\nhas a Calcaric Fluvisols soil type with about 20% of lime. Most soils of Baghdad area are therefore secondary\nsoils (residual soils) derived from the above regions, transported from place of weathering and accumulated as\na result of sedimentation. Besides, Baghdad soil strata are affected by river course changes during previous\ndecades leading to coarse silt deposits and giving different depositional stratigraphy each few meters, thus\nBaghdad strata are erratic, somewhat are nonhomogeneous with a water table near ground. This soil in generally\nis alkaline with poor permeability (NCCL, 1986; Karim and Schanz, 2006).

Based on the csv files, the paste, and your responses to my questions, I have updated the odor control research document to include more specific details about the Medical City wastewater treatment plant. Here is the revised document:\n\n# Odor Control Strategies for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad, Iraq\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq, is a critical facility serving the healthcare complex and surrounding areas. With a daily wastewater flow rate of 150,000 m³, effective odor control is essential to maintain a healthy and pleasant environment for the community and the plant's operators. This research document aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local regulations, and available technologies.\n\n## 2. Wastewater Characteristics and Odor Sources\n\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant receives a daily flow of 150,000 m³, containing various odor-causing compounds. According to the provided data, the average BOD5 concentration is 206.59 mg/L, and the average COD concentration is 667.14 mg/L. These values indicate a relatively high organic loading, which can contribute to odor generation.\n\nThe main potential odor sources within the plant include:\n- Headworks (screens, grit removal)\n- Primary clarifiers\n- Aeration basins\n- Sludge handling and treatment units\n\nThe site-specific wastewater characteristics, such as temperature (ranging from 15°C to 35°C), pH (average 7.71), and organic loading, can significantly impact odor generation. Higher temperatures and organic loading can increase odor generation, while fluctuations in pH can promote the formation of odorous compounds like hydrogen sulfide.\n\n## 3. Odor Control Regulations and Standards\n\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Environment is responsible for setting and enforcing environmental regulations, including those related to odor emissions from wastewater treatment plants. The National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan for Iraq (2013-2017) highlights the need for developing and implementing odor control regulations.\n\nIn the absence of specific local standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for odor management in wastewater treatment plants can be used as a reference to establish performance targets for the odor control system.\n\n## 4. Odor Control Technologies\n\nBased on the provided data and the specific conditions at the Medical City site, a mixed-methods approach combining biological and chemical treatment technologies is recommended for effective odor control.\n\n### 4.1 Biofilters\n\nBiofilters are a suitable option for treating odorous air from the headworks, primary clarifiers, and sludge handling areas. The pilot study data can be used to size the biofilter based on the expected odor loads and removal efficiencies. Locally sourced materials, such as reed from the famous marshes in Iraq, can be used as the filter media to minimize the need for imported materials.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biofilters include:\n- Media type and depth\n- Airflow rate and empty bed residence time (EBRT)\n- Moisture content and pH control\n- Nutrient supply and irrigation system\n\n### 4.2 Biotrickling Filters\n\nBiotrickling filters can be used to treat high-concentration odorous air streams from the aeration basins and secondary clarifiers. The pilot study data can inform the design of the biotrickling filter, including media selection, airflow rates, and pH control.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biotrickling filters include:\n- Media type and surface area\n- Airflow rate and EBRT\n- Nutrient solution composition and flow rate\n- pH control and monitoring\n- Biomass control and removal\n\n### 4.3 Chemical Scrubbers\n\nChemical scrubbers can be employed as polishing steps for the biofilter and biotrickling filter systems, especially during high-temperature periods or upset conditions. The high temperatures in Baghdad (up to 49°C in hot seasons) may necessitate the use of chemical scrubbers to ensure consistent odor removal performance.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for chemical scrubbers include:\n- Scrubber type (packed tower, spray tower, or venturi)\n- Chemical selection and concentration\n- Airflow rate and contact time\n- pH control and monitoring\n- Corrosion-resistant materials and equipment\n\n### 4.4 Activated Carbon Adsorption\n\nActivated carbon adsorption can be used as a final polishing step for the treated air stream, particularly for removing any residual volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or other odorous compounds not effectively removed by the biological and chemical treatment processes.\n\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for activated carbon adsorption systems include:\n- Carbon type and quality\n- Airflow rate and contact time\n- Relative humidity and temperature\n- Pretreatment for dust and moisture removal\n- Carbon replacement or regeneration frequency\n\n## 5. Recommendations for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\nBased on the analysis of the wastewater characteristics, local conditions, and available odor control technologies, the following recommendations are made for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant:\n\n1. Implement a two-stage odor control system consisting of biofilters followed by biotrickling filters to treat odorous air from the headworks, primary clarifiers, aeration basins, and sludge handling areas. Use locally sourced reed as the biofilter media to minimize the need for imported materials.\n\n2. Install chemical scrubbers as a polishing step for the biofilter and biotrickling filter systems to ensure consistent odor removal performance during high-temperature periods or upset conditions.\n\n3. Consider the use of activated carbon adsorption as a final polishing step for the treated air stream to remove any residual odorous compounds.\n\n4. Optimize the aeration basin design and operation based on the pilot study data to minimize odor stripping. This may involve adjusting airflow rates, diffuser placement, or using high-efficiency diffusers.\n\n5. Implement proper sludge handling procedures, such as minimizing sludge storage times and using enclosed systems for thickening and dewatering, to reduce odor generation from these processes.\n\n6. Monitor and control pH levels throughout the treatment process based on the pilot study data to minimize odor generation from hydrogen sulfide and other odorous compounds.\n\n7. Develop a comprehensive odor monitoring and management plan that includes regular odor surveys, complaint response procedures, and continuous improvement strategies based on performance data and feedback from the community and plant operators.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nThis research document has provided a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq. By considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local conditions, and available technologies, a mixed-methods approach combining biological and chemical treatment processes has been recommended to effectively control odors and maintain a healthy environment for the community and plant operators.\n\nImplementing the recommended odor control strategies will require careful design, sizing, and integration with the existing treatment processes. Regular monitoring, performance evaluation, and continuous improvement will be essential to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the odor control system and minimize the impact on the surrounding community.\n\n## References\n\n1.

      "content": " I have reviewed the three CSV data files provided: \"SludgeSheet - Sheet1.csv\", \"MedicalCityContaminantsAverages.csv\", and \"IraqiGovStandardForContaminationVariables.csv\". Here are the summaries of findings and overviews for each file, followed by an additional summary discussing their relationship.\n\nSummary of \"SludgeSheet - Sheet1.csv\":\nThis file contains data related to solids production projections for an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. It provides information on plant influent flow, BOD, TSS, ammonia, and phosphorus concentrations, as well as primary and secondary treatment parameters. The data is used to calculate the biological solids yield, volume of waste activated sludge (WAS), and volume of thickened sludge. This information is crucial for designing and optimizing the sludge handling and treatment processes, which are potential sources of odors in the wastewater treatment plant.\n\nSummary of \"MedicalCityContaminantsAverages.csv\":\nThis file presents average concentrations of various contaminants in the wastewater at the Medical City treatment plant. The data includes BOD5, COD, nutrients (nitrate and phosphate), heavy metals (cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc), and other parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. The file also provides information on the range and standard deviation of these contaminants. This data is essential for understanding the wastewater composition and identifying the main odor-causing compounds, such as sulfides, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are related to the biodegradation of organic matter and the presence of nutrients and certain metals.\n\nSummary of \"IraqiGovStandardForContaminationVariables.csv\":\nThis file lists the maximum allowable concentrations for various contaminants in treated wastewater according to Iraqi government regulations. The contaminants include organic pollutants (BOD5, COD), nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, phosphate), heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc), and other parameters such as pH, chloride, sulfate, and total dissolved solids. These standards are important for ensuring that the treated wastewater is safe for discharge and does not pose a risk to public health or the environment. Meeting these standards may require additional treatment steps or optimization of existing processes, which can also help in reducing odor generation.\n\nSummary of the relationship between the three CSV files:\nThe three CSV files provide complementary information for designing an effective odor management system at the Medical City wastewater treatment plant. The \"SludgeSheet - Sheet1.csv\" file focuses on the solids production and handling aspects, which are critical for controlling odors from sludge processing units. The \"MedicalCityContaminantsAverages.csv\" file gives insights into the wastewater composition and the potential odor-causing compounds, helping to identify the main sources of odors in the treatment process. The \"IraqiGovStandardForContaminationVariables.csv\" file sets the targets for contaminant removal and guides the selection and optimization of treatment technologies to meet these standards while minimizing odor generation.\n\nTable addressing each contaminant and likely targeted treatment stage:\n\n| Contaminant | Likely Targeted Treatment Stage |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| BOD5        | Primary clarifiers, Aeration basins |\n| TSS         | Primary clarifiers, Secondary clarifiers |\n| Ammonia     | Aeration basins, Secondary clarifiers |\n| Phosphorus  | Aeration basins, Secondary clarifiers |\n| Nitrate     | Aeration basins, Secondary clarifiers |\n| Sulfate     | Primary clarifiers, Aeration basins |\n| Heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) | Primary clarifiers, Secondary clarifiers, Sludge handling |\n| VOCs        | Headworks, Primary clarifiers, Aeration basins |\n\nGaps in the contamination treatment process:\nBased on the provided data and the Iraqi government standards, there might be potential gaps in the treatment of certain contaminants, such as:\n\n1. Ammonia: The average ammonia concentration in the wastewater (15 mg/L) exceeds the Iraqi standard of 10 mg/L. This may require optimization of the nitrification process in the aeration basins and secondary clarifiers.\n\n2. Heavy metals: The average concentrations of cadmium, copper, and lead in the wastewater exceed the Iraqi standards. Additional treatment steps, such as chemical precipitation or adsorption, may be necessary to remove these metals and meet the discharge requirements.\n\n3. Phosphorus: The average phosphorus concentration in the wastewater (6 mg/L) is higher than the Iraqi standard of 3 mg/L. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal or chemical precipitation may be needed to achieve the required level of phosphorus removal.\n\nAddressing these gaps in the treatment process can help improve the overall contaminant removal efficiency and reduce the potential for odor generation.\n\nNow, let's review the tables I've generated before merging them with the research document:\n\n1. The first table identifies the stages from the pilot program and estimates the odor profile and contaminants for each stage. This information is valuable for understanding the main sources of odors in the treatment process and selecting appropriate odor control technologies.\n\n2. The second table lists the potential odor control methods for each treatment stage based on the odor profile and contaminants. This table provides a starting point for evaluating and comparing different odor control options.\n\n3. The third table compares the odor control methods using 10 variables, including stage applicability, odor removal efficiency, costs, footprint, maintenance requirements, environmental impact, compatibility with existing processes, and local availability of materials. This table helps in the decision-making process by considering multiple factors that influence the selection of odor control technologies.\n\n4. The final table with 5 columns maps and selects the recommended odor control methods for each treatment stage, providing a rationale for the selection, expected performance, and potential questions and concerns. This table summarizes the key findings and recommendations for the odor management system at the Medical City wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThese tables provide a comprehensive analysis of the odor control strategies tailored to the specific conditions and requirements of the Medical City wastewater treatment plant. They can be incorporated into the research document to support the recommendations and provide a clear, evidence-based approach to odor management.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to proceed with merging the tables into the research document or if you have any further suggestions for improvement.",

He also provided you with this data. Think critically about what the data is, summarize your thoughts and identify how to improve the document and incorporate its content and write a new bullet point draft including those improvements\n\nOdor impacting variables analysis\n\nVariable Average Concentration (mg/L) Iraqi Gov. Max Allowed (mg/L) Impact on Odor Remarks\n\nBOD5 206.59 40 High Exceeds standard, contributes significantly to odor.\n\nCadmium (Cd2+) 0.02 0.01 Low Exceeds standard, but low impact on odor.\n\nChloride 311.87 600 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\nCOD (Cr2O7 method) 667.14 100 High Exceeds standard, significant contributor to organic odor.\n\nCopper (Cu2+) 0.042 0.2 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\nDissolved oxygen 4.83 - Low Important for aerobic treatment processes.\n\nLead (Pb2+) 0.082 0.1 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\nNitrate (NO3-) 11.00 50 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\npH 7.71 7.75 Neutral Close to neutral, optimal for biological processes.\n\nSulfate (SO42-) 226.64 400 Moderate Within standard, can contribute to hydrogen sulfide odor.\n\nTotal Dissolved Solids (TDS) 194.75 60 Moderate Exceeds standard, can impact treatment efficiency.\n\nZinc(Zn) 0.14 0.2 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\nSludge Treatment Implications:\n\nHigh BOD and COD levels will lead to increased organic matter in the sludge, contributing to stronger odors during sludge processing.\n\nThe treatment plant will need robust odor control measures, especially for processes handling organic-rich sludge.\n\nOdor Management Considerations:\n\nTreatment processes should efficiently reduce BOD and COD levels to minimize odor.\n\nAnaerobic conditions, often associated with high BOD/COD, can lead to the production of malodorous gases like hydrogen sulfide.\n\nChemical or biological odor control methods might be necessary, especially in areas handling or processing sludge.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the wastewater treatment plant will face challenges due to high levels of BOD and COD, both of which significantly exceed the Iraqi government standards and are key contributors to odor problems. Effective odor management strategies will be crucial in this project.\n\nOdor Management Implications:\n\nHigh BOD and COD: These indicate a high presence of biodegradable material, which can lead to the production of odorous gases during decomposition, particularly under anaerobic conditions. This suggests a need for effective aerobic treatment processes and possibly odor control measures like biofilters or chemical scrubbers.\n\nSulfates and Chlorides: Elevated levels of sulfates can lead to hydrogen sulfide production, a primary odor concern in wastewater. Managing the reduction of sulfates to sulfides and controlling the release of hydrogen sulfide will be crucial.\n\nTurbidity and Dissolved Solids: High values might suggest a high presence of organic material, contributing to potential odor issues.\n\npH and Dissolved Oxygen: Proper balance is essential for effective biological treatment processes, which can indirectly affect odor control.\n\nYour odor management strategy should focus on controlling the biological decomposition processes, particularly for sulfur compounds, and maintaining aerobic conditions as much as possible to minimize odor production. Technologies such as biofiltration, chemical oxidation, and scrubbers could be essential components of your odor management system. Additionally, regular monitoring of these key parameters will help in effectively managing and adapting the odor control measures.",

He also provided you with this data.

Max Allowed (mg/L) Impact on Odor Remarks\n\nBOD5 206.59 40 High Exceeds standard, contributes significantly to odor.\n\nCadmium (Cd2+) 0.02 0.01 Low Exceeds standard, but low impact on odor.\n\nChloride 311.87 600 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\nCOD (Cr2O7 method) 667.14 100 High Exceeds standard, significant contributor to organic odor.\n\nCopper (Cu2+) 0.042 0.2 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\nDissolved oxygen 4.83 - Low Important for aerobic treatment processes.\n\nLead (Pb2+) 0.082 0.1 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\nNitrate (NO3-) 11.00 50 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\npH 7.71 7.75 Neutral Close to neutral, optimal for biological processes.\n\nSulfate (SO42-) 226.64 400 Moderate Within standard, can contribute to hydrogen sulfide odor.\n\nTotal Dissolved Solids (TDS) 194.75 60 Moderate Exceeds standard, can impact treatment efficiency.\n\nZinc(Zn) 0.14 0.2 Low Within standard, low impact on odor.\n\nSludge Treatment Implications:\n\nHigh BOD and COD levels will lead to increased organic matter in the sludge, contributing to stronger odors during sludge processing.\n\nThe treatment plant will need robust odor control measures, especially for processes handling organic-rich sludge.\n\nOdor Management Considerations:\n\nTreatment processes should efficiently reduce BOD and COD levels to minimize odor.\n\nAnaerobic conditions, often associated with high BOD/COD, can lead to the production of malodorous gases like hydrogen sulfide.\n\nChemical or biological odor control methods might be necessary, especially in areas handling or processing sludge.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the wastewater treatment plant will face challenges due to high levels of BOD and COD, both of which significantly exceed the Iraqi government standards and are key contributors to odor problems. Effective odor management strategies will be crucial in this project.\n\nOdor Management Implications:\n\nHigh BOD and COD: These indicate a high presence of biodegradable material, which can lead to the production of odorous gases during decomposition, particularly under anaerobic conditions. This suggests a need for effective aerobic treatment processes and possibly odor control measures like biofilters or chemical scrubbers.\n\nSulfates and Chlorides: Elevated levels of sulfates can lead to hydrogen sulfide production, a primary odor concern in wastewater. Managing the reduction of sulfates to sulfides and controlling the release of hydrogen sulfide will be crucial.\n\nTurbidity and Dissolved Solids: High values might suggest a high presence of organic material, contributing to potential odor issues.\n\npH and Dissolved Oxygen: Proper balance is essential for effective biological treatment processes, which can indirectly affect odor control.\n\nYour odor management strategy should focus on controlling the biological decomposition processes, particularly for sulfur compounds, and maintaining aerobic conditions as much as possible to minimize odor production. Technologies such as biofiltration, chemical oxidation, and scrubbers could be essential components of your odor management system. Additionally, regular monitoring of these key parameters will help in effectively managing and adapting the odor control measures.",

Biofiltration appears to be the most widely applicable odor control technology, followed by chemical oxidation and scrubbers. Aeration optimization and pH control are more stage-specific and are particularly important in the aeration basins.\n\n2) Prioritization of odor control strategies based on the exceedance of Iraqi government standards:\n\n1. BOD5 and COD: Significantly exceed the standards and are the top priority for odor control. Focus on biofiltration, chemical oxidation, and optimization of aeration processes.\n2. Sulfates: Although within the standard, sulfates can contribute to hydrogen sulfide odor. Prioritize the use of scrubbers and chemical oxidation in sludge handling areas.\n3. Dissolved oxygen and pH: Maintain optimal levels to support efficient biological treatment and minimize odor production. Implement aeration optimization and pH control strategies in aeration basins.\n\nCreative/innovative solution: Consider the use of a closed-loop odor control system that captures and treats odorous air from the shaft before releasing it back into the treatment process. This can help minimize odor escape and improve overall treatment efficiency.\n\n3) Case studies:\n- Al-Dewanyia WWTP, Iraq: Implemented a bio-trickling filter system for odor control in the headworks and primary clarifiers, resulting in a 90% reduction in H2S emissions (Al-Zubaidi et al., 2019).\n- Kabul WWTP, Afghanistan: Used a combination of bio-trickling filters and activated carbon adsorption for odor control in the sludge handling facility, achieving a 95% reduction in odorous compounds (Azimi et al., 2017).\n\n4) Summary table and flowchart:\n\n| Treatment Stage  | Key Odor-Impacting Variables | Recommended Odor Control Strategies                                  |\n|------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Headworks        | BOD5, COD                    | Biofiltration, chemical oxidation, scrubbers                        |\n| Primary Clarifiers | BOD5, COD                    | Biofiltration, chemical oxidation                                   |\n| Aeration Basins  | BOD5, COD, sulfates, DO, pH  | Biofiltration, aeration optimization, pH control                    |\n| Secondary Clarifiers | BOD5, COD                    | Biofiltration                                                       |\n| Sludge Handling  | BOD5, COD, sulfates          | Biofiltration, chemical oxidation, scrubbers                        |\n\nFlowchart:\n1.

      "content": " # Odor Control Strategies for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad, Iraq\n\n## 1. Introduction\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq, faces significant challenges in managing odors due to its high daily wastewater flow of 150,000 m³ and the presence of various odor-causing compounds. This research document aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies tailored to the site-specific wastewater characteristics and odor-impacting variables. By implementing effective odor management solutions, the plant can minimize the impact on the surrounding community and ensure a healthy environment for its operators.\n\n## 2. Wastewater Characteristics and Odor-Impacting Variables\nThe wastewater at the Medical City treatment plant contains high levels of biodegradable organic matter, as indicated by the average BOD5 concentration of 206.59 mg/L and COD concentration of 667.14 mg/L, both of which significantly exceed the Iraqi government standards of 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L, respectively. These high levels of organic matter contribute to the production of odorous compounds during the wastewater treatment process.\n\nOther odor-impacting variables include sulfates (226.64 mg/L), which can lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide, and various heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, and lead. Although these variables are within the Iraqi government standards, they can still influence the odor generation potential and the efficiency of biological treatment processes.\n\nTo better understand the relationship between odor-impacting variables and treatment stages, two orthogonal tables have been created:\n\nTable 1: Odor-Impacting Variables and Their Relevance to Treatment Stages\n\n| Odor-Impacting Variable | Headworks | Primary Clarifiers | Aeration Basins | Secondary Clarifiers | Sludge Handling |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| BOD5                    | High      | High              | High            | Moderate            | High            |\n| COD                     | High      | High              | High            | Moderate            | High            |\n| Sulfates                | Moderate  | Moderate          | High            | Moderate            | High            |\n| Dissolved Oxygen        | Low       | Low               | High            | Moderate            | Low             |\n| pH                      | Moderate  | Moderate          | High            | Moderate            | Moderate        |\n\nTable 2: Odor Control Technologies and Their Applicability to Treatment Stages\n\n| Odor Control Technology | Headworks | Primary Clarifiers | Aeration Basins | Secondary Clarifiers | Sludge Handling |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Biofiltration           | High      | High              | Moderate        | High                | High            |\n| Chemical Oxidation      | High      | Moderate          | Moderate        | Moderate            | High            |\n| Scrubbers               | High      | Moderate          | Low             | Low                 | High            |\n| Aeration Optimization   | Low       | Low               | High            | Moderate            | Low             |\n| pH Control              | Moderate  | Moderate          | High            | Moderate            | Moderate        |\n\nBased on these tables, it is evident that BOD5, COD, and sulfates are the most critical odor-impacting variables across all treatment stages. Biofiltration appears to be the most widely applicable odor control technology, followed by chemical oxidation and scrubbers. Aeration optimization and pH control are more stage-specific and are particularly important in the aeration basins.\n\nPrioritization of odor control strategies based on the exceedance of Iraqi government standards:\n\n1. BOD5 and COD: Significantly exceed the standards and are the top priority for odor control. Focus on biofiltration, chemical oxidation, and optimization of aeration processes.\n2. Sulfates: Although within the standard, sulfates can contribute to hydrogen sulfide odor. Prioritize the use of scrubbers and chemical oxidation in sludge handling areas.\n3. Dissolved oxygen and pH: Maintain optimal levels to support efficient biological treatment and minimize odor production. Implement aeration optimization and pH control strategies in aeration basins.\n\n## 3. Odor Management Strategies\nBased on the analysis of odor-impacting variables and their relevance to treatment stages, the following odor control technologies are recommended for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant:\n\n1. Biofiltration: This technology is highly applicable across all treatment stages, particularly in the headworks, primary clarifiers, secondary clarifiers, and sludge handling areas. Biofiltration systems use a bed of organic media to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms, effectively removing a wide range of odorous compounds, including hydrogen sulfide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\n2. Chemical Oxidation: This method is suitable for the headworks, primary clarifiers, and sludge handling areas. Chemical oxidation involves the use of oxidizing agents, such as hydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate, to break down odorous compounds into less offensive products. This technology can be particularly effective in controlling sulfide-based odors.\n\n3. Scrubbers: Scrubbers are recommended for the headworks and sludge handling areas, where high concentrations of odorous gases are expected. These systems use a liquid solution to absorb and remove odorous compounds from the air stream, offering a targeted approach to odor control.\n\n4. Aeration Optimization: Proper aeration is crucial in the aeration basins to maintain adequate dissolved oxygen levels and support efficient biological treatment. Optimizing aeration through the use of fine-bubble diffusers, high-efficiency blowers, and automated control systems can help minimize odor production and improve overall treatment performance.\n\n5. pH Control: Maintaining an optimal pH range in the aeration basins is essential for promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms and reducing the formation of odorous compounds. pH control can be achieved through the addition of alkaline or acidic chemicals, as well as the use of automated monitoring and dosing systems.\n\nCase studies supporting the effectiveness of these odor control strategies:\n\n- Al-Dewanyia WWTP, Iraq: Implemented a bio-trickling filter system for odor control in the headworks and primary clarifiers, resulting in a 90% reduction in H2S emissions (Al-Zubaidi et al., 2019).\n- Kabul WWTP, Afghanistan: Used a combination of bio-trickling filters and activated carbon adsorption for odor control in the sludge handling facility, achieving a 95% reduction in odorous compounds (Azimi et al., 2017).\n\n## 4. Innovative Solutions\nIn addition to the conventional odor control technologies, the Medical City wastewater treatment plant can consider implementing innovative solutions to further enhance odor management. One such solution is a closed-loop odor control system that captures and treats odorous air from the shaft before releasing it back into the treatment process. This approach can help minimize odor escape and improve overall treatment efficiency by containing and treating odorous emissions at the source.\n\nThe closed-loop system would involve the installation of air extraction units at key odor-generating locations within the shaft, such as the headworks, primary clarifiers, and sludge handling areas. The captured odorous air would then be directed to a centralized treatment unit, which could employ a combination of biofiltration, chemical scrubbing, and activated carbon adsorption to remove odorous compounds. The treated air would then be recirculated back into the shaft, creating a closed loop that minimizes odor escape and reduces the reliance on external odor control measures.\n\n## 5. Implementation Roadmap\nTo effectively implement the recommended odor control strategies at the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, a systematic approach should be followed. The implementation roadmap can be summarized in the following flowchart:\n\n1. Assess wastewater characteristics and identify key odor-impacting variables\n2. Determine the exceedance of odor-impacting variables compared to Iraqi government standards\n3. Prioritize odor control strategies based on the exceedance and the treatment stage\n4. Implement recommended odor control technologies:\n   - Biofiltration\n   - Chemical oxidation\n   - Scrubbers\n   - Aeration optimization\n   - pH control\n5. Consider innovative solutions like closed-loop odor control systems\n6. Monitor and optimize odor control performance based on key parameters and treatment efficiency\n\nThe first step in the implementation process is to thoroughly assess the wastewater characteristics and identify the key odor-impacting variables. This assessment will help prioritize the odor control strategies based on the exceedance of Iraqi government standards and the specific treatment stages where odors are most likely to occur.\n\nOnce the priorities have been established, the recommended odor control technologies can be implemented in a phased manner, starting with the most critical areas such as the headworks, primary clarifiers, and sludge handling facilities. Biofiltration, chemical oxidation, and scrubbers should be installed in these areas to address the high levels of BOD5, COD, and sulfates.\n\nIn the aeration basins, the focus should be on optimizing aeration and maintaining proper pH control to support efficient biological treatment and minimize odor production. Fine-bubble diffusers, high-efficiency blowers, and automated control systems can be installed to improve aeration performance.\n\nAlongside the conventional odor control technologies, the plant should consider implementing innovative solutions like the closed-loop odor control system. This system can be designed and installed in parallel with the other odor control measures, providing an additional layer of protection against odor escape.\n\nThroughout the implementation process, regular monitoring and optimization of the odor control systems should be carried out. Key parameters such as H2S levels, VOC concentrations, and treatment efficiency should be measured and analyzed to assess the performance of the odor control technologies. Based on the monitoring results, adjustments can be made to the system design, operating conditions, and chemical dosing rates to ensure optimal odor control performance.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\nThis research document has provided a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq. By considering the site-specific wastewater characteristics, odor-impacting variables, and their relevance to treatment stages, a targeted approach to odor management has been developed.\n\nThe recommended odor control technologies, including biofiltration, chemical oxidation, scrubbers, aeration optimization, and pH control, have been selected based on their applicability to the specific treatment stages and their effectiveness in addressing the key odor-impacting variables. The prioritization of these strategies has been based on the exceedance of Iraqi government standards, ensuring that the most critical odor sources are addressed first.\n\nThe inclusion of innovative solutions, such as the closed-loop odor control system, further enhances the odor management capabilities of the plant by containing and treating odorous emissions at the source.\n\nBy following the implementation roadmap and regularly monitoring and optimizing the odor control systems, the Medical City wastewater treatment plant can effectively mitigate odors, improve treatment efficiency, and maintain a healthy environment for the surrounding community and its operators.\n\nOngoing research and development in the field of odor control, as well as the sharing of experiences and best practices among wastewater treatment facilities in the region, will be essential for the continuous improvement of odor management strategies. The Medical City wastewater treatment plant can serve as a model for other facilities facing similar challenges, demonstrating the effectiveness of a comprehensive and targeted approach to odor control.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Optimizing aeration through the use of fine-bubble diffusers, high-efficiency blowers, and automated control systems can help minimize odor production and improve overall treatment performance.\n\n5. pH Control: Maintaining an optimal pH range in the aeration basins is essential for promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms and reducing the formation of odorous compounds. pH control can be achieved through the addition of alkaline or acidic chemicals, as well as the use of automated monitoring and dosing systems.\n\nCase studies supporting the effectiveness of these odor control strategies:\n\n- Al-Dewanyia WWTP, Iraq: Implemented a bio-trickling filter system for odor control in the headworks and primary clarifiers, resulting in a 90% reduction in H2S emissions (Al-Zubaidi et al., 2019).\n- Kabul WWTP, Afghanistan: Used a combination of bio-trickling filters and activated carbon adsorption for odor control in the sludge handling facility, achieving a 95% reduction in odorous compounds (Azimi et al., 2017).\n\n## 4. Innovative Solutions\nIn addition to the conventional odor control technologies, the Medical City wastewater treatment plant can consider implementing innovative solutions to further enhance odor management. One such solution is a closed-loop odor control system that captures and treats odorous air from the shaft before releasing it back into the treatment process. This approach can help minimize odor escape and improve overall treatment efficiency by containing and treating odorous emissions at the source.\n\nThe closed-loop system would involve the installation of air extraction units at key odor-generating locations within the shaft, such as the headworks, primary clarifiers, and sludge handling areas. The captured odorous air would then be directed to a centralized treatment unit, which could employ a combination of biofiltration, chemical scrubbing, and activated carbon adsorption to remove odorous compounds. The treated air would then be recirculated back into the shaft, creating a closed loop that minimizes odor escape and reduces the reliance on external odor control measures.\n\n## 5. Implementation Roadmap\nTo effectively implement the recommended odor control strategies at the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, a systematic approach should be followed. The implementation roadmap can be summarized in the following flowchart:\n\n1. Assess wastewater characteristics and identify key odor-impacting variables\n2. Determine the exceedance of odor-impacting variables compared to Iraqi government standards\n3. Prioritize odor control strategies based on the exceedance and the treatment stage\n4. Implement recommended odor control technologies:\n   - Biofiltration\n   - Chemical oxidation\n   - Scrubbers\n   - Aeration optimization\n   - pH control\n5. Consider innovative solutions like closed-loop odor control systems\n6. Monitor and optimize odor control performance based on key parameters and treatment efficiency\n\nThe first step in the implementation process is to thoroughly assess the wastewater characteristics and identify the key odor-impacting variables. This assessment will help prioritize the odor control strategies based on the exceedance of Iraqi government standards and the specific treatment stages where odors are most likely to occur.\n\nOnce the priorities have been established, the recommended odor control technologies can be implemented in a phased manner, starting with the most critical areas such as the headworks, primary clarifiers, and sludge handling facilities. Biofiltration, chemical oxidation, and scrubbers should be installed in these areas to address the high levels of BOD5, COD, and sulfates.\n\nIn the aeration basins, the focus should be on optimizing aeration and maintaining proper pH control to support efficient biological treatment and minimize odor production. Fine-bubble diffusers, high-efficiency blowers, and automated control systems can be installed to improve aeration performance.\n\nAlongside the conventional odor control technologies, the plant should consider implementing innovative solutions like the closed-loop odor control system. This system can be designed and installed in parallel with the other odor control measures, providing an additional layer of protection against odor escape.\n\nThroughout the implementation process, regular monitoring and optimization of the odor control systems should be carried out. Key parameters such as H2S levels, VOC concentrations, and treatment efficiency should be measured and analyzed to assess the performance of the odor control technologies. Based on the monitoring results, adjustments can be made to the system design, operating conditions, and chemical dosing rates to ensure optimal odor control performance.\n\n## 6.

Here is the revised section:\n\n## 2. Wastewater Characteristics and Odor-Impacting Variables\n\nThe wastewater at the Medical City treatment plant contains high levels of biodegradable organic matter, as indicated by the average BOD5 concentration of 206.59 mg/L and COD concentration of 667.14 mg/L, both of which significantly exceed the Iraqi government standards of 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L, respectively. These high levels of organic matter contribute to the production of odorous compounds during the wastewater treatment process.\n\nOther odor-impacting variables include sulfates (226.64 mg/L), which can lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide, and various heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, and lead. Although these variables are within the Iraqi government standards, they can still influence the odor generation potential and the efficiency of biological treatment processes.\n\nTable 1: Contaminant Odor Impact Assessment\n\n| Contaminant                         | Average Concentration | Odor Impact | Remarks                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)              | TBD                  | High        | Major contributor to \"rotten egg\" smell, prevalent in sulfide-rich wastewater |\n| Ammonia (NH3)                       | TBD                  | Moderate    | Causes sharp, pungent odors; often present in human waste                     |\n| Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)   | TBD                  | Varies      | Can include a range of organic chemicals with varying odor profiles           |\n\nTable 2: Comparison of Aerobic Treatment Technologies\n\n| Technology         | Efficacy in Reducing Sulfides/Ammonia | Ease of Maintenance | Self-Sustaining Aspects                                           |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Activated Sludge   | High                                  | Moderate            | Requires constant aeration but can be energy-efficient           |\n| Biofiltration      | High                                  | High                | Natural process; requires periodic media replacement             |\n| Aeration Systems   | High                                  | Moderate            | Effective in odor control; requires energy input                 |\n\nTable 3: Cost Comparison of Odor Control Technologies\n\n| Technology                 | Capital Cost | Operating Cost | Maintenance Cost |\n|----------------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Biofiltration              | Moderate     | Low            | Low              |\n| Chemical Scrubbers         | High         | High           | Moderate         |\n| Activated Carbon Filters   | Moderate     | Moderate       | Moderate         |\n| Aeration Optimization      | Low          | Moderate       | Low              |\n| pH Control                 | Low          | Low            | Low              |\n\nThe wastewater treatment process at the Medical City WWTP is designed as a 100-meter diameter circular shaft, with two primary shafts designated for specific stages of the treatment process.

Wastewater Treatment Process Description\nThe wastewater treatment process at the Medical City WWTP is designed as a 100-meter diameter circular shaft, with two primary shafts designated for specific stages of the treatment process.\n\n### Shaft 1: Primary Clarification\n- Wastewater from the city's sewage system enters this shaft.\n- Large settleable solids and particulate matter are removed through gravitational settling and mechanical screening.\n- The clarified water transitions to Shaft 2 for further treatment, while the removed solids are directed towards sludge processing.\n\n### Shaft 2: Activated Sludge and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)\n- Biological treatment occurs in this shaft using the activated sludge process to reduce organic content, BOD, and COD.\n- Microorganisms in the activated sludge break down the organic matter, converting it into more stable forms.\n- The wastewater undergoes dissolved air flotation, where fine particles are floated to the surface and skimmed off, reducing the levels of fine suspended solids and other contaminants.\n\n### Final Stages: Disinfection and Discharge\n- Post-clarification, the treated water undergoes disinfection, typically using sodium hypochlorite, to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms.\n- The treated and safe water is then discharged into the adjacent river, completing the purification cycle.\n\n### Sludge Processing:\n- Sludge collected from the primary clarification and excess biomass from the activated sludge process are treated separately.\n- They undergo thickening, dewatering, and potentially further stabilization processes before being repurposed or safely disposed of.\n\n## 4. Key Odor-Generating Areas and Recommended Control Technologies\n\n### Shaft 1: Primary Clarification\n- Odors may arise from the raw wastewater and the settled sludge.\n- Recommended odor control technologies: Biofiltration, Chemical Scrubbers\n\n### Shaft 2: Activated Sludge and DAF\n- Odors may be generated from the biological treatment process and the floating sludge.\n- Recommended odor control technologies: Aeration Optimization, Biofiltration\n\n### Sludge Processing:\n- Odors may be released during sludge thickening, dewatering, and stabilization.\n- Recommended odor control technologies: Biofiltration, Chemical Scrubbers, Activated Carbon Filters\n\n## 5. Implementation Plan\nThe implementation of the odor control strategy will be carried out in four phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Data Collection and Technology Selection\n- Collect data on the average concentrations of key odor-causing contaminants (hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and VOCs) in the wastewater.\n- Evaluate the suitability and cost-effectiveness of the recommended odor control technologies based on the collected data and the specific requirements of the Medical City WWTP.\n\n### Phase 2: Design and Procurement\n- Develop detailed designs for the selected odor control technologies, including sizing, layout, and integration with the existing treatment processes.\n- Procure the necessary equipment, materials, and services for the installation of the odor control systems.\n\n### Phase 3: Installation and Commissioning\n- Install the odor control systems in the designated areas of the treatment plant, following the designed plans and specifications.\n- Commission the installed systems to ensure proper functionality and performance, making any necessary adjustments or optimizations.\n\n### Phase 4: Monitoring and Optimization\n- Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to track the performance of the odor control systems and the overall odor levels in and around the treatment plant.\n- Continuously optimize the odor control systems based on the monitoring results, ensuring efficient and effective odor mitigation.\n- Provide regular training to the plant operators to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the odor control systems.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe proposed odor control strategy for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant, based on a thorough analysis of the wastewater characteristics, odor-impacting variables, and the treatment process, offers a targeted approach to effectively mitigate odors. By implementing the recommended odor control technologies, such as biofiltration, chemical scrubbers, activated carbon filters, aeration optimization, and pH control, in the key odor-generating areas, the plant can significantly reduce odor emissions and improve the environmental quality for the surrounding community. The four-phase implementation plan provides a structured approach to ensure the successful execution of the odor control strategy, from data collection and technology selection to installation, commissioning, monitoring, and optimization. With the proper implementation and ongoing management of the odor control systems, the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant can become a model for effective odor management in urban wastewater treatment facilities.",

Although these variables are within the Iraqi government standards, they can still influence the odor generation potential and the efficiency of biological treatment processes.\n\n### Table 1: Contaminant Odor Impact Assessment\n| Contaminant                         | Average Concentration | Odor Impact | Remarks                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)              | TBD                  | High        | Major contributor to \"rotten egg\" smell, prevalent in sulfide-rich wastewater |\n| Ammonia (NH3)                       | TBD                  | Moderate    | Causes sharp, pungent odors; often present in human waste                     |\n| Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)   | TBD                  | Varies      | Can include a range of organic chemicals with varying odor profiles           |\n\n### Table 2: Comparison of Aerobic Treatment Technologies\n| Technology         | Efficacy in Reducing Sulfides/Ammonia | Ease of Maintenance | Self-Sustaining Aspects                                           |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Activated Sludge   | High                                  | Moderate            | Requires constant aeration but can be energy-efficient           |\n| Biofiltration      | High                                  | High                | Natural process; requires periodic media replacement             |\n| Aeration Systems   | High                                  | Moderate            | Effective in odor control; requires energy input                 |\n\n### Table 3: Cost Comparison of Odor Control Technologies\n| Technology                 | Capital Cost | Operating Cost | Maintenance Cost |\n|----------------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Biofiltration              | Moderate     | Low            | Low              |\n| Chemical Scrubbers         | High         | High           | Moderate         |\n| Activated Carbon Filters   | Moderate     | Moderate       | Moderate         |\n| Aeration Optimization      | Low          | Moderate       | Low              |\n| pH Control                 | Low          | Low            | Low              |\n\n## 3. Wastewater Treatment Process Description\nThe wastewater treatment process at the Medical City WWTP is designed as a 100-meter diameter circular shaft, with two primary shafts designated for specific stages of the treatment process.\n\n### Shaft 1: Primary Clarification\n- Wastewater from the city's sewage system enters this shaft.\n- Large settleable solids and particulate matter are removed through gravitational settling and mechanical screening.\n- The clarified water transitions to Shaft 2 for further treatment, while the removed solids are directed towards sludge processing.\n\n### Shaft 2: Activated Sludge and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)\n- Biological treatment occurs in this shaft using the activated sludge process to reduce organic content, BOD, and COD.\n- Microorganisms in the activated sludge break down the organic matter, converting it into more stable forms.\n- The wastewater undergoes dissolved air flotation, where fine particles are floated to the surface and skimmed off, reducing the levels of fine suspended solids and other contaminants.\n\n### Final Stages: Disinfection and Discharge\n- Post-clarification, the treated water undergoes disinfection, typically using sodium hypochlorite, to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms.\n- The treated and safe water is then discharged into the adjacent river, completing the purification cycle.\n\n### Sludge Processing:\n- Sludge collected from the primary clarification and excess biomass from the activated sludge process are treated separately.\n- They undergo thickening, dewatering, and potentially further stabilization processes before being repurposed or safely disposed of.\n\n## 4. Key Odor-Generating Areas and Recommended Control Technologies\n\n### Shaft 1: Primary Clarification\n- Odors may arise from the raw wastewater and the settled sludge.\n- Recommended odor control technologies: Biofiltration, Chemical Scrubbers\n\n### Shaft 2: Activated Sludge and DAF\n- Odors may be generated from the biological treatment process and the floating sludge.\n- Recommended odor control technologies: Aeration Optimization, Biofiltration\n\n### Sludge Processing:\n- Odors may be released during sludge thickening, dewatering, and stabilization.\n- Recommended odor control technologies: Biofiltration, Chemical Scrubbers, Activated Carbon Filters\n\n## 5. Implementation Plan\nThe implementation of the odor control strategy will be carried out in four phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Data Collection and Technology Selection\n- Collect data on the average concentrations of key odor-causing contaminants (hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and VOCs) in the wastewater.\n- Evaluate the suitability and cost-effectiveness of the recommended odor control technologies based on the collected data and the specific requirements of the Medical City WWTP.\n\n### Phase 2: Design and Procurement\n- Develop detailed designs for the selected odor control technologies, including sizing, layout, and integration with the existing treatment processes.\n- Procure the necessary equipment, materials, and services for the installation of the odor control systems.\n\n### Phase 3: Installation and Commissioning\n- Install the odor control systems in the designated areas of the treatment plant, following the designed plans and specifications.\n- Commission the installed systems to ensure proper functionality and performance, making any necessary adjustments or optimizations.\n\n### Phase 4: Monitoring and Optimization\n- Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to track the performance of the odor control systems and the overall odor levels in and around the treatment plant.\n- Continuously optimize the odor control systems based on the monitoring results, ensuring efficient and effective odor mitigation.\n- Provide regular training to the plant operators to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the odor control systems.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\nThe proposed odor control strategy for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant, based on a thorough analysis of the wastewater characteristics, odor-impacting variables, and the treatment process, offers a targeted approach to effectively mitigate odors. By implementing the recommended odor control technologies, such as biofiltration, chemical scrubbers, activated carbon filters, aeration optimization, and pH control, in the key odor-generating areas, the plant can significantly reduce odor emissions and improve the environmental quality for the surrounding community. The four-phase implementation plan provides a structured approach to ensure the successful execution of the odor control strategy, from data collection and technology selection to installation, commissioning, monitoring, and optimization. With the proper implementation and ongoing management of the odor control systems, the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant can become a model for effective odor management in urban wastewater treatment facilities.",

Introduction\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq, is a critical facility serving the healthcare complex and surrounding areas. With a daily wastewater flow rate of 150,000 m³, effective odor control is essential to maintain a healthy and pleasant environment for the community and the plant's operators. This research document aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant, considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local regulations, and available technologies.\n2. Wastewater Characteristics and Odor Sources\nThe Medical City wastewater treatment plant receives a daily flow of 150,000 m³, containing various odor-causing compounds. According to the provided data, the average BOD5 concentration is 206.59 mg/L, and the average COD concentration is 667.14 mg/L. These values indicate a relatively high organic loading, which can contribute to odor generation.\nThe main potential odor sources within the plant include:\nHeadworks (screens, grit removal)\nPrimary clarifiers\nAeration basins\nSludge handling and treatment units\nThe site-specific wastewater characteristics, such as temperature (ranging from 15°C to 35°C), pH (average 7.71), and organic loading, can significantly impact odor generation. Higher temperatures and organic loading can increase odor generation, while fluctuations in pH can promote the formation of odorous compounds like hydrogen sulfide.\n3. Odor Control Regulations and Standards\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Environment is responsible for setting and enforcing environmental regulations, including those related to odor emissions from wastewater treatment plants. The National Environmental Strategy and Action Plan for Iraq (2013-2017) highlights the need for developing and implementing odor control regulations.\nIn the absence of specific local standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for odor management in wastewater treatment plants can be used as a reference to establish performance targets for the odor control system.\n4. Odor Control Technologies\nBased on the provided data and the specific conditions at the Medical City site, a mixed-methods approach combining biological and chemical treatment technologies is recommended for effective odor control.\n4.1 Biofilters\nBiofilters are a suitable option for treating odorous air from the headworks, primary clarifiers, and sludge handling areas. The pilot study data can be used to size the biofilter based on the expected odor loads and removal efficiencies. Locally sourced materials, such as reed from the famous marshes in Iraq, can be used as the filter media to minimize the need for imported materials.\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biofilters include:\nMedia type and depth\nAirflow rate and empty bed residence time (EBRT)\nMoisture content and pH control\nNutrient supply and irrigation system\n4.2 Biotrickling Filters\nBiotrickling filters can be used to treat high-concentration odorous air streams from the aeration basins and secondary clarifiers. The pilot study data can inform the design of the biotrickling filter, including media selection, airflow rates, and pH control.\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for biotrickling filters include:\nMedia type and surface area\nAirflow rate and EBRT\nNutrient solution composition and flow rate\npH control and monitoring\nBiomass control and removal\n4.3 Chemical Scrubbers\nChemical scrubbers can be employed as polishing steps for the biofilter and biotrickling filter systems, especially during high-temperature periods or upset conditions. The high temperatures in Baghdad (up to 49°C in hot seasons) may necessitate the use of chemical scrubbers to ensure consistent odor removal performance.\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for chemical scrubbers include:\nScrubber type (packed tower, spray tower, or venturi)\nChemical selection and concentration\nAirflow rate and contact time\npH control and monitoring\nCorrosion-resistant materials and equipment\n4.4 Activated Carbon Adsorption\nActivated carbon adsorption can be used as a final polishing step for the treated air stream, particularly for removing any residual volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or other odorous compounds not effectively removed by the biological and chemical treatment processes.\nDesign considerations and sizing criteria for activated carbon adsorption systems include:\nCarbon type and quality\nAirflow rate and contact time\nRelative humidity and temperature\nPretreatment for dust and moisture removal\nCarbon replacement or regeneration frequency\n5. Recommendations for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant\nBased on the analysis of the wastewater characteristics, local conditions, and available odor control technologies, the following recommendations are made for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant:\nImplement a two-stage odor control system consisting of biofilters followed by biotrickling filters to treat odorous air from the headworks, primary clarifiers, aeration basins, and sludge handling areas. Use locally sourced reed as the biofilter media to minimize the need for imported materials.\nInstall chemical scrubbers as a polishing step for the biofilter and biotrickling filter systems to ensure consistent odor removal performance during high-temperature periods or upset conditions.\nConsider the use of activated carbon adsorption as a final polishing step for the treated air stream to remove any residual odorous compounds.\nOptimize the aeration basin design and operation based on the pilot study data to minimize odor stripping. This may involve adjusting airflow rates, diffuser placement, or using high-efficiency diffusers.\nImplement proper sludge handling procedures, such as minimizing sludge storage times and using enclosed systems for thickening and dewatering, to reduce odor generation from these processes.\nMonitor and control pH levels throughout the treatment process based on the pilot study data to minimize odor generation from hydrogen sulfide and other odorous compounds.\nDevelop a comprehensive odor monitoring and management plan that includes regular odor surveys, complaint response procedures, and continuous improvement strategies based on performance data and feedback from the community and plant operators.\n6. Conclusion\nThis research document has provided a comprehensive analysis of odor control strategies suitable for the Medical City wastewater treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraq. By considering site-specific wastewater characteristics, local conditions, and available technologies, a mixed-methods approach combining biological and chemical treatment processes has been recommended to effectively control odors and maintain a healthy environment for the community and plant operators.\nImplementing the recommended odor control strategies will require careful design, sizing, and integration with the existing treatment processes. Regular monitoring, performance evaluation, and continuous improvement will be essential to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the odor control system and minimize the impact on the surrounding community.\nReferences\nMetcalf & Eddy, Inc.

Wastewater Characteristics and Odor-Impacting Variables\nThe wastewater at the Medical City treatment plant contains high levels of biodegradable organic matter, as indicated by the average BOD5 concentration of 206.59 mg/L and COD concentration of 667.14 mg/L, both of which significantly exceed the Iraqi government standards of 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L, respectively. These high levels of organic matter contribute to the production of odorous compounds during the wastewater treatment process.\nOther odor-impacting variables include sulfates (226.64 mg/L), which can lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide, and various heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, and lead. Although these variables are within the Iraqi government standards, they can still influence the odor generation potential and the efficiency of biological treatment\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Contaminant Odor Impact Assessment\nContaminant\nAverage Concentration\nOdor Impact\nRemarks\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S)\nTBD\nHigh\nMajor contributor to \"rotten egg\" smell, prevalent in sulfide-rich wastewater\nAmmonia (NH3)\nTBD\nModerate\nCauses sharp, pungent odors; often present in human waste\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)\nTBD\nVaries\nCan include a range of organic chemicals with varying odor profiles\n\n\nTable 2: Comparison of Aerobic Treatment Technologies\nTechnology\nEfficacy in Reducing Sulfides/Ammonia\nEase of Maintenance\nSelf-Sustaining Aspects\nActivated Sludge\nHigh\nModerate\nRequires constant aeration but can be energy-efficient\nBiofiltration\nHigh\nHigh\nNatural process; requires periodic media replacement\nAeration Systems\nHigh\nModerate\nEffective in odor control; requires energy input\n\n\nTable 3: Cost Comparison of Odor Control Technologies\nTechnology\nCapital Cost\nOperating Cost\nMaintenance Cost\nBiofiltration\nModerate\nLow\nLow\nChemical Scrubbers\nHigh\nHigh\nModerate\nActivated Carbon Filters\nModerate\nModerate\nModerate\nAeration Optimization\nLow\nModerate\nLow\npH Control\nLow\nLow\nLow\n\n\nContaminant\nLikely Targeted Treatment Stage\nBOD5\nPrimary clarifiers, Aeration basins\nTSS\nPrimary clarifiers, Secondary clarifiers\nAmmonia\nAeration basins, Secondary clarifiers\nPhosphorus\nAeration basins, Secondary clarifiers\nNitrate\nAeration basins, Secondary clarifiers\nSulfate\nPrimary clarifiers, Aeration basins\nHeavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn)\nPrimary clarifiers, Secondary clarifiers, Sludge handling\nVOCs\nHeadworks, Primary clarifiers, Aeration basins\n\n\n\nGaps in the contamination treatment process: Based on the provided data and the Iraqi government standards, there might be potential gaps in the treatment of certain contaminants, such as:\nAmmonia: The average ammonia concentration in the wastewater (15 mg/L) exceeds the Iraqi standard of 10 mg/L. This may require optimization of the nitrification process in the aeration basins and secondary clarifiers.\nHeavy metals: The average concentrations of cadmium, copper, and lead in the wastewater exceed the Iraqi standards. Additional treatment steps, such as chemical precipitation or adsorption, may be necessary to remove these metals and meet the discharge requirements.\nPhosphorus: The average phosphorus concentration in the wastewater (6 mg/L) is higher than the Iraqi standard of 3 mg/L. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal or chemical precipitation may be needed to achieve the required level of phosphorus removal.\nAddressing these gaps in the treatment process can help improve the overall contaminant removal efficiency and reduce the potential for odor generation.\n\n\n\n\nFrom: The Detailed Design Study for the Sewerage Construction Project in Kurdistan Region (I)\n\nNote excerpt from: From: The Detailed Design Study for the Sewerage Construction Project in Kurdistan Region (I)\n\n5.4.4 Odour Control\nMajor strong odour sources in the WWTP are sludge treatment process and grit chamber at which screenings containing garbage and other organics are separated from wastewater. Further, medium odour generates from distribution chamber and primary sedimentation tanks. On the other hand, aeration tanks by conventional activated sludge process generates little odour on account of BOD-SS load and degradation of organic matter by micro-organisms under aerobic conditions.\nWET note: It appears that the aeration tanks might not have a lot of odor production because it’s already degraded by microorganisms in aerobic conditions. Can we find any research on this and to identify odor measures?\n\nSteve’s Odor Control in the original proposal:\n\n\n6-6 Odor Control\nOdor control on this project will be provided by enclosing the headworks and sludge dewatering equipment in the headworks building.  Shaft 1 will also be covered.  Fresh air for these enclosed areas will be provided and form the input to the activated sludge aeration compressors.  This will result in the odors emanating from these enclosed portions of the plant to be deodorized by the mixed liquor. Odor is one of the negative impacts of any wastewater treatment facility and especially in congested areas like the Medical Center area.  Because of the compact nature of the Treatment Shaft and the facility is not spread out and limited to only a few structures, providing cover for the facility is an effective way of controlling odor emission.  Air ventilation from the space below the cover will reduce odor escaping outside.  Exhaust air will be directed to the air blower for the aeriation chamber for treatment.  \n\n“Roots of reeds release O2 into the bed matrix, promoting\naerobic conditions for nitrification to occur (Browning et al.,\n2002). The roots may also release exudates that support the\ngrowth of microorganisms, and antibiotics that kill pathogens\n(Brix, 1994 and Vymazal et al., 1998).\n“\nReed bed accompanying process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosorb alt:\n\n\nProject Overview: We are seeking a researcher to help polish and refine an odor control strategy document for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad, Iraq. The document aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of wastewater characteristics, odor-impacting variables, and the treatment process, and propose targeted odor control solutions to mitigate odors effectively. It should include the current practices and add some novel techniques from the research literature, especially focusing on dry weather treatment plant processes that utilize local and natural methods for odor management. For instance in Iraq there are reeds and marshlands that we can leverage.\n\nKey Sections to be Covered:\nIntroduction\nWastewater Characteristics and Odor-Impacting Variables\nWastewater Treatment Process Description\nKey Odor-Generating Areas and Recommended Control Technologies\nImplementation Plan\nConclusion\nRequirements:\nThe document should be written in fluent English using a professional and technical writing style, removing unnecessary language and “AI written” content.\nThe final document should be well-structured, coherent, and easy to understand for a target audience of wastewater treatment professionals and decision-makers.\nThe researcher would benefit from a background in environmental engineering, wastewater treatment, or a related field.\nTimeline:\nThe project is expected to be completed within a week from the date of assignment. \nA draft of the polished document should be submitted for review within the first few days organizing and structuring the document and suggesting a writing approach.\nDeliverables:\nDay 1-3: Structured, deduplicated document with suggested editing plan\nWeek 1 conclusion: Document with one review, including novel methods from research literature. \nEnding with a polished, well-structured, and coherent odor control strategy document in google docs format.\nA brief summary of the changes and improvements made to the original document.\nSuccess Criteria:\nThe final document should effectively communicate the process, Iraqi conditions and how they impact odor control, traditional and novel odor control strategies aligned with the current process. \nIt should be free of errors, and meet the specified requirements and objectives.\n\n\nIf you have any additional information or specific requirements for the project, please include them in your proposal.

Wastewater Characteristics and Odor-Impacting Variables\n\nThe wastewater received by the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant has unique characteristics that contribute to the generation of odorous compounds during the treatment process.

The wastewater characteristics are as follows:\n\n- Average BOD5 concentration: 206.59 mg/L\n- Average COD concentration: 667.14 mg/L\n- Average TSS concentration: 200 mg/L\n- Average Ammonia concentration: 15 mg/L\n- Average Phosphorus concentration: 6 mg/L\n- pH range: 7.41 - 7.91 (average 7.71)\n- Temperature range: 15°C - 35°C\n\nThese values indicate a relatively high organic loading in the wastewater, which can contribute to the production of odorous compounds during the treatment process. The high BOD5 and COD concentrations, in particular, significantly exceed the Iraqi government standards of 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L, respectively.\n\n## 2.2 Odor-Impacting Variables\n\nIn addition to the general wastewater characteristics, several specific contaminants and variables have a significant impact on odor generation:\n\n### 2.2.1 Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)\nHydrogen sulfide is a major contributor to the \"rotten egg\" smell commonly associated with wastewater treatment plants. It is prevalent in sulfide-rich wastewater and is formed under anaerobic conditions. The average concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant is currently unknown and needs to be determined through sampling and analysis.\n\n### 2.2.2 Ammonia (NH3)\nAmmonia is another important odor-causing compound, often present in human waste. It causes sharp, pungent odors and can be a significant contributor to overall odor levels. The average ammonia concentration in the wastewater is 15 mg/L, which exceeds the Iraqi government standard of 10 mg/L.\n\n### 2.2.3 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)\nVOCs are a diverse group of organic chemicals that can have varying odor profiles. They can be present in both domestic and medical wastewater and contribute to the overall odor levels. The specific VOCs and their concentrations in the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant need to be determined through targeted sampling and analysis.\n\n### 2.2.4 Sulfates (SO42-)\nSulfates can contribute to the formation of hydrogen sulfide under anaerobic conditions. The average sulfate concentration in the wastewater is 226.64 mg/L, which is within the Iraqi government standard of 400 mg/L. However, even at these levels, sulfates can still contribute to odor generation.\n\n### 2.2.5 Other Variables\nOther variables that can impact odor generation include:\n- Temperature: Higher temperatures can increase the rate of biological activity and odor generation.\n- pH: pH levels outside the optimal range can affect the growth and activity of odor-producing microorganisms.\n- Dissolved oxygen: Low dissolved oxygen levels can promote anaerobic conditions, leading to the formation of odorous compounds.\n\n## 2.3 Gaps in the Contamination Treatment Process\n\nBased on the provided data and the Iraqi government standards, there are potential gaps in the treatment of certain contaminants that can impact odor generation:\n\n1. **Ammonia**: The average ammonia concentration in the wastewater (15 mg/L) exceeds the Iraqi standard of 10 mg/L. This may require optimization of the nitrification process in the aeration basins and secondary clarifiers to effectively remove ammonia and prevent odor generation.\n\n2. **Heavy metals**: The average concentrations of cadmium, copper, and lead in the wastewater exceed the Iraqi standards. While these metals do not directly contribute to odor generation, their presence can inhibit the activity of odor-degrading microorganisms and affect the overall treatment efficiency. Additional treatment steps, such as chemical precipitation or adsorption, may be necessary to remove these metals and ensure optimal odor control performance.\n\n3. **Phosphorus**: The average phosphorus concentration in the wastewater (6 mg/L) is higher than the Iraqi standard of 3 mg/L. Excess phosphorus can lead to the growth of algae and other microorganisms, which can contribute to odor generation. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal or chemical precipitation may be needed to achieve the required level of phosphorus removal and minimize odor issues.\n\nAddressing these gaps in the treatment process can help improve the overall contaminant removal efficiency, reduce the potential for odor generation, and ensure compliance with local regulations. By targeting these specific contaminants and optimizing the treatment processes, the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant can effectively mitigate odors and maintain a pleasant environment for the surrounding community.",

Wastewater Characteristics and Odor-Impacting Variables\nThe wastewater at the Medical City treatment plant contains high levels of biodegradable organic matter, as indicated by the average BOD5 concentration of 206.59 mg/L and COD concentration of 667.14 mg/L, both of which significantly exceed the Iraqi government standards of 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L, respectively. These high levels of organic matter contribute to the production of odorous compounds during the wastewater treatment process.\nOther odor-impacting variables include sulfates (226.64 mg/L), which can lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide, and various heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, and lead. Although these variables are within the Iraqi government standards, they can still influence the odor generation potential and the efficiency of biological treatment\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Contaminant Odor Impact Assessment\nContaminant\nAverage Concentration\nOdor Impact\nRemarks\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S)\nTBD\nHigh\nMajor contributor to \"rotten egg\" smell, prevalent in sulfide-rich wastewater\nAmmonia (NH3)\nTBD\nModerate\nCauses sharp, pungent odors; often present in human waste\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)\nTBD\nVaries\nCan include a range of organic chemicals with varying odor profiles\n\n\nTable 2: Comparison of Aerobic Treatment Technologies\nTechnology\nEfficacy in Reducing Sulfides/Ammonia\nEase of Maintenance\nSelf-Sustaining Aspects\nActivated Sludge\nHigh\nModerate\nRequires constant aeration but can be energy-efficient\nBiofiltration\nHigh\nHigh\nNatural process; requires periodic media replacement\nAeration Systems\nHigh\nModerate\nEffective in odor control; requires energy input\n\n\nTable 3: Cost Comparison of Odor Control Technologies\nTechnology\nCapital Cost\nOperating Cost\nMaintenance Cost\nBiofiltration\nModerate\nLow\nLow\nChemical Scrubbers\nHigh\nHigh\nModerate\nActivated Carbon Filters\nModerate\nModerate\nModerate\nAeration Optimization\nLow\nModerate\nLow\npH Control\nLow\nLow\nLow\n\n\nContaminant\nLikely Targeted Treatment Stage\nBOD5\nPrimary clarifiers, Aeration basins\nTSS\nPrimary clarifiers, Secondary clarifiers\nAmmonia\nAeration basins, Secondary clarifiers\nPhosphorus\nAeration basins, Secondary clarifiers\nNitrate\nAeration basins, Secondary clarifiers\nSulfate\nPrimary clarifiers, Aeration basins\nHeavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn)\nPrimary clarifiers, Secondary clarifiers, Sludge handling\nVOCs\nHeadworks, Primary clarifiers, Aeration basins\n\n\n\nGaps in the contamination treatment process: Based on the provided data and the Iraqi government standards, there might be potential gaps in the treatment of certain contaminants, such as:\nAmmonia: The average ammonia concentration in the wastewater (15 mg/L) exceeds the Iraqi standard of 10 mg/L.

Summary\nIn this study, an attempt was made to evaluate the physico-chemical parameters of domestic wastewater quality before application of vetiver for wastewater treatment and the possibility\n40\nof vetiver grass in treating domestic wastewater using hydroponic technique in the HU main campus.\nThe physico-chemical parameter results obtained before application of vetiver for wastewater treatment were 19.68  0.41-20.69  1 oC, 6.73  0.33-7.57  0.31 units, 2496.67  235- 3470220 μS/cm, 0.540.02-0.800.02 mg/l, 98020-1026.6741 mg/l, 1226.4024- 1285.20  51 mg/l, 120.96  3-154.56  1 mg/l and 26.03  0.23-31.02  0.45 mg/l, respectively, for temperature, pH, EC, DO, BOD5, COD, TN and TP. These results showed that except temperature and pH all parameters measured were above standard maximum discharge permissible limit value set out by EEPA. The presence of above limit values of nutrients (noticeably nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic matter (measured as a BOD5 and COD) in wastewater discharging can be undesirable because they have ecological impact and can affect public health. As result, biological wastewater treatment method known as phyto- remediation of hydroponic vetiver treatment of domestic wastewater was carried out.\nAn experiment was conducted to assess the effect of vetiver grass growing under hydroponic with no supporting medium to treat the domestic wastewater released to Haramaya University farm, which had been primarily treated in septic tank. The field experiment was assigned in plastic containers of thirty liters which were set-up simultaneously with planted vetiver hydroponically and no plant as a control, which replicated three times in three containers. Treatments started when vetiver was five months old. Water samples were taken for analysis at weekly interval for eight weeks and examined for different water quality parameters during the time of experiment.\nSample results of the analysis of variance after eight weeks of hydroponic vetiver treatment showed that the overall concentration of BOD5, COD, TN, TP and EC were significantly (p<0.0001) decreased from 1026.67±41 to 80.00±20 mg/l, from 1285.20±51 to 101.40±25 mg/l, from 154.56±1 to 13.64±0.11 mg/l, from 31.02±0.45 to 4.12±0.11 mg/l and from 3470.00±220 to 966.67±23 μS/cm, respectively. The removal efficiencies were observed to be 92.21%, 92.11%, 91.17%, 86.72% and 72.14%, respectively, for BOD5, COD, TN, TP and EC parameters. After eight weeks hydroponic vetiver treatment of domestic wastewater, the\n41\n\ncontents of pollutants appreciably decreased, and almost all of them were below maximum permissible discharge limit values with the exception of BOD5 (EEPA, 2003). This indicates that the treatment efficiency of vetiver was outstanding, from the lowest, 72.14% for EC to the highest, 92.21% for BOD5. However, as compare to other studies which had soils as media, vetiver showed a good potential to be used in situ to treat domestic wastewater.\nGenerally the hydroponic technique with no supporting medium vetiver treatment of domestic wastewater was exposed and found that the effect of vetiver treatment system was gradually increased with treatment time. This was obviously associated with gradual growth and development of vetiver resulting in a gradual increase of biomass, and also it gradually adapted itself to the wastewater environment. It is positive, therefore, that the treatment possibility of vetiver in domestic wastewater became stronger and stronger as vetiver grew.\n5.2. Conclusions\nBased on the results reported and discussed in the preceding section, the following conclusions are drawn:\nThe status of the wastewater disposal at Haramaya University exceeds the allowable limit set by EEPA (2003) with the exceptions of temperature and pH.\nVetiver grass, growing under hydroponic with no supporting medium, can effectively remove organic matter and nutrient from domestic wastewater.\nThe potential of vetiver after eight weeks hydroponic treatment was found to be efficient for the removal of chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorous and electrical conductivity from domestic wastewater. However, it was not observed to be efficient for the treatment of biochemical oxygen demand.\n5.3. Recommendations\n   42\n\nFrom the results obtained and the challenges faced during the experiment period, the following recommendation and future research direction are forwarded:\nThe application of vetiver for wastewater treatment is enormous. This study however, highlights one feature of hydroponic technique which emphasizes it’s potential to domestic wastewater treatment. Its real potential is still not achieved. Thus, an intensive research should go to its extraordinary application for wastewater treatment.\nThe hydroponic vetiver removal efficiency of wastewater is affected by concentration or sources of wastewater, configuration of hydroponic vetiver set-up (in an open space and/or green house), HRT, temperature, treatment time, etc. This study showed that the removal efficiency of open space configuration hydroponic vetiver set-up to treat domestic wastewater without changing or supplementing the wastewater throughout the study period. Therefore, further study should be accomplished hydroponically to investigate its potential for wastewater treatment at green house with different HRT and evaluate its effectiveness in treating wastewater of different concentration just to name a few.\nIn this study the concentration of biodegradable biochemical oxygen demand in the treated wastewater is above the discharge limits set by Ethiopian Environmental Quality Standard for textile effluent. Therefore, further studies should be conducted to investigate how long it will take vetiver to hydroponically treat wastewater at least all pollutants are in line with permissible limit values, and to note management issues that must be addressed if hydroponic vetiver treatment wastewater is to be a viable alternative to discharge the University farm with treated domestic wastewater in an environmental friendly way.\nBased on many studies reported, the nutrient accumulation in the vetiver biomass received wastewater is different. So, additional research regarding degree of nutrient accumulation in roots and shoots biomass of vetiver should be done.\nThe study was conducted within limited observation time of only two months. It may lack comprehensiveness. Hence, further studies should be conducted in different seasons considering other wastewater quality parameters including heavy metals.\n     43\n\nIn short, the preliminary results of this experiment showed that the University should retain its wastewater at least for two months in the oxidation pond before discharging into the nearby creek daily.\nEven though the introduction of vetiver grass in Ethiopia is almost 39 years old, its various applications including for natural disaster reduction (flood, landslide, road batter failure, river bank etc.) and environmental protection (treatment of solid and liquid waste and soil and water conservation etc.) purposes are poorly studied. This is mainly due to lack of experts for proper technical application in vetiver technology promotion and lack of proper networking as well as the flow of information among the users of the technologies. Therefore, a great deal of research should be done in such diverse environment."

This program is commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).\nThe ecological sanitation (ecosan) approach is able to address both: child health which needs to be improved through better household sanitation and wastewater treatment, and sustainable management and safe recycling of important resources such as water and nutrients.\nIt is a positive development that more and more people are now becoming aware of the present worldwide sanitation crisis which is killing thousands of young children each day. A major reason is the large amount of excreta and untreated wastewater discharged into surface waters and polluting the groundwater.\nConstructed wetlands are flexible systems which can be used for single households or for entire communities. Also, due to climate change, more and more regions are experiencing droughts or flooding. Hence, water recycling as well as resilient technologies are key aspects to adapt to these effects of climate change.\nBased also on our own past experiences with constructed wetlands in diverse countries such as the Philippines, Syria and Albania, we consider constructed wetlands as a suitable technology for sustainable wastewater management. I am sure this technology review will inspire people working on such solutions.

On the other hand VFBs require interval loading (4-8 times per day) which needs more design know-how, whereas HFBs receive wastewater continuously. HFBs are easier to design and are currently more common in developing countries than VFBs.\nFor municipal wastewater treatment the “French System” for combined raw wastewater pre-treatment and secondary treatment is an interesting option. This system uses VFBs in two separate process stages and requires no additional pre- treatment step.\nThe apparent simplicity of CWs often leads to the false assumption that this technology does not need specialised design knowledge nor regular maintenance. In fact, most CWs which show poor treatment performance had design flaws or lack of maintenance. The most important maintenance tasks include regular checking of the efficiency of the pre-treatment process, of pumps, of influent load and distribution on the filter bed. The actions required to prevent clogging of the filter bed are also explained in this document.\n1 Summary\n Constructed wetlands (CWs) can be used as part of decentralised wastewater treatment systems and are a robust and “low tech” technology with low operational requirements. CWs can be used for the treatment of various types of wastewater, and play an important role in many ecological sanitation (ecosan) concepts.\nThere are many different types of CWs designed for a variety of wastewater types. This publication deals only with subsurface flow constructed wetlands with a substrate of coarse sand for treatment of greywater, domestic or municipal wastewater in developing countries and countries in transition. Subsurface flow CWs are reliable treatment systems with very high treatment efficiencies for the removal of organic matter and pathogens, as well as for nutrients.\nThe treatment process of CWs is based on a number of biological and physical processes such as adsorption, precipitation, filtration, nitrification, decomposition, etc. The most important process is the biological filtration by a biofilm composed of aerobic and facultative bacteria. The efficiency of the aerobic treatment processes depends on the ratio between oxygen demand (i.e. load) and oxygen supply which is determined by the design of the CW. Professionals with knowledge of wastewater treatment systems are needed to design these biologically complex systems.\nFurthermore the planning always has to consider the specific local circumstances, such as temperature, land availability and the intended reuse or disposal of the treated wastewater.\n Constructed wetlands can be considered as a secondary treatment step since suspended solids, larger particles including toilet paper and other rubbish as well as some organic matter need to be removed before wastewater can be treated in subsurface flow CWs. Pre-treatment is extremely important to avoid clogging of subsurface flow CWs, which is an obstruction of the free pore spaces due to accumulation of solids.\n• Sand and grit removal\n• Grease trap\n• Compost filter (for small scale-systems)\n• Septic tank\n• Baffled tank (or anaerobic baffled reactor)\n• Imhoff tank\n• Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor (only\nused for large-scale systems)\nThis publication intends to spread awareness and knowledge about subsurface flow constructed wetlands in developing countries and countries in transition.\n2 Introduction\n2.1 Target audience\nThe target audience for this publication are people with some basic technical background who:\n• want to obtain an overview of subsurface flow CWs, their\ndesigns, performance and maintenance requirements;\n• want to understand whether subsurface flow CWs could be a possible option for a given wastewater treatment\nproblem;\n• work with consultants who are designing CWs and thus\nneed to be able to ask the right questions;\n• have an interest in sustainable sanitation solutions for\ndeveloping countries and countries in transition.\n2.2 Scope of this document\nThis document focuses on treating domestic/municipal wastewater or greywater with subsurface flow constructed wetlands with coarse sand as a filter medium. The emphasis is on the application in developing countries and countries in transition (with a moderate to warm climate), although constructed wetlands can in principle be used in all types of countries and climates.\nThis document is not a design manual. An experienced expert should always be consulted for the design of constructed wetlands.\nConstructed wetlands are generally used as a decentralised wastewater treatment process. They are used as a secondary treatment process which means that the wastewater is treated in a primary treatment step before entering the CW filter bed; except for the “French System” which works without primary treatment.\n The main pre-treatment technologies which are used upstream of the CW filter bed are:\n The issue of unintended biogas generation and lack of biogas capture from the pre-treatment units is discussed in this document. While use or flaring of biogas is very desirable for climate protection reasons, this is unfortunately often not economically feasible in practice for small-scale systems.\nCWs lose their treatment capacity when they are overloaded for an extended period of time. Short loading peaks on the other hand do not cause performance problems. Overloading\n may occur if the pre-treatment system fails and suspended solids, sludge or fats pass into the CW.\nSubsurface flow CWs can be designed with vertical or horizontal flow. Vertical flow beds (VFBs) have a higher treatment efficiency and less area requirement compared to\n 8\n \n This document provides an overview and basic guidance on the design and maintenance of horizontal flow beds (HFBs), vertical flow beds (VFBs) and the “French System”. It also includes a description of the most common pre-treatment systems due to their vital importance for the proper functioning of CWs.\n2.3 Definition and terminology\nConstructed wetlands (CWs) are ‘‘engineered systems, designed and constructed to utilise the natural functions of wetland vegetation, soils and their microbial populations to treat contaminants in surface water, groundwater or waste streams” (ITRC, 2003).\nSynonymous terms of CWs include: Man-made, engineered, artificial or treatment wetlands.\nThere are also a number of terms used for subsurface flow CWs, which can be confusing for novices:\n• Planted soil filters: Their vegetation is composed of\nmacrophyte plants from natural wetlands and this sets them apart from the unplanted soil filters, also called subsurface biofilters, percolation beds, infiltration beds or intermittent sand filters.\n• Reed bed treatment system: A term used in Europe resulting from the fact that the most frequently used plant species is the common reed (Phragmites australis).\n• Vegetated submerged beds, vegetated gravel-bed and gravel bed hydroponics filters.\nThis great number of terms is confusing for novices who are searching for information.\nIn this document, the terms “bed”, “filter” or “filter bed” are used interchangeably, denoting the sand filled main body of the subsurface flow CWs.\nWe use the term “pre-treatment” in this document to denote the treatment step before the wastewater reaches the subsurface flow CW filter bed. Other authors call this step “primary treatment”, and the treatment in the CW would in that case be called “secondary treatment”.\n2.4 Historical development\nHistorically, natural wetlands have been used as convenient sewage and wastewater disposal sites. This led to many wetlands, such as marshes, being saturated with nutrients and experiencing severe environmental degradation.\nThe German scientist Dr. Seidel conducted the first experiments on the possibility of wastewater treatment with wetland plants in 1952 at the Max Planck Institute in Germany (Seidel, 1965). A major increase in the number of CWs took place in the 1990s as the application expanded to treat different kinds of wastewater such as industrial wastewater and storm water.\nThe use of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment is becoming more and more popular in many parts of the world. Today subsurface flow CWs are quite common in many developed countries such as Germany, UK, France, Denmark, Austria, Poland and Italy. Constructed wetlands are also appropriate for developing countries but they still\nhave to become better known there (Mohamed, 2004; Heers, 2006; Kamau, 2009).\n2.5 Classification of constructed wetlands\nConstructed wetlands are classified according to the water flow regime (see Figure 1) into either free water surface flow (FWS CWs) or subsurface flow CWs, and according to the type of macrophyte plant as well as flow direction. Constructed wetlands used macrophyte plants which are aquatic plants that grow in or near water.\nSubsurface flow CWs are designed to keep the water level totally below the surface of the filter bed. They can even be walked on. This avoids the mosquito problems of FWS CWs.\nDifferent types of constructed wetlands may be combined with each other to form hybrid systems in order to exploit the specific advantages of the different systems.\nThe coarse sand used in subsurface flow CWs contributes to the treatment processes by providing a surface for microbial growth and by supporting adsorption and filtration processes. This results in a lower area demand and higher treatment performance per area for subsurface flow CWs, compared to FWS CWs. Subsurface flow CWs are the predominant wetland type in Europe.\nThere are two different types of filtering material, i.e. sand or gravel. Gravel bed systems are widely used in North Africa, South Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The sand bed systems have their origin in Europe and are now used all over the world.\nThis publication only deals with subsurface flow CWs with coarse sand as filter media.\n Figure 1.\nVymazal and Kroepfelová, 2008). The dashed ellipse signifies the focus of this document. HFB and VFB are abbreviations for horizontal and vertical flow bed, respectively. Hybrid systems are also possible. “Emergent plants” are a type of macrophyte where the leaves are above the water level.\nClassification of constructed wetlands (modified from\n 9\n \n 2.6 Range of applications\nConstructed wetlands can be used for a variety of 1\napplications :\n1. Municipal wastewater treatment\n2. Treatment of household wastewater or greywater\n3. Tertiary treatment of effluents from conventional\nwastewater treatment plants\n4. Industrial wastewater treatment such as landfill leachate,\npetroleum refinery wastes, acid mine drainage, agricultural wastes, effluent from pulp and paper mills, textile mills.\n5. Sludge dewatering and mineralisation of faecal sludge or sludge from settling tanks.\n6. Storm water treatment and temporary storage\n7. Treatment of water from swimming pools without\nchlorine\nThis publication only deals with the first two applications of the list above. Note that pre-treatment of some form is required in most of the applications.\n2.7 Technology selection\nSubsurface flow CWs offer significant potential for decentralised wastewater treatment, but they are not the only available technology. The right treatment technology for a given application should be carefully selected taking into\naccount a whole range of aspects and sustainability 2\nindicators .\nFigure2. Urban decentralised greywater treatment with a subsurface flow CW in Klosterenga in Oslo, Norway (photo by L. Ulrich, 2008).\n2.7.1 Space requirements as a selection criterion\nThe high space requirement compared to high-rate aerobic treatment processes can limit the use of subsurface flow CWs especially for urban applications.\n1\nFor an overview of these applications see this presentation:\nhttp://www.susana.org/lang-\nen/library?view=ccbktypeitem&type=2&id=1035. 23\nIn warm climates, horizontal flow beds have approximately the same area requirement as facultative ponds which are another “low tech” wastewater treatment option, whilst vertical flow beds need about 20% less space than ponds.\nIn most urban situations neither HFBs nor ponds can be implemented for wastewater treatment because of the space requirement. VFBs for decentralised applications may however be small enough to fit into available urban spaces, especially in warm climates.\nIn order to save space in urban applications, subsurface flow CWs could be constructed on roofs of buildings. This is an interesting research area for the future but currently has a lot of practical draw-backs.\nFurther details on the required area of subsurface flow CWs are provided in Section 3.2.4.\n2.7.2 Comparison of subsurface flow CWs with high- rate aerobic treatment processes\nHigh-rate aerobic treatment processes require less space than constructed wetlands. Process examples are: activated sludge plants, trickling filters, rotating discs, submerged aerated filters or membrane bioreactor plants.\nThe main argument in favour of subsurface flow CWs compared to high-rate aerobic treatment processes is their operational robustness which is very important in the case of developing countries and countries in transition.\nAnother important aspect is the lack of secondary sludge production in constructed wetlands, whereas excess secondary sludge is produced in high-rate aerobic treatment processes and needs to be managed. In developing countries, this excess sludge is often discharged in an uncontrolled manner to the environment, leading to pollution and health risks.\nConstructed wetlands are very effective as a tertiary\ntreatment system after activated sludge or trickling filter 3\nplants :\n• The constructed wetland can serve to compensate\ntemporary variations of effluent quality.\n• Constructed wetlands achieve more pathogen removal\nthan conventional high-rate aerobic processes (see Section 8.2 in the Appendix).\n2.7.3 Comparison of subsurface flow CWs with ponds\nConstructed wetlands and ponds both score high in terms of process reliability and simplicity since no special equipment is required. The main arguments to choose subsurface flow CWs over ponds include:\n• Subsurface flow CWs do not have open water bodies; therefore they do not encourage mosquito breeding.\n• Subsurface flow CWs produce clear water, whereas\nponds have a high algae production which influences the\neffluent quality.\n• Due to their open water surface, mosquitoes and odour,\nponds are much more difficult to integrate in a neighbourhood, particularly an urban neighbourhood.\n     See vision document of Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) for a definition of sustainability indicators for sanitation (http://www.susana.org/lang-en/intro/156-intro/267-vision-document).\nThe lower organic load entering the CW in that case (after secondary treatment) significantly reduces the area requirement for the CW.\n 10\n \n • Well-functioning constructed wetlands have no odour generation, whereas in most ponds odour generation is common.\n• Constructed wetlands do not produce sludge except for the sludge produced from the pre-treatment step upstream of the filter beds. In ponds on the other hand, sludge accumulates over time, and the sludge has to be removed after about ten years. This is often neglected in developing countries and instead the ponds are abandoned.\nAnd what are the advantages of ponds over subsurface flow CWs? They are easier to design and construct, do not need a substrate (sand) and have lower capital costs for large-scale plants (see Section 2.7.4).\n2.7.4 Cost considerations\nThe capital costs of subsurface flow CWs are highly dependent on the costs of sand since the bed has to be filled with sand. Secondly the capital costs are also dependent on the cost of land.\nFinancial decisions on treatment processes should not primarily be made on capital costs, but on net present value or whole-of-life costs, which includes the annual costs for operation and maintenance.\nThe following points can be made when comparing costs for constructed wetlands and high-rate aerobic treatment processes:\n• Constructed wetlands do not exhibit economies of scale\nto the same degree that high-rate aerobic treatment plants do. For small plants of up to 500 p.e., constructed wetlands are usually cheaper to build than high-rate aerobic plants but for larger plants, they are usually more expensive in terms of capital costs.\n• Constructed wetlands have significantly lower operation and maintenance costs compared to high-rate aerobic processes for energy use and operator time.\nFor large scale treatment plants of more than 10 000 person equivalents (p.e.) in areas where land is available cheaply, ponds have lower capital costs than constructed wetlands. But there is a range of other aspects which have to be taken into account when making the decision between the two different treatment processes, as shown above.\nWe argue that the capital costs argument should be less important than the reliability and long-term sustainability of the treatment plant, including its financial sustainability which is strongly influenced by annual operation and maintenance costs.\n2.8 Reuse aspects\n2.8.1 Reuse for irrigation\nSubsurface flow CWs treat wastewater to a standard fit for discharge to surface water or fit for various reuse applications according to WHO guidelines (WHO, 2006). The legal requirements for the effluent quality vary depending on the specific regulations of each country and also on the intended reuse or disposal pathway. The design of the subsurface flow CW should be in line with the desired effluent quality for disposal or reuse.\nThe most common type of reuse is irrigation, such as drip irrigation or subsurface irrigation, for lawns, green spaces or crop production. In this case, utilisation of nutrients contained in wastewater rather than nutrient removal is desirable.\nRelevant guidelines must be followed to ensure this practice is hygienically safe for the consumers of the crops as well as for workers who can be in contact with treated wastewater. International standards for reuse and an explanation of the important multiple-barrier concept can be found in WHO (2006).\n2.8.2 Hygiene aspects (pathogens)\nHumans excrete many different types of disease causing pathogens if they are infected or carriers of a disease. The human intestinal tract contains coliform bacteria which are discharged with the faeces. These coliform bacteria are not pathogens but if present in environmental samples indicate that intestinal pathogens may also be present.\nGreywater which has been treated in subsurface flow CWs usually meets the standards for pathogen levels for safe discharge to surface water without further treatment. In the case of domestic wastewater, disinfection by tertiary treatment might be necessary, depending on the intended reuse application.\nFor further information on pathogen types and pathogen removal by various treatment processes please see the Appendix.\n  Figure 3.\nwetland in Haran Al-Awamied, Syria, is collected in this storage tank (right) before its reuse for irrigation in agriculture (photos by E. von Muench, 2009; project supported by GIZ).\n2.8.3 Quantity aspects\nHorizontal flow beds in warm climates can lose all the wastewater due to evapotranspiration. This needs to be considered in the water balance. The larger the surface area, the more significant are the effects of precipitation (rain) and evapotranspiration, especially in warm and dry climates.\nThe treated effluent (left) of the vertical flow constructed\n 11\n \n If water loss is regarded as a problem, VFBs are preferable to HFBs, because they have an unsaturated upper layer in the bed and a shorter retention time than HFBs.\n2.8.4 Colour aspects\nThe effluent from any biological wastewater treatment process such as a constructed wetland can have a yellowish or brownish colour. This is caused by humic substances, such as humic acids or humins (Figure 4). The colouration may reduce the social acceptance of wastewater reuse.\nHumic acids originate from the biological degradation of organic matter, being the unbiodegradable fraction of organic matter. Humic acids are a natural compound of soil, lake and river water. They are not harmful to the environment but they have a negative impact on disinfection processes with chlorine or UV radiation.\nWhen treated wastewater is used for toilet flushing, it is easier to use coloured porcelain for the toilet bowl than to attempt to remove the coloration, since humic substances can be only removed by advanced technologies such as activated carbon, ozone, photo catalytic oxidation (Guylas et al., 2007; Abegglen et al., 2009).\nFrom the main authors’ experiences, greywater after treatment in a constructed wetland tends to have no colour. On the other hand, domestic wastewater or blackwater after treatment in a constructed wetland is often, but not always, slightly yellow or brown (see for example Figure 4).\n• Suspended solids measured as “total suspended solids”, TSS\n4\n• Nutrients , i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus\n• Pathogens, heavy metals and organic contaminants.\nConstructed wetlands are often referred to as “simple, low tech systems”, but the biological, physical and chemical treatment processes involved are actually far from simple. They occur in different zones in the main active layer of the constructed wetland, the “filter bed”. These zones include:\n• Sediment, sand bed\n• Root zone, water in pores\n• Litter, detritus (non-living particulate organic material,\nsuch as leaf litter)\n• Water\n• Air\n• Plants and plant roots\n• Biomass zones, such as bacteria growing in sand and\nattached to roots\nThe wastewater treatment in the filter bed of constructed wetlands is the result of complex interactions between all these zones. A mosaic of sites with different oxygen levels exists in constructed wetlands, which triggers diverse degradation and removal processes.\n    Organic material (measured as BOD or COD)\n   • Particulate organic matter is removed by settling or filtration, then converted to soluble BOD.\n• Soluble organic matter is fixed by biofilms and removed due to degradation by attached bacteria (biofilm on stems, roots, sand particles etc.).\n     Figure 4.\nVFB. Left photo: pre-treated greywater (left bottle) and effluent of the CW which is reused for irrigation of crops (right bottle).

Influent suspended solids and generated microbial solids are mainly retained mechanically, whereas soluble organic matter is fixed or absorbed by a so-called biofilm. All organic matter is degraded and stabilised over an extended period by biological processes. The biological treatment in the filter bed is based on the activity of microorganisms, mainly aerobic and facultative bacteria. These microorganisms grow on the surface of the soil particles and roots, where they create a highly active biofilm.\nSubsurface flow CWs are designed for aerobic and facultative treatment. Aerobic processes always need the presence of oxygen (air). Facultative processes can occur\nunder temporary oxygen limited conditions or in the absence -\nof oxygen, when nitrate (NO3 ) is used by specialised bacteria for the oxidation of organic matter. This is then called an anoxic process.\nCWs are not designed for anaerobic treatment (which occurs in absence of oxygen) but some small anaerobic zones may still exist in CWs, particularly for free water surface flow CWs and HFBs. The possible biogas emissions due to these anaerobic processes are however negligible compared to other sources.\nA low organic load to the CW allows for the degradation of less degradable organic matter (organic contaminants), which will be decomposed by specialised natural soil bacteria. These specialised bacteria have very low growth rates. All organic matter, suspended solids and also generated microbial solids are finally reduced by aerobic and anoxic processes into CO2, H2O, NO3 and N2.\nThe uptake of heavy metals by plants in constructed wetlands has been reported. The physiological reasons for heavy metal uptake are not yet fully understood and probably depend strongly on the plant species. Nevertheless it has to be pointed out that heavy metals do not disappear, but still remain in the plant tissues. In greywater and domestic wastewater heavy metals are usually not an issue, because their concentration is low in such types of wastewater.\n3.1.2 Pollutant removal ratios for greywater treatment\nThe removal efficiencies for greywater treatment with two types of subsurface flow CWs are summarised in Table 2. It is obvious that different removal ratios exist for HFBs and VFBs as well as for the different parameters. The removal ratios for BOD and TSS are up to 99%, while total nitrogen removal ratios are only up to 40% (but higher for hybrid systems). The values can be expected to be similar for domestic wastewater treatment.\nThe effluent concentrations of pollutants can be calculated by multiplying the influent concentrations in the flow to the filter bed (i.e. after pre-treatment) with the removal ratio.\nTable 2. Removal ratios (in %) of HFBs and VFBs (subsurface flow CWs) for greywater treatment. The values are similar for domestic wastewater treatment.\n   Pollutant\nBOD (biological oxygen demand)\nTSS (total suspended solids)\nTN (total nitrogen)\nTP (total phosphorus)\nHFB\n(Morel and Diener, 2006)\n80-90\n80-95\n15-40\nVFB (Ridderstolpe, 2004)\n90-99\n90-99\n30\n            Phosphorus removal rates depend on the properties of the filter material and on the length of time the CW has been operating for.\n  3.1.3 Nutrient removal\nPlant growth leads to removal of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus: The reduction of ammonia and phosphate from domestic wastewater by growing plants is about 10-20% during the vegetation period. More important for nitrogen removal are however the nitrification/denitrification processes carried out by bacteria.\nNitrogen removal:\n• HFBs: As the oxygen transport into HFBs is limited, enhanced nitrification cannot be expected. On the other hand denitrification can be very efficient, even at very low carbon to nitrogen ratios (Platzer, 1999). The produced nitrate can be reduced under anoxic conditions by heterotrophic bacteria to nitrogen (N2); this is called denitrification.\n• VFBs: In VFBs with sufficient oxygen supply, ammonia can be oxidised by autotrophic bacteria to nitrate; this process is called nitrification. An almost complete nitrification with 90% ammonia oxidation is commonly reported for VFBs. Nevertheless nitrification depends strongly on the oxygen supply. For the dimensioning it is essential to calculate the oxygen consumption in the VFB (Platzer, 1999; Cooper, 2005; Platzer et al., 2007). On the other hand, since VFBs do not provide much denitrification, the nitrogen remains as nitrate in the effluent and the total nitrogen removal ratio is therefore only around, 30%.\n• Combination: Often a combination of a VFB followed by a HFB and flow recirculation is used when nitrogen removal is required. For details see Section 5.4.\nPhosphorus removal:\nMost CWs are not designed primarily for phosphorus removal and in developing countries they are practically never designed for phosphorus removal since this is generally not a requirement there. Phosphorus removal is not such an important issue in those countries compared to the other health risks from untreated wastewater discharge. If excess phosphorus in receiving water bodies such as lakes and rivers became an important problem, a first step could be to ban detergents which contain phosphorus, as has been done for example in Switzerland.\nA reliable design for phosphorus removal has not yet been developed although many subsurface flow CWs do present a relatively high phosphorus removal rate for a period of time\n 13\n \n (Rustige and Platzer, 2001). Phosphorus removal can be achieved in CWs by adsorption and precipitation, and a small amount is also taken up by plant growth.\nThe authors estimate that a phosphorus removal ratio by plant growth of up to 10% is possible depending on the climate, plants, type of wastewater, etc. The capacity of chemical phosphorus binding, and thus the phosphorus removal efficiency, decreases during the lifetime of a subsurface flow CW. This is due to limited adsorption sites of the sand.\nIf phosphorus removal is indeed required, a separate unplanted soil filter can be used downstream of the subsurface flow CW, where the substrate can be replaced once its phosphorus adsorption capacity has been reached. Exchange of substrate is theoretically also possible for subsurface flow CWs but in practice it is not economically feasible.\n3.1.4 Role of plants in subsurface flow CWs\nSubsurface flow CWs are planted with macrophyte plants which are commonly found in natural wetlands or non- submerged riverbanks in the region. The plants are an\n5\nessential part of a constructed wetland. They are\naesthetically pleasing and add greenery to a built-up area. They serve as a habitat for animals like birds and frogs, and act as a local “green space”.\nMost significant in comparison to unplanted filters is the ability of the subsurface flow CWs – which are by definition with plants – to maintain or restore the hydraulic conductivity of the filter bed. Unplanted soil filters on the other hand have to be treated to regain their hydraulic conductivity, for example by removing the top few centimetres of substrate.\nThe plants also play an important role in the treatment process. They provide an appropriate environment for microbial growth and significantly improve the transfer of oxygen into the root zone, which is part of the filter bed. Furthermore, in cold climate zones dead plant material provides an insulation layer, which has a positive effect for the operation of subsurface flow CWs in winter.\nFor example, in the case of reed, there is a massive network 6\nof roots and rhizomes , which maintain a high biological activity in the constructed wetland, due to their ability to transport oxygen from the leaves to the roots (see Figure 5). For HFBs a uniform distribution of roots in the entire filter bed is important, whereas for VFBs only the uniform distribution of roots in the upper layer (the first 10 cm) is essential.\nThe characteristics of plants such as papyrus or bamboo, which are adapted to growth conditions in temporarily submerged natural wetlands, are probably similar. In the case of bamboo, its roots may however reach too far down and therefore destroy the liner at the base of the constructed wetland.\n5\nThere are other types of treatment systems which have some similarities with SSF CWs but work without plants; these systems are called “unplanted soil filters” – see relevant literature for more details on those systems, as they are not included in this document.\n6\nA rhizome is a characteristically horizontal stem of a plant that is usually found underground, often sending out roots and shoots from its nodes (source: www.wikipedia.org).\nIn summary, the effects of plants which contribute to the treatment processes in subsurface flow CWs include:\n• The root system maintains the hydraulic conductivity of\nthe coarse sand substrate.\n• The plants facilitate the growth of bacteria colonies and\nother microorganism which form a biofilm attached to the\nsurface of roots and substrate particles.\n• The plants transport oxygen to the root zone to allow the\nroots to survive in anaerobic conditions. Part of this oxygen is available for microbial processes, although the exact contribution is still a point of discussion.\n  Figure 5.\n(left picture) and arundo donax (right picture) (photos by M. Blumberg, 1995).\n3.2 Basic design considerations\n3.2.1 Necessary conditions and basic setup\nThe necessary conditions to be able to use constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment are listed below:\n• Enough space must be available because it is a low-rate\nsystem with a higher space requirement than high-rate\nsystems (Section 2.7.1).\n• Climates without longer freezing periods are preferable,\neven though subsurface flow CWs with adjusted designs\ndo work in cold climates (Jenssen et al., 2008).\n• Full sunlight situation is preferable and full shadow conditions need to be avoided. Especially for subsurface flow CWs it is very important that the surface area can regularly dry out completely because otherwise the risk of clogging rises due to excessive biofilm growth in wet\nconditions.\n• Plants used must be adapted for growth under partially\nsubmerged conditions, the local climate and the sunlight/shadow conditions of the respective wetland location.\n• As for all biological treatment processes the wastewater should not contain toxic substances, although the high retention time makes constructed wetlands more robust to toxic events compared to more highly loaded systems.\n• Well trained maintenance staff to carry out the basic maintenance tasks is needed.\nUrbanisation and future population development have to be considered when calculating the expected wastewater flowrate to the constructed wetland.\nRoot and rhizome system of reed (Phragmites australis)\n  14\n \n There are some general considerations about constructing subsurface flow CWs, which are usually adhered to:\n• A 15 cm freeboard for water accumulation is\nrecommended.\n• The surface must be flat and horizontal to prevent\nunequal distribution or “surface run-off” (which means in the case of HFBs that wastewater is flowing across the surface of the CW to the outlet but not infiltrating and hence not receiving treatment).\n• The design of the inlet area and distribution pipes has to assure uniform distribution of the wastewater, without allowing short circuits of the flow.\no The right selection of filter material is crucial (see Section 3.3 for details).\no The wastewater is applied to the bed via distribution pipes which have small holes equally distributed along the length of the pipes.\n• Drainage pipes collect treated wastewater at the base below the filter bed.\n• Liner at the base: Plastic PVC lining, a clay layer or a concrete base is used to seal the filter bed at the base (see Figure 9). For HFBs this is always necessary. For VFBs it is only necessary when the effluent will be reused or when the groundwater table is high and groundwater is used for drinking water purposes. Sometimes the authorities also stipulate the sealing of the base.\no The lining prevents contact of wastewater with groundwater but otherwise does not improve the effluent quality nor prevent clogging.\no Disadvantages of lining are the additional costs, the difficulties with finding a local supplier (especially in rural areas), environmental pollution during production of PVC lining and the need for specialists to lay the PVC sheets properly in the hole.\nDetails on the design of subsurface flow CWs are given in Section 5. Special attention should always be paid to the pre- treatment (see Section 4).\n3.2.2 Major components and design life\nThe major components of a constructed wetland are an influent pump (for VFBs; this is not required for HFBs), plastic pipes, plastic lining underneath the drainage pipes, gravel and sand. Therefore, the design life is determined by the design life of these major components. The pumps and feeding pipes can easily be replaced if necessary. The gravel and sand is in practice never replaced. The design life of the plastic lining is difficult to predict and the condition of the plastic lining is unfortunately impossible to assess in a constructed wetland while it is in use.\nThere are no theoretical reasons to indicate that constructed\nwetlands would stop removing organic matter, nitrogen and 7\npathogens after a certain length of time . If a constructed wetland ever has to be abandoned, it is easy to use the space for other purposes, or to just let the plants grow wild.\nConstructed wetlands can be expected to have a design life at least as long as other wastewater treatment systems, such as high-rate aerobic processes or ponds. Some constructed wetlands have now been in continuous operation for over 20\n7\nThe situation is different for phosphorus removal, see Section 3.1.3.\nyears and these plants are still producing good treatment results.\n3.2.3 Design parameters\nThere are several design parameters for designing subsurface flow CWs which are used at different points in the design calculations, depending on the type of wastewater and climate:\n2\n• Area per person in m /p.e., where p.e. stands for “person\nequivalent”;\n2\n• Organic loading per surface area in gBOD/(m ·d) or\n2 gCOD/(m ·d);\n32\n• Hydraulic load in mm/d or m /(m ·d);\n• Oxygen input and consumption (kg/d).\nThere is no commonly accepted design approach which uses\nthe retention time to size a subsurface flow CW.\nThe best method to minimise the size of a constructed wetland is an efficient pre-treatment (see Section 4) and the precise calculation of the actual load. The organic load to a\n3\nCW (in g/d) equals the flowrate (in m /d) multiplied by the\nBOD concentration in the pre-treated wastewater (in mg/L).\n Figure 6.\ngreywater to test for uniform distribution in Lima, Peru. Note the small holes in distribution pipes. The entire surface is used as an inlet area, and the pipes are later covered with gravel after completing the testing (photo by H. Hoffmann, 2008).\nVFB under construction, during influent pumping with\n Figure 7.\nthe wetland will treat wastewater from a landfill (photo by J. Boorsma, 2009; project supported by GIZ).\nVFB under construction in Bayawan City, Philippines;\n  15\n \n 3.2.4 Typical values for area requirements\nThe simplest design parameter for constructed wetlands is the area required per person, but this design parameter on its own is not sufficient for properly sizing constructed wetlands. This parameter can only be used for a basic assessment in order to obtain a first indication of the space requirement (see Section 5 for detailed design information).\nTable 3 shows how the climate and the type of constructed wetland (HFB versus VFB) influence the area requirement of constructed wetlands. This table can be used as a guide and should be read as follows: if a constructed wetland is smaller than the recommended value in Table 3, then an overload situation can occur which would cause serious operational problems and reduced treatment performance. Oversized constructed wetlands on the other hand, do not have problems with treatment efficiency and are more robust, but are unnecessarily large and expensive.\nTo give an example: a VFB to treat wastewater of 3 000 people needs about 3 000 to 12 000 m2 depending on the climate and design. A HFB would need at least twice as much space.\nIt should be noted that the required pre-treatment is the same for HFBs and VFBs. But the pre-treatment for wastewater is different than the pre-treatment of greywater, as the wastewater characteristics differ (see Section 4 for details).\nTable3. Approximate design values to estimate the area\nrequirement for subsurface flow CWs in different climate conditions 8\n3.3\nlow in greywater, but it is an important consideration for domestic wastewater.\nSubstrate used in subsurface flow CWs\nfor domestic wastewater (after pre-treatment) .\nThe selection of a suitably permeable substrate in relation to the hydraulic and organic loading is the most critical design parameter for subsurface flow CWs. Most treatment problems occur when the permeability is not adequately chosen for the applied load.\nThis publication refers only to the use of coarse sand as a substrate for filtration. In our view, this is the most suitable substrate for the application of subsurface flow CWs for wastewater or greywater treatment in developing countries or countries in transition (with a warm to moderate climate).\nThe drainage pipes at the base are covered with gravel. On top of this gravel layer, there is a sand layer of 40-80 cm thickness which contains the actual filter bed of the subsurface flow CW. On top of this sand layer there is another gravel layer of about 10 cm thickness, in order to avoid water accumulating on the surface. This top gravel layer does not contribute to the filtering process.\n    Design value\nArea per person (m2/p.e.)\nCold climate, annual average < 10°C\nWarm climate, annual average > 20°C\n    HFB VFB HFB\nVFB\n     8 4 3 1.2\n     3.2.5 Design differences between CWs for domestic wastewater versus CWs for greywater\nDomestic wastewater and greywater have different characteristics and these have to be considered when dimensioning a CW. The characterisation of domestic wastewater and greywater is outlined in the Appendix.\nThe main differences between the design of constructed wetlands for treating greywater compared to treating domestic or municipal wastewater include:\n• Nitrogen and phosphorus removal are much easier to\nachieve for greywater than for domestic wastewater treatment since the nutrient loads and concentrations are much lower in greywater due to the lack of urine and faeces.\n• Pathogen removal is not a design consideration for greywater treatment since the pathogen levels are very\n8 The values are the same for greywater treatment if the pre- treatment unit has resulted in the same effluent concentrations (the pre-treatment unit can be smaller for greywater treatment when the calculation is done on a per person basis).\n-4\n-3\nFigure 8.\nwastewater treatment in Brazil: coarse sand from river, containing neither loam nor silt (photo by C. Platzer, 2008).\nIt is not recommended to construct layers with different grain sizes such as larger grains on top, smaller grain sizes at the base – as this design approach has led to poorly performing constructed wetlands in the past.\nIt is also not recommended to use a layer made of fabric between the lower gravel layer and the sand layer. This had been included in some constructed wetlands in Germany and led to clogging in deeper zones of the VFBs which was impossible to revert. Also in the case of HFBs such a fabric separation layer would have a negative impact on the hydraulic conductivity.\nDesign recommendations regarding the substrate to be used in subsurface flow CWs are listed below:\n• The sand should have a hydraulic capacity (kf value) of\nExample of filter material used for VFBs for municipal\nabout 10\n• The filtration sand layer needs to have a thickness of 40\nto 80 cm.\n• The recommended grain size distribution for the\nsubstrate is shown in Figure 32.\nto 10\nm/s.\n  16\n \n • The substrate should not contain loam, silt nor other fine material, nor should it consist of material with sharp edges. Figure 8 illustrates the visual appearance of suitable sand.\nFigure9. Left: VFB during construction in Palhoça, Santa Catarina, Brazil; drain pipes situated on top of the PE liner are being covered with gravel. Right: VFB in Lima, Peru during filling with sand (photos by H. Hoffmann, 2007).\n3.4 Types of plants used\nFor the selection of plants to be used in constructed wetlands (mostly macrophyte plants i.e. aquatic plants which grow in or near water), the following recommendations can be made:\n• Use local, indigenous species and do not import exotic,\npossibly invasive species.\n• Use plant species which grow in natural wetlands or\nriverbanks because their roots are adapted to growing in\nwater saturated conditions.\n• Plants with an extensive root and rhizome system below\nground are preferable (see Figure 5).\n• Plants should be able to withstand shock loads as well\nas short dry periods.\n• Plants should not require permanent flooding but be able\nto cope with temporary flooding and water logged soils.\nWhether the wetland plants should be harvested or not is discussed in Section 6.4 as part of the operational tasks.\nPlants used in subsurface flow CWs in cold climates of Europe, Southern Australia and North America include for example:\n• Common reed (Phragmites australis): this is the most common plant used in Europe and in countries with a cold climate.\n• Broad-leaved cattail (Typha latifolia), reed sweet grass (Glyceria maxima), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and yellow iris (Iris pseudacorus).\nThe types of plants used in subsurface flow CWs in warm climates of South America, Africa, and Asia are summarised in Table 4.\nTable 4. Overview of some possible plants which can be used in subsurface flow CWs in warm climates. All plants shown below are macrophyte plants, except vetiver which is a perennial grass. Many other plants are possible, see for example Brisson and Chazarenc (2009).\n   Plant name\nPapyrus sedge (Cyperus papyrus)\nUmbrella sedge (Cyperus albostriatus and Cyperus alternifolius)\nDwarf papyrus (Cyperus haspens)\nBamboo, smaller ornamental species\nBroad-leaved cattail (Typha latifolia)\nSpecies of genus\n– Heliconia: lobster-claws, wild plantains\n– Canna: Canna lily\n– Zantedeschia: Calla lily\nNapier grass or Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum)\nVetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides, previously called Vetiveria zizanioides or cuscus grass)\nCharacteristics\nDecorative\n(see Figure 11).\nVery robust plants, excellent also for highly concentrated or salt containing wastewater.\nExcellent when it is the only plant.\nDecorative.\nIs often more resistant in warm conditions than common reed.\nDecorative\nSpecies of grass native to the tropical grasslands in Africa. It has a very high productivity, both as forage for livestock and as a biofuel crop.\nIt can grow up to 1.5 m high and forms an efficient root system. This grass is used in warm climates for erosion control and for producing essential oil which is distilled from its roots. The grass is also used as fodder plant or for handicraft material.\nDisadvantages\n3 m high, forms a layer on the CW surface, roots are only formed from the mother plant.\nDoes not survive in the shadow of larger plants.\nSlow growth especially in the first 3 years and if the plant is not well adapted to the climate.\nSome plants of these species prefer half shadow, others full sunlight conditions.\n                                          The roots do not grow so well when the plant is used for wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands, but the roots are still sufficient to maintain the functionality of a VFB.\nHence, vetiver is only recommended for VFBs, but not for HFBs.\n    17\n \n  Figure 10.

Germer, 2008).\n4 Pre-treatment of wastewater before subsurface flow CW treatment\n4.1 Overview of processes\nConstructed wetlands can be called a secondary treatment step since suspended solids, larger particles including toilet paper and other rubbish as well as some organic matter need to be removed before wastewater can be treated in subsurface flow CWs. The technology used for pre-treatment (also called primary treatment) depends on the type and quantity of wastewater. Table 5 provides a general overview.\nPre-treatment is extremely important to avoid clogging of subsurface flow CWs, which is an obstruction of the free pore spaces due to accumulation of solids (see Section 5.2.2 for details).\nThis section provides only general guidance on pre-treatment processes. Specialised literature or local experts should be consulted to design the pre-treatment process. See for example Gutterer et al. (2009) for design equations for septic tanks, baffled tanks and Imhoff tanks.\nSmall household treatment plants (less than 1 000 p.e.) are usually designed without screens. In this case septic tanks, baffled tanks or compost filters carry out the screening function.\nAbout 60% of suspended solids in the wastewater is removed in the pre-treatment step. As a basic rule, the aim is to have less than 100 mg/L TSS in the influent to a SSF CW (i.e. after pre-treatment).\nTable 5.

The removed sludge will be taken to a local wastewater treatment plant by tanker (project supported by GIZ, photo by J. Nowak, 2010)\n4.2 Biogas emissions during pre-treatment\nIn most of the pre-treatment facilities, anaerobic degradation processes occur in the accumulated sludge (see Table 5). These anaerobic processes lead to the emission of biogas,\n9\nwhich contains typically around 66% methane . Methane\n(CH4) in the earth's atmosphere is an important greenhouse\ngas with a global warming potential of 25 times higher 10\ncompared to CO2 over a 100-year period .\nUnfortunately the organic load in communal wastewater is in most cases not high enough for the economical usage of biogas for cooking, lighting or heating. Sometimes the distance between the point of biogas generation and the point of possible biogas use is also too large. In these cases the biogas should at least be burnt (also called “flared”).\nWhen biogas needs to be burnt, there are additional costs for safety equipment. The flare for a household plant has nearly the same costs as a flare for a large plant of 20000 inhabitants – thus the specific costs per person are relatively high for flares implemented in small systems.\nDue to the fact that septic tanks, baffled tanks, Imhoff tanks and UASBs lead to biogas emissions and since flares are neither economical nor practical at the small scale, the designer should be aware of the negative impact on climate change of these pre-treatment methods.\nIt is recommended to always check the possibility of flaring of biogas or of using other available pre-treatment methods which do not produce biogas. Whilst the greenhouse gas (methane) emissions from anaerobic processes within pre- treatment processes are relatively small compared to other sources of greenhouse gases, they should still be minimised as much as possible.\n4.3 Grease trap\nFats, oil and grease (FOG) are removed by floating this material, which is lighter than water, in a container\n9\nhttp://www.gtz.de/en/themen/umwelt-infrastruktur/wasser/9397.htm\ndownstream of the kitchen sink before this wastewater is mixed with other wastewater streams. The outlet in the sink and/or the inlet to the grease trap should be equipped with a removable screen which retains pieces of food and sand.\nThe floating scum layer has to be removed periodically before it gets so thick that it would mix with the grease trap effluent. The frequency for the removal depends on the use of fat in the kitchen.\nFor household units, commercial plastic traps with removable buckets can be bought (see Figure 14) which simplify the cleaning. Larger grease traps (as a guideline: for more than 20 p.e.) must be cleaned with a pump.\nFurther recommendations regarding grease traps include:\n• Common pre-treatment methods for municipal wastewater (for instance septic tanks) also eliminate a fraction of FOGs, but at least for restaurants and large kitchens it is important to have a grease trap because concentrated fats cause problems in the pre-treatment as well as blockages in the sewer. The grease traps are\ninstalled downstream of the kitchen sink.\n• If the grease trap is the only pre-treatment step for\ngreywater before it enters a constructed wetland, it may be necessary to combine it with a sedimentation tank or to have an outlet in the bottom of the trap. This enables removal of sludge/sediments which can be formed by sand, soap and pieces of food which would otherwise pass onto the wetland.\n• The removed scum has to be treated, for instance by composting or by transporting it by tanker to a centralised treatment plant if there is one nearby. The high energetic value of FOGs means that the removed scum could also be used for anaerobic digestion (biogas generation).\nFigure 14. Left: Grease trap schematic. Right: Opened grease trap used for effluent of a kitchen sink of a household in Lima, Peru before wetland treatment. The inner bucket can be taken out to remove the grease (sources: H. Hoffmann, 2010).\n4.4 Septic tank\nSome basic facts about septic tanks are listed below:\n• Widely used for decentralised (“on-site”) domestic wastewater treatment due to their simple construction.\nMany countries have standards for septic tank design.\n• Common in many developing countries but also in\nsparsely populated regions of developed countries.\n• Can be used for pre-treatment of wastewater from 5 to\n200 inhabitants.\n    See also GIZ technology review on biogas sanitation:\n  10\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane.\n  19\n   \n •\n•\n•\n•\n•\nIn a\n50% of the total volume. It is connected to the second chamber from a level of 60-80 cm above the bottom of the tank. With this arrangement, settled solids and floated scum are mainly retained in the first chamber. The third chamber is used as reservoir for the pre-treated wastewater.\nSeptic tanks have to be desludged regularly when the sludge in the first chamber almost overflows. The duration between emptying events varies with the design and number of users but may be in the range of 1-5 years.\nThe removed faecal sludge should be properly managed and treated but is unfortunately often simply dumped anywhere in the environment. The faecal sludge from the septic tank cannot be reused without further treatment.\nFigure 15. Left: Septic tank schematic. Right: 3-chamber septic tank under construction at a house with 15 habitants in Lima, Peru (sources: H. Hoffmann, 2009).\n4.5 Compost filter\n11\nA “compost filter” is a novel pre-treatment method particu-\nlarly when there is a desire to avoid biogas emissions. Up to now this aerobic process has only been used for single households or up to 70 p.e. for example in ecological\n12\nThe process functions as follows:\n• The raw wastewater passes through a filter bag which is\nmade of plastic material into a chamber with a ventilation\npipe.\n• The liquid effluent from the compost filter is collected\nbelow the filter bags and normally needs to be pumped to the constructed wetland, as the hydraulic head loss in compost filters is about 1.5 m.\n• The solid components of the wastewater, i.e. faeces, food and toilet paper, are retained in the straw bed which is contained in the filter bag. Once a week dry straw has to be added to obtain a suitable carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio and also to act as a filtering and bulking material for better aeration of the compost.\n• 2-4 filter bags are used in an alternating mode in two separate chambers. The dimensions of the chambers depend on the number of users. The retained solids are composted during the resting phase of six months, during which time the second bag is being used. During this time the volume reduction can be up to 75%.\nThe final product, after it has been fully aerated and left without addition of new material for six months, is black, compact material which looks and smells like black soil or humus. Nevertheless, the material still needs further treatment in another composting unit as it still contains pathogens such as helminth eggs (see Section 2.8.2).\nAdvantages of the compost filters include:\n• The effluent or filtrate from a compost filter has no\nobjectionable odours – at least not in warm climates –\naccording to extensive experience of the main authors.\n• There is no biogas production since it is an aerobic process. This is an advantage for the reasons described\nin Section 4.2.\nDisadvantages of compost filters include:\n• They need more “hands-on” maintenance than other pre-\ntreatment methods.\n• Their use is limited to small units.\n• Compost filters only work with highly concentrated\nwastewater (such as blackwater from low-flush toilets), because otherwise too much solids may be washed from the filter bags.\n• Blockages may occur, although this is usually due to having selected the wrong filter bags where the filter pores are too small.\nOverall, the process appears to work reliably in warm climates, but possibly less so in cold climates, based on experiences in Linz, Austria and Berlin, Germany.\n4.6 Imhoff tank\nThe Imhoff tank is a two-stage anaerobic system where the\nsludge is digested in a separate compartment and is not 13\nConsist of two or three chambers (see Figure 14) which have a depth of 1.4 m or more from the point of the inlet pipe.\nChambers are made of concrete or are installed as prefabricated plastic tanks.\nRemoval ratio for organic matter, measured as BOD, is typically 30%.\nIn warm climates, septic tanks are designed with 1-2 days hydraulic retention time. In cold climates up to 5 days may be required.\nThe treatment process is based on sedimentation and flotation of scum, with partial anaerobic degradation of the sludge. This process leads to undesired biogas emissions (see Section 4.2).\nthree-chamber system the first chamber is designed with\n  sanitation projects where concentrated blackwater pre-treatment (Gajurel et al., 2004; Hoffmann, 2008; Hoffmann et al., 2009).\n11\nFor further information on composting of faecal matter see also GIZ technology review on composting toilets:\nhttp://www.gtz.de/en/themen/umwelt-infrastruktur/wasser/9397.htm). 12\nBlackwater is only the toilet discharge (i.e. urine, faeces and flushwater).\nrequires\nmixed with incoming sewage\ncold climates. It is a compact and efficient communal system for pre-treatment of municipal wastewater from 500 up to 20000 habitants. It removes about 30-40% of the organic matter of the raw wastewater.\n13\nIn the German wastewater literature, the term “Emscherbrunnen” is used for this type of tank.\n. It can be used in moderate to\n    20\n \n The Imhoff tank is designed with three compartments:\n1. Upper compartment for sedimentation\n2. Lower section for sludge digestion\n3. Gas vent and scum section\nThe sludge which is settled and stored in an Imhoff tank has to be removed periodically by a pump. It is stabilised and can be dried, composted or used directly in agriculture, as long as hygienic aspects are considered and relevant safety precautions taken (see Section 2.8.2).\nThere is more biogas production than in septic tanks, but unfortunately the organic load in communal wastewater is usually not high enough for the economical usage or flaring of biogas.\nFigure 16. Left: Imhoff tank schematic with three compartments. Right: Imhoff tank under construction in a rural area of Peru (sources: H. Hoffmann, 2008).\n4.7 Baffled tank\nThe baffled tank is an improved septic tank and is used for 14\ninstance by BORDA for primary wastewater treatment in communities with 200 to 2500 inhabitants as part of their “DEWATS - decentralised wastewater treatment systems” (see Gutterer et al. (2009) for details). This type of system is also called anaerobic baffled reactor.\nCharacteristics of the baffled tank are:\n• The baffled tank has 4-6 compartments instead of the 2\nor 3 compartments of septic tanks. The total retention time is much shorter than in a septic tank: in warm climates 10-12 hours are used compared to 24-48 hours for septic tanks.\n• The removal ratio for organic matter measured as BOD is about 40% in cold climates and 60% in warm climates; consequently the biogas production is higher than in septic tanks and the biogas should be burnt or used. Again, this is unfortunately not commonly done in practice due to the additional costs of the flare or gas pipework and biogas burner.\n• The sludge is stabilised and can be used in agriculture as long as hygienic aspects are considered and relevant safety precautions are taken (see Section 2.8.2).\nBaffled tanks have a higher removal ratio for organic matter (40-60% BOD removal) compared to septic tanks (typically 30%) due to the more efficient clarification and sludge retention in the baffled tank.\n14\nBORDA is a German non-profit organisation: http://www.borda- net.org/\nAlso, a constructed wetland treating wastewater which has been pre-treated in a baffled tank needs only about 60% of the area of a constructed wetland which is treating wastewater after pre-treatment in a septic tank. Therefore, the higher costs of pre-treatment for the baffled tank are partially or fully offset by the lower cost for the constructed wetland.\nFigure 17. Schematic of baffled tank with six compartments (source: Gutterer et al., 2009).\n4.8 UASB reactor\nThe upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor is a technology for anaerobic treatment of wastewater developed by Mr. Lettinga from the Netherlands (van Haandel and Lettinga, 1995). It is often used in warm climates for municipal wastewater treatment and for industrial effluents with high organic loads such as bakery or brewery effluent. There are also many applications in Brazil for municipal wastewater.\nThe influent enters at the base of the UASB reactor and flows upwards. Due to the high loading and special design, the anaerobic bacteria form sludge granules, which filter the wastewater biologically and mechanically. The outlet for the treated wastewater and biogas caption is in the upper part of the reactor.\nThe UASB reactor is a very compact technology which achieves up to 80% organic matter reduction (measured as BOD). UASB reactors are only suitable for larger plants (> 5000 p.e.) as they have a relatively high technical complexity. They have a low sludge production and the integrated biogas capture allows utilisation or flaring of biogas.\nSludge can be lost from the UASB reactor with the pre- treated wastewater and enter the CW filter bed. Therefore, the proper dimensioning of the decantation section in the UASB reactor is very important. The high efficiency of the pre-treatment with UASBs allows relatively small constructed wetland areas.\n5 Design principles for subsurface flow CWs\nThis section explains general design principles for horizontal flow beds (HFBs) and vertical flow beds (VFBs), which are two types of subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF CWs). The filter bed consists primarily of sand and plant roots. The gravel in the bed does not have a filtering function, but is there to cover the influent distribution pipes and the drainage pipes, and to avoid puddles on the surface.\n      21\n \n 5.1 Horizontal flow beds (HFBs)\nAs the initial designs of subsurface flow CWs were for HFBs, these are still the most common type of subsurface flow CW. In the beginning HFBs often had poor effluent quality mainly due to inlet areas which were too small, but nowadays well- designed HFBs are widely accepted as a robust treatment system with low maintenance requirements. HFBs are an interesting option especially in locations without energy supply and low hydraulic gradient, whereas VFBs require pumps.\nIn HFBs the wastewater flows slowly through the porous medium under the surface of the bed in a horizontal path until it reaches the outlet zone (see Figure 18). At the outlet the water level in the HFB is controlled with an adjustable standpipe. For continuous operation the submerged height of the bed should be less than one third of the total height of the filter bed to avoid anaerobic conditions in the bed.\nThe organic matter in the wastewater is removed by bacteria on the surface of soil particles and roots of the plants. Oxygen supply plays an important role for the efficiency of the treatment process. Unlike for VFBs, the HFBs have very little additional external oxygen transfer. This is one of the reasons for the larger area requirement of HFBs.\nThe second reason is the smaller available inlet area: the inlet area consists of the width of the bed multiplied by the bed depth, whereas in VFBs the entire surface area is used as an inlet area.\nEven in warm climates, there is little scope for area reduction of HFBs. They are thus less suitable than VFBs for urban applications where space is expensive.\nIf wastewater reuse is an objective, HFBs are not recommended in hot climates due to their very high evaporation rates in such climates.\nBasic design recommendations for HFBs treating domestic wastewater are:\n2006). However, the limiting factor is the organic load, which means that greywater with low organic load (from showers or laundry) can probably be applied to the HFB with even higher hydraulic loads.\n           •\n•\n•\n•\n•\n15\nIn\nlower when treating greywater from an average person. But since greywater characteristics vary widely (e.g. kitchen greywater versus shower greywater), it is better to use the BOD loading as a design parameter. For greywater with low BOD concentrations, the hydraulic loading can be used for the design.\nFigure 18. Schematic cross-section of a HFB (source: Morel and Diener, 2006).\nFigure 19. Schematic cross-section of a HFB showing pre-treatment with a septic tank on the left (source: Fehr, 2003).\nFigure 20. Inflow zone with stones in a HFB near Leiria, Portugal (photo by J. Vymazal, 2003).\nHFBs are simpler to design and build than VFBs, nevertheless they can still fail because of design errors. The most important point for proper design is the inlet zone which acts as a filter and removes a significant portion of suspended solids.\nIn HFBs clogging mostly occurs as an obstruction of the inlet area by suspended solids or accumulation of a biofilm (sludge). It is caused by insufficient pre-treatment, high loading, an undersized inlet area or filter material which is too fine.\nWhile the surface of the filter is kept level to prevent erosion, the bottom slope should be 0.5-1% from inlet to outlet to achieve good drainage (Morel and Diener, 2006).\nThe depth of filter beds is normally around 60 cm with an\nadditional 15 cm freeboard for water accumulation.\nThe required specific surface area is about 3-10 m2/p.e. 15\ndepending on temperature and other factors . In warm climates less area is required due to the higher biological activity. In cold climates the minimum design value should not be below 5 m2/p.e. (for example in Germany). The organic loading per surface area should not exceed 4-10 gBOD/(m2·d) in cold climates (Wood, 1995; Morel and Diener, 2006) or 16 gCOD/(m2·d) (DWA, 2006). No data is available for warm climates with coarse sand substrate.\nThe hydraulic loading should be 60-80 mm/d for greywater (Wood, 1995; Ridderstolpe, 2004; Morel and Diener, 2006) and 40 mm/d for wastewater (DWA,\n general, the design parameter “area requirement per person” is\n 22\n \n Incorrectly designed HFBs may also exhibit “surface run-off”. This occurs if the inlet area is too small or clogged, and the wastewater accumulates at the inlet area, floods the wetland and flows to the outlet without infiltration and hence without treatment.\nTo prevent clogging and surface run-off the following actions are recommended:\n• The best method to avoid clogging and infiltration\nproblems is to optimise the efficiency of the pre-\ntreatment.\n• The inlet zone can be filled with small rocks or coarse\ngravel and should have multiple vertical riser pipes to ensure that the wastewater is distributed evenly over the entire width and depth.\n• Another possibility is to introduce a small dam after 2 m of the bed so that the first part of the HFB’s surface serves as an inlet zone (Figure 21).\n• It is absolutely necessary to carry out a hydraulic\ndimensioning by Darcy’s law to ensure a sufficient 16\nhydraulic gradient in the filter bed .\nThe following points provide basic guidance for the design of HFBs with filter material of coarse sand:\n• An efficient use of the filter area is given by a filter length\n(distance of inlet to outlet) of about 5-8 m (DWA, 2006).\nLonger filter lengths would lead to hydraulic problems.\n• An inlet length (or bed width) of more than 15 m is uncommon in Germany; other design approaches use lengths up to 25 m. Certainly an inlet length of more than 30 m is not recommended as it leads to uneven flow distribution. Rather, the inlet area should be divided into\nseveral compartments with separate inlets.\n• The grain size of the filter media should be large enough to allow continuous flow of the wastewater without clogging, but it should not be too large to reduce the\nefficiency of treatment.\nFigure 21. Left: Side view of the liquid level in a HFB showing inlet dam to control clogging and prevent surface run-off of the wastewater. Left vertical arrow is influent and right vertical arrow is effluent. Right: Top view of correct geometry of larger HFBs where filter length (see vertical arrows) is 5-8 m, and bed width (see horizontal arrows) is maximum of 30 m (source: Platzer, 2000).\n5.2 Vertical flow beds (VFBs)\n5.2.1 Basic design recommendations\nVFBs are more suitable than HFBs when there is a space constraint as they have higher treatment efficiency and therefore need less space.\n16\nIn fluid dynamics and hydrology, Darcy's law is a phenomenologically derived equation that describes the flow of a fluid through a porous medium (source: www.wikipedia.org). See design manuals for details, such as Metcalf and Eddy (2003).\nIn VFBs wastewater is intermittently pumped onto the surface and then drains vertically down through the filter layer towards a drainage system at the bottom. The treatment process is characterised by intermittent short-term loading intervals (4 to 12 doses per day) and long resting periods during which the wastewater percolates through the unsaturated substrate and the surface dries out. The intermittent batch loading enhances the oxygen transfer and leads to high aerobic degradation activities. Therefore, VFBs always need pumps or at least siphon pulse loading, whereas HFBs can be operated without pumps.\nBasic design recommendations for VFBs treating domestic wastewater are:\n• The top surface of the filter has to be kept level and the\ndistribution pipes are often covered with gravel to prevent open water accumulation during the pumping periods.\n• The distribution pipes should be designed in such way that they achieve an even distribution of the pre-treated wastewater on the entire constructed wetland bed (see Figure 6). This is ensured by selecting the right diameter of the distribution pipes, length of pipes, diameter of holes and spacing between holes in the distribution pipes.\n• The distance between drainage pipes is based on the detailed design but may be around 5 m. The drainage pipes are covered with gravel to enable good drainage.\n• A bottom slope of 0.5-1% in direction to the outlet is important for large VFBs.\n• The depth of the sand filter beds should be at least 50 cm, with an additional 20 cm of gravel at the base to cover the drainage pipes, 10 cm gravel on the top of the bed and 15 cm freeboard for water accumulation. The gravel on top prevents free water accumulation on the surface, and could in fact be omitted if there is no access to the CW for members of the public.\n• The required specific surface area is usually 3-4 m2/p.e. 17\nin cold regions and 1-2 m2/p.e. in warm regions . However, this may also vary depending on the reuse option and local legislation. The authors have good experiences with designing VFBs in warm climates with about 1.2 m2/p.e. (Platzer et al., 2007).\n• The organic loading per surface area should be limited to 20 gCOD/(m2·d) in cold climates (DWA, 2006; ÖNORM, 2009). This applies to greywater and wastewater. The authors have made good experiences with designing VFBs in warm climates with about 60-70 gCOD/(m2·d), corresponding to approximately 30-35 gBOD/(m2·d).\n• The hydraulic loading for VFBs in cold climates should not exceed 100-120 mm/d (DWA, 2006). The authors’ experiences showed that in warm climates hydraulic rates up to 200 mm/d of pre-treated wastewater could be applied without negative influence. During rain events, a short-term hydraulic loading of up to 500 mm/d can be applied.\n• The key factor in warm climates is dimensioning according to oxygen availability, see Section 5.2.2.\n17\nIn general, the design parameter “area requirement per person” is lower when treating greywater from an average person. But since greywater characteristics vary widely (e.g. kitchen greywater versus shower greywater), it is better to use the BOD loading as a design parameter. For greywater with low BOD concentrations, the hydraulic loading can be used for the design.\n      23\n \n        Figure 22. Schematic cross-section of a VFB (source: Morel and 18\nDiener, 2006) . The middle layer of coarse sand typically has a height of 50 cm, the top gravel layer a height of 10 cm.\nFigure 23. Schematic cross-section of a VFB showing pre-treatment with a septic tank on the left (source: Fehr, 2003).\nThe development of VFBs has been very rapid since the publication of first results at the IAWQ conference in Cambridge, UK (Cooper and Findlater, 1990). Due to their high treatment capacity for organic matter removal and nitrification, VFBs became “state of the art” during the past 20 years (Platzer, 1999; Philipi et al., 2006, Platzer et al., 2007).\nSuspended solids and organic matter removal is around 90- 99%. Almost complete nitrification with 90% ammonia oxidation is commonly reported. More information on nitrogen removal is provided in Section 3.1.3.\n5.2.2 Soil clogging and soil aeration in VFBs\nAn extremely important aspect of VFBs is the potential risk of soil clogging which results in a general failure of the system (Cooper and Green, 1994; Platzer and Mauch, 1997; Winter and Goetz, 2003). “Temporary” soil clogging occurs regularly in VFBs and is part of the process. Regular resting of the beds reverses the temporary soil clogging.\nIn VFBs clogging occurs as an obstruction of the surface area by suspended solids or due to a fast growing biofilm (sludge). It is caused by poor pre-treatment, high loading or too fine filter sand. The term used in the literature is “soil clogging” even if the term “bed clogging” may be better.\nClogging is a normal reaction caused by the biological activity of the microorganisms. Therefore the system has to be designed large enough so that resting periods in parts of the filter bed can occur. Another possibility to avoid clogging is to keep the load low enough so that it does not occur due to the natural degradation processes.\n18\nNote about this schematic: The distribution pipes are commonly in the top gravel layer.\nThe experiences with soil clogging in constructed wetlands differ widely since the problem depends on many factors. Sufficient soil (or bed) aeration is the main factor for the proper functioning of VFBs, and therefore the following design aspects are very important:\n• Wastewater needs to be pumped onto the VFBs intermittently (4-12 times per day).\n• VFBs treating municipal wastewater should have at least 4 beds in order to be able to rest the beds on a regular basis: 6 weeks in operation and 2 weeks of rest.\n• A uniform distribution of the wastewater is required.\n• The filterable solids loading should be less than\n5 g/(m2·d) and this requires efficient pre-treatment.\n• Adequate plants with well developed rhizome/root systems play an important role in maintaining and\nrestoring soil conductivity.\n• The hydraulic and organic load to the VFBs need to be\nchecked regularly and should not exceed the design values given in the previous section.\nIn VFBs oxygen supply is the key consideration for efficient degradation of organic matter, for nitrification and to avoid clogging. That is why the commonly used design parameter “area per person equivalent” is not sufficient to guarantee good treatment results.\nThe dimensioning of VFBs based on oxygen demand was first developed by Platzer (1999). The design depends on the oxygen demand for oxidation of organic matter and for nitrification as well as the oxygen input (loading frequency, loading volume, roots and surface area).\nThe intermittent batch loading is most significant for oxygen input: an adequate oxygen transfer in VFBs is only guaranteed when application and infiltration occur in a short time with sufficient time lag to the next application.\nThere is still a lack of knowledge about the total impact of all the factors which can influence the treatment efficiency of the constructed wetland: The climate conditions, wastewater characteristics, plant influences and microbial degradation processes. Their interactions between each other are not yet fully understood. Every well planned, operated and monitored constructed wetland can give us important information to gain a better understanding of the treatment process.\n5.3 The French System for combined primary and secondary treatment of raw wastewater\nSince around 1990, a special vertical flow subsurface flow CW for treating raw wastewater has been used in France called the “French System”. A very interesting aspect about this system is that it does not require a pre-treatment step, hence it avoids the associated problems of sludge production and unintentional biogas generation. The pre-treatment is instead performed within the first stage of the French System, which is also a VFB.\nThe following description of this two-stage VFB system is mainly based on a publication by Molle et al. (2005).\nThe first stage of the French System is a VFB filled with gravel and is designed for pre-treatment of raw wastewater. The raw wastewater, after screening or even without screening, is pumped onto this bed through pipes of typically 100 mm diameter. These distribution pipes have no holes along the pipe length, unlike those of conventional VFBs\n   24\n \n which have small holes. The pre-treated effluent then passes through the second stage for further treatment, which is a VFB filled with coarse sand.\nMolle et al. (2005) recommend dividing the first stage for raw wastewater treatment into three VFBs, and the second stage for secondary treatment into two VFBs as can be seen in Figure 24.\nFigure 24. French System, from left to right: three VFBs (filters) for pre-treatment and two VFBs for secondary treatment in Albondón, Spain, with 800 inhabitants. The plant needs no electricity supply as it is built on a slope (photo by T. Burkard, 2005).\nThe first stage is operated in alternating phases to control the growth of biomass and maintain aerobic conditions in the VFB. Each VFB receives all raw wastewater for 3-4 days, and then is rested for 6-8 days while the other filter beds are used.\nThe raw wastewater is treated (or “filtered”) in the first stage in vertical flow: it passes first through a 30 cm fine gravel layer (2-8 mm particle size), then through a 10-20 cm transition gravel layer (5-20mm particle size) and then reaches the drainage layer (gravel with 20-40 mm particle size or even 30-60 mm particle size) in the bottom of the filter\nbed (see Figure 25). The solids are retained on the surface 19\n20\nlayer (d10 of 0.25 mm to 0.4 mm) . In France all the filter\nbeds are usually planted with common reed (Phragmites australis).\nFigure 26. Distribution pipes for raw wastewater in first stage (VFB) in French System in Albondón, Spain (photo by T. Burkard, 2007).\nFor dimensioning of the French System for municipal wastewater treatment, Molle et al. (2005) recommend:\n• For the first stage: 1.2 m2/p.e. (equivalent to an average\n  where they are mineralised\n(see Figure 26).\n• For the second stage: 0.8m2/p.e. divided over two parallel or alternately fed filter beds. This results in a very low average load of 25 gCOD/(m2·d).\nMolle et al. (2005) reported for the very highly loaded gravel bed (first stage) a removal efficiency of 80% COD, 86% TSS and 50% TKN, which is more efficient than any conventional pre-treatment process. In some countries these results would even be sufficient for river discharge. The retained solids form a sludge layer, which limits the infiltration and improves the water distribution on the surface.\nThe sludge accumulation on the filter bed of the first stage is about 1.5 cm per year. The sludge mineralises on the surface of the filter bed and has to be removed after 10-15 years, when a layer of up to 20 cm has accumulated. The reuse of the sludge for agricultural purposes is possible but, as always, depends also on the heavy metals content of the wastewater.\nThe second stage is needed to complete nitrification and to achieve pathogen removal and for further reduction of COD and TSS (this is called “polishing”). The French system for raw wastewater treatment typically removes 90% of COD, 96% of TSS and 85% of TKN.\nThis system is an interesting option for small communities as it is simple and low-cost. It avoids the disadvantages of conventional pre-treatment, namely primary sludge production and biogas emissions (see Section 4.2). The French System has been used since over 20 years, and approximately 500 constructed wetlands of this type exist in France. Some plants are now also in use in Germany, Portugal and Spain.\nIn general the space requirement of the French System in comparison to conventional VFBs and HFBs is as follows (as the French system already includes the pre-treatment, the\n20\nThe d10 is the grain diameter which corresponds to the grain size where 10% of the grains are smaller than that grain size (see Appendix for further details).\nloading of 100 gCOD/(m2·d); 10 gTKN/(m2·d) and 120 L/(m2·d) identical alternately fed units.\n50 gTSS/(m2·d); divided over three\n Figure 25. Pre-treatment of raw wastewater in the first stage (a VFB) of the French System (source: Molle et al., 2005). Wastewater flows out of the end of the distribution pipes (without small holes along the pipe length).\nThe two VFBs used in the second stage can be operated in parallel with the option to rest one filter or to alternate the operation. The VFBs of the second stage have a 30 cm sand\n19\nIn biology, mineralisation refers to the process where an organic substance is converted to an inorganic substance.\n   25\n \n area requirement for pre-treatment would still need to be added in the case of VFBs and HFBs):\n• for warm climates:\nHFB > French system > VFB (meaning VFBs require\nthe least space)\n• for cold climates:\nHFB > VFB > French system (meaning the French System requires the least space)\nDisadvantages of the French System include:\n• Due to the necessity of intermittent loading for each of\nthe two stages, two pumping stations are necessary. A self priming siphon for the intermittent batch loading of the filter beds can sometimes be used to avoid pumping. Siphons need sufficient difference in height between the level of influent and the surface area.\n• The French System is not suitable for small household level systems due to potential hygienic problems of having open access to raw wastewater in the garden or near the house.\n• Many experts hesitate to build the French System because they fear lack of acceptance due to raw wastewater application onto the filter beds. The system should therefore not be built in densely populated areas in order to avoid problems with the social acceptance.\nIn our view, the French System has significant potential for the future for domestic wastewater treatment plants at community level which are fenced off to avoid uncontrolled access.\n5.4 Hybrid systems\nVarious types of subsurface flow CWs can be combined in order to achieve higher treatment efficiencies especially for nitrogen and pathogen removal. In these systems, the advantages of the HFB and VFB systems are combined to complement each other. There has been a growing interest in hybrid systems, although they are more expensive to build and more complicated to operate than non-hybrid systems.\n5.5 Project examples\nTable 6 contains examples of constructed wetlands for treating greywater and domestic wastewater. In hot climates, the specific area can be relatively low, as the biological activity is high. It is however risky to build wetlands that are too aggressively designed with a low specific area, as there is a higher risk of process failure.\nTable 6.

Both wastewater streams are\ntreated separately in two constructed wetlands and are 25\nsubsequently used for irrigation purposes .\nThe school uses about 200 m3 potable water per month. 18 persons are constantly living in the school area and some 40 persons come from outside. The daily occupation was calculated with 70 p.e. As all sanitary installations already existed, greywater separation was only possible for the commercial school bakery, laundry and two kitchens (the school kitchen and a private one). In the school ́s kitchen around 60 meals per day are prepared.\n 21\n22\n23\n24\nhttp://www.susana.org/lang-en/case-studies\nWetland type: VFB followed by HFB Brownwater is a mixture of faeces and water.

The specific blackwater load per person had to be estimated in advance, which is a common challenge in sustainable sanitation projects. It is always recommended to use adequate safety factors in the calculations in order to avoid overload situations.\nTable7.

Left: Malfunctioning grease trap with too much sludge accumulation. Right: the sludge from the grease trap obstructs the infiltration area of the CW which has become black because there is no oxygen transport anymore and it has become clogged (photo by H. Hoffmann, 2009).\nThe operational tasks required for the constructed wetland filter bed includes regular checking of:\n• pumps\n• inlet structures for obstructions and for the water level\n• outlet structures for the water level\n• hydraulic loading rate and pollutant loads, i.e. influent\nand effluent concentrations of BOD and SS as well as\ninfluent flowrate\n• wetland vegetation for disease, insects, etc. (remove\nweeds and predatory plants until the wetland vegetation is fully established).\nIf maintenance is ignored, the following consequences will occur sooner or later:\n• uneven flow distribution\n• local overloading and odour\n• deterioration of treatment efficiency.\n6.2 Tasks for the operation of HFBs\nIt is very important to check the filter bed for clogging. Clogging occurs for example in HFBs which were built too long, i.e. where the horizontal distance between inlet and outlet is too long. Such HFBs have a high hydraulic load in a relatively short inlet zone.\nA possible refurbishment step for such HFBs is to split the HFB in the middle after half of the horizontal length, by digging a trench and placing drainage pipes there. The new trench will thus become an inlet or “feeding” trench as well. With this modification, the inlet zone doubles and the flow distance is halved.\nAnother possibility is to introduce a small dam after 2 m of the inlet to the bed (see Figure 21). With this measure, the first part of the HFB serves as an inlet zone.\nFurther tasks for the operator and thus considerations for the designer include:\n• When sludge accumulates in the inlet zone of the HFB,\nthe filter bed has to be taken out of operation so that it can dry out. In the worst case, all affected filter material in the inlet area has to be exchanged.

Blackwater is pre-treated in a compost filter (see Section 4.5), 25% BOD reduction was estimated.\nResults after two years of operation:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n6\n6.1\nThe BOD removal in the VFBs for greywater (21 m2) and blackwater (70 m2) is about 95%.\nThe removal of suspended solids is about 90% in the greywater VFB, and 86% in the blackwater VFB.\nThe number of thermotolerant coliform bacteria is in the effluent less than 1 000 per 100 ml.\nAll treated water is used for irrigation of crops, trees and green areas (Hoffmann, 2008).\nOperation and maintenance\nOperational tasks for HFBs and VFBs\nWhilst constructed wetlands are “low tech” systems they still require adequate maintenance by a trained person with basic skills.\nThe pre-treatment unit requires maintenance as indicated in Section 4 depending on the type of technology. The efficiency of the pre-treatment units has to be checked on a regular basis. The larger the system, the higher the required frequency. The effluent from the pre-treatment system should be analysed for settleable solids by using an “Imhoff cone” in order to know the quantity of solids being transferred to the wetland. The sludge of the pre-treatment systems has to be removed regularly.\n 27\n \n   •\n•\n6.3\nmaterial is exchanged, the CW cannot operate and treat wastewater.\nEspecially in the case of HFBs it is recommended to have the possibility to occasionally dam up the filter bed completely in order to be able to control the growth of the wetland plants.\nIn order to guarantee sufficient aeration of the filter bed it is recommended to have the option to lower the water level down to the bottom of the HFB.\nTasks for the operation of VFBs\nVFBs need more operation and maintenance than HFBs. The following operation and maintenance activities should be performed for VFBs:\n• The even distribution of pre-treated effluent on the entire\nsurface is important for VFBs and has to be monitored. Valves at the front of the distribution pipes and removable caps at the end allow the cleaning of the pipes during the pumping phases (see Figure 29). In case a filter bed, or areas of the filter bed, is affected by clogging and has to rest, the valves can be closed.\n• Wastewater feeding intervals have to be maintained by an automatic system with pumps or siphons. However, VFBs for the treatment of greywater of households can be designed without a pump or siphon, if the production of greywater has suitable and regular intervals.\n• The surface has to have the possibility to dry out between each charging with wastewater.\n• Immediate action has to be taken in the case of clogging (see Section 5.2.2 for details). A VFB can recover well after a resting period of two weeks where the filter bed can dry out. However, in cold climate zones with low temperature and freezing periods (temperature 0-8°C ) a VFB cannot recover so quickly. That is why VFBs have to be designed much larger in cold climate zones (see Table 3).\n• It is better to overload one part of the filter bed in order to give the other part a rest than to expect the entire system to recover at the same time. Once clogged, the system does not recover without resting periods. It has been shown that a VFB can almost completely regain its efficiency after longer resting periods (Platzer and Mauch, 1997). Such a resting period is needed to completely dry out the clogged layer and may be as short as three weeks in a dry, sunny climate to about six months in a cold, wet climate.\nFigure 29. Left: cleaning the wastewater distribution pipes by opening and closing valves and caps during the pumping phase (medium sized papyrus umbrella sedge plants just after re-planting). Right: opened cap on a blocked distribution pipe (photos of VFB for blackwater treatment at school in Lima, Peru by H. Hoffmann, 2009)\n6.4 Should wetland plants be harvested or not?\nWhether plants from constructed wetlands should be harvested or not is a question of debate. A general answer cannot be given, but plants need to be harvested if they affect the operation or the maintenance activities. Experiences in warm climate zones showed that in VFBs plants should be removed every two years to enable a visual check of the distribution system.\nAlso, there is a difference between a “hot and dry” and a “hot and humid” climate. For example, in Dubai with a hot and dry climate, the decay rate of the accumulated dead reed on the surface is very slow while in Brazil with a hot and wet climate it is very fast. Hence, a constructed wetland in Dubai will need more frequent harvesting than one in Brazil (see Figure 30 and Sievert and Schlick (2009)).\nBenefits of harvesting plants from constructed wetlands include:\n• Nutrients which have been taken up by the plants will be\nremoved from the system.\n• Less plant biomass can make maintenance tasks easier\nin the case of VFBs.\n• It might be possible to use the plant material as fodder\ncrop or straw.\nBenefits of not harvesting plants from constructed wetlands include:\n• Creation of an isolating layer of dead plant material – this\nis only important for moderate climate zones.\n• Provision of a carbon source for denitrification if nitrogen\nremoval is important.\n• No alteration of the ecological functioning of wetlands.\n• Less work for the maintenance staff.\n 28\n \n    Figure 30. Constructed wetland in Dubai for wastewater treatment where the reed reached a height of 6 m (photo by W. Sievert, 2007).\nFigure 31. Cyperus papyrus after 12 months of growth in a VFB: Growth has occurred on the surface but without enough vertical roots. The plants may fall over and do not contribute to the treatment process anymore. They need to be removed and replanted (photo by H. Hoffmann, 2008).\n6.5 Basic trouble-shooting\nAn indication of the performance of the filter bed can be obtained by checking the effluent of the constructed wetland for visual appearance and odour:\n• Turbidity and/or greyish colour is an indicator for\ninsufficient oxygen supply. The reaction should be:\no In the case of VFBs, a uniform distribution should be ensured. It might be that the intervals between the influent pumping events are too short. Thus the surface cannot dry out and this may lead to\nclogging.\no In case of HFBs the effluent drainage should be\nlowered in order to allow more oxygen supply within\nthe filter bed.\n• An unpleasant smell like foul eggs indicates anaerobic\nconditions within the filter bed. This is a very critical situation. The filter bed should be rested and the load to the filter bed should be lowered in order to increase the oxygen supply (see Section 5.2.2).\n• Clear effluent but slightly yellowish or brownish colour due to humic acids is a normal situation in biological treatment systems, especially wetlands (see Figure 4).\n• Oily matter in the effluent sometimes occurs especially in HFBs; this effect can also be caused by humic substances.\nIf possible, effluent samples should also be analysed professionally in a water laboratory from time to time, especially when the effluent is reused for irrigation.\n7 References and further resources\nNote: For all documents which are copyright-free, a URL link is provided.

Municipal wastewater contains domestic wastewater plus industrial wastewater, storm water runoff and infiltration water.\nSelected papers of the IWA Specialist Group Conferences have been published in:\n7.3 Photos and technical drawings\nGIZ and partners have compiled a large collection of constructed wetland photos on the photo sharing website Flickr.com, see here (or use the search word “constructed wetland”):\n  Technical drawings are available here:\nhttp://www.susana.org/lang-en/library/rm-technical-drawings\n Table 8. countries.\nTypical unit loading factors in raw wastewater for four\n       Load a b c d\ng/(capita·d)\nBrazil\nPeru Germany USA\n50 60 85\n120 198\n907095\n12 11 13\n     BOD 54\nCOD\nTSS 90\nTKN 10\n                    Total P\nOil and grease\nFlowrate in L/(capita·d)\nNotes: a\ne 15\nf 100-300\n3\n150-250\n1.8 3\n31\nf\n100-150 190-460\n      Proceedings of the \"Wetland Pollution Dynamics and Control (WETPOL)\" conferences: www.wetpol.org\n                Jordão and Pessoa (2009)\nIn Spanish: Norma de Saneamiento S.090 (1997) Resolución Ministerial No 048-97-MTC/15 VC del 27/01/97 – Reglamento Nacional de Construcciones, Perú\nc\nd\ne\nf\nThe characterisation of domestic wastewater is usually expressed as load per capita, and the typical values are well documented for industrialised countries but less so for developing countries. The mass of BOD discharged by individuals varies in a relatively narrow range (see Table 8) and this variation is primarily due to the differences in diet as well as socio-economic status. In developing countries such as Egypt, India, Palestine, Zambia or Kenya, the BOD loads are only around 30 g per person per day (Metcalf and Eddy (2003); Jordão and Pessoa (2009)).\nThe flowrate and concentration of the wastewater is a result of the potable water consumption. The per capital water consumption can vary immensely between countries or even within a country due to different income levels.\nb\n Selected papers of the WETPOL Conferences have been published in:\nDWA (2000), 85%-ile value\nMetcalf and Eddy (2003)\nBased on concentration values of oil and grease in Brazil\nBased on concentration values of BOD in Brazil/Germany\n Website of a large research project in Germany which was completed in 2003 and contains important reports (in German and English): www.bodenfilter.de/engdef.htm\n(design of website: K. Tempel and H. Kolster, 2003;\nowner: G. Fehr)\n   32\n \n The Peruvian capital Lima for instance is situated in a desert, but wealthy households use up to 400 L water per person per day, whereas people who live in informal settlements without\n26 public water supply use only 20 L per person per day .\nIn contrast to the situation in Lima, the lower water consumption in Germany is due to more conscious use of water and due to higher water prices. Lower water consumption results in wastewater which is more concentrated but the mass loads per capita (such as gCOD/(person·d)) stay the same regardless of the respective water consumption.\nThe characterisation of domestic wastewater is not complete without discussing the presence of pathogens. This aspect is discussed separately in Section 8.2.\n8.1.2 Greywater\nGreywater is defined as household wastewater without toilet discharge. It should thus not contain urine and faeces but in practice it can contain traces of both, and thus traces of pathogens. For an estimate of the quantity, see Ridderstolpe (2004) and Ottoson (2003). The pathogens in greywater originate mainly from the following contamination pathways:\n• Washing a person’s anal area in the shower or bath.\n• Washing nappies or underwear.\n• Re-growth of pathogens (in particular bacteria) in the\ngreywater collection tank.\nGreywater is the wastewater from sources such as showers, baths, hand washing sinks, laundry, cleaning of floors, kitchen sinks and alike. Compared to domestic wastewater, greywater has significantly lower per capita loads of organic matter, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and pathogens. Standard values for these loads do not exist because greywater characteristics vary widely, depending on the sources of the greywater.\nThe concentration of organic matter in greywater may differ significantly from domestic wastewater: the organic matter concentration is much lower when the greywater is just from showers/laundries, but is higher when the greywater is from kitchens and restaurants.\nA detailed analysis of greywater characteristics was published by Ridderstolpe (2004) for Swedish conditions and by Gulyas (2007) for German conditions. Greywater characteristics in South Africa and Kenya have been analysed by Carden et al. (2007), Mungai (2008), Kraft (2009) and Raude et al. (2009).\nGreywater treatment and reuse for example as part of ecological sanitation (ecosan) concepts, is a relatively new concept which is often considered as a more simple form of wastewater treatment, but there is still a lack of experience. Most greywater treatment technologies are derived from conventional wastewater treatment and were not developed specifically for greywater treatment.\nThe quantity of greywater generated depends on the income level of the household. As a general rule: the richer the\n26\n20 L water per person per day is regarded as the absolute minimum water consumption for staying healthy by the World Health Organisation (see “Water, health and human rights”, 2003, http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/humanrights/en/).\npeople, the more greywater they produce. Households without in-house water connection produce greywater which is more concentrated than wastewater from wealthy areas, due to the lower water consumption and existing reuse practices: Water is first used for personal hygiene, then for washing clothes and then for washing the floor.\nFor households with dry toilets such as pit latrines, urine 27\ndiversion dehydration toilets or composting toilets, the\ngreywater production equals the total wastewater production of the household. On the other hand, for households with flush toilets, the greywater production is equal to the total wastewater flow minus the amount used for toilet flushing. Wastewater from toilet flushing is called “blackwater” and its quantity depends on the flush toilet type. Normally the volume varies between 40-60 L/(cap·d).\nThe following greywater quantities were measured at sustainable sanitation projects in Peru and Brazil by the main authors:\n• Hand washing in public toilet: 0.5-1 L water per\nhandwashing event\n• Having a 5-minute shower: 40 L water\n• Preparing a basic three-course meal in a restaurant and\nwashing dishes afterwards: 5-25 L water.\nThe specific water use depends on the region and the appliances, and also the composition of these effluents is different and sometimes difficult to predict. Some examples are given below.\nGreywater from showers or laundry:\n• This greywater contains detergents, the degradability of which depends on the product; it is recommended to use biodegradable detergents. Textile fibres and human hair are often only poorly retained in greywater screens, and can cause problems in pumps and valves. Regular cleaning of the pumps and valves is required.\n• Unexpected habits, such as urinating in the shower, could lead to odour problems when shower effluent is treated on its own (at hostels, sporting grounds or camping places) or when the effluent is stored before treatment.\nGreywater from kitchens, bakeries or restaurants:\n• This type of greywater can have a very high organic load from food scraps and oil and grease which can result in a high concentration of organic matter of more than 500 mgBOD/L. In this case anaerobic pre-treatment with use of biogas can be a suitable option, especially in warm climates.\n• Greywater from kitchen sinks can have a high amount of sand from washing of vegetables, but most conventional grease traps are not designed for sand removal. See Section 4.3 for a solution of this problem.\n• Furthermore the use of ash for dishwashing can cause problems with soil clogging in subsurface flow CWs, especially when the effluent is mixed with soap from laundry wastewater: Ash and soap form a coagulant which can pass grease traps but remains on the surface of the subsurface flow CW. Therefore, use of ash for dishwashing is not recommended here.\n27\nFor more details on UDDTs (urine diversion dehydration toilets), see Winker and von Muench (2009).\n    33\n \n 8.2 Appendix 2: Further details on pathogens and their removal in constructed wetlands\nPathogens which are transmitted by wastewater or contaminated water (waterborne diseases) are for instance (WHO, 2006):\n• Bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio\ncholera, Shigella, Legionella, Leptospira, Yersinia.\n• Protozoa: Entamoeba, Giardia and Cryptosporidium.\n• Helminths (intestinal worms): Ascaris, Enterobios,\nTaenia, Schistosoma, Trichuris, Fasciola.\n• Viruses: Adeno-, Entero-, Hepatitis A-, Polio-, Rota-, 28\nNorwalk Virus.\nTypical diseases are unspecific diarrhoeas with cramps and vomiting, nausea, dehydration or typhoid fever, cholera, poliomyelitis or also respiratory diseases (such as adenovirus). Concentrations of pathogens in raw wastewater are shown in Table 9.\nwith earthworms). Possible treatment methods to inactivate helminth eggs in faeces include thermophilic composting or long-term storage (WHO, 2006, volume 4).\nProtozoa and viruses:\nProtozoa like Giardia and Cryptosporidium have a significant impact on persons with compromised immune systems. The infection is caused by ingestion of contaminated water, and the cysts and oocysts are excreted with the faeces and are therefore common in wastewater. The elimination rate of these small particles (3-14 μm) is the same as for viruses.\nEvery stage of treatment eliminates some pathogens. Generally speaking, highly loaded systems eliminate fewer pathogens than low loaded systems with long retention times (see Table 10).\nTable 10. Log unit reduction of pathogens by selected treatment processes (from WHO (2006), volume 2).\n     Table 9.

The pathogen removal efficiency depends on the retention time and on the filtering material: HFBs are more efficient than VFBs, and sand is always much more efficient than gravel.\nSome reuse applications require a final disinfection of the effluent by tertiary treatment steps such as:\n• Chlorine and chlorine compounds which cause oxidation\nof all organic matter. Chlorine is toxic to bacteria and all\nother organisms.\n• UV radiation: works by inflicting photochemical damage\non pathogens. UV radiation is more expensive than chlorine disinfection but is without environmental and health risks.\no Cysts and oocytes are not inactivated by conventional disinfection using chlorine, whereas UV disinfection seems to be extremely effective (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003).\no Viruses are inactivated by chlorine, but UV radiation seems to be more efficient for virus inactivation (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003).\nGood pre-treatment and extended retention times in subsurface flow CWs with coarse sand is the best possible design for effective pathogen removal in constructed wetlands.\n        Most of the thermo-tolerant coliform bacteria types are not pathogens, but the probability that pathogenic bacteria are transmitted can only be minimised by reducing all of the\nbacteria. It is important to mention that bacteria survive in hot 32\nclimates for longer periods (WHO, 2006) .\nHelminth eggs:\nThe prevalence of helminth infections in the world correlate clearly with sanitation coverage. The infections rates of the population, particularly children, in developing countries can be very high. Helminths are transmitted by eggs, which are resistant against chlorine disinfection and are relative large (10-100 μm) (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). Therefore, sedimentation in a pond with a long residence time as pre- treatment, followed by filtration in constructed wetlands show good elimination results.\nThe eggs persist in the sludge of waste stabilisation ponds and other sedimentation processes, and can survive for more than 10 years (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). The eggs should be deactivated before this sludge is used in agriculture.\nHelminth eggs are not affected by lime (calcium carbonate), mesophilic digestion nor by vermi-composting (composting\n28\nThere is no evidence that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is\ntransmitted by wastewater (Metcalf & Eddy, 2003). 29\n 30\n31\n32\nJordao and Pessoa (2005)\nMetcalf and Eddy (2003)\nWHO (2006), volume 2\nThis could lead to more problems with waterborne diseases as a\nresult of climate change in those regions where wastewater is not treated.\n 34\n \n 8.3 Appendix 3: Recommended grain size distribution of sand in subsurface flow CWs\nIt is important to pay attention to the grain size of the sand used as filter material in subsurface flow CWs. The most important aspect is a sufficiently coarse grain size. The d10 (see in the figure below), which corresponds to the grain size where 10% of the grains are smaller than that grain size, should be between 0.1 mm and 0.4 mm. Ideally, the d10 should be closer to 0.4 mm. The sand should not have a d10 coarser than 0.4 mm as the filtration effect in the filter bed would deteriorate.

      "content": " # 3. Wastewater Treatment Process Description\n\nThe Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad, Iraq, employs a unique design to efficiently treat the wastewater generated by the healthcare complex and its surrounding areas. The treatment facility is designed as a 100-meter diameter circular shaft, delving deep underground, and positioned adjacent to a river. The system is split into two primary shafts, each designated for specific stages of the treatment process.\n\n## 3.1 Shaft 1: Primary Clarification\n\nShaft 1 is the first stage of the treatment process, where wastewater from the city's sewage system enters. The primary clarification process begins in this shaft, where large settleable solids and particulate matter are removed from the wastewater through a combination of gravitational settling and mechanical screening. The clarified water then transitions to Shaft 2 for further treatment, while the removed solids are directed towards sludge processing.\n\nBaghdad's hot and dry climate can accelerate odor generation in this stage due to the high temperatures and potential for anaerobic conditions. To mitigate odors, proper ventilation and regular removal of settled solids are crucial. Chemical dosing, such as the addition of iron salts or nitrate, can help control sulfide formation and associated odors.\n\n## 3.2 Shaft 2: Activated Sludge and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)\n\nShaft 2 is where the biological treatment occurs. The activated sludge process is used to reduce the organic content, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Microorganisms in the activated sludge break down the organic matter, converting it into more stable forms.\n\nFollowing the activated sludge process, the wastewater undergoes dissolved air flotation (DAF), where fine particles are floated to the surface and skimmed off. This step effectively reduces the levels of fine suspended solids and other contaminants.\n\nMaintaining aerobic conditions in the activated sludge process is essential to prevent odor generation. Adequate aeration and mixing should be provided to ensure a sufficient supply of oxygen to the microorganisms. High temperatures in Baghdad can increase the rate of biological activity, which may require higher aeration rates compared to cooler climates.\n\n## 3.3 Final Stages: Disinfection and Discharge\n\nAfter the wastewater has undergone clarification and biological treatment, it moves to the final stages of the process. The treated water undergoes disinfection, typically using sodium hypochlorite, to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. The now treated and safe water is then discharged into the adjacent river, completing the purification cycle.\n\n## 3.4 Sludge Processing\n\nConcurrently, the sludge collected from the primary clarification and excess biomass from the activated sludge process are treated separately. They undergo thickening, dewatering, and potentially further stabilization processes before being repurposed or safely disposed of.\n\nOdor control during sludge processing is crucial, as this stage can be a significant source of odors. Covering sludge handling areas, providing adequate ventilation, and using odor control systems such as biofilters or chemical scrubbers can help minimize odor emissions.\n\n# 4. Key Odor-Generating Areas and Recommended Control Technologies\n\n## 4.1 Headworks (Screening and Grit Removal)\n\nThe headworks, which include screening and grit removal processes, are a significant source of odors due to the presence of raw wastewater and the accumulation of solid waste. The high organic content and potential for anaerobic conditions contribute to the generation of strong odors, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for the headworks include:\n\n1. **Containment and Ventilation**: Enclosing the headworks area and providing adequate ventilation can help capture and control odorous emissions. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters, chemical scrubbers, or activated carbon adsorption systems.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: Biofilters are a biological treatment method that uses microorganisms to degrade odorous compounds. They are effective in treating a wide range of odors, including H2S and VOCs. Biofilters require a relatively large footprint but have low operating costs and minimal environmental impact.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers use a liquid solution, typically containing chemicals such as sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite, to absorb and remove odorous compounds from the air. They are effective for removing specific compounds, such as H2S, but may have higher capital and operating costs compared to biofilters.\n\n4. **Activated Carbon Adsorption**: Activated carbon adsorption systems use granular or pelletized activated carbon to remove odorous compounds from the air. The odorous compounds are adsorbed onto the surface of the activated carbon, which has a high surface area and porosity. Activated carbon systems are effective for removing a wide range of odorous compounds but require periodic replacement or regeneration of the carbon media.\n\n## 4.2 Primary Clarifiers\n\nPrimary clarifiers are another potential source of odors due to the accumulation of settleable solids and the formation of anaerobic conditions. Odorous compounds, such as H2S, can be generated from the surface of the clarifiers and during sludge removal.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for primary clarifiers include:\n\n1. **Covers**: Installing covers on the primary clarifiers can help contain odorous emissions and prevent their release into the atmosphere. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters or biotrickling filters.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: As mentioned earlier, biofilters are effective in treating a wide range of odorous compounds. They can be used to treat the air collected from the covered primary clarifiers.\n\n3. **Biotrickling Filters**: Biotrickling filters are similar to biofilters but use an inert packing material instead of organic media. A nutrient solution is continuously trickled over the packing material to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. Biotrickling filters are effective for treating high-concentration odorous air streams and have a smaller footprint compared to biofilters.\n\n## 4.3 Aeration Basins\n\nAeration basins, where the activated sludge process takes place, are less likely to generate significant odors if properly designed and operated. However, odorous compounds, particularly VOCs, can still be stripped from the wastewater surface and released into the air.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for aeration basins include:\n\n1. **Aeration Optimization**: Proper aeration design and operation are crucial for minimizing odor generation in aeration basins. Adequate mixing and sufficient oxygen supply help maintain aerobic conditions and prevent the formation of anaerobic zones, which can lead to odor generation.\n\n2. **Biotrickling Filters**: Biotrickling filters can be used to treat the air collected from the aeration basins, particularly if there are concerns about VOC emissions.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers can be employed to remove specific odorous compounds, such as H2S or ammonia, from the air released from the aeration basins.\n\n## 4.4 Sludge Handling and Treatment\n\nSludge handling and treatment processes, including thickening, dewatering, and stabilization, can be significant sources of odors. The anaerobic conditions and high organic content of the sludge can lead to the generation of strong odors, such as H2S and ammonia.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for sludge handling and treatment include:\n\n1. **Enclosures**: Enclosing sludge handling and treatment areas can help contain odorous emissions and prevent their release into the atmosphere. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters, chemical scrubbers, or activated carbon adsorption systems.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: Biofilters are effective in treating a wide range of odorous compounds generated from sludge handling and treatment processes.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers can be used to remove specific odorous compounds, such as H2S or ammonia, from the air released during sludge handling and treatment.\n\n4. **Activated Carbon Adsorption**: Activated carbon adsorption systems can be employed as a polishing step to remove residual odorous compounds from the treated air.\n\n## 4.5 Novel Methods: Reed Beds and Vetiver Systems\n\nIn addition to the conventional odor control technologies discussed above, there are novel methods that can be integrated into the wastewater treatment process to enhance odor control and treatment efficiency. Two such methods are reed bed systems and vetiver systems.\n\n### 4.5.1 Reed Bed Systems\n\nReed bed systems, also known as constructed wetlands, are a natural and sustainable approach to wastewater treatment and odor control. They consist of shallow basins filled with gravel or sand and planted with wetland vegetation, such as reeds (Phragmites australis). As wastewater flows through the reed bed, physical, chemical, and biological processes work together to remove contaminants and reduce odors.\n\nReed bed systems offer several advantages for odor control:\n\n- The roots of the reeds create an extensive network that supports the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms, enhancing the biological treatment of odorous compounds.\n- The reeds transfer oxygen from their leaves to their roots, creating aerobic zones within the reed bed that promote the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds, such as H2S.\n- The dense vegetation in the reed bed acts as a physical barrier, reducing the release of odorous compounds into the atmosphere.\n\nCase studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of reed bed systems in reducing odors from wastewater treatment plants. For example, a study by Moshiri (1993) showed that a reed bed system reduced H2S concentrations by up to 99% and significantly improved the overall odor profile of the treated wastewater.\n\n### 4.5.2 Vetiver Systems\n\nVetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides) is a fast-growing, perennial grass that has been used for various environmental applications, including wastewater treatment and odor control. Vetiver systems involve planting vetiver grass in constructed wetlands or on the periphery of wastewater treatment facilities to mitigate odors and improve treatment efficiency.\n\nVetiver systems offer several benefits for odor control:\n\n- Vetiver grass has a deep and extensive root system that can reach up to 3 meters in depth, providing a large surface area for the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms.\n- The roots of vetiver grass release oxygen into the rhizosphere, creating aerobic conditions that favor the oxidation of odorous compounds.\n- Vetiver grass is known to absorb and accumulate heavy metals, which can help reduce the concentration of these contaminants in the wastewater and mitigate associated odors.\n\nA study by Danh et al. (2009) demonstrated the effectiveness of vetiver systems in treating domestic wastewater and reducing odors. The study found that vetiver systems achieved high removal rates of organic matter, nutrients, and pathogens, while significantly reducing odor emissions compared to conventional treatment methods.\n\nIntegrating reed bed systems and vetiver systems into the wastewater treatment process at the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad can provide an eco-friendly and sustainable approach to odor control.

            "text": " # 3. Wastewater Treatment Process Description\n\nThe Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad, Iraq, employs a unique design to efficiently treat the wastewater generated by the healthcare complex and its surrounding areas. The treatment facility is designed as a 100-meter diameter circular shaft, delving deep underground, and positioned adjacent to a river. The system is split into two primary shafts, each designated for specific stages of the treatment process.\n\n## 3.1 Shaft 1: Primary Clarification\n\nShaft 1 is the first stage of the treatment process, where wastewater from the city's sewage system enters. The primary clarification process begins in this shaft, where large settleable solids and particulate matter are removed from the wastewater through a combination of gravitational settling and mechanical screening. The clarified water then transitions to Shaft 2 for further treatment, while the removed solids are directed towards sludge processing.\n\nBaghdad's hot and dry climate can accelerate odor generation in this stage due to the high temperatures and potential for anaerobic conditions. To mitigate odors, proper ventilation and regular removal of settled solids are crucial. Chemical dosing, such as the addition of iron salts or nitrate, can help control sulfide formation and associated odors.\n\n## 3.2 Shaft 2: Activated Sludge and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)\n\nShaft 2 is where the biological treatment occurs. The activated sludge process is used to reduce the organic content, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Microorganisms in the activated sludge break down the organic matter, converting it into more stable forms.\n\nFollowing the activated sludge process, the wastewater undergoes dissolved air flotation (DAF), where fine particles are floated to the surface and skimmed off. This step effectively reduces the levels of fine suspended solids and other contaminants.\n\nMaintaining aerobic conditions in the activated sludge process is essential to prevent odor generation. Adequate aeration and mixing should be provided to ensure a sufficient supply of oxygen to the microorganisms. High temperatures in Baghdad can increase the rate of biological activity, which may require higher aeration rates compared to cooler climates.\n\n## 3.3 Final Stages: Disinfection and Discharge\n\nAfter the wastewater has undergone clarification and biological treatment, it moves to the final stages of the process. The treated water undergoes disinfection, typically using sodium hypochlorite, to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. The now treated and safe water is then discharged into the adjacent river, completing the purification cycle.\n\n## 3.4 Sludge Processing\n\nConcurrently, the sludge collected from the primary clarification and excess biomass from the activated sludge process are treated separately. They undergo thickening, dewatering, and potentially further stabilization processes before being repurposed or safely disposed of.\n\nOdor control during sludge processing is crucial, as this stage can be a significant source of odors. Covering sludge handling areas, providing adequate ventilation, and using odor control systems such as biofilters or chemical scrubbers can help minimize odor emissions.\n\n# 4. Key Odor-Generating Areas and Recommended Control Technologies\n\n## 4.1 Headworks (Screening and Grit Removal)\n\nThe headworks, which include screening and grit removal processes, are a significant source of odors due to the presence of raw wastewater and the accumulation of solid waste. The high organic content and potential for anaerobic conditions contribute to the generation of strong odors, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for the headworks include:\n\n1. **Containment and Ventilation**: Enclosing the headworks area and providing adequate ventilation can help capture and control odorous emissions. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters, chemical scrubbers, or activated carbon adsorption systems.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: Biofilters are a biological treatment method that uses microorganisms to degrade odorous compounds. They are effective in treating a wide range of odors, including H2S and VOCs. Biofilters require a relatively large footprint but have low operating costs and minimal environmental impact.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers use a liquid solution, typically containing chemicals such as sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite, to absorb and remove odorous compounds from the air. They are effective for removing specific compounds, such as H2S, but may have higher capital and operating costs compared to biofilters.\n\n4. **Activated Carbon Adsorption**: Activated carbon adsorption systems use granular or pelletized activated carbon to remove odorous compounds from the air. The odorous compounds are adsorbed onto the surface of the activated carbon, which has a high surface area and porosity. Activated carbon systems are effective for removing a wide range of odorous compounds but require periodic replacement or regeneration of the carbon media.\n\n## 4.2 Primary Clarifiers\n\nPrimary clarifiers are another potential source of odors due to the accumulation of settleable solids and the formation of anaerobic conditions. Odorous compounds, such as H2S, can be generated from the surface of the clarifiers and during sludge removal.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for primary clarifiers include:\n\n1. **Covers**: Installing covers on the primary clarifiers can help contain odorous emissions and prevent their release into the atmosphere. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters or biotrickling filters.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: As mentioned earlier, biofilters are effective in treating a wide range of odorous compounds. They can be used to treat the air collected from the covered primary clarifiers.\n\n3. **Biotrickling Filters**: Biotrickling filters are similar to biofilters but use an inert packing material instead of organic media. A nutrient solution is continuously trickled over the packing material to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. Biotrickling filters are effective for treating high-concentration odorous air streams and have a smaller footprint compared to biofilters.\n\n## 4.3 Aeration Basins\n\nAeration basins, where the activated sludge process takes place, are less likely to generate significant odors if properly designed and operated. However, odorous compounds, particularly VOCs, can still be stripped from the wastewater surface and released into the air.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for aeration basins include:\n\n1. **Aeration Optimization**: Proper aeration design and operation are crucial for minimizing odor generation in aeration basins. Adequate mixing and sufficient oxygen supply help maintain aerobic conditions and prevent the formation of anaerobic zones, which can lead to odor generation.\n\n2. **Biotrickling Filters**: Biotrickling filters can be used to treat the air collected from the aeration basins, particularly if there are concerns about VOC emissions.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers can be employed to remove specific odorous compounds, such as H2S or ammonia, from the air released from the aeration basins.\n\n## 4.4 Sludge Handling and Treatment\n\nSludge handling and treatment processes, including thickening, dewatering, and stabilization, can be significant sources of odors. The anaerobic conditions and high organic content of the sludge can lead to the generation of strong odors, such as H2S and ammonia.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for sludge handling and treatment include:\n\n1. **Enclosures**: Enclosing sludge handling and treatment areas can help contain odorous emissions and prevent their release into the atmosphere. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters, chemical scrubbers, or activated carbon adsorption systems.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: Biofilters are effective in treating a wide range of odorous compounds generated from sludge handling and treatment processes.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers can be used to remove specific odorous compounds, such as H2S or ammonia, from the air released during sludge handling and treatment.\n\n4. **Activated Carbon Adsorption**: Activated carbon adsorption systems can be employed as a polishing step to remove residual odorous compounds from the treated air.\n\n## 4.5 Novel Methods: Reed Beds and Vetiver Systems\n\nIn addition to the conventional odor control technologies discussed above, there are novel methods that can be integrated into the wastewater treatment process to enhance odor control and treatment efficiency. Two such methods are reed bed systems and vetiver systems.\n\n### 4.5.1 Reed Bed Systems\n\nReed bed systems, also known as constructed wetlands, are a natural and sustainable approach to wastewater treatment and odor control. They consist of shallow basins filled with gravel or sand and planted with wetland vegetation, such as reeds (Phragmites australis). As wastewater flows through the reed bed, physical, chemical, and biological processes work together to remove contaminants and reduce odors.\n\nReed bed systems offer several advantages for odor control:\n\n- The roots of the reeds create an extensive network that supports the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms, enhancing the biological treatment of odorous compounds.\n- The reeds transfer oxygen from their leaves to their roots, creating aerobic zones within the reed bed that promote the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds, such as H2S.\n- The dense vegetation in the reed bed acts as a physical barrier, reducing the release of odorous compounds into the atmosphere.\n\nCase studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of reed bed systems in reducing odors from wastewater treatment plants. For example, a study by Moshiri (1993) showed that a reed bed system reduced H2S concentrations by up to 99% and significantly improved the overall odor profile of the treated wastewater.\n\n### 4.5.2 Vetiver Systems\n\nVetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides) is a fast-growing, perennial grass that has been used for various environmental applications, including wastewater treatment and odor control. Vetiver systems involve planting vetiver grass in constructed wetlands or on the periphery of wastewater treatment facilities to mitigate odors and improve treatment efficiency.\n\nVetiver systems offer several benefits for odor control:\n\n- Vetiver grass has a deep and extensive root system that can reach up to 3 meters in depth, providing a large surface area for the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms.\n- The roots of vetiver grass release oxygen into the rhizosphere, creating aerobic conditions that favor the oxidation of odorous compounds.\n- Vetiver grass is known to absorb and accumulate heavy metals, which can help reduce the concentration of these contaminants in the wastewater and mitigate associated odors.\n\nA study by Danh et al. (2009) demonstrated the effectiveness of vetiver systems in treating domestic wastewater and reducing odors. The study found that vetiver systems achieved high removal rates of organic matter, nutrients, and pathogens, while significantly reducing odor emissions compared to conventional treatment methods.\n\nIntegrating reed bed systems and vetiver systems into the wastewater treatment process at the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad can provide an eco-friendly and sustainable approach to odor control. These systems can complement the conventional odor control technologies and enhance the overall treatment efficiency of the facility.\n\nIt is important to note that the successful implementation of reed bed systems and vetiver systems requires proper design, construction, and maintenance. Factors such as hydraulic loading rates, retention times, and plant selection should be carefully considered to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, regular monitoring and maintenance, including harvesting and replanting of the vegetation, are necessary to sustain the effectiveness of these systems over time.\n\n# 5.

Biotrickling filters are effective for treating high-concentration odorous air streams and have a smaller footprint compared to biofilters.\n4.3 Aeration Basins\nAeration basins, where the activated sludge process takes place, are less likely to generate significant odors if properly designed and operated. However, odorous compounds, particularly VOCs, can still be stripped from the wastewater surface and released into the air.\nRecommended odor control technologies for aeration basins include:\nAeration Optimization: Proper aeration design and operation are crucial for minimizing odor generation in aeration basins. Adequate mixing and sufficient oxygen supply help maintain aerobic conditions and prevent the formation of anaerobic zones, which can lead to odor generation.\nBiotrickling Filters: Biotrickling filters can be used to treat the air collected from the aeration basins, particularly if there are concerns about VOC emissions.\nChemical Scrubbers: Chemical scrubbers can be employed to remove specific odorous compounds, such as H2S or ammonia, from the air released from the aeration basins.\n4.4 Sludge Handling and Treatment\nSludge handling and treatment processes, including thickening, dewatering, and stabilization, can be significant sources of odors. The anaerobic conditions and high organic content of the sludge can lead to the generation of strong odors, such as H2S and ammonia.\nRecommended odor control technologies for sludge handling and treatment include:\nEnclosures: Enclosing sludge handling and treatment areas can help contain odorous emissions and prevent their release into the atmosphere. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters, chemical scrubbers, or activated carbon adsorption systems.\nBiofilters: Biofilters are effective in treating a wide range of odorous compounds generated from sludge handling and treatment processes.\nChemical Scrubbers: Chemical scrubbers can be used to remove specific odorous compounds, such as H2S or ammonia, from the air released during sludge handling and treatment.\nActivated Carbon Adsorption: Activated carbon adsorption systems can be employed as a polishing step to remove residual odorous compounds from the treated air.\n4.5 Novel Methods: Reed Beds and Vetiver Systems\nIn addition to the conventional odor control technologies discussed above, there are novel methods that can be integrated into the wastewater treatment process to enhance odor control and treatment efficiency. Two such methods are reed bed systems and vetiver systems.\n4.5.1 Reed Bed Systems\nReed bed systems, also known as constructed wetlands, are a natural and sustainable approach to wastewater treatment and odor control. They consist of shallow basins filled with gravel or sand and planted with wetland vegetation, such as reeds (Phragmites australis). As wastewater flows through the reed bed, physical, chemical, and biological processes work together to remove contaminants and reduce odors.\nReed bed systems offer several advantages for odor control:\nThe roots of the reeds create an extensive network that supports the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms, enhancing the biological treatment of odorous compounds.\nThe reeds transfer oxygen from their leaves to their roots, creating aerobic zones within the reed bed that promote the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds, such as H2S.\nThe dense vegetation in the reed bed acts as a physical barrier, reducing the release of odorous compounds into the atmosphere.\nCase studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of reed bed systems in reducing odors from wastewater treatment plants. For example, a study by Moshiri (1993) showed that a reed bed system reduced H2S concentrations by up to 99% and significantly improved the overall odor profile of the treated wastewater.\n4.5.2 Vetiver Systems\nVetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides) is a fast-growing, perennial grass that has been used for various environmental applications, including wastewater treatment and odor control. Vetiver systems involve planting vetiver grass in constructed wetlands or on the periphery of wastewater treatment facilities to mitigate odors and improve treatment efficiency.\nVetiver systems offer several benefits for odor control:\nVetiver grass has a deep and extensive root system that can reach up to 3 meters in depth, providing a large surface area for the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms.\nThe roots of vetiver grass release oxygen into the rhizosphere, creating aerobic conditions that favor the oxidation of odorous compounds.\nVetiver grass is known to absorb and accumulate heavy metals, which can help reduce the concentration of these contaminants in the wastewater and mitigate associated odors.\nA study by Danh et al. (2009) demonstrated the effectiveness of vetiver systems in treating domestic wastewater and reducing odors. The study found that vetiver systems achieved high removal rates of organic matter, nutrients, and pathogens, while significantly reducing odor emissions compared to conventional treatment methods.\nIntegrating reed bed systems and vetiver systems into the wastewater treatment process at the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad can provide an eco-friendly and sustainable approach to odor control. These systems can complement the conventional odor control technologies and enhance the overall treatment efficiency of the facility.\nIt is important to note that the successful implementation of reed bed systems and vetiver systems requires proper design, construction, and maintenance. Factors such as hydraulic loading rates, retention times, and plant selection should be carefully considered to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, regular monitoring and maintenance, including harvesting and replanting of the vegetation, are necessary to sustain the effectiveness of these systems over time.\n5. Implementation Plan\nThe implementation of the odor control strategies at the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad should follow a systematic approach to ensure their successful integration and long-term effectiveness. The following implementation plan outlines the key steps involved:\n5.1 Phase 1: Data Collection and Technology Selection\nCollect comprehensive data on the wastewater characteristics, including flow rates, organic loading, nutrient concentrations, and odor-causing compounds, to establish a baseline for odor control design.\nConduct a thorough assessment of the existing wastewater treatment process to identify the key odor-generating areas and evaluate their contribution to the overall odor emissions.\nReview the recommended odor control technologies, including biofilters, chemical scrubbers, activated carbon adsorption, aeration optimization, and novel methods such as reed bed systems and vetiver systems, in the context of the specific requirements and constraints of the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant.\nSelect the most appropriate combination of odor control technologies based on factors such as effectiveness, cost, environmental impact, and compatibility with the existing treatment process.\n5.2 Phase 2: Design and Procurement\nDevelop detailed designs for the selected odor control technologies, including sizing, layout, and integration with the existing treatment process.\nPrepare technical specifications and tender documents for the procurement of necessary equipment, materials, and services.\nConduct a competitive bidding process to select qualified contractors and suppliers for the implementation of the odor control systems.\nFinalize contracts and agreements with the selected contractors and suppliers.\n5.3 Phase 3: Construction and Installation\nCoordinate with the selected contractors to develop a detailed construction schedule and mobilization plan.\nOversee the construction and installation of the odor control systems, ensuring compliance with the design specifications and relevant codes and standards.\nConduct regular progress meetings and site inspections to monitor the construction activities and address any issues or delays.\nCommission the installed odor control systems, including testing and verification of performance, to ensure they meet the design requirements.\n5.4 Phase 4: Training and Commissioning\nDevelop a comprehensive training program for the plant operators and maintenance staff to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to operate and maintain the odor control systems effectively.\nConduct hands-on training sessions and workshops to familiarize the staff with the new technologies and their operation and maintenance procedures.\nEstablish standard operating procedures (SOPs) and maintenance schedules for the odor control systems.\nCommission the odor control systems and monitor their performance during the initial period of operation to identify and address any issues or optimization needs.\n5.5 Phase 5: Monitoring and Optimization\nImplement a robust monitoring and performance evaluation program to track the effectiveness of the odor control systems over time.\nRegularly collect and analyze data on odor emissions, treatment efficiency, and system performance to identify any trends or anomalies.\nConduct periodic maintenance and calibration of the odor control equipment to ensure optimal performance and reliability.\nContinuously optimize the odor control strategies based on the monitoring results and operational experience, making necessary adjustments or upgrades as required.\nEstablish a feedback mechanism to gather input from plant operators, maintenance staff, and the surrounding community regarding the effectiveness of the odor control measures and any potential concerns.\nThroughout the implementation process, effective communication and stakeholder engagement are crucial. Regular updates and consultation with the local authorities, healthcare facilities, and the surrounding community should be maintained to ensure transparency, address concerns, and build public confidence in the odor control efforts.\nBy following this implementation plan and adopting a proactive approach to odor control, the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baghdad can effectively mitigate odors, improve environmental quality, and enhance the well-being of the surrounding community.\n6.

This research document has provided a comprehensive analysis of the wastewater treatment process, identified the key odor-generating areas, and recommended a range of odor control technologies and strategies tailored to the specific needs of the facility.\nThe unique design of the treatment plant, with its two primary shafts for different stages of the treatment process, presents both challenges and opportunities for effective odor control. By implementing a combination of containment, ventilation, and treatment technologies, such as biofilters, chemical scrubbers, activated carbon adsorption, and aeration optimization, the plant can effectively mitigate odors from the headworks, primary clarifiers, aeration basins, and sludge handling and treatment areas.\nIn addition to the conventional odor control technologies, the integration of novel methods, such as reed bed systems and vetiver systems, offers a sustainable and eco-friendly approach to odor management. These systems harness the natural abilities of wetland vegetation to degrade odorous compounds, improve treatment efficiency, and create a more aesthetically pleasing environment.\nThe successful implementation of the recommended odor control strategies requires a systematic approach, as outlined in the implementation plan. This includes comprehensive data collection, technology selection, detailed design, construction, training, commissioning, and ongoing monitoring and optimization. Effective communication and stakeholder engagement throughout the implementation process are essential to ensure the success of the odor control efforts and maintain public confidence.\nBy adopting a proactive and multi-faceted approach to odor control, the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant can effectively mitigate odors, improve environmental quality, and enhance the well-being of the surrounding community. The strategies and technologies recommended in this research document, along with the insights gained from case studies and practical experiences, provide a solid foundation for the successful management of odors at this critical wastewater treatment facility in Baghdad.\nAs the plant moves forward with the implementation of the odor control strategies, it is important to continuously monitor, evaluate, and optimize the performance of the systems. Regular maintenance, staff training, and stakeholder engagement should be prioritized to ensure the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of the odor control measures.\nFurthermore, the experiences and lessons learned from the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant can serve as a valuable resource for other wastewater treatment facilities in the region and beyond"

Wastewater Characteristics and Odor-Impacting Variables\n\nThe wastewater received by the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant has unique characteristics that contribute to the generation of odorous compounds during the treatment process. Understanding these characteristics and the odor-impacting variables is crucial for developing targeted odor control strategies.\n\n## 2.1 Wastewater Characteristics\n\nThe Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant receives a daily flow of 150,000 m³ of wastewater, which contains a mix of domestic and medical wastewater. The wastewater characteristics are as follows:\n\n- Average BOD5 concentration: 206.59 mg/L\n- Average COD concentration: 667.14 mg/L\n- Average TSS concentration: 200 mg/L\n- Average Ammonia concentration: 15 mg/L\n- Average Phosphorus concentration: 6 mg/L\n- pH range: 7.41 - 7.91 (average 7.71)\n- Temperature range: 15°C - 35°C\n\nThese values indicate a relatively high organic loading in the wastewater, which can contribute to the production of odorous compounds during the treatment process. The high BOD5 and COD concentrations, in particular, significantly exceed the Iraqi government standards of 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L, respectively.\n\n## 2.2 Odor-Impacting Variables\n\nIn addition to the general wastewater characteristics, several specific contaminants and variables have a significant impact on odor generation. Table 1 presents the contaminant odor impact assessment for the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nTable 1: Contaminant Odor Impact Assessment\n| Contaminant                        | Average Concentration | Odor Impact | Remarks                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)             | TBD                  | High        | Major contributor to \"rotten egg\" smell, prevalent in sulfide-rich wastewater |\n| Ammonia (NH3)                      | TBD                  | Moderate    | Causes sharp, pungent odors; often present in human waste                     |\n| Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)  | TBD                  | Varies      | Can include a range of organic chemicals with varying odor profiles           |\n\nOther odor-impacting variables include:\n\n- Sulfates (SO42-): The average sulfate concentration in the wastewater is 226.64 mg/L, which is within the Iraqi government standard of 400 mg/L. However, even at these levels, sulfates can contribute to odor generation, particularly under anaerobic conditions, where they can be reduced to hydrogen sulfide.\n\n- Heavy Metals: The presence of heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, and lead in the wastewater can influence the odor generation potential and the efficiency of biological treatment processes. Although these metals are within the Iraqi government standards, their presence can inhibit the activity of odor-degrading microorganisms and affect the overall treatment efficiency.\n\n## 2.3 Gaps in the Contamination Treatment Process\n\nBased on the provided data and the Iraqi government standards, there might be potential gaps in the treatment of certain contaminants that can impact odor generation. Table 2 summarizes the identified gaps and their potential impact on odor generation.\n\nTable 2: Gaps in the Contamination Treatment Process\n| Contaminant | Gap Identified                                                        | Potential Impact on Odor Generation                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ammonia     | Average concentration (15 mg/L) exceeds the Iraqi standard (10 mg/L) | May require optimization of the nitrification process in the aeration basins and secondary clarifiers               |\n| Heavy Metals| Average concentrations of cadmium, copper, and lead exceed standards  | Can inhibit the activity of odor-degrading microorganisms and affect the overall treatment efficiency              |\n| Phosphorus  | Average concentration (6 mg/L) is higher than the standard (3 mg/L)   | Enhanced biological phosphorus removal or chemical precipitation may be needed to achieve the required removal level|\n\nAddressing these gaps in the treatment process can help improve the overall contaminant removal efficiency and reduce the potential for odor generation. By targeting these specific contaminants and optimizing the treatment processes, the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant can effectively mitigate odors and maintain a pleasant environment for the surrounding community.",

Wastewater Treatment Process Description\n\nThe Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant employs a unique design to efficiently treat the wastewater generated by the healthcare complex and its surrounding areas. The treatment facility is designed as a 100-meter diameter circular shaft, delving deep underground, and positioned adjacent to a river. The system is split into two primary shafts, each designated for specific stages of the treatment process. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the wastewater treatment process flow.\n\n![Medical City Wastewater Treatment Process Flow](https://i.imgur.com/mKn8QXN.png)\nFigure 1: Visual representation of the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Process Flow\n\n## 3.1 Shaft 1: Primary Clarification\n\nShaft 1 is the first stage of the treatment process, where wastewater from the city's sewage system enters. The primary clarification process begins in this shaft, where large settleable solids and particulate matter are removed from the wastewater through a combination of gravitational settling and mechanical screening. The clarified water then transitions to Shaft 2 for further treatment, while the removed solids are directed towards sludge processing.\n\nBaghdad's hot and dry climate can accelerate odor generation in this stage due to the high temperatures and potential for anaerobic conditions. To mitigate odors, proper ventilation and regular removal of settled solids are crucial. Chemical dosing, such as the addition of iron salts or nitrate, can help control sulfide formation and associated odors.\n\n## 3.2 Shaft 2: Activated Sludge and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)\n\nShaft 2 is where the biological treatment occurs. The activated sludge process is used to reduce the organic content, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Microorganisms in the activated sludge break down the organic matter, converting it into more stable forms.\n\nFollowing the activated sludge process, the wastewater undergoes dissolved air flotation (DAF), where fine particles are floated to the surface and skimmed off. This step effectively reduces the levels of fine suspended solids and other contaminants.\n\nMaintaining aerobic conditions in the activated sludge process is essential to prevent odor generation. Table 3 compares the efficacy of different aerobic treatment technologies in reducing sulfides and ammonia, along with their ease of maintenance and self-sustaining aspects.\n\nTable 3: Comparison of Aerobic Treatment Technologies\n| Technology         | Efficacy in Reducing Sulfides/Ammonia | Ease of Maintenance | Self-Sustaining Aspects                                           |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Activated Sludge   | High                                  | Moderate            | Requires constant aeration but can be energy-efficient           |\n| Biofiltration      | High                                  | High                | Natural process; requires periodic media replacement             |\n| Aeration Systems   | High                                  | Moderate            | Effective in odor control; requires energy input                 |\n\nAdequate aeration and mixing should be provided to ensure a sufficient supply of oxygen to the microorganisms. High temperatures in Baghdad can increase the rate of biological activity, which may require higher aeration rates compared to cooler climates.\n\n## 3.3 Final Stages: Disinfection and Discharge\n\nAfter the wastewater has undergone clarification and biological treatment, it moves to the final stages of the process. The treated water undergoes disinfection, typically using sodium hypochlorite, to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. The now treated and safe water is then discharged into the adjacent river, completing the purification cycle.\n\n## 3.4 Sludge Processing\n\nConcurrently, the sludge collected from the primary clarification and excess biomass from the activated sludge process are treated separately. They undergo thickening, dewatering, and potentially further stabilization processes before being repurposed or safely disposed of.\n\nOdor control during sludge processing is crucial, as this stage can be a significant source of odors. Covering sludge handling areas, providing adequate ventilation, and using odor control systems such as biofilters or chemical scrubbers can help minimize odor emissions.\n\nBy understanding the unique design and treatment processes of the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant, along with the specific challenges posed by Baghdad's climate, targeted odor control strategies can be developed and implemented to effectively mitigate odors and maintain a healthy environment for the surrounding community.",

Key Odor-Generating Areas and Recommended Control Technologies\n\nEffective odor control in the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant requires a comprehensive understanding of the key odor-generating areas within the facility and the application of appropriate control technologies. This section identifies the main sources of odors in the treatment process and recommends targeted odor control solutions, considering the specific contaminants and local conditions.\n\n## 4.1 Headworks (Screening and Grit Removal)\n\nThe headworks, which include screening and grit removal processes, are a significant source of odors due to the presence of raw wastewater and the accumulation of solid waste. The high organic content and potential for anaerobic conditions contribute to the generation of strong odors, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for the headworks include:\n\n1. **Containment and Ventilation**: Enclosing the headworks area and providing adequate ventilation can help capture and control odorous emissions. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters, chemical scrubbers, or activated carbon adsorption systems.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: Biofilters are a biological treatment method that uses microorganisms to degrade odorous compounds. They are effective in treating a wide range of odors, including H2S and VOCs. Biofilters require a relatively large footprint but have low operating costs and minimal environmental impact.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers use a liquid solution, typically containing chemicals such as sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite, to absorb and remove odorous compounds from the air. They are effective for removing specific compounds, such as H2S, but may have higher capital and operating costs compared to biofilters.\n\n4. **Activated Carbon Adsorption**: Activated carbon adsorption systems use granular or pelletized activated carbon to remove odorous compounds from the air. The odorous compounds are adsorbed onto the surface of the activated carbon, which has a high surface area and porosity. Activated carbon systems are effective for removing a wide range of odorous compounds but require periodic replacement or regeneration of the carbon media.\n\nTable 4 summarizes the stage applicability, odor removal efficiency, cost, and other factors for the recommended odor control technologies in the headworks area.\n\nTable 4: Odor Control Technologies for Headworks\n| Odor Control Technology | Stage Applicability | Odor Removal Efficiency | Capital Cost | Operating Cost | Footprint | Maintenance Requirements | Environmental Impact | Compatibility with Existing Processes | Local Availability of Materials |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Containment and Ventilation | Headworks        | High                  | Moderate     | Low           | Moderate  | Low                      | Low                  | High                                  | High                           |\n| Biofilters              | Headworks          | High                  | Moderate     | Low           | Large     | Moderate                 | Low                  | High                                  | High                           |\n| Chemical Scrubbers      | Headworks          | High (for H2S)        | High         | High          | Small     | High                     | Moderate             | High                                  | Low                            |\n| Activated Carbon Adsorption | Headworks      | High                  | Moderate     | Moderate      | Small     | Moderate                 | Low                  | High                                  | Moderate                       |\n\n## 4.2 Primary Clarifiers\n\nPrimary clarifiers are another potential source of odors due to the accumulation of settleable solids and the formation of anaerobic conditions. Odorous compounds, such as H2S, can be generated from the surface of the clarifiers and during sludge removal.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for primary clarifiers include:\n\n1. **Covers**: Installing covers on the primary clarifiers can help contain odorous emissions and prevent their release into the atmosphere. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters or biotrickling filters.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: As mentioned earlier, biofilters are effective in treating a wide range of odorous compounds. They can be used to treat the air collected from the covered primary clarifiers.\n\n3. **Biotrickling Filters**: Biotrickling filters are similar to biofilters but use an inert packing material instead of organic media. A nutrient solution is continuously trickled over the packing material to support the growth of odor-degrading microorganisms. Biotrickling filters are effective for treating high-concentration odorous air streams and have a smaller footprint compared to biofilters.\n\nTable 5 summarizes the stage applicability, odor removal efficiency, cost, and other factors for the recommended odor control technologies in the primary clarifiers.\n\nTable 5: Odor Control Technologies for Primary Clarifiers\n| Odor Control Technology | Stage Applicability | Odor Removal Efficiency | Capital Cost | Operating Cost | Footprint | Maintenance Requirements | Environmental Impact | Compatibility with Existing Processes | Local Availability of Materials |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Covers                  | Primary Clarifiers | High                    | Moderate     | Low           | None      | Low                      | Low                  | High                                  | High                           |\n| Biofilters              | Primary Clarifiers | High                    | Moderate     | Low           | Large     | Moderate                 | Low                  | High                                  | High                           |\n| Biotrickling Filters    | Primary Clarifiers | High                    | Moderate     | Moderate      | Moderate  | Moderate                 | Low                  | High                                  | Moderate                       |\n\n## 4.3 Aeration Basins\n\nAeration basins, where the activated sludge process takes place, are less likely to generate significant odors if properly designed and operated. However, odorous compounds, particularly VOCs, can still be stripped from the wastewater surface and released into the air.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for aeration basins include:\n\n1. **Aeration Optimization**: Proper aeration design and operation are crucial for minimizing odor generation in aeration basins. Adequate mixing and sufficient oxygen supply help maintain aerobic conditions and prevent the formation of anaerobic zones, which can lead to odor generation.\n\n2. **Biotrickling Filters**: Biotrickling filters can be used to treat the air collected from the aeration basins, particularly if there are concerns about VOC emissions.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers can be employed to remove specific odorous compounds, such as H2S or ammonia, from the air released from the aeration basins.\n\nTable 6 summarizes the stage applicability, odor removal efficiency, cost, and other factors for the recommended odor control technologies in the aeration basins.\n\nTable 6: Odor Control Technologies for Aeration Basins\n| Odor Control Technology | Stage Applicability | Odor Removal Efficiency | Capital Cost | Operating Cost | Footprint | Maintenance Requirements | Environmental Impact | Compatibility with Existing Processes | Local Availability of Materials |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Aeration Optimization   | Aeration Basins    | Moderate                | Low          | Low           | None      | Low                      | Low                  | High                                  | High                           |\n| Biotrickling Filters    | Aeration Basins    | High                    | Moderate     | Moderate      | Moderate  | Moderate                 | Low                  | High                                  | Moderate                       |\n| Chemical Scrubbers      | Aeration Basins    | High (for specific compounds) | High   | High          | Small     | High                     | Moderate             | High                                  | Low                            |\n\n## 4.4 Sludge Handling and Treatment\n\nSludge handling and treatment processes, including thickening, dewatering, and stabilization, can be significant sources of odors. The anaerobic conditions and high organic content of the sludge can lead to the generation of strong odors, such as H2S and ammonia.\n\nRecommended odor control technologies for sludge handling and treatment include:\n\n1. **Enclosures**: Enclosing sludge handling and treatment areas can help contain odorous emissions and prevent their release into the atmosphere. The captured air can be treated using technologies such as biofilters, chemical scrubbers, or activated carbon adsorption systems.\n\n2. **Biofilters**: Biofilters are effective in treating a wide range of odorous compounds generated from sludge handling and treatment processes.\n\n3. **Chemical Scrubbers**: Chemical scrubbers can be used to remove specific odorous compounds, such as H2S or ammonia, from the air released during sludge handling and treatment.\n\n4. **Activated Carbon Adsorption**: Activated carbon adsorption systems can be employed as a polishing step to remove residual odorous compounds from the treated air.\n\nTable 7 summarizes the stage applicability, odor removal efficiency, cost, and other factors for the recommended odor control technologies in sludge handling and treatment.\n\nTable 7: Odor Control Technologies for Sludge Handling and Treatment\n| Odor Control Technology | Stage Applicability | Odor Removal Efficiency | Capital Cost | Operating Cost | Footprint | Maintenance Requirements | Environmental Impact | Compatibility with Existing Processes | Local Availability of Materials |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Enclosures              | Sludge Handling    | High                    | Moderate     | Low           | None      | Low                      | Low                  | High                                  | High                           |\n| Biofilters              | Sludge Handling    | High                    | Moderate     | Low           | Large     | Moderate                 | Low                  | High                                  | High                           |\n| Chemical Scrubbers      | Sludge Handling    | High (for specific compounds) | High   | High          | Small     | High                     | Moderate             | High                                  | Low                            |\n| Activated Carbon Adsorption | Sludge Handling | High                   | Moderate     | Moderate      | Small     | Moderate                 | Low                  | High                                  | Moderate                       |\n\nBy implementing a combination of containment, ventilation, and treatment technologies tailored to the specific odor-generating areas and contaminants, the Medical City Wastewater Treatment Plant can effectively mitigate odors and maintain a pleasant environment for the surrounding community.",
