      "content": "You're looking for a **one-time payment virtual number** (or SIM) that can:\n\n1. Be used to set up a **new WhatsApp account**, and  \n2. **Receive 2FA texts indefinitely** (especially for logins, verification, etc.).\n\nHere are a few **options** that might work for your goal:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Best One-Time-Pay or Low-Maintenance Options:\n\n#### **1. Prepaid SIM Card (Real Number)**\n- **Example**: Tello, Mint Mobile, LycaMobile (in the US), or local prepaid SIMs in your country.\n- **Cost**: ~$10–$20 for initial setup.\n- **Pros**:\n  - Works like a normal phone number.\n  - Can receive SMS forever as long as it's active.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Might require occasional top-up to stay active (e.g., once every 3–6 months).\n\n#### **2. Twilio / SMS APIs (Not Ideal for WhatsApp)**\n- Many services like Twilio allow receiving texts, but **WhatsApp blocks virtual or VoIP numbers** from many providers. Not reliable for WhatsApp setup.\n- ✅ Can work for **other 2FA services**, not WhatsApp.\n\n#### **3. MySudo (VoIP + Privacy Number)**\n- One-time or low-fee setup.\n- **Downside**: WhatsApp might reject these VoIP numbers.\n- Not great for longevity.\n\n#### **4. **SilentLink or JMP.chat (Premium Privacy SIM/VoIP)**\n- **SilentLink**: $39 one-time for a number that supports SMS and can be kept without recurring fees.\n- **JMP.chat**: ~USD $2.99/month (XMPP + SMS bridge; may work with WhatsApp setup but not guaranteed).\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 Best Long-Term Strategy (WhatsApp-Focused):\n\nIf you want to **keep the number forever** and **ensure WhatsApp compatibility**:\n\n#### 🥇 **Buy a prepaid SIM that never expires with minimal use**\n- Get a **real SIM card** that:\n  - Has a local number.\n  - Doesn’t require monthly top-ups.\n- Example: LycaMobile (some regions), Orange Holiday (EU), or T-Mobile Prepaid.\n\nYou can even keep the SIM in a phone or an old device just to receive messages when needed.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Avoid:\n- **Free virtual numbers** or sites like TextNow, TextFree, or Receive-SMS-Online — these are public/shared and **blocked by WhatsApp**.\n- **VoIP-only numbers** — WhatsApp usually requires a **mobile/cellular** number, not a VoIP line.\n\n---\n\nWould you prefer a **physical SIM card**, or are you specifically looking for an **online / virtual number** that you never have to physically manage?",
