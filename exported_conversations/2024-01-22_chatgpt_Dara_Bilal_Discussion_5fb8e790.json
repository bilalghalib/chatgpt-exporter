      "content": "Can you summarize this call between bilal and his colleague dara and give us a summary for bilal, dara and some action plan for tasks to do in the next days? 00:00 Right of way.\n00:02 Is there nothing of this sort of brief that I worked on?\n00:07 Hey a couple of months ago that essentially go through and explain why we want to have a new assessment and usership.\n00:20 I said, that was my first question.\n00:22 Yeah before like are we doing enough taking the data?\n00:27 Are we analyzing are we releasing one pager?\n00:29 Others are we you know before we get back to Changing the data set, shouldn't we?\n00:36 Anyway that was my first question.\n00:38 Do you want to walk me over the document just like open the like with the screen share and try to convince me.\n00:43 So there's basically there's there were two issues.\n00:49 There was the issue of first of all the assessment the universal scale assessment not being comprehensive enough and not talking about leadership enough and the fact that it's learning Are very basic there for high school students.\n01:06 Yeah Four Seasons entrepreneurs.\n01:09 The second issue that we realized is in the way that we do our assessment.\n01:15 There's this I figured there's a word name for it.\n01:18 It's called the dunning-kruger effect.\n01:20 And you know it.\n01:21 Yeah, you have graphed previously.\n01:23 Yeah, it's people yourself super high at the beginning of a program, and then they will drag their service lower at the end of the program.\n01:29 Yeah.\n01:29 So how do we let our pre and post assessment in a way that take this into consideration and it allows us to have this measure of pre and post?\n01:38 Yeah.\n01:38 We identified some of the principles behind all of this out of this reasoning and so okay.\n01:48 So this I think you need to read one by one but there're the ones that I think are most important is yeah idea aligning.\n01:57 It's less of a says it was less of an assessment.\n02:00 It's like more of a demonstration or something like that where you actually have real.\n02:04 You know way of this.\n02:08 Yeah.\n02:08 So basically you can take any given skill in the assessment and be able to give someone a certificate on that school.\n02:17 Yeah.\n02:18 I did a little bit of this research.\n02:20 I don't know if you remember a long time ago with chat GPT where I tried to break down each thing into an actual thing that is measurable and provable that is not cannot kind of influenceable by self like, you know, like self-assessment.\n02:35 And I should I can pull that out.\n02:38 But I did a little bit of that work a while ago.\n02:40 Yeah.\n02:42 Okay, exactly.\n02:43 So it makes sense for you to share their skills interesting.\n02:46 Yeah scales passport.\n02:49 One of the jobs that I was looking at was like this Mozilla skills passport adaptation for Unicef.\n02:57 They had like a technology something position specifically for this that was open six months ago but closed, so they're definitely Working on this right now, which is interesting, and we could reach out and see what they're up to.\n03:10 Yeah, definitely.\n03:12 I think there was this super interesting because it's also open source, I guess if it's Mozilla, whereas this one yeah and UNICEF.\n03:19 It's like it's a UNICEF thing.\n03:21 Yeah, exactly.\n03:23 Yeah.\n03:32 Yeah, and there's also an aspect of third-party validation.\n03:41 So how do we also sort of have this third party validation?\n03:48 But one of the cool thing that we thought about also is having a portfolio per skin.\n03:55 So let us say for example, you're working on your creativity and you take a module and a video and you work on a project and I what then you have a portfolio to present on your creativity and Of score of three and four score so it's like a comprehensive thing.\n04:09 Yeah.\n04:11 But I think those are all like long-term ideas as well and to start we really need to think about what can we do in the coming months to have an assessment we can use in the study program that said, yeah.\n04:27 I think this is all important things to think about.\n04:29 It's also stuffed that you might want to talk to t'adore about because I don't know if you remember he had been thinking and working a lot about this kind of skill proof ability.\n04:39 So transferability of skills.\n04:43 Girls so that you can get a your University education piecemeal from lots of different places and prove it, and so he's done a lot of that thinking and you might want to just reach out and get it on a call with him and see where he's landed on that kind of stuff.\n04:58 There was some other things like related to this which was what was it called?\n05:07 Oh my God, it's not up work it was.\n05:10 Skillshare, I think skillshare had like a Some kind of verification stuff and also LinkedIn is trying to prove your capacities and different things and there's yeah, there's a stuff to look into but yeah, I don't think we're going to talk about all the specific things.\n05:29 What's the yeah, let us think about like what you want me to support in for these three months and who am I mad is because I still I don't think I am better that I meet him.\n05:41 He said he's awesome.\n05:42 So I am excited.\n05:42 Yeah, but that's him.\n05:44 How much is awesome?\n05:45 He's working with us and with Village Capital.\n05:47 He's the program manager for we're in and for another program at IBM as well.\n05:53 And he's a amazing.\n05:55 I love him.\n05:56 He's very talented at impact measurement.\n05:59 He's done in a very short period of time.\n06:03 He's cleaned our data in a way that not many not just me and not anyone so far has been able to do it's clean.\n06:11 Where is it?\n06:11 It's usable.\n06:13 I will show you later on.\n06:15 But cool, it's really a great done it he's making a database it is usable on Google Sheets, you know, like it's not complicated.\n06:23 Yeah.\n06:23 Yeah, very usable is more valuable than complicated.\n06:27 Wait.\n06:27 Yeah, exactly, and he think he's doing also some work on the pre and post assessment which I would like him to explain to you.\n06:37 So maybe like visualizing not it's not visualizing.\n06:41 He's actually looking at the assessment the e-cat assessment and trying to think of a way to do the scoring that takes into consideration the dunning-kruger effect.\n06:52 So, okay.\n06:53 Yeah, so I should probably find my old stuff see if I can get that out for him.\n06:58 Yeah.\n06:59 Absolutely.\n07:00 I think that would be great, and we can set up a call with him to talk about that because I think it's also relates to this somehow the scoring criteria the way he's organizing it for ecad.\n07:13 This can be applicable for this individual.\n07:15 Assessment as well.\n07:16 Yeah interesting.\n07:18 Like it should be aligned right?\n07:21 Like why do the same thing twice?\n07:23 Yeah, exactly.\n07:25 So it should kind of be the same thing.\n07:26 Hello where I will need your help is and let us put that here building the first job the first draft of the assessment and the way I thought that it could be done is we have a universal skill.\n07:44 We have the ig's have the entry come framework.\n07:51 We can take all of this data that we have plugged it into judge Petit and maybe find the minimum set of categories that we want to measure for the universal skills for yeah cats and for what I did and energy Corp Can you show me the intercom thing again?\n08:20 Yeah, what was that intercom thing?\n08:23 She's and ventricle so and Chicago on Toronto reckon.\n08:29 I was thinking of like intercom.\n08:32 Yeah.\n08:33 Okay.\n08:33 So basically the one that has I will show you like the high level 1 it has three main things like ideas and opportunities resources and then into action and then out of this there's 15 And see it is and 60 different threads out of that.\n08:51 So I put all of that's another word.\n08:54 We have the word thread which is what a specific skill is.\n08:57 It asked because maybe we should just rename that into skill uncover needs focus on challenges just because I don't want to just having another category of topics.\n09:08 I just want to know exactly what it what is it.\n09:10 So there were competencies each of these things means that's the hard part about working in these domains, like everybody uses the language.\n09:18 It slightly differently and you know what's crazy.\n09:21 I we're in touch with the people behind and track up Angela put us in touch with them.\n09:27 And I told them we're working on this leadership assessment, and we hope to have some resources.\n09:33 Yeah, that will was developed the assessment.\n09:36 I only obscure for entry comp stuff.\n09:39 She sent me all of these things with two new different Frameworks that are not a cop, and I am like, oh my God you wish to new things Euclid.\n09:48 You can tend to be digital.\n09:51 Yes.\n09:52 It looks like in Turkey on teleconference or comp or whatever is European competency framework.\n09:57 So they're probably trying to like provide guidance but aligned with other people's stuff.\n10:03 So I am imagining that's why did you probably you have checked out there intercoms website right?\n10:08 Like you have seen the this guy?\n10:10 Yeah.\n10:10 Yeah.\n10:11 Yeah.\n10:12 I have seen it free interesting one called working with enter a Convent Republic Dedenne.\n10:18 You that also goes into a thorough description of each of the competencies, but then also has exercises.\n10:27 It's interesting, you know, because like even on the intercom website, there are skills profiler, right?\n10:34 It's developing.\n10:35 Yeah, and they have like agenda for Europe.\n10:38 Yeah, it is.\n10:42 They do have different things, you know could be cool or is something we don't often try enough I think is you said that you were put in touch with these people.\n10:51 Yeah, it's an anybody else that you could talk to hear that, you know might be able to kind of know the bigger picture because there's like a lot of things even just on the intercom website is European skills and competencies qualifications and occupations thing.\n11:07 There's like vocational excellence.\n11:09 And yeah.\n11:11 Third Country Nationals, and as I looked a lot of pieces and it would be interesting to see if we can get some alignment look we can definitely we have a meeting with them at the end of the month, so we can definitely prepare a set of questions for them to discuss this more clarity.\n11:31 Yeah.\n11:31 And I personally I find that the answer come framework to be complex because There's a lot of things in there and there's a lot of levels.\n11:46 So even when you went for each of the threads.\n11:49 Yes 82 lat from you're discovering the thread or the skill to its transformational and it's huge.\n12:00 Yeah.\n12:01 Oh, you know LPI is also working on this kind of stuff.\n12:08 You remember no learning plan Institute.\n12:12 They have liked you have reminded me because they have this like red yellow green.\n12:18 I don't know if it's a self-assessment, but they have let me see if I can find LPI learning project.\n12:27 I don't know even what to call it.\n12:28 But yeah, they have this project.\n12:34 Directory and it's connected to the ability for people to kind of identify and manage skills reasons.\n12:44 This is like it's supposed to be all kind of connected from not just like what you actually kind of what you're talking about in terms of having something where people can have their work and like demonstrate the work that they have done and connect it to their skills and have this resume.\n13:03 I think that's kind of the idea.\n13:04 Yeah, I don't know if it is mapping your online learning.\n13:09 These are all the projects that directory.\n13:13 Well, they got a good URL.\n13:14 And then it's like a line with sdgs but it's I think the problem a lot of these things is so many people are making stuff.\n13:23 But oh they do have the skill stink interesting.\n13:28 Let me see course design.\n13:32 We see if that works.\n13:33 If you go into people you will see that you can like search how we got by skill, but they have not this let us try philosophy or not.\n13:45 What's an actual skill cooking management project management confirm and then it will filter?\n13:58 Oh, it did work.\n13:59 8pr guess who came up to the door?\n14:02 Yeah, five forming Community facilitators to door.\n14:08 Bio projects groups skills.\n14:10 Yeah, I wonder how these things work.\n14:14 Do you see the people actually this is actually probably a person because I know that she works there the problem with building stuff that nobody uses that you have to look at the people building it to see how it's used.\n14:23 So very true.\n14:26 Yeah.\n14:26 So here's like Arena, and she actually had added all of these skills.\n14:30 I don't know exactly the here's a question skill levels level one is curious level to his basic level 3 is competent level fours expert and it gives you a breakdown curious is curious High School level is basic 3 is competent Master Level or didn't intermediate projects or can teach licensing level expert is PhD or big project to teach to a Master Level?\n14:51 Yeah, that's definitely like four levels makes a lot more sense than eight levels.\n14:55 I think that the anti-fog framework a bit too far.\n14:58 Yeah.\n14:59 So this is this they are trying to turn this into like learning planet that organ.\n15:07 Yeah, yeah, the definitely a lot of people in this sort of learning by doing and categorizing.\n15:17 I know that they want would love to be able to like validate projects by skills and have that be updated but it seems like no one really is using it but that's the questions like do we double down on something or do we build new things?\n15:33 Anyway, I mean their assessment somehow.\n15:38 And I think using their progression level of yeah, that is interesting because it's aligned with the answer come framework, but it's more minimalists.\n15:50 Yeah, and I am wondering if there's like an API so that rather than having someone's profile and managing their profiles and projects and all of that.\n15:58 We actually use the structure of projects people group, whatever sdgs, but we use their Eyes to update the person's profile based on the assessment and intervention, and we focus on getting really good at that.\n16:14 We just need to like align with this for like pillar model and then also like figure out what they're using to Define as a skill.\n16:24 That's yeah they have yeah.\n16:29 Do you know what this is or there is no assessment?\n16:33 These are self-identified.\n16:34 I think okay, but funding then like you identify your skills and you taught them to the jobs, but it's not necessarily there's no excitement.\n16:44 And so that's what we would be providing.\n16:47 It could be another interesting thing.\n16:48 Like I kind of feel like, you know some point in our time working together.\n16:53 I think we had this idea.\n16:54 Oh, we create profiles, and then we create projects that we have all of these things, and I am beginning to wonder if we focused on getting the assessment part, right?\n17:01 We can like map to this we can map to also whatever the backpack thing is from the UNICEF or Mozilla and just like have it is what we're doing is figuring out how to figure out skills.\n17:14 I know like what else is doing it up.\n17:17 Up work skills certification.\n17:18 Have you seen that there's this as well know there's a few other places because they have you know, you want to hire people and you want to know that they know stuff and I actually when I was having people I would often look into Yeah?\n17:37 Invitation only they have to do types for now software and creative.\n17:47 Yeah, there was another thing is like skillshare forget exactly.\n17:56 I mean considering the golden standards, I would say yeah, and they even have this thing is every time you do something in a course you have your skills increases Different skills that are focusing on in this course, that's cool.\n18:14 And so they have each course map to like a set of skills.\n18:18 Exactly interesting.\n18:22 I am trying to remember because I had a call with somebody for a skills certification thing.\n18:30 I have impact trying to see if I can find the persons.\n18:35 How do I figure out we had a call?\n18:37 So I guess I could look at the calendar.\n18:39 And I remember I was interested, but we had to pay, so I thought not back then.\n18:48 Okay, you know what?\n19:01 I will do this of the call, but it's I want to make sure that I find that's example.\n19:10 Yeah.\n19:10 Yeah because I was interested in working with this guy but it didn't work out and I can't remember why Skelly did you do?\n19:21 Okay.\n19:21 I will find it later.\n19:22 Just I will put as like my follow-up thing.\n19:27 Okay.\n19:29 Okay later.\n19:33 Yeah.\n19:34 Okay.\n19:34 And what is the thing that you want me to potentially support in this project?\n19:40 And like what is the time requirement, and we have until xe3 which is cool?\n19:46 But do we actually three was awesome?\n19:47 I was awesome.\n19:49 Right miss these guys.\n19:49 You guys are great.\n19:50 He's absolutely fabulous.\n19:52 I was so stoked when we had the call and the meeting and I started working on the proposal that I was so excited.\n19:59 Yeah so launch the Things are running now.\n20:03 No way.\n20:03 It's February and the boot camp is going to be in March.\n20:09 So we have until the end of February to have an up and running assessment.\n20:14 That's the timeline.\n20:16 Oh very soon.\n20:17 Yeah.\n20:18 Exactly.\n20:18 And what do they want to change or are we changing it because we want to change?\n20:25 Okay, we have the that we want to have a leadership assessment so that we will have them do in the open house.\n20:34 They will do the character strengths assessment and then in the boot camp, they will do e-cat and the leadership assessment and the one that we're The crew building leadership one is the leadership.\n20:50 So it's basically waited a second.\n20:52 We're replacing Universal skills with leadership.\n20:54 Yeah kind of makes sense for people running entrepreneurship programs.\n20:59 We can keep Universal skills.\n21:04 When you do things related to used with at this point.\n21:07 I don't think that it has any added value.\n21:09 Yeah, right.\n21:11 Yeah also this idea of like if we want to run a program, and we put out a call or you know, individual applications to a universal skills program versus a leadership program.\n21:24 I think it's way more likely someone's gonna be like, oh, yeah, I would like to learn these skills.\n21:30 Actually.\n21:30 I was I got an email from a I care being like I want to learn leadership.\n21:35 Can you help me very specific?\n21:37 You knew what you wanted and it was cool.\n21:42 Yeah.\n21:42 Very cool.\n21:45 So yeah, that's also a thing is that this is a sellable Revenue stream.\n21:50 Basically if we're doing need related stuff, it's great and it can even be as specific as we make it to be depending on how many skills were going to have in there and what kind of content we can build around those kids.\n22:06 Yeah.\n22:07 And you think that the Entre what is it called Entre skills thing is mostly focused on leadership, you know, like leadership development.\n22:18 There's like a many training programs that use probably many different approaches.\n22:27 Yeah.\n22:28 That's a great point.\n22:31 I haven't looked into other leadership Frameworks because I think we already have enough Frameworks to look at I could That there is however if you think it might be interesting it's like shifting from something as generic.\n22:46 It's supposed to be like a kind of comprehensive quote soft skills and then focusing on leadership, which is a dimension that used to be a dimension and soft skills.\n22:55 Is a bit of a pivot, and we need to make sure that we're not Reinventing the wheel and also that Entre whatever is actually an is it a leadership assessment or is it an entrepreneurial overall?\n23:10 It's about being an entrepreneur and I think leadership is a subset of that.\n23:15 I don't think necessarily it's about everything looked the word.\n23:20 We're talking about 60 different skills and undergone.\n23:24 So, I think it's comprehensive enough.\n23:26 That we can then narrow it down to the most important skills that we want to measure in our programs.\n23:32 Yeah.\n23:33 Yeah measure and help grow.\n23:36 Yeah and is the focus of xe3 should it be focused on leadership is that what would make sense for this program?\n23:47 Definitely because we are at the end of the day.\n23:50 We are targeting idea and prototype stage entrepreneurs and developing their leadership skill at this.\n23:56 Stage is as important as developing their ideas.\n24:00 Yeah, I remember I pitched that for xe3.\n24:04 We're like, you actually had to teach the Next Generation because that's like one of the elements of leadership but I forget exactly the whole proposal.\n24:12 I wonder is it at all similar to what I initially like defined back in the day or did you guys start from scratch?\n24:19 Well, we didn't start from scratch.\n24:21 We're actually we're doing a repeat that foxy to and have someone with the different.\n24:26 It is that we're doing a one months bootcamp for sessions instead of eight sessions, and we're adding this leadership component.\n24:35 Okay.\n24:37 Yeah.\n24:37 I am excited to do that.\n24:41 I think it's interesting.\n24:43 I want to go definitely want to figure out which subset of Entre.\n24:51 Why are we considering on Fred comp like Is there a reason we're looking at that in specific besides the fact that Angela connected us?\n25:03 No, it's it doesn't have to do with Angela.\n25:06 It's because it has two reasons.\n25:09 The first one is that it's comprehensive enough that it can include everything from soft skill to Universal skills to leadership Etc.\n25:18 And the second reason is because of the way the framework is built their levels are very interesting in terms of Progression going from I am a beginner to I am an expert and I can teach and I can Implement that one was interesting as well.\n25:37 Okay.\n25:40 Yeah, I think it's the fact that it has but does it have any of the presides the progression does it have any measurable things because I think I thought we were trying to get back down to something more granular know?\n25:53 I think this is coming from us.\n25:54 This is going to be up to us in the way.\n25:56 We formulate the questions and the scoring and the weight because I might want to do some wearing as well and categories.\n26:04 So based on that this is what is going to help us with the pre and post but It's not it has nothing to do with the actual compliment of itself.\n26:11 Okay?\n26:13 Yeah, I would like to work.\n26:18 I would like to work on this.\n26:19 I would like to help Define it I would like to also just like look back at the previous like work that I did to try to come up with those things and it could be that the Entre comp has like a broad set, and we can consider that like the umbrella set and then if this is gonna be focused on universal, sorry leadership skills, we can just focus on like one of the Dimensions from the Entre comp think I like the idea of mapping with something from the EU means that it's likely to help us get funding but I also want to see what's going on with like the whole UNICEF like learning skills backpack thing.\n27:02 Yeah, and yeah, it sounds good.\n27:08 Okay.\n27:09 Also, there's one last thing I have wish I could find it.\n27:12 There was like a I was looking up like this skillshare.\n27:16 But I can't remember which organization was doing it.\n27:21 I have to look through my calls and try to figure out where in terms of how we want to work together.\n27:30 I was thinking that like I want to do research on leadership Frameworks and try to understand what does leadership mean and what is being measured when we talk about leadership, but I think where I need your help.\n27:46 Most here where I feel out of my depth is in taking those different Frameworks that were talking about and then having an outline to say these are the five six skills that we want to measure and then for me writing the questions could be easy I could plug in plug from the different things but also like doing this with someone as helpful because then we can bounce off ideas.\n28:12 Yeah, you don't get stuck in like a right like for me.\n28:15 I also work best.\n28:17 When I work with somebody else I can like pass things back and forth.\n28:19 Do you wanna work on this dock that you gave me what is the yeah, we can use this as our playground up?\n28:28 Look who's here.\n28:29 We only have one month.\n28:31 Basically Hello.\n28:33 Whoa.\n28:36 Working spaces so cool.\n28:48 I know maybe yeah.\n28:50 Yeah, that's great.\n28:56 So one month is not a lot of time.\n28:59 So if you want we can have a regular meet up or I don't know like how do you want to manage your time now that you have time again?\n29:09 How could you want to manage your time?\n29:11 That's my question.\n29:12 So right now I have I don't know if I told you, but I am thinking about spending half of my time trying to you know, like II like to learn and then I like to teach and I learn by doing, and I was starting to feel like I should be doing something again, and I was helping my dad with this Waste Water treatment project.\n29:32 It has some it's a problem that's really important pure and clean water in terms of sustainable development and a big reason why there's going to be climate migration is because of the lack of available clean water.\n29:46 And he has a an approach for it that I think is really interesting.\n29:51 But he was not a business person was not able to give it legs and initially I was just helping him work on this contract, but I realized that he's in his 70s now he's not going to make this happens and that I have some skills that could help this project potentially come to life.\n30:07 And, so I told him and the problem is it doesn't have any money it would be a start-up, and so I told him if you can.\n30:16 Like allocate X dollars, I will allocate half my time for six months to be the interim CEO until we can find someone who can actually take this project and give it its rights and hopefully by that point I will have gotten grants.\n30:31 I will have unlocked the contract that is in the works right now in Iraq.\n30:35 Hopefully that works out or something and if not in six months, I will be back on the job market, but for six months, can you allocate X dollars a month so that I can now get half my time.\n30:45 So half my time now.\n30:46 I think is occupied the other half available and earlier in the morning is better because it's just better for me.\n30:58 Like I said drop off the baby and Studio nine.\n31:04 So nine thirty.\n31:06 I will be home and ready to go friends time.\n31:08 So it's 10:30 your time.\n31:10 Yeah, 10:15 is like earliest it's definitely possible, but I would have to it's really close.\n31:16 It's a five-minute walk.\n31:17 So it's 10 February 15th.\n31:20 Let us let so what's your rhythm?\n31:22 My I know it's you know, my rhythm is a bit crazy because I am partnership mentorship program manager everything at once and Claude.\n31:33 Wanted to oh my God, we know today.\n31:37 Yeah, today's it is.\n31:38 No.\n31:39 Yeah.\n31:40 Okay.\n31:46 Oh my God.\n31:47 Yeah if there's anything that I can do just because like this is an interesting topic for me and You know, I could call it the door I could get on a call with UNICEF.\n31:59 I could try to get on a call with on struck complex.\n32:02 I mean you already have the relationship but if the I can take some of those hours to give you some hours for other things, I would buy that super interesting my could take good notes do screen recordings.\n32:12 And you can give me your specific questions.\n32:17 That way you don't have to deal with like an hour call or 30 minute caller these types.\n32:21 Yeah, look I think.\n32:23 I think that's a good idea.\n32:26 But also maybe we should have maybe co-working sessions, you know, maybe Thursday morning.\n32:33 We can spend an hour and a half together and digest what we have learned in the coming two days whether it's from calls or ridging research Etc.\n32:45 Yeah and see how we can forward.\n32:49 Yeah.\n32:49 I think this is a good idea and I have a small proposal which might not make sense.\n32:53 Let me know let us have the co-working session.\n32:58 Be long enough to be done to actually try our best to finish and then all we do from this the here on out is review potentially do a research critique it uses it and be like, okay.\n33:16 Well this question is really dumb like be done and it doesn't have to be perfect as even have to be kind of good.\n33:21 It can be really bad.\n33:22 It could be like completely off the mark but I like the idea of being done, and then we just Take it from there.\n33:30 They just have that block of session and be like, okay.\n33:32 Well, here's what we know so far.\n33:34 Let us go for it.\n33:35 Take two hours or whatever hour and a half try to be done and then see if it can only go get it's like basically from here on out.\n33:44 It's just improvements.\n33:46 You know what I mean?\n33:47 I feel like that would feel nice.\n33:48 It'd be nice for you and this for me like I swear everybody be like, oh we have something in case nothing else happens.\n33:54 It's that we got it, you know, and hopefully it gets better.\n33:58 I am gonna book us for Thursday morning for an hour and a half.\n34:02 Okay.\n34:03 Yeah, so 1015 to 1215 sounds perfect.\n34:08 And then I go to lunch if I don't know about you it works for you.\n34:11 Yeah, okay, 9:00 9:15 to How's it going?\n34:16 Yeah nine 9:45 11:15 for me 10:15 to 12:15 for you.\n34:24 Okay, did all right and I will go try to figure out this call that I had with the skills person and then review some of this other stuff.\n34:34 And then with that I think we're good.\n34:37 Okay, one more thing about logistics.\n34:40 So you know that you have a budget allocated for the so you're going to get a salary from that.\n34:46 Yeah.\n34:46 If you want the salary like it's flexible, you know other athletic Foundation.\n34:53 They're very flexible.\n34:55 Yes, we can pay you all at once or you can pay you a little bit this month a little bit next month.\n35:00 It's up to you.\n35:01 I think basically have to pay Joe back for like the last few months when I didn't pay rent.\n35:08 So yeah, it would be nice.\n35:11 Yeah.\n35:12 Yeah, it would be helpful but not necessary if it makes the budget difficult in any It now it doesn't worry about the title.\n35:20 We will figure it out with root Z well and voice show and you will get something in your bank account.\n35:26 Yeah, do I need to do anything sign any some things?\n35:30 I don't know.\n35:31 I will figure it out with root because you usually do that your invoicing, so I will see you at them about it.\n35:37 Okay, sounds good.\n35:38 This is great.\n35:39 Um, it's nice to work with you again.\n35:42 Nice work on a very unlike the exact thing that I think I have been thinking the most about for last few years.\n35:49 And yeah, it's nice to have some Co working sessions with you again.\n35:53 And also I would like to just stay connected also ready foundation and say hi to Habit.\n35:59 I am glad part of this project continuing because well study programs are like kind of one of the you know, like I did my research on it for the during the last times and yeah, we learned a lot and also it has been a great partner are we like really hyping him up enough?\n36:19 I don't know.\n36:19 I feel like we should do some sort of talk to Chad's and make sure to like just like but I have its face.\n36:25 I was cute.\n36:26 Now be great because I think about 40 Foundation like, you know, here we go round 3, and it could be more marketing.\n36:33 They just be specific to highlighting the fact that we have these things.\n36:36 And then maybe we use that as a time.\n36:38 I know you did some of this did we do any analysis / 1 pages of previous sexy things, and we were working on those work.\n36:47 We did the reporting but one features we didn't do I didn't do a case study on Axiom.\n36:54 I could work on that a little bit.\n36:56 I would wait until and this until Claude come back.\n36:59 All right?\n37:00 Yeah.\n37:01 Yeah.\n37:01 Okay.\n37:02 Yeah.\n37:03 I wonder if there's something that I could do like I wrote something that we made kind of public which is like an analysis of XE to and like the buffering effect, which I think Be turned into a yeah, what would you call it case study not exactly a case study?\n37:20 It's like a project like an analysis like what are we learning?\n37:25 And it could be something interesting both to like hype up xe3 and make sure that our funders know that we love them.\n37:32 All right.\n37:34 So, yeah, I think that's a great idea because also it's dealing with the protest, and we are targeting Enterprises and Palestine as well.\n37:43 Yeah, so I think this could be an interesting angle if you can dig it up and send it to me up to Dad about my do find the right now.\n37:53 I think if I look up this word buffering it will oh, you know what?\n37:59 I think it was in my Previous email actually looking in the wrong Ducks.\n38:09 Okay, I will send it to you on slack.\n38:11 And I think I will be great just I would probably need cleaning like yeah, it's old and it's also my writing which means it's a great.\n38:20 Do you know Rebecca solnit?\n38:22 No, okay.\n38:24 I met a writer which was cool.\n38:27 I found what's it called?\n38:31 I connected with her at the on being think she wrote a lot of really interesting books and I sent her an email and I just remember freaking out the whole time.\n38:41 I am like, is this a good email?\n38:43 Is it is this like a they got yours like I am writing a writer?\n38:48 It feels nervous.\n38:50 I feel nervous just like right bad grammar something.\n38:54 You're talking about writing an email to a writer.\n39:01 Try flirting with Peter.\n39:03 Oh, shoot.\n39:04 Yeah, is it going?\n39:05 Well, okay.\n39:08 I found the exit end of program report.\n39:10 I think I called it the axi end of program report addendum

be really shortened.\n39:23 And actually I like this would be great.\n39:25 I need to get stuff.\n39:26 Published because you know nahal was introducing me to some people that may go who wants to do a post-traumatic growth thing.\n39:32 There's a guy have a friend.\n39:33 Who does that kind of stuff and it just like it's nowhere.\n39:36 It's not even on the bloom website.\n39:37 I think like an

Yeah.\n42:29 You're hilarious it gets.\n42:33 It's messy it gets messy, and he gets into theoretical.\n42:36 Like what is the spirit?\n42:37 What is the mind?\n42:38 What is the hand can be like think of the philosophy about the yeah, and then I tried to align it skills Builder mashed with via skills Builder match with the ls cels ee management via elysée é match with it doing this now with a I will be so much easier and probably better.\n42:53 No, that's crazy.\n42:55 So this is gonna be cool.\n42:56 Like you could actually potentially use this like, oh are these the actual clusters or maybe I could do it, but I thought I just remind you that we have done some of this thinking and x0 and then the what's it called there the for the Harvard stuff.\n43:10 Remember the Harvard mapping thing?\n43:12 Yeah.\n43:13 Yeah.\n43:14 Okay, but we don't want to get too deep what we want to do and then here's the knowledge technique versus Praxis versus phronesis.\n43:22 Like there's their Italian thing, and we're looking for more technical knowledge of change of variable and practice.\n43:29 Okay, cool.\n43:32 Cool.\n43:32 Cool.\n43:32 Okay, I guess.\n43:33 It's not working right

      "content": "Certainly, exploring and recommending verifiable and certifiable leadership frameworks involves considering both well-established models and emerging approaches that have gained global recognition. Here are some notable frameworks:\n\n1. **Skills Builder Framework**: \n   - **Focus**: Emphasizes eight essential skills for success, including leadership. It's structured around four progressive stages: Beginner, Learner, Practitioner, and Expert.\n   - **Measurability**: Offers clear progression steps, making it easier to measure and certify skills development.\n   - **Application**: Widely used in education and corporate settings for skill development.\n\n2. **EntreComp Framework (The European Entrepreneurship Competence Framework)**:\n   - **Focus**: Targets entrepreneurial skills, with leadership as a key component. It identifies competencies across three major areas: Ideas & Opportunities, Resources, and Into Action.\n   - **Measurability**: Provides a detailed progression model for each skill, useful for assessment and certification.\n   - **Application**: Recognized in Europe for entrepreneurship education and training, but also relevant globally.\n\n3. **Leadership Circle Profile**:\n   - **Focus**: This framework integrates several leadership theories into a comprehensive model. It measures two primary leadership dimensions: Creative Competencies and Reactive Tendencies.\n   - **Measurability**: Utilizes a 360-degree feedback mechanism, making it robust for leadership assessment.\n   - **Application**: Used globally, particularly in executive coaching and organizational development.\n\n4. **Transformational Leadership Theory**:\n   - **Focus**: Focuses on the impact of transformational leaders who inspire and motivate followers to exceed their own self-interests for the good of the organization.\n   - **Measurability**: Assessed through various scales, like the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ).\n   - **Application**: Widely accepted in academic research and practical leadership development programs.\n\n5. **Situational Leadership Model**:\n   - **Focus**: Based on the belief that different situations demand different kinds of leadership. It adjusts leadership styles based on the maturity level of followers.\n   - **Measurability**: Offers a structured approach to understanding and applying different leadership styles, useful for training and development.\n   - **Application**: Popular in corporate leadership training programs.\n\n6. **Emotional Intelligence Frameworks (e.g., Goleman's EI Model)**:\n   - **Focus**: Highlights the role of emotional intelligence in effective leadership. Goleman identifies five EI components: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.\n   - **Measurability**: Assessed using tools like the Emotional Competence Inventory (ECI) or the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal.\n   - **Application**: Increasingly recognized as a crucial component of leadership development in various sectors.\n\n7. **Strengths-Based Leadership (Gallup’s StrengthsFinder)**:\n   - **Focus**: Centers on identifying and leveraging individual strengths in leadership roles.\n   - **Measurability**: Uses the CliftonStrengths assessment to identify individual talents and strengths.\n   - **Application**: Popular in personal development and team-building initiatives.\n\nWhen considering a framework for leadership development, it's important to align the framework with the specific goals and context of your organization or program. Each framework offers unique insights and tools for measuring and developing leadership competencies. Additionally, it may be beneficial to integrate aspects of multiple frameworks to create a more holistic approach to leadership development.",

      "content": "Measuring the competencies outlined in the EntreComp Framework effectively requires a blend of qualitative and quantitative approaches, with a focus on performance-based assessments. Here are some methods that can be used to quantify the EntreComp competencies:\n\n1. **Project-Based Assessments**: \n   - **Description**: Assign projects or tasks that align with specific competencies in the EntreComp framework. For instance, a project requiring innovation and problem-solving could measure competencies related to 'Ideas & Opportunities'.\n   - **Quantification**: Evaluate the outcome based on pre-defined criteria like creativity, problem-solving efficiency, or the viability of solutions.\n\n2. **Simulations and Role-Playing**:\n   - **Description**: Create simulated business scenarios where participants make decisions, solve problems, or manage resources. \n   - **Quantification**: Score participants based on their decision-making process, resource management efficiency, and problem-solving skills.\n\n3. **360-Degree Feedback**:\n   - **Description**: Collect feedback from a variety of sources including peers, subordinates, and superiors.\n   - **Quantification**: Use a standardized rating scale to assess various competencies. Aggregate and analyze the data to provide a quantitative measure of skills like leadership, teamwork, and communication.\n\n4. **Self-Assessment Surveys**:\n   - **Description**: Use structured surveys where participants rate their own skills.\n   - **Quantification**: Apply Likert scales (e.g., 1-5 rating) for different competencies. Analyze the results to identify perceived strengths and areas for improvement.\n\n5. **Case Studies and Business Plan Development**:\n   - **Description**: Have participants analyze case studies or develop business plans relevant to their field.\n   - **Quantification**: Score based on criteria such as analytical depth, practicality of the business plan, and innovation.\n\n6. **Skills Tests and Quizzes**:\n   - **Description**: Implement tests focusing on specific knowledge areas related to entrepreneurship, like market analysis, financial literacy, or legal aspects.\n   - **Quantification**: Use scoring systems to evaluate the correctness and depth of responses.\n\n7. **Behavioral Interviews**:\n   - **Description**: Conduct interviews focusing on past experiences where specific competencies were demonstrated.\n   - **Quantification**: Use a scoring rubric to evaluate responses based on factors like complexity of the situation handled, effectiveness of the solution, and impact of the actions taken.\n\n8. **Competency Checklists**:\n   - **Description**: Develop checklists that outline specific behaviors or actions that demonstrate each competency.\n   - **Quantification**: Use the checklist to track and evaluate the frequency and quality of these behaviors in real-life scenarios.\n\n9. **Digital Portfolios**:\n   - **Description**: Encourage participants to compile digital portfolios showcasing their work, projects, or achievements related to the competencies.\n   - **Quantification**: Assess the portfolios based on criteria such as complexity of projects, diversity of skills demonstrated, and the quality of work.\n\n10. **Peer Review**:\n    - **Description**: Implement a system where participants evaluate each other's work or contributions in team settings.\n    - **Quantification**: Use peer evaluations to quantify aspects like teamwork, collaboration, and leadership.\n\nRemember, the effectiveness of these assessments depends on their alignment with the specific competencies you aim to measure within the EntreComp framework. It's also crucial to ensure that the assessment methods are valid, reliable, and applicable to the contexts in which the participants are operating. Combining multiple methods can provide a more comprehensive and accurate measurement of the EntreComp competencies.",

      "content": "Among the performance assessments for measuring competencies in the EntreComp framework, the ones requiring the least human intervention typically leverage automated or self-directed processes. Here are a few options that minimize the need for extensive human involvement:\n\n1. **Skills Tests and Quizzes**:\n   - **Automation**: These can be fully automated using online platforms where questions are pre-set, and the system automatically scores responses based on correctness and depth. \n   - **Minimal Intervention**: Once the test is designed, it requires little to no ongoing human involvement, except for initial setup and occasional updates.\n\n2. **Self-Assessment Surveys**:\n   - **Automation**: Surveys can be administered and analyzed using online survey tools. Participants rate themselves on various competencies using a standardized scale.\n   - **Minimal Intervention**: The process requires minimal human intervention, primarily in the survey design phase and for analyzing aggregate data.\n\n3. **Digital Portfolios**:\n   - **Semi-Automated Review**: Participants compile their portfolios independently. The review process can be semi-automated using software that checks for certain keywords or criteria.\n   - **Minimal Intervention**: Human intervention is needed more in setting criteria and final evaluation, but the bulk of the work is carried out by the participant and the software.\n\n4. **360-Degree Feedback** (with automation tools):\n   - **Automation**: There are tools available that automate the distribution, collection, and basic analysis of 360-degree feedback.\n   - **Minimal Intervention**: Human involvement is mainly in the interpretation of the results, while data collection and aggregation can be largely automated.\n\n5. **Competency Checklists** (digitally monitored):\n   - **Digital Tracking**: Competency checklists can be tracked using digital tools where participants self-report their progress.\n   - **Minimal Intervention**: Requires human input for initial setup and final evaluation, but the tracking can be largely automated or self-managed.\n\n6. **Case Studies and Business Plan Development** (with structured evaluation criteria):\n   - **Template-Based Assessment**: If the assessment criteria are structured and template-based, much of the evaluation can be standardized.\n   - **Minimal Intervention**: Requires initial effort in designing the case study and setting up the evaluation template, but subsequent assessments can be more streamlined.\n\nEach of these methods has its strengths and limitations, and the choice largely depends on the specific competencies you're looking to measure and the context in which the assessment is being conducted. Automated and self-assessment tools are efficient and require less human intervention, but they might not always capture the depth and nuance that a more hands-on approach can offer. It's often beneficial to use a combination of methods to balance efficiency and comprehensiveness.",

      "content": "Modern best practices for assessing and verifying \"soft skills,\" also known as 21st-century skills, leadership skills, and entrepreneurship skills, have evolved to address the dynamic and often subjective nature of these competencies. The focus is on creating reliable, valid, and comprehensive assessments that can capture the nuances of these skills. Here are some of the most up-to-date practices:\n\n1. **Holistic Assessment Approach**: \n   - Combining various methods such as self-assessments, peer reviews, simulations, and 360-degree feedback to capture different dimensions of soft skills.\n   - Ensuring a balance between subjective self-assessment and more objective measures like observed behaviors or outcomes.\n\n2. **Use of Technology and Digital Tools**: \n   - Leveraging online platforms and software for assessments, such as using AI-driven analysis for large-scale data.\n   - Implementing gamified assessments and virtual reality (VR) simulations to evaluate skills in more engaging and realistic settings.\n\n3. **Performance-Based Assessments**:\n   - Focusing on real-world tasks and projects to assess the application of skills in practical scenarios.\n   - Using case studies, role-playing, and project-based learning as part of the assessment process.\n\n4. **Continuous and Formative Assessment**:\n   - Shifting from one-time testing to ongoing evaluation to track development over time.\n   - Implementing micro-assessments and regular feedback loops for continuous skill development.\n\n5. **Behavioral Indicators and Rubrics**:\n   - Developing clear, behavior-based indicators for each skill to provide tangible measures for assessment.\n   - Using rubrics with defined criteria to standardize the evaluation process and reduce subjectivity.\n\n6. **360-Degree Feedback and Peer Review**:\n   - Incorporating feedback from a range of sources, including colleagues, superiors, and subordinates, to provide a comprehensive view of an individual's skills.\n   - Using peer assessments to gauge teamwork, communication, and other interpersonal skills.\n\n7. **Self-Reflection and Narrative Assessments**:\n   - Encouraging self-reflection exercises where individuals assess and articulate their skill development and experiences.\n   - Including narrative assessments like reflective essays or journals to capture personal growth and self-awareness.\n\n8. **Competency Frameworks and Alignment**:\n   - Aligning assessment practices with established competency frameworks like the EntreComp for entrepreneurship or Emotional Intelligence frameworks for leadership.\n   - Ensuring that assessments are relevant and aligned with industry standards and requirements.\n\n9. **Cultural and Contextual Relevance**:\n   - Adapting assessments to be culturally sensitive and contextually relevant.\n   - Considering diverse perspectives and backgrounds in the development and implementation of assessments.\n\n10. **Data Privacy and Ethical Considerations**:\n    - Ensuring the ethical use of data collected during assessments, respecting privacy and confidentiality.\n    - Being transparent about how assessment data will be used and ensuring it is handled securely.\n\n11. **Professional Development and Training for Assessors**:\n    - Providing training and professional development for those conducting assessments to ensure reliability and validity.\n    - Regularly updating training to reflect current best practices in soft skills assessment.\n\nThese practices reflect a shift towards more integrated, dynamic, and technologically supported methods of assessment. They emphasize the importance of context, continuous learning, and the multifaceted nature of soft skills. By adopting these approaches, organizations and educators can more accurately and effectively assess and verify soft skills in various settings.",

      "content": "As of my last update in April 2023, there is no singular international standard for measuring and certifying soft skills that is universally accepted across all industries and countries. However, there are several frameworks and methodologies that are widely recognized and used for this purpose. These frameworks often serve as benchmarks or guidelines rather than strict standards. Some notable examples include:\n\n1. **OECD's Definition and Selection of Competencies (DeSeCo) Project**: \n   - The DeSeCo Project by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provides a theoretical framework for defining key competencies in various life contexts. It's widely referenced in educational and occupational settings.\n\n2. **European Qualifications Framework (EQF)**:\n   - The EQF is a common European reference framework that links countries' qualifications systems, helping to make qualifications more readable and understandable across different countries in Europe. It includes competencies that can be related to soft skills.\n\n3. **EntreComp: The European Entrepreneurship Competence Framework**:\n   - As mentioned earlier, EntreComp is a framework developed by the European Union to define the competencies that make someone entrepreneurial. It is used in various educational and training settings across Europe.\n\n4. **Emotional Intelligence Frameworks (e.g., Goleman’s EI Model)**:\n   - These frameworks are used globally to assess and develop emotional intelligence, a key component of soft skills. They often include aspects such as self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.\n\n5. **World Economic Forum’s 21st Century Skills**:\n   - The WEF identifies key skills needed in the 21st century, including foundational literacies, competencies (such as critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration), and character qualities like curiosity and adaptability.\n\n6. **ASTD (Association for Talent Development) Competency Model**:\n   - Although more focused on training and development professionals, the ASTD model outlines a range of competencies and skills that are relevant to a broader professional context.\n\n7. **International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards**:\n   - While focused on educational technology, the ISTE standards encompass a range of soft skills, particularly around digital citizenship and collaborative work.\n\nThese frameworks are often adapted or referenced in creating soft skill assessment and certification programs by educational institutions, training providers, and professional organizations. The key challenge in measuring and certifying soft skills lies in their subjective nature and the context-dependent way in which these skills are manifested and utilized. Therefore, while these frameworks provide a foundational guide, many organizations tailor their assessment and certification processes to fit their specific context and requirements.",

These measures are often used in educational, training, and professional development contexts:\n\n1. **Emotional Intelligence Frameworks (e.g., Goleman’s EI Model)**:\n   - **Measures**: Tools like the Emotional Competence Inventory (ECI) or the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal are used to assess emotional intelligence components like self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.\n\n2. **World Economic Forum’s 21st Century Skills**:\n   - **Measures**: While the WEF outlines key skills, the specific assessment tools are often developed by educational institutions or organizations in alignment with these skills. These may include performance-based assessments, peer reviews, and self-assessment surveys.\n\n3. **ASTD (Association for Talent Development) Competency Model**:\n   - **Measures**: The model itself does not come with a specific assessment tool, but it is used to guide the development of competency assessments in professional and organizational settings, often through 360-degree feedback, self-assessments, and performance evaluations.\n\n4. **International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards**:\n   - **Measures**: ISTE provides a range of assessment tools and resources for educators to measure their own and their students' progress in meeting these standards. These include self-assessment tools, checklists, and reflection guides.\n\n5. **OECD's Definition and Selection of Competencies (DeSeCo) Project** and **European Qualifications Framework (EQF)**:\n   - **Measures**: These frameworks provide a conceptual foundation for understanding key competencies and are often used to inform the development of assessment tools. However, they do not come with specific measurement tools. Instead, countries and institutions develop their own assessments based on these frameworks.\n\n6. **EntreComp: The European Entrepreneurship Competence Framework**:\n   - **Measures**: EntreComp itself is a framework and does not offer specific assessment tools. However, it is used as a basis for developing entrepreneurship education and assessment programs, which may include project-based assessments, simulations, and portfolio reviews.\n\nIn general, while these frameworks provide a structured approach to understanding and categorizing soft skills, the actual assessment tools are often developed separately by organizations, educational institutions, or training providers to fit their specific needs and contexts. These tools can range from standardized tests and quizzes to more complex and interactive methods like simulations, role-plays, and project-based assessments.",

      "content": "Among the frameworks previously mentioned, the Emotional Intelligence frameworks, particularly those based on Daniel Goleman’s model, have readily available assessments with specific questions. One widely recognized tool for assessing Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the Emotional Competence Inventory (ECI) and its successor, the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI). Another popular tool is the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal.\n\n### Emotional Intelligence Appraisal:\nThis assessment measures four core EI skills:\n\n1. **Self-Awareness**\n2. **Self-Management**\n3. **Social Awareness**\n4. **Relationship Management**\n\nThe appraisal includes questions that are typically rated on a frequency scale (e.g., \"How often do you...?\"). Sample questions might include:\n\n1. **Self-Awareness Questions**:\n   - \"How often are you aware of your emotions as they arise?\"\n   - \"How frequently do you recognize how your feelings affect your performance?\"\n\n2. **Self-Management Questions**:\n   - \"How often do you manage your emotional impulses effectively?\"\n   - \"How frequently do you take initiative to improve or correct your behavior?\"\n\n3. **Social Awareness Questions**:\n   - \"How often do you pick up on emotional cues from others at work?\"\n   - \"How regularly do you understand the perspective of others in a conflict situation?\"\n\n4. **Relationship Management Questions**:\n   - \"How often do you handle difficult people and tense situations with diplomacy?\"\n   - \"How frequently do you build strong relationships with others at work?\"\n\n### Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI):\nDeveloped by Daniel Goleman and Richard Boyatzis, the ESCI focuses on 12 EI competencies grouped into four clusters:\n\n1. **Self-Awareness**\n2. **Self-Management**\n3. **Social Awareness**\n4. **Relationship Management**\n\nThe ESCI typically uses a multi-rater or 360-degree feedback mechanism, where individuals are assessed by themselves, their peers, superiors, and subordinates. Sample aspects evaluated include:\n\n1. **Emotional Self-Awareness**: Recognizing one’s emotions and their impact.\n2. **Achievement Orientation**: Striving to meet or exceed a standard of excellence.\n3. **Empathy**: Sensing others’ feelings and perspectives.\n4. **Inspirational Leadership**: Inspiring and guiding individuals or groups.\n\nWhile specific questions from these assessments are proprietary and not publicly available, the general focus is on evaluating how individuals recognize, understand, and manage their own emotions and those of others. These tools are widely used in corporate training, personal development, and organizational development contexts. They often require facilitator training or certification to administer and interpret.",

      "content": "\"Psychometric properties\" refer to the characteristics that define the quality and efficacy of a psychological test or assessment tool. These properties are crucial for determining whether a test is reliable and valid in measuring what it's intended to measure. Understanding psychometric properties is essential in fields like psychology, education, organizational behavior, and any other area where assessments of human characteristics are important. The main psychometric properties include:\n\n1. **Reliability**: \n   - **Description**: Reliability refers to the consistency of a test or assessment. A reliable test will produce the same or very similar results under consistent conditions.\n   - **Types**:\n     - **Test-Retest Reliability**: The stability of test scores over time.\n     - **Internal Consistency**: The extent to which items within a test measure the same construct.\n     - **Inter-Rater Reliability**: The degree of agreement among different raters or observers.\n\n2. **Validity**: \n   - **Description**: Validity is about the accuracy of a test, specifically whether the test measures what it claims to measure.\n   - **Types**:\n     - **Content Validity**: The extent to which a test represents all facets of a given construct.\n     - **Criterion Validity (Predictive and Concurrent)**: The extent to which a test correlates with a relevant outcome (predictive) or with previously established measures of the same construct (concurrent).\n     - **Construct Validity**: The degree to which a test measures the theoretical construct it's supposed to measure.\n\n3. **Standardization**:\n   - **Description**: This refers to the uniformity of the procedures and conditions under which a test is administered and scored. Standardization is vital for comparing results across different individuals or groups.\n\n4. **Norming**:\n   - **Description**: Norming involves establishing norms or benchmarks for a test based on the test results of a large, representative sample. These norms help in interpreting an individual's score in relation to a broader population.\n\n5. **Scale Properties**:\n   - **Description**: This includes the characteristics of the scale used in the test, such as its type (e.g., Likert scale), range, and scoring system.\n\n6. **Item Analysis**:\n   - **Description**: This is the evaluation of individual items within a test to assess their effectiveness and contribution to the overall test. It helps in refining the test by identifying items that are too easy, too difficult, or irrelevant.\n\nUnderstanding these psychometric properties is essential for developing and selecting appropriate assessment tools, especially in contexts where accurate and fair measurement of abilities, personality, attitudes, or other psychological traits is critical.",

      "content": "Yes, there are Outcome-Based Assessments (OBAs) specifically designed for evaluating entrepreneurial skills. Outcome-Based Assessment focuses on the end results of the learning process, evaluating what learners can actually do with the knowledge and skills they have acquired. This approach is particularly relevant for entrepreneurial skills, as it emphasizes practical application and real-world impact. Here are some key types of OBAs used for assessing entrepreneurial skills:\n\n1. **Business Plan Development and Presentation**:\n   - Learners create a comprehensive business plan and present it. This assesses their ability to conceive, plan, and articulate a business idea, covering market analysis, financial planning, and strategy.\n\n2. **Simulations and Role-Playing Exercises**:\n   - Participants engage in simulations that mimic real-life entrepreneurial challenges. This can include handling a startup scenario, responding to market changes, or pitching to investors.\n\n3. **Project-Based Learning (PBL)**:\n   - Learners undertake a project where they must apply entrepreneurial skills to develop a product or service, manage a team, or execute a small business venture.\n\n4. **Portfolio Assessments**:\n   - Learners compile a portfolio of work that demonstrates their entrepreneurial skills. This can include business plans, marketing strategies, financial analyses, and reflective essays on their learning journey.\n\n5. **Case Study Analysis**:\n   - Assessment based on the analysis of real-world business cases, where learners must apply their entrepreneurial knowledge to solve problems, make decisions, or recommend strategies.\n\n6. **Self and Peer Assessments**:\n   - Learners and their peers assess each other’s entrepreneurial skills based on group projects or collaborative tasks. This can include feedback on leadership, teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.\n\n7. **Competitions and Challenges**:\n   - Organizing or participating in entrepreneurial competitions or challenges where learners pitch ideas, develop prototypes, or present business solutions to real-world problems.\n\n8. **Reflection and Self-Evaluation**:\n   - Encouraging learners to reflect on their own entrepreneurial journey, challenges faced, and learning outcomes. This can be done through journals, blogs, or reflective essays.\n\n9. **360-Degree Feedback**:\n   - Gathering feedback from multiple sources, including instructors, peers, industry mentors, or even potential customers, to evaluate learners’ entrepreneurial skills.\n\nThese assessments are designed to evaluate not just theoretical knowledge, but also practical skills and competencies essential in entrepreneurship, such as innovation, risk-taking, resourcefulness, and resilience. By focusing on outcomes, these assessments provide a more holistic view of a learner’s entrepreneurial capabilities.",
