  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is applying for a UNICEF Learning and Development role and requested Claude's help to review their application materials and gather additional content to strengthen their proposal. The user has a Master's in Education from Learning Planet Institute and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from University of Michigan. They co-founded Bloom, a venture platform, and have worked with organizations including GEMSI, ITC, Nawaya, and Autodesk, focusing on learning systems, entrepreneurship, and innovation spaces. Their experience includes work in refugee contexts and post-conflict settings, combining technical and pedagogical expertise.\n\nClaude reviewed the user's Terms of Reference documents, cover letter, and technical/financial proposals, finding them coherent and well-structured but identifying opportunities for strengthening with more concrete examples and evidence of impact. Since no previous conversation history was available, Claude proceeded directly to asking ten targeted questions designed to elicit specific examples and deeper substance for the application. These questions focused on areas including evidence-based impact measurement, knowledge management systems, trauma-informed learning design, governance structures, AI literacy training, management development, facilitation approaches, and working within UN-adjacent organizational constraints.\n\nThe user's approach emphasizes practical principles like \"three-click\" findability, \"reuse before build\" philosophy, and measuring \"behavior change instead of attendance.\" They have experience running 118 sprint cycles at Bloom and have developed expertise in creating sustainable learning governance structures. Claude's questioning strategy aimed to help the user articulate the texture and specifics that would demonstrate actual hands-on experience rather than theoretical knowledge, particularly focusing on failures and lessons learned, concrete metrics and outcomes, and adaptation strategies for different organizational contexts.",

Review the proposal documents they've shared\n3. Ask 10 questions to gather content needed to help their UNICEF application\n\nLet me start by searching their conversation history to understand their background, style, and approach.\n\nI should use the conversation_search tool to find relevant past conversations about:\n- Their facilitation style\n- Their work approach\n- Their learning design philosophy\n- Any relevant project work\n- Their communication style\n\nLet me search for key terms that would reveal their approach to work.I'll search through our past conversations to understand your facilitation style, approach, and ways of working, then ask you targeted questions to strengthen your application.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nNo results for that search. Let me try different keywords related to their work.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nStill no results. Let me try searching for their company Bloom or their projects.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nLet me try recent chats to see what we've discussed recently.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nInteresting - no conversation history found. This might be a new project conversation or the history isn't available. Let me proceed with what I have from the documents they've shared and ask insightful questions based on:\n\n1. The ToR requirements\n2. Their cover letter and proposals\n3. Their CV/work history in the job description document\n\nFrom the documents, I can see:\n- They have a Master's in Education from Learning Planet Institute (CRI)\n- Bachelor's in CS from U Michigan\n- Co-founded Bloom (venture platform)\n- Work with GEMSI, ITC, Nawaya, Autodesk\n- Focus on learning systems, entrepreneurship, innovation spaces\n- Experience in refugee contexts, post-conflict settings\n- Technical + pedagogical background\n\nThe ToR wants:\n- L&D strategy covering technical, soft skills, management\n- Rounds of conversation facilitation\n- Learning pathways\n- Repository and governance\n- Evidence-based evaluation\n\nTheir proposal is solid but could be strengthened with:\n- More specific examples of past work\n- Clearer evidence of impact\n- Stronger connection between their experience and UNICEF's needs\n- More detail on trauma-informed approaches\n- Concrete examples of governance structures they've built\n\nLet me craft 10 questions that will help me gather the content needed to strengthen their application.I don't see previous conversations in this project space, so I'll work from the documents you've shared. I've reviewed your ToR, cover letter, technical and financial proposals - they're coherent and well-structured. Now let me ask 10 questions to help strengthen your application with concrete examples and deeper substance:\n\n## 10 Questions to Strengthen Your Application\n\n**1. Evidence of Impact**\nYou mention measuring \"behavior change instead of attendance\" - can you give me a specific example where you designed a learning intervention, what you measured (your actual KPIs), and what changed? Numbers, before/after, actual outcomes.\n\n**2. The \"Three-Click\" Principle**\nYou emphasize findability within three clicks. Walk me through a knowledge management system you've actually built - what was the architecture, what tools did you use, and how did you know people were actually using it?\n\n**3. Trauma-Informed Design**\nYour proposal mentions \"trauma-informed by design\" and you've worked in refugee camps and post-conflict contexts. What does trauma-informed learning design actually look like in practice? Give me a concrete example of how you adapted something because of this lens.\n\n**4. Governance That Sticks**\nYou talk about \"30-minute monthly committee cadence\" and \"sunset rules.\" Can you describe a learning governance structure you've set up that actually continued after you left? What made it sustainable versus performative?\n\n**5. The Flop**\nWhat's a learning pathway or intervention you designed that didn't work? What failed, why, and what did you learn that now shapes your approach?\n\n**6. AI Learning Design**\nThe role involves AI upskilling. You have tech background but what's your actual experience designing learning for AI literacy? Have you taught non-technical people to use AI tools? What worked/didn't?\n\n**7. Middle Management Development**\nThe ToR emphasizes management/middle-management development. What's your philosophy on teaching people to manage? What's one non-obvious thing you've learned about developing managers in innovation contexts?\n\n**8. Rounds of Conversation**\nThey want \"brown bag lunches\" and informal learning spaces. You've run 118 sprint cycles at Bloom - how did you create psychological safety and genuine peer learning (not just networking theater)? What's your facilitation approach?\n\n**9. The Repository Problem**\nEveryone builds learning repositories. Most become graveyards. You say \"reuse before build\" - give me an example of how you've actually gotten people to use and maintain a shared knowledge base over time.\n\n**10. The UNICEF Context**\nYou've worked with ITC and in UN-adjacent spaces, but UNICEF has particular constraints - bureaucracy, distributed teams, innovation fatigue, multiple languages/cultures. What's your theory about what actually works in these environments versus startup/NGO contexts?\n\n---\n\nTake your time with these. I'm looking for the texture and specifics that will make evaluators think \"this person has actually done this work and learned from it\" rather than \"this person can write a good proposal.\"",

Their CV/work history in the job description document\n\nFrom the documents, I can see:\n- They have a Master's in Education from Learning Planet Institute (CRI)\n- Bachelor's in CS from U Michigan\n- Co-founded Bloom (venture platform)\n- Work with GEMSI, ITC, Nawaya, Autodesk\n- Focus on learning systems, entrepreneurship, innovation spaces\n- Experience in refugee contexts, post-conflict settings\n- Technical + pedagogical background\n\nThe ToR wants:\n- L&D strategy covering technical, soft skills, management\n- Rounds of conversation facilitation\n- Learning pathways\n- Repository and governance\n- Evidence-based evaluation\n\nTheir proposal is solid but could be strengthened with:\n- More specific examples of past work\n- Clearer evidence of impact\n- Stronger connection between their experience and UNICEF's needs\n- More detail on trauma-informed approaches\n- Concrete examples of governance structures they've built\n\nLet me craft 10 questions that will help me gather the content needed to strengthen their application.",

I've reviewed your ToR, cover letter, technical and financial proposals - they're coherent and well-structured. Now let me ask 10 questions to help strengthen your application with concrete examples and deeper substance:\n\n## 10 Questions to Strengthen Your Application\n\n**1. Evidence of Impact**\nYou mention measuring \"behavior change instead of attendance\" - can you give me a specific example where you designed a learning intervention, what you measured (your actual KPIs), and what changed? Numbers, before/after, actual outcomes.\n\n**2. The \"Three-Click\" Principle**\nYou emphasize findability within three clicks. Walk me through a knowledge management system you've actually built - what was the architecture, what tools did you use, and how did you know people were actually using it?\n\n**3. Trauma-Informed Design**\nYour proposal mentions \"trauma-informed by design\" and you've worked in refugee camps and post-conflict contexts. What does trauma-informed learning design actually look like in practice? Give me a concrete example of how you adapted something because of this lens.\n\n**4. Governance That Sticks**\nYou talk about \"30-minute monthly committee cadence\" and \"sunset rules.\" Can you describe a learning governance structure you've set up that actually continued after you left? What made it sustainable versus performative?\n\n**5. The Flop**\nWhat's a learning pathway or intervention you designed that didn't work? What failed, why, and what did you learn that now shapes your approach?\n\n**6. AI Learning Design**\nThe role involves AI upskilling. You have tech background but what's your actual experience designing learning for AI literacy? Have you taught non-technical people to use AI tools? What worked/didn't?\n\n**7. Middle Management Development**\nThe ToR emphasizes management/middle-management development. What's your philosophy on teaching people to manage? What's one non-obvious thing you've learned about developing managers in innovation contexts?\n\n**8. Rounds of Conversation**\nThey want \"brown bag lunches\" and informal learning spaces. You've run 118 sprint cycles at Bloom - how did you create psychological safety and genuine peer learning (not just networking theater)? What's your facilitation approach?\n\n**9. The Repository Problem**\nEveryone builds learning repositories. Most become graveyards. You say \"reuse before build\" - give me an example of how you've actually gotten people to use and maintain a shared knowledge base over time.\n\n**10. The UNICEF Context**\nYou've worked with ITC and in UN-adjacent spaces, but UNICEF has particular constraints - bureaucracy, distributed teams, innovation fatigue, multiple languages/cultures. What's your theory about what actually works in these environments versus startup/NGO contexts?\n\n---\n\nTake your time with these. I'm looking for the texture and specifics that will make evaluators think \"this person has actually done this work and learned from it\" rather than \"this person can write a good proposal.\"",
