      "content": "Cursive is “context as a first-class citizen” for the web stack.\n\nIf HTML/CSS/JS answer **what it is / how it looks / what it does**, Cursive answers:\n\n> **Who did this, in what situation, for whom, and toward what change?**\n\nHere’s one way it could look at the “Context” layer:\n\n### 1. What Cursive *is*\n\n**Cursive = a context protocol + a reference app.**\n\n- **Protocol:** a small set of primitives that can wrap *any* artifact (doc, page, issue, note, video, PR, etc.) with shared context.\n- **Reference app:** a workspace that lives on top of those primitives and lets humans actually *use* that context in their day-to-day work.\n\nThink of it like **HTML for meaning** plus **Git for intent**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Core primitives (the protocol)\n\nAt the protocol level, Cursive doesn’t care *what* the content is; it cares about **its story**.\n\nYou might have something like:\n\n- **Artifact**\n  - `artifact_id` (URL, foreign key, etc.)\n  - `kind` (doc, page, card, email, repo, etc.)\n\n- **Author & Identity**\n  - `actor_id`\n  - `signature` / origin (human, org, AI-assisted, etc.)\n\n- **Situation**\n  - `when` (timestamp / span)\n  - `where` (project, group, client, cohort)\n  - `session_id` (a work sprint / walkthrough)\n\n- **Intent**\n  - `goal` (what were you trying to move?)\n  - `tension` (the problem, question, or stuckness)\n  - `audience` (who is this really for?)\n\n- **State**\n  - `status` (draft, in-play, adopted, archived)\n  - `lineage` (derived from X, superseded by Y)\n  - `trust` (rough signal: “safe to rely on?”)\n\nEach artifact can have **many context entries over time** (different people, new tensions, evolving states). The protocol is just: *how do we represent and link those cleanly?*\n\n---\n\n### 3. What the reference app feels like\n\nOn top of that protocol, the **Cursive app** is:\n\n- A place where you **work as usual** (notes, walkthroughs, sessions)  \n  but everything you do quietly emits those **context objects**.\n- A **navigation surface** where you browse by:\n  - “Show me everything related to this tension”\n  - “What did we learn the last time we tried to solve X?”\n  - “What are the live ‘in-play’ artifacts for this project?”\n  - “What did Bilal touch in the last week related to Client Y?”\n\nInstead of a file tree, you get a **context graph**: people, tensions, sessions, artifacts, and decisions.\n\n---\n\n### 4. What Cursive is *not*\n\n- Not a new transport (HTTP still moves the bits).\n- Not a replacement for docs, Notion, GitHub, etc.  \n  It wraps them.\n- Not just “tags” or “labels” — it’s **structured stories about use**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Short tagline for your stack diagram\n\nYou could render it like:\n\n> **Cursive → Context & Lineage**  \n> *Who made it, in what situation, chasing which tension,  \n> how it evolved, and whether it’s safe to stand on now.*",
