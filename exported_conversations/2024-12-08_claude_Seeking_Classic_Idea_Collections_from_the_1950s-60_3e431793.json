      "content": " A few collections from that era could match your description, but the \"Great Books of the Western World\" series (first published in 1952) isn't quite what you're looking for since it focused on classical works. Given that you're mentioning Erich Fromm's \"The Art of Loving\" (1956), you might be thinking of the \"World Perspectives\" series, published by Harper & Brothers/Thames and Hudson from the 1950s to 1970s, edited by Ruth Nanda Anshen.\n\nHowever, since you're asking about a very specific collection from several decades ago, I want to note that while I'm confident about the general timeframe and existence of some of these series, I may be uncertain about specific details.\n\nAnother possibility could be the \"Harper Torchbooks\" series, which included many influential works of psychology, philosophy, and social theory including some of Fromm's work.\n\nWould either of these series sound familiar? If not, could you remember any other books that were in the collection you're thinking of? That might help narrow it down.",
