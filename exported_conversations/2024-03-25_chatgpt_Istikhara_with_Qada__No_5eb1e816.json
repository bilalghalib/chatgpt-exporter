      "content": "In the Maliki tradition, as in other Islamic schools of thought, Istikhara (prayer for guidance) can be performed at any time when a Muslim needs divine guidance in making a decision. However, it is typically not combined directly with Qada prayers (missed obligatory prayers that are being made up). \n\nThe practice of Istikhara involves praying two Rak'ahs of non-obligatory prayer, which is distinct from the Qada prayers. After performing the Istikhara prayer, one should ideally recite the special Istikhara supplication. Combining Istikhara with Qada prayers would not align with the traditional methodology, as Qada prayers are the making up of missed obligatory prayers, and Istikhara is a separate, non-obligatory prayer for seeking guidance.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that Islamic jurisprudence can vary, and individual circumstances might lead to different interpretations or recommendations. For a specific, personalized ruling, it's always best to consult with a knowledgeable scholar or Imam familiar with the Maliki tradition.",

      "content": "In the Maliki school of thought, as in other Islamic jurisprudential traditions, the intentions and purposes of different types of prayers are distinct and generally not combined. Taraweeh prayers are specific to the month of Ramadan, performed in congregation (jama'ah), and are considered a highly recommended (Sunnah) but not obligatory practice. On the other hand, Qada prayers are the making up of missed obligatory (Fard) prayers.\n\nCombining the intention of performing Taraweeh with the intention of making up missed obligatory prayers is not typically advised or practiced in the Maliki or other Islamic traditions. Each type of prayer has its own specific intention and purpose. Taraweeh is for the specific time of Ramadan and is an act of extra worship during this holy month, while Qada prayers are an obligation to make up for missed obligatory prayers.\n\nTherefore, in general, when performing Taraweeh, one should do so with the intention of Taraweeh only. Similarly, Qada prayers should be performed with the sole intention of making up the missed obligatory prayers.\n\nAgain, for personalized guidance, especially for situations involving missed prayers and the best way to make them up according to the Maliki school, it's advisable to consult with a knowledgeable scholar or Imam in your tradition.",

      "content": "In Islamic jurisprudence, the intention (niyyah) behind performing a specific prayer is crucial and should align with the nature of that prayer. Taraweeh prayers, performed during Ramadan, are specific to that month and are considered Sunnah (commended, but not obligatory) prayers. Qada prayers are the missed obligatory (Fard) prayers that a Muslim is making up.\n\nWhen you join a congregation for Taraweeh prayers, the group's collective intention is to perform Taraweeh, not Qada prayers. Therefore, if you participate in the Taraweeh with the congregation, your prayer would be considered as Taraweeh, not as Qada, because the nature and purpose of the prayer are defined by the congregation's collective intention.\n\nIn Islamic practice, especially within the Maliki school of thought, Taraweeh and Qada prayers are not interchangeable. They serve different religious purposes and are observed separately. Qada prayers should be performed with the explicit intention of making up for the specific missed obligatory prayers.\n\nIf you have missed obligatory prayers, you should make them up separately, outside the Taraweeh prayer time, with the specific intention of fulfilling your missed obligations. Always remember, for specific guidance related to personal circumstances and practices, consulting with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or Imam is advisable.",
