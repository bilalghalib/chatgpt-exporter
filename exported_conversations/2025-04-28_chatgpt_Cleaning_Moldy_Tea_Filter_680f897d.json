      "content": "Got it — thanks for the photo. It looks like you have a Yixing-style clay teapot, and the internal ball filter (the part with small holes) is clogged because tea leaves and maybe some mold grew there.\n\nHere’s a safe step-by-step way to clean it **without damaging the teapot**:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Hot Water Rinse (First)**\n- Boil some clean water.\n- Pour the boiling water *into and through* the teapot several times. Let it sit for a few minutes each time.  \n  This softens the old tea residue and mold.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Wooden Toothpick or Soft Brush (Gentle Mechanical Cleaning)**\n- Use a **wooden toothpick** (never metal) to *very gently* poke each hole in the filter from the inside.  \n- You can also use a **very soft toothbrush** or a soft **baby bottle brush** to clean inside.\n\n> **Important:** Be very careful. Yixing clay is delicate — don’t scrape hard.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Deep Soak (Optional if Needed)**\nIf hot water and gentle brushing aren’t enough:\n- Fill a pot with **boiling water**.\n- Add a **small amount of baking soda** (like half a teaspoon) — it helps break down organic material.\n- Soak the whole teapot (completely submerged) for 1–2 hours.\n\n**Alternative if you want extra strength:** Instead of baking soda, you can add **food-grade citric acid** (same as lemon acid, very effective for removing buildup).\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Final Rinse**\n- After soaking, rinse *very thoroughly* with just hot water.\n- Let the teapot air dry *completely* upside down in a clean place.\n\n---\n\n### Important Warnings:\n- **No soap**! Soap will stick in the pores of Yixing clay and ruin the taste of your tea forever.\n- **No metal tools**.\n- **No bleach** or chemical cleaners.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also show you a special technique for *re-seasoning* the pot afterward to get it back to a beautiful tea flavor? (Since mold can slightly affect the pot's aroma if not fully cleaned.)  \nLet me know!",

      "content": "Great!  \nHere’s a simple way to **re-season** your Yixing teapot after cleaning — to *restore its aroma, flavor memory, and tea energy*.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Re-season Your Yixing Teapot**\n\n**1. Boil the Teapot Alone First**\n- Place the cleaned, empty teapot carefully inside a large pot (something deep enough so the teapot is fully submerged).\n- Fill with cold water.\n- Slowly heat the pot to a **gentle boil**.\n- Let it simmer **for about 30 minutes**.\n- Then turn off the heat and let it cool down *naturally* inside the water.\n\n> **Why?** This helps open the clay pores again and remove any last traces of old smells or mold.\n\n---\n\n**2. Boil the Teapot With Tea (Second Step)**\n- Refill the pot with fresh water.\n- Add a handful of **the same type of tea** you normally brew in this teapot (for example, if it's a green tea pot, use green tea; if oolong, use oolong, etc.).\n- Put the teapot into the tea-water bath.\n- Bring to a **gentle simmer** and let it steep like this for **about 1 hour**.\n- Let it cool naturally again in the tea water.\n\n> **Why?** The clay will reabsorb the tea oils and \"relearn\" its intended flavor memory.\n\n---\n\n**3. Final Rinse and Air Dry**\n- After the tea bath, rinse the teapot **only with hot water**.\n- Place it **upside down** on a clean cloth or rack to air dry completely.\n- Then it’s ready for use!\n\n---\n\n**Bonus Tips:**\n- For the first 2–3 brews after re-seasoning, use a little extra tea and do short steeps to help rebuild the pot’s \"soul.\"\n- Always try to brew **only one type of tea** in each Yixing pot (green, oolong, pu-erh, etc.). This way the pot matures and improves over years.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also show you a simple *daily ritual* for taking care of it so you never get mold again?  \n(It's very easy and makes a big difference.)",

      "content": "Awesome — here’s a simple **daily ritual** for caring for your Yixing teapot, so it stays clean, alive, and mold-free:\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Daily Care Ritual for Yixing Teapot**\n\n**1. Rinse Well After Each Session**\n- After you finish brewing tea, **immediately rinse** the teapot thoroughly with *hot water only* (no soap, ever).\n- Swirl the hot water around to wash out the leaves and oils.\n\n---\n\n**2. Let it Dry Completely (Very Important!)**\n- **Leave the lid off**.\n- Turn the pot upside down or tilt it slightly so air can flow inside.\n- Let it dry *fully* before you store it.  \n  (Mold happens when water gets trapped.)\n\n---\n\n**3. No Closed Storage**\n- Never store the pot closed in a dark, humid place (like inside a cabinet) unless it’s **bone dry**.\n- Best: keep it out in the open air if you can.\n\n---\n\n**4. Occasionally \"Wake It Up\"**\n- Every few weeks, you can pour boiling water inside the pot and swirl it, even if you're not drinking tea that day.  \n  It keeps the clay alive and breathing.\n\n---\n\n**5. Love and Patience**\n- Every brew improves the pot.\n- Touch it, use it, pour a little tea on the outside sometimes (some people do this on purpose!) — it makes the surface slowly shiny and beautiful over time.\n\n---\n\n> **Summary:**  \n> \"Rinse hot, dry fully, breathe freely, love daily.\"\n\n---\n\nWould you like a bonus \"tea blessing\" you can say (silently or out loud) when you start your first brew after re-seasoning? Some tea lovers say it helps set a beautiful mood for tea sessions!  \n(It’s short and poetic.) Want it?",
