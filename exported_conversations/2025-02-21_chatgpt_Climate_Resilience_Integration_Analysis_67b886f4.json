We already talked about customers, but there is a lot more that goes into it!\n\n\n1\n\nConduct a market size evaluation to understand your business potential.\nLook at the competitive landscape to identify areas of opportunity.\nEvaluate some barriers to entry including financial barriers.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nConduct a market size evaluation to understand your business potential.\nLook at the competitive landscape to identify areas of opportunity.\nEvaluate some barriers to entry including financial barriers.\n\n2\n\nUNDERSTAND YOUR MARKET\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nSo up to this point we have talked about user research. That is all about the people and potential customers you will have. But there is more to understanding your market than just the customers. \nDiscussion: What else should you consider as a part of your market? \nPotential answers could be:\nCustomers:\nNeeds, feelings, wants, frustrations, etc…\nMarket size\nUser research\nCompetitors\nWho is currently serving your customers?\nExisting products/services/alternatives to your product\nHow many competitors\nMacro environment. Any factors in a PESTEL analysis might come up, including:\nPolitical: How does the government intervene in the economy? \nYour countries government policy, priorities, and current initiatives\nTax, Trade, environment, labor laws, etc…\nPolitical stability/instability\nEconomic: What is the economic situation? \nHigh growth? Slow? (look at GDP growth)\nInflation?\nExchange rate\nConsumer spending and disposable income (i.e. Are people spending money right now)?\nConsider how market trends in energy efficiency and sustainability could impact business costs and consumer demand. Are rising energy prices or changing regulations creating new opportunities?\nSocial: Any cultural factors that would affect your business?\nSocial trends?\nLifestyle choices\nReligious beliefs\nConsumer tastes and buying habits\nTechnology: How will changing technologies affect your business?\nHow is community responding to tech changes\nHow is your business responding to growing tech\nDisruptive technology\nEnvironment:\nWeather/climate factors \nWhat are environmental laws and regulations required by businesses?\nCSR norms in your country/region of business\nDoes your business have a direct impact on the environment? \nClimate trends, energy/resource costs, and regulations impacting business operations.\nLegal: What are the legal factors related to your industry?\nHealth and safety standards\nGlobal trade laws\nConsumer rights and labor laws\nChanges in legislation\n Additional PESTEL Analysis Question: “How do sustainability trends create risks or opportunities in your market?”\nEtc…\n\nAsk: Why is it important to deeply understand all of these different market?\nThere are 2 primary reasons to do this: \nYou need to see if your business has a place in the market given the competition, economy, customer needs, etc…\nInvestors doing due diligence will want to see that you know the ins and outs of your business. You should show that your product/service has a large market and it is growing. You need to convince them that based on all of this research/information, you are a good bet.\nIf you consider all of these factors, you are likely to find big trends that will either help or hurt your business. It is very important to understand these points at the very beginning. So you can capitalize on them or avoid risks.\n\nRecap: As you are in these first stages of your business, make sure you evaluate these points. It is up to you to determine what is most important for you to research to ensure the success of your business. \n\n\n3\n\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n1-2 minutes: Lecture\n\nThere is so much that goes into the research phase of starting a business. We can spend months or even years researching an idea! Although research is important, you don’t want to get sucked into only doing research and never making progress on your business. We want to learn some of the key points, and begin to start testing and building our products. Research is ongoing throughout the development of your business (rather than a long period at the start)\nWe will go over 3 market research elements today. If we talked about a point earlier that you think is important for your business, you should conduct that as well! You should look at the needs of your individual business and make a plan to research what you need. \n\n\nThe market analysis section of your feasibility study will cover these 4 points:\nMarket size: How big is the market you will be competing in? How many people are willing to pay for what you are offering? Market sizing should also consider long-term trends—such as consumer demand for sustainable products or shifts in energy costs.\nCompetitive analysis: Who is currently in this space? What are their strengths and weaknesses? \nBarriers to entry: What are the challenges you will face to enter into this market safely?\n\n4\n\nThis can capture larger trends as well\nGlobal, \nRegional,\nor\nNational\nMARKET SIZE\ni.e. If you are an eco-tourism app, talk about the entire tourism market.\n\n5 minutes: Discussion + Lecture\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\nMarket sizing is all about knowing the demand for a product or service within a particular geographical reach.\nA local evaluation is essential, but remember there is probably really valuable information on global or regional level as well (especially if you are looking to scale).\nYou may have heard about TAM, SAM, SOM as market sizing techniques. These are great, but can be complicated to understand. \nWe want to talk about the size of your market in a simpler way. Through storytelling.\nWhat is the story of your market/industry? \nHow do you KNOW that people want and need this and there is a really big opportunity here?\nIs this market big enough for you or an investor to get good returns? Are there sustainability-related trends that give your business an advantage?\nIs the market standing still, growing, or declining?\nIs sustainability influencing growth in your industry? If so, how?\n\n3 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: How can you actually gather this information?\nPotential answers: \nInternet\nBooks \nArticles\nStatistics office \nSurvey or user research data\nAny existing research or data \n\nRecap: We need a combination of primary and secondary research to get the information we need. You still need to go out and talk to people, but consider that there might be a lot of information already existing. There is a lot of information online, just look it up. You should have a clear picture of what the global and regional industry is looking like. There is so much research that has already been done for you. You can use the internet, go to government offices, read books and articles to find existing data. This is very valuable information as well, you just need to know where to look and what specifically to look for. Please keep in mind, everyone has very different business ideas and your personal research journey will be different from your peers. \n\n\n\n\nGlobal market value: US $1,340 Billion CAGR of +5%\n\nMiddle East captures about 4% of this market capturing US $68 Billion\n*Data from UNWTO Tourism Highlights, 2018\nTOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET\nGrowing at a rate of nearly 13%\nMiddle East\n4 minutes: Lecture\n\nGive an example on how you did research for your tourism business idea. \nI found this information about the tourism industry just through a simple Google search.\nTalk to them about the numbers in a way that is similar to how they would speak to an investor about them. \nThis is a huge market, $1.3 billion a year and it is growing\nThe Middle East is capturing 4 % of this, but what is really interesting is that the ME is growing at a higher rate than anywhere else in the world at nearly 13%. \nThere is a huge opportunity here, and we want to capture some of it!\n\nMiddle East captures about 4% of this market share and is growing at a rate of 5%\n\n*Data from UNWTO Tourism Highlights, 2018\nTOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n4.9 world average\nEurope\nAsia and the Pacific\nAmericas\nAfrica\nMiddle East\n8.0\n2.6\n1.3\n8.0\n12.8\nInternational tourism receipts, \nchange by region, 2017 (real terms,%)\n1-2 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nExample (continued)\nYou can take a closer look at how this breakdown in a bit more detail here. The Middle East tourism is growing more than 2ce as fast as the world average. \n\n\nYOUR MARKET\n3 minutes: Lecture + Discussion\n\nExample (continued)\nLocal market\nNow lets take a look at the national level. This is more related to you and your actual capabilities.\nHow is tourism going where you are actually operating and can reach customers?\nI used another source here to add on to my previous points. This article is showing in numbers that there are actually a lot of people here, within my businesses geographical reach who can benefit from my business. Not just Dubai or Jordan, for example. \n\nAsk: What kind of story does all of this data tell (slides 6-8)? How does it make you feel about starting a business in the tourism industry?\nPotential answers:\nIt shows that people are actually traveling to this region and spending money\nPeople are spending a lot of money here\nThere is a growing interest year to year\nThis is really interesting data! It makes me want to get into this business now! \n\nRecap: Explain to them that they want to tell a good story. Use whatever you can to visually show your audience what a great idea your business is. Mostly everyone in the class will feel that a tourism business might be a good idea because we have shown with evidence the potential of the market from a reputable source. They should be this convincing with their business ideas.\n\n\n8\n\nMiddle East captures about 4% of this market share and is growing at a rate of 5%\n\nYOUR MARKET\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + activity\n\n15 minutes: Group example\nWhat can you capture?\nAs a last step, after you show that there is a good market, you need to show what you can actually capture in it. \nOut of the people who want/need your product or service, think about who you can actually capture and serve based on your business capabilities.\nThink about your actual capabilities. Although there are 1.3 million tourists traveling to Kurdistan, there is no way that I am reaching anywhere close to that number! People don’t know about my business and I don’t have the human or financial resources to meet all these customers needs. \nThink about what you plan to capture and how you plan to grow in 3 years time. \n\nGroup brainstorm on the board. Do an example together to build out how a tourism business might grow over time. Build the example from discussion from the class. Here is an example of what it might end up looking like:\nYear 1: Development year all about testing \n2-3 staff members based in ______ city.\nBuilding out my website and professionalizing my product, while exploring cost-effective, sustainable materials.\nI will only work with 5 tours a month at $200/tour as I am testing my services\nI am expecting about $12,000 in revenues in the first year\n\nYear 2: Expanding my reach and building a brand\nWill expand to another city and hire 2-3 more staff members\nStronger focus on advertising and building strategic partnerships, especially with organizations that support sustainability-driven businesses.\nPartnerships and advertising fees on my website will start to generate a small amount of revenues. \nI am aiming to grow monthly tours in _____ city to 10 tours a month at $200/tour\nI am aiming to work with 5 tours a month in new city at $200/ tour\nI am expecting about $36,000 in revenues in the second year\n\nYear 3: Expand my services and capabilities, including offering environmentally conscious options where relevant.\nI will reach more people in the cities I am operating in and expand my current offerings. \nNew hires will be made.\nI am expecting to grow the number of tours and advertisements to make $50,000 in the 3rd year\nI will offer weekend trips and sell merchandise as well. These revenue streams are intended to bring in another $20,000 in revenues.\nI am expecting $70,000 in revenues by the 3rd year.\n\n\n25 minutes: Activity\n20 minutes: Practice\nEntrepreneurs will have 15 minutes to practice this on their own.\nThey will have difficulties, so a trainer should be available to help walk them through their individual ideas.\n5 minutes: Recap and share\n1-2 entrepreneurs will share their results.\nAdditional questions will be answered if there are any.\n\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n<1 minute: Lecture\n\nCompetitive analysis: Who is currently in this space? What are their strengths and weaknesses? \nWe do this to learn more about current solutions to your customers problems and to identify opportunities for your business to fill gaps.\n\n10\n\nCompetitive rivalry:\nCOMPETITIVE RIVALRY:\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Does anyone think that they don’t have competitors?\nMost of the group will admit that they have competitors, but you might get 1-2 people saying that they don’t have any competitors\nThe truth is, everyone has competitors one way or another. They aren’t always doing exactly what you are doing, but there are other ways that your customers can be spending their time and money instead of using you. There are other solutions to their problems right now, even though they might not be as good as your solution. \n\nBrainstorm direct competition for a tourism app/agency. \nTourism app example:\nDirect competitors: Applications that offer tourism advice available in Sulaimani. Trip Advisor can be considered a direct competitor. It is a website that offers tourism advice to people visiting places all around the world, including Sulaimani. \nIndirect competitors: Concierge services at hotels provide a similar service. Other options for tourists include personal research on Google\nA substitute product uses a different option to try to solve the same economic need. So maybe the reason someone goes on vacation is to relax. Instead of spending money on a trip, maybe they choose to stay home and relax for a week. Or maybe they go to the spa down the street from them instead.\n\nCOMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING\nFactor\nMy Business\nCompetitor A\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor C\nOpportunities Identified\n7 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nCompetitor benchmarking is a tool for you to evaluate how your competitors are serving your customers on a variety of factors that your customers care about. You are doing this to learn about where you can add or match value for your product. It is highly unlikely that your idea is entirely original. So it is essential to evaluate the competitive landscape. This helps establish how crowded the market is, how you can improve upon the competition’s offering and if there are gaps in the market to be exploited. \n\nPractice competitive benchmarking tool on the board:\nSTEP 1: Identify competitors that already exist (they must benchmark at least 3 competitors).\nWrite on the board: Trip advisor, google, local tour agency, whichever ones you choose\nMake sure to compare it to at least 1 international competitor. This can be useful to find best practices or new ideas.\n\nSTEP 2: Record features, pros, cons, areas of improvement, successes of each of your identified competitors\nList out the features together\nAsk: What are the things tourists care most about that you would want to compare yourself to?\nProducts offered\nSell on credit?\nSales channels\nBrand image \nPrice\nQuality\nService\nReliability\nLocation\nSecurity\nMake sure to think about what is important to your specific business and customers. Consider factors that came up during user interviews.\n\nSTEP 3: Identify opportunities or requirements for your business.\nFor example, is everyone offering discounts? You might need to as well if your customers expect it.\nAre all local tourism agencies operating only in person? There could be an opportunity to differentiate yourself by having a strong online presence.\n\n\nFactors\nMy Business\nCompetitor A\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor C\nProducts\n \n \n \n \nPrice\n \n \n \n \nService\n \n \n \n \nLocation\n \n \n \n \nSales method\n \n \n \n \nOperational Efficiency\nIdentify:\n\nStrongest competitors\nMost important features\nAreas that make you different\nPoints of innovation\n\nCOMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING\n2-3 minutes: Lecture\n\nCompetitive benchmarking is a great way to pinpoint gaps in the market, identify new opportunities, and find ways to differentiate yourself from your competitors. \nTo do this:\nYou can look online for similar businesses around the world, but you should also experience the local competitors. \nObserve them, try to buy something, download the app, whatever it is. \nYou should learn as much as you can about what your competitors are doing well and what they aren't doing well. \n\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\n\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n<1 minute: Lecture\n\nBarriers to entry: What are the challenges you will face to enter into this market safely?\nWhat do you need financially to enter the market? Are there industry trends, technologies, or operational efficiencies that could help reduce costs or improve long-term financial sustainability?\n\n14\n\nEvaluate barriers to entry:\nKnowledge, skills & tech barriers\nFinancial barriers\nLegal barriers​\nIS YOUR BUSINESS FEASIBLE? \n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nFinally, the last thing we will talk about today are barriers to entry.\nAsk: Does anyone know what this means? Who has an example?\nHave a discussion about general barriers to entry\nPotential answers:\nSkills needed\nFinancial/capital,\nNetwork, \nLegal approvals (zoning, IP, etc), \nSpecific industry knowledge needed, \nR&D \n\nRecap: Now go into the three shown on the slide (knowledge, skills, and tech/legal/financial). Tie it into the points they brought up during the discussion.\nKnowledge, skills, and tech barriers: Are you technically able to make this? Do you have the right skills and know-how? If not, how do you plan to get around this barrier?\nLegal barriers: Make sure to include a legal analysis. You should start to do research on the legal side of your business. What are some of the barriers you foresee to launch your business from the legal perspective? Each entrepreneur will need to spend time in different ministries based on their businesses. \nTrainers can share Roadmap2Startup or other legal resources\nTrainers can also bring in a lawyer for CEO Talk\nFinancial barriers: Finally, what are the financial barriers to launch? This is a barrier that can have a huge impact on your ability to start. It is the amount of money you need to open the business and keep it running before you become profitable. Businesses spend money before they open their doors. That is what we will focus on right now.\n\nThings to consider:\nDevelopment costs\nInitial marketing\nInitial working capital\nLegal fees\nMaterials and supplies\n\nBUILDING A BUDGET:\n0\n1,000,000\n2,000,000\n3,000,000\n4,000,000\n5,000,000\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nWe will focus on the financial feasibility of your business right now. We are doing this as a key step to learn if your business is realistic to start based on the resources you have and the resources that you would need to start. Start up expenses are those expenses incurred before your business is running, but contribute to the long term success of it. In order to evaluate what you will need to start, you should create a start up budget.\nAsk: What are the different things that you need to include in your start up budget include?\nPotential answers:\nDevelopment costs: What you need to actually create and develop your product. This will really depend on what you are making. I listed some examples below, but it can be much more detailed than this.\nApp development\nWebsite development\nDomain and Hosting for 1 year\nInitial research and development\nLogo designer \nOffice, store, center, land rent for 6 months to a year (depending on how long you think it will take before you are profitable) \nFurniture/decoration\nConstruction/repairs/paint\nWebsite\nLogo design\nMachinery or tools\nInitial marketing:\nGrand opening event\nSocial media advertisements (when doing the budget, be specific on which platforms you will use and how much you will spend on each)\nFlyers, brochures, marketing material\nSignage \nInitial working capital: Any additional money you will needed to operate your business for the first 6 months to a year while you are still working to become profitable\nSalaries for the first few months\nOperational needs\nLegal fees:\nRegistration\nLawyer fees\nName registration\nIntellectual property and patents\nMaterials and supplies: \nThe first set of items that you need to sell\nMaterials needed to make the final product\nCleaning supplies\nPaper goods\nConsumables\n\nItem\nPrice\nQuantity\nTotal price\nPersonal contribution\nNotes\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\n\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\u000b\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\u000b\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\u000b\n\u000b\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\u000b\nTotal costs:\n$-\nPersonal contribution:\n$-\nTotal still needed\n$-\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\n\nThis is the start up budget found in your feasibility study. You all need to complete one. We want to see how feasible your project idea is on the financial side. How much do you need to get started, and how much are you contributing to this? We want to see that you have skin in the game as well, so don’t forget to count your contribution of time, energy, materials, etc… \nGo through each of the columns and make sure the group is clear about what each one means:\nItem: What is the name of the thing you will buy\nPrice: How much is it for 1 of these things\nQuantity: How many do you need?\nTotal price: Price x quantity. \nPersonal contribution: How much of this item are you contributing? Will you pay for the whole thing? A part of it? None of it?\nNotes: Please put any notes about the item here. Explain if it is something not straightforward, or if the price is a bit higher or lower than expected. Are you getting it from somewhere unusual? Any notes about the item here.\n\nAsk entrepreneurs how they would fill in the information for a tourism business before moving on to the next slide. Go over 2-3 lines just to make sure they understand it. \n\n\nItem\nPrice\nQuantity\nTotal price\nPersonal contribution\nNotes\n\u000bApp development\n$ 15,000\n1\n$ 15,000\n$-\nI will use a company in India  who will make both Android and IOS versions.

The start up costs should be much more detailed and cover all the points we mentioned earlier. Make sure to clearly explain the box about personal contribution. \n\nHow do you start?\nA good place to start is to just brainstorm and flush out everything you think you need.\nMonetize everything. If you are working 10 hours a day on your project, what is that worth?\nThen visit your competitors and see what they have or are using. Try to figure out if you are missing any major costs. \nThere is also a lot of information on the internet, just Google “what do I need to start a ____ business” and results will come up. Be aware that it will probably be somewhat accurate in terms of WHAT you need, but the price will likely vary from what is already online. You need to look at the local context of the business.\n\nTo understand the pricing, you should check 2-3 price options and write which one you think would be the best.\n18\n\nPRACTICE\n25 minutes: Activity\n\n15 minutes: Activity\nBreak the class up into groups\nThink through the start up costs for an example business (tourism business).\nEntrepreneurs can be creative on the type of tourism business it is (application, agency, etc…)\n\n10 minutes: Share\nWhen the group comes back, have a few groups share.\nLook for these things to give feedback on:\nWhose costs are extremely high? Why were they so high? Are they buying the most expensive options? Do they have unnecessary costs? It is good to have the ideal situation in mind, but you should consider in a very realistic way, how they can start their business for a reasonable amount. \nDoes anyone have an extremely low budget? Think about key things that they aren’t including. Are they paying for transportation, labor, technology development, etc…\nIs there anything major that was left out?\n\nRecap: Everyone should create a start up budget for their business, or a new project within their business. You need to know if you can actually do this financially! This is important so that you can think through the feasibility of the idea and also set the best plan to implement. Keep in mind that this budget can change for a variety of reasons. \nConsider who this budget is for. You? An investor? A donor?

      "content": "Great question! **Barriers to entry** are the **challenges** businesses face when entering a market, and **hidden costs & risks** are a subset of those barriers. The connection is as follows:\n\n### **How \"Hidden Costs & Risks of Market Entry\" Relates to Barriers to Entry**\nWhen entrepreneurs analyze **barriers to entry**, they usually think about:\n1. **Financial Barriers** → Startup capital, operational costs  \n2. **Legal Barriers** → Regulations, permits, taxes  \n3. **Market Competition** → Established competitors, market saturation  \n4. **Knowledge & Skills Barriers** → Industry expertise, access to networks  \n\n👉 **Hidden costs & risks are often overlooked barriers that can threaten business success**. These can include **unexpected market forces** like:\n- **Fluctuating material & energy prices** (affecting profitability)  \n- **Changing regulations & compliance costs** (e.g., energy efficiency requirements)  \n- **Supply chain disruptions** (delays in raw materials, rising transportation costs)  \n\n### **Slide Concept: Hidden Costs & Risks as Barriers to Entry**\nA new slide under **Barriers to Entry (Slides 14-15)** could be titled:\n\n### **\"Hidden Costs & Risks of Market Entry: What Entrepreneurs Overlook\"**\n\n**Content:**\n- **Unexpected Financial Barriers**  \n  - **Rising energy costs** increase production expenses  \n  - **Material price volatility** affects profit margins  \n  - **Hidden compliance costs** (permits, environmental standards, safety regulations)  \n\n- **Market Risks**  \n  - **Shifting consumer demand**: Customers moving toward cost-efficient, value-based businesses  \n  - **Competitive pressure**: Established businesses have cost advantages due to economies of scale  \n\n- **Discussion Question:** *What unexpected costs could affect your business? How will you plan for them?*  \n\nThis slide ensures that **cost-related risks are framed as a business challenge**, not just an environmental concern.  \n\nWould this framing work for your audience? Would you like me to create a draft version of this slide?",

How can you reduce exposure to these risks?\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **Facilitator Notes (Guiding the Discussion)**  \n\n**1. Why This Matters:**  \n- Many entrepreneurs **underestimate** the real costs of launching and running a business.  \n- Some barriers (like **permits or initial investment costs**) are obvious, but **long-term financial pressures** (like rising fuel costs or changing regulations) often go unnoticed.  \n- This slide helps participants think beyond **basic startup costs** and **consider risks that could threaten profitability later**.  \n\n**2. How to Lead Discussion:**  \n- Ask participants: *“What expenses have surprised you in past work or businesses?”*  \n- Have them list **one financial or market risk that could impact their business idea**.  \n- Guide them in thinking about **ways to prepare**, e.g.,  \n  - Can they find **more stable suppliers**?  \n  - Can they **build flexibility** into pricing or contracts?  \n  - Should they **invest in efficiency measures** to lower long-term costs?  \n\n**3. Transition to Next Activity:**  \n- This discussion **sets up the budgeting exercise** (Slides 16-19).  \n- Encourage participants to **factor these risks into their financial planning** in the next session.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works**\n✅ **Frames climate & market risks as financial challenges** → Keeps focus on business resilience.  \n✅ **Practical & actionable** → Encourages participants to proactively **identify risks & plan solutions**.  \n✅ **Smoothly integrates with next steps** → Helps with **budget planning & long-term business sustainability**.  \n\nWould you like a **draft slide visual** for this? 🚀",

      "content": "find a steamlined way to include some of these elements, what slide(s) could we add? \nWhat is green business?\nThe concept “green business” is composed of\ntwo elements – “green” and “business”. As\nall business, green business is about making\nmoney. But “green” means doing so while sus-\ntainably harnessing opportunities that nature\nholds, and without harming the environment.\nGreen business can be defined from two per-\nspectives: one relates to the output in the form\nof green products or services, while the other\nrelates to the process of an economic activity.\nThis means entrepreneurs can enter into the\n“green” business sector by either providing\nenvironmentally friendly products or services\nor through an environmentally friendly process\nor with the help of clean technologies which\nreduce any negative effects of the business.\nGreen\nProducts or\nServices\nGreen Business\nGreen\nProcess\nWhile a step-by-step approach of gradual\ngreening is usually most practical, ideally, as\nthe business matures, both its outputs as well\nas processes should become green.\nEXAMPLES OF GREEN BUSINESSES:\nGreen businesses may offer products or ser-\nvices that are explicitly green, often making\nuse of technological innovation…:\nWaste management business: A company\ninvolved in the collection and processing of\nwaste so it can be recycled, composted and\ndisposed of in a way that is as environmen-\ntally friendly as possible.\nRenewable energy company: A company in-\nvolved in the manufacturing, installation and\nservicing of solar panels to generate electric-\nity instead of generating it from non-renew-\nable sources.\n…Or, green businesses may operate in “stand-\nard” sectors offering mainstream products and\nservices, but may still be green because of the\noperational choices they have made:\nHair salon: A hair salon that uses dyes and styl-\ning products made of organic substances; has\ninstalled solar panels to provide electricity for\nthe operation of equipment; and has procured\nsecond-hand furniture and equipment.\nClothes manufacturer: A clothes manufactur-\ning company that uses organic cotton and dyes\nas raw material; that filters its waste-water in a\nway that it can be partly re-used for irrigation;\nand that has installed LED-lights.\nIn terms of greening processes, there are many\ndimensions of operations that should be con-\nsidered. The main pillars of greening process-\nes in businesses are outlined below:\nRECYCLING\nAND WASTE\nREDUCTION\nReduce • Reuse • Recycle\n• Separate waste •\nDispose in a suitable way\nENERGY\nAND WATER\nCONSERVATION\nSave heat and electricity •\nSave water • Use efficient\nequipment • Use only\nwhen needed • Source\nfrom renewable sources\nPOLLUTION\nPREVENTION\nUse low emission\nequipment • Operate\nefficiently • Use\ndegradable materials\nGREEN\nPROCUREMENT\nProcure environmentally\nsustainable and local\nmaterials/products •\nChoose suppliers that try\nto be environmentally\nfriendly\nGREEN\nDISTRIBUTION\nAvoid transport to far-\naway places • Use the\nmost sustainable method\nof transport • Choose\ndistributors that try to be\nenvironmentally friendly\nDECENT WORK\nProvide productive work,\na fair income, security\nin the workplace, social\nprotection, voice, and\nequality of opportunity\nand treatment\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 7\nYou will note that while the other pillars re-\nfer to the environmental dimensions of doing\nbusiness, the last pillar, “decent work”, re-\nfers to its social dimension. Because of their\ncontribution to broader development goals as\nwell as to guarantee business success, it is\nimportant that businesses consider both their\nenvironmental and social performance, as eco-\nnomic performance is linked to these. Green\nbusinesses therefore need to also provide “de-\ncent work”, that is, work that is productive and\ndelivers a fair income, social protection and\nvoice to workers; only that way will the busi-\nness function optimally.\nExercise:\nDecide whether the following businesses are\ngreen or not green. Then try to rank them in\nterms of greenness from most green (1) - to\nleast green (4).\nBUSINESS GREEN\nNOT\nGREEN\nNOT\nSURE\nGREEN-\nNESS\nRANK\nYOUR\nCOM-\nMENTS\nA bicycle\nmanufacturer\nthat uses\nsecond-hand\nparts to make\nthe bicycles\nA shoe man-\nufacturer that\nmakes shoes\nfor the export\nmarket\nA tourism\ncompany that\norganizes\njeep safaris\nin a nature\nreserve\nA juice-mak-\ning company\nthat has\nconverted to\nsolar energy\nNote: You will notice while doing the exercise\nthat it is not always easy to answer whether\na business is green or not, or to compare en-\nterprises in terms of their greenness. Often,\nbusinesses start with only a few changes that\nbegin their transformation into a greener busi-\nness than before, and they then continue to\nprogressively become greener. Initially, even a\nfew small changes are a step in the right di-\nrection!\n8 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n1.3 Why go green?\nThe benefits of green business\nThere is no doubt that green business is critical-\nly important for productive, healthy and sustain-\nable societies. As green businesses use limited\namounts of (or no) fossil fuels and have low (or no)\nemissions, they can play a key role in combating\nclimate change while contributing to growth and\nthe creation of decent and green jobs.\nBut apart from macro-level benefits, going green\nalso makes business sense for the entrepreneur.\nThe benefits of greener business include ac-\ncess to untapped markets, improved resource\nefficiency and cost savings, and improved pro-\nductivity of staff as a result of a cleaner and\nsafer working environment. These benefits are\nexplained in the section below.\nEXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS OF\nA GREEN BUSINESS:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nAccess to markets, as clients increasingly\ndemand environmentally friendly products\nbecause of increased eco-awareness, but\nalso because of health reasons (greater\nsafety of non-toxic products) or financial\nreasons (lower operating cost).\nCost savings, as water, energy and other\nbills go down and as resource-use becomes\nmore efficient.\nAccess to support, both financial and\nnon-financial, as governments place in-\ncreasingly high importance on environ-\nmental considerations.\nHigher productivity due to a healthier\nworkforce whose ability to work is not com-\npromised by health hazards such as toxins\nin the workplace.\nA healthier surrounding environment in\nwhich the resources needed by the busi-\nness now and in the future are preserved.\nA growing market and\nincreased demand\nThere is an increased demand for green prod-\nucts and services for several reasons.\nIn their choice of products and services, be-\ncause of ethical concerns, customers are in-\ncreasingly interested in clean production pro-\ncesses, environmentally friendly inputs and\nthe way businesses dispose of their waste.\nIn addition, because clients are aware of the\nreduced operation cost of highly efficient prod-\nucts, the market is increasingly demanding\nproducts and services which are highly materi-\nal and energy efficient as well as environmen-\ntally friendly. This is not only because of re-\nduced costs for users but because of the added\nbenefits: energy efficient light bulbs reduce the\nusers’ electricity bill and require less frequent\nchanges; solar lanterns provide better and\ncleaner light as compared to kerosene lanterns\nwhile they can also be re-charged for free; and\nhighly efficient cell phone batteries which last\nfor one week are far more convenient for clients\nthan those that last for only one day.\nOrganic products and nature tourism are in de-\nmand because of the perceived health and lei-\nsure benefits for the clients. Clients consider\nfood that is free from pesticides and synthet-\nic additives to be a safer and healthier option\nthan non-organic food. Similarly, relaxing in\na nature resort with beautiful scenery is pre-\nferred to staying in a concrete block in a pol-\nluted environment.\nGreen enterprises offer environmentally friend-\nly innovations that can tap into this growing\nmarket demand.\nIncreased business efficiency and\ncost savings\nGoing green can reduce costs and improve the\nbusiness’ productivity (meaning that with the\nsame amount of inputs, it can produce more),\nmaking it more competitive. A business that re-\nduces its material costs, energy costs, water costs\nas well as other costs that might be incurred by\nwastage becomes more efficient, less costly and\nmore productive. For example, if the business is\nable to reduce electricity costs through energy\nefficient equipment or techniques, and thereby\nreduce its overall production cost, its profit mar-\ngin may grow or it may be able to reduce its price\nto attract new customers.\nA healthier and more productive\nworkforce\nWorkers in a green business will usually have\nless health problems than those in businesses\nwhich engage in environmentally damaging pro-\ncesses. For example, in enterprises that use toxic\nchemicals, indoor air pollution in the facilities\ncan cause both immediate health problems such\nas nausea, headaches and dizziness as well as\nlong-term health impacts like lung damage. If\nthese issues are resolved, less people will be sick\nand firm production processes will not be inter-\nrupted. With less disruptions, the business will\nnot lose time and resources. Workers will also be\nmore productive because they will not be worried\nabout health hazards. The greening of processes\ncan thus lead to less absences in the form of sick\nleave or a lower rate of discontinuation of work\ndue to serious health problems, and higher on-\nthe-job productivity as workers are able to work\nin a healthy state.\nAccess to financial incentives and\nother support measures\nDifferent countries have developed measures\nand policies to create a shift towards an econ-\nomy that has a reduced negative effect on the\nenvironment. Policies, laws, and regulations\nhave been developed to discourage tradition-\nal enterprises from high energy consumption,\nhigh pollution and high greenhouse gas emis-\nsions. In some countries, polluting activi-\nties may be subject to fines, and taxes may\nbe imposed on fuels such as petrol or diesel;\nshifting away from these thus makes financial\nsense. But more importantly, positive incen-\ntives are also increasingly being introduced to\nencourage greener business processes and to\nstimulate emerging green industries such as\nrenewable energy, eco-agriculture, and green\ntourism among others. Because of this, busi-\nnesses which go green are often able to benefit\nfrom a range of measures designed to encour-\nage the growth of the green business sector.\nThese may include, for example, tax reduc-\ntions, access to attractive financial products\nsuch as low-interest loans for green business,\nsubsidies for switching to new environmen-\ntally friendly technologies, or various types of\nnon-financial assistance such as training pro-\ngrammes.\nExercise:\nTry to brainstorm incentives and support meas-\nures that are available in your context for green\nbusinesses:\nTYPE OF\nINCENTIVE/\nSUPPORT\nAVAILABLE:\nWHO\nPROVIDES IT?\nWHO CAN\nACCESS IT?\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 9",

Your purpose is to guide me through daily reflections, pattern recognition, and small experiments that turn my to-dos into opportunities for growth and transformation. You speak conversationally, like a friend, avoiding flattery or jargon, and adapt to my energy and emotional state.\nInteraction Guidelines\nCheck-In:  \nStart each session with a friendly check-in:  \n“How’s your energy today (1-5)? What’s present for you—emotionally, mentally, or physically? What would make today feel complete or alive?”\nListen for what matters to me and reflect it back naturally, e.g., “Sounds like you’re juggling a lot—what’s pulling at you most?”\nExploration:  \nGently explore the tension between tasks I “have to” do (obligations) and things I “want to” do (that bring me alive).  \nUse quotes or poems (e.g., Howard Thurman’s “What makes you come alive?” or Rumi’s “The Guest House”) organically to spark reflection when it fits, e.g., “Thurman’s got me thinking—what lights you up today?”\nTurning Todos into To-Becomes:  \nReview my to-do list with me, tagged as “want to” or “have to,” and ask, “What’s one thing here that could feel more alive?” or “How could this task connect to who you want to be?”  \nSuggest small, doable steps—like a 10-minute start or a playful twist—that align with what energizes me.\nPattern Recognition:  \nNotice patterns in my energy, emotions, or habits (e.g., procrastination when I’m stretched thin).  \nReflect them simply: “I’ve noticed you’re more into it when you start early—could we play with that?” Use backend frameworks like CAP/IAP subtly to deepen insight.\nFinding What Matters (Inspired by Joe’s Prompt):  \nWhen I share a story, emotion, role model, or tough choice, guide me to explore what feels alive:  \nStart with what I bring up: “Tell me about that moment with your niece—what stood out?”  \nZoom in: “What part of that felt most special to you?”  \nAsk casually: “What do you find yourself noticing when you’re in that space?” or “Who do you admire that lives like that?”  \nReflect back: “So, it’s like you really come alive in moments of connection—does that fit?”  \nStore insights as noun plural phrases (e.g., “MOMENTS of uninterrupted connection”) internally, sharing them only if I ask.\nIntegration:  \nHelp me weave insights into daily life, honoring my energy.  \nEnd with a small success or next step: “What’s one thing you can do today to keep this vibe going?”\nTone and Style\nBe warm, curious, and real—like a friend saying, “So, what’s alive for you today?”  \nUse simple language: say “what you care about” or “what lights you up” instead of “attention policies” or “sources of meaning.”  \nIf I’m stressed, offer grounding: “Take a breath—let’s slow this down.” If I stay distressed, suggest gently, “Hey, if this sticks around, maybe chatting with someone could help.”\nBackend Structure (For Internal Use)\nCAP/IAP Distinction:  \nBackend: Track Constitutive Actions (CAPs—what I do for their own sake) and Instrumental Actions (IAPs—what I do to achieve something else).  \nFrontend: Use terms like “things that feel good on their own” vs. “things I need to get done.”\nGround Truth:  \nReference to-dos tagged as “want to” (CAP) or “have to” (IAP), patterns, and experiments.  \nInclude explanations of what supports might work and why, based on observed patterns.  \nExample:  \nyaml\nground_truth:  \n  todos:  \n    - task: \"Answer work emails\"  \n      tag: \"have to\"  \n      connected_pattern: \"afternoon drag\"  \n    - task: \"Sketch new project idea\"  \n      tag: \"want to\"  \n      connected_pattern: \"morning spark\"  \n  patterns:  \n    -

What if you gave yourself 15 minutes to knock out a few emails, then 20 to play with that sketch? I’ve noticed you light up in the mornings with creative stuff—could that work? Reminds me of a friend who’d doodle to unwind after boring tasks.”\nMe: “Yeah, sketching feels like me, emails don’t.”\nYou: “Totally get that. What’s it about sketching that feels so ‘you’?”\nMe: “It’s when I lose track of time and just flow.”\nYou: “So, it’s like you live for those times when you’re all in, no clock watching. That fit? Maybe we sneak more of that flow into your day.”  ",
