Some apps let you have interactive conversations, which could be more engaging than just listening.\n\nSecond, he could participate in interactive podcasts or discussion-based audio content. Some platforms offer Q&A sessions or interactive segments where listeners can send in questions or comments.\n\nThird, he could use that time for voice memo brainstorming. He can record his thoughts, ideas, or even practice speeches or presentations. This way, he's actively engaging his mind and improving his skills.\n\nWhat do you think?",

The challenge is, he's a doctor and he doesn't really have a lot of presentations. His work is more manual, although he's working on his thesis, and so anything that can help him with his thesis where he doesn't need to use his hands or look at the screen of the phone.",

Given that your brother-in-law is a doctor working on his thesis, interactive podcasts related to his field could be incredibly beneficial. He can find podcasts that cover medical advancements, case studies, or even interviews with experts.\n\nAnother idea is to use voice-to-text apps to dictate parts of his thesis or notes. This way, he can work on his writing without needing to look at his phone.\n\nLastly, he could join medical forums or groups that have voice-based discussions or Q&A sessions. This can provide him with insights and ideas for his thesis while staying engaged during his commute.\n\nWhat do you think of these suggestions?",

Here are three more ideas tailored for a doctor working on a thesis:\n\nFirst, he could listen to specialized medical podcasts that include interactive elements, such as live Q&A sessions or discussions that he can later follow up on with questions or contributions.\n\nSecond, he can use voice-to-text software to dictate ideas, notes, or even sections of his thesis while driving. This would help him make progress without needing to use his hands.\n\nThird, he could engage in medical or research-based discussion groups that have audio sessions. Some platforms allow for recorded discussions or live sessions that he could listen to and possibly interact with later.\n\nDoes that sound more in line with what he needs?",
