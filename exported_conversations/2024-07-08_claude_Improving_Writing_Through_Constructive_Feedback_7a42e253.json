The great news is that the activities that support people in difficult times also promote connections between teams and creativity toward daily challenges. \nDaily check-ins are a common feature businesses, schools, and teams use to start their day. By sharing an overall view of what's happening personally and professionally within an organization, check-ins can nurture relationships, provide a place to share challenges, and become the platform people can stand on when other things are unstable.\nWhile check-in questions can vary to serve your organization's goals, we encourage adding a few questions from the list below. These questions spark the engine of deliberate rumination and community building - factors that promote creativity, growth, and resilience. \nThe following questions target important factors of deliberate rumination by promoting a realistic and growth-oriented reappraisal of the situation and promoting narrative formation. When life throws curveballs at us, having a place where we can practice telling a new story while not negating the reality of the situation is critical. \nWe believe that entrepreneurship programs can provide a valuable home for this type of discussion and that, especially for social impact entrepreneurs working in difficult areas, it’s essential to establish a space that builds meaningful relationships and provides framing and a home for navigating transitions.\nUse these questions in your programs, classrooms, and perhaps even with your family at breakfast. They should be fun, connecting, and spark creativity:\nThey help reappraise past difficulties, create empowered narratives, identify ways forward, celebrate achievements, and recognize new opportunities. They also blend the ability to reflect on past experiences and infuse humor into daily reflections.\n**Unexpected Positives:**\n1. \"What’s a surprise from your past that makes you smile?\"\n**Empowered Narratives:** \n2. What past challenge did you overcome that seemed insurmountable at first?\n3. If a past mishap were a plot twist in your superhero origin story, how did it turn you into a champion?\n**Ways Forward:** \n4. What small step did you take in the past that felt like a giant leap for mankind (or at least for you)?\n5. What’s one thing you did in the past that you feel like had oversized positive impact on your life today?\n**Celebrating Achievements:** \n6. What’s your ‘I nailed it!’ moment from the past week? Even if it’s just resisting the urge to snooze the alarm?\n7. What did you do in the past that you think deserves a celebration today?\n**New Opportunities and Silver Linings:** \n8. What’s a new door that opened for you given the situation, even if it was just a crack and you had to squeeze through?\n9. How can you turn a past challenge into a silver lining?\n**Finding Humor in Adversity:**\n10. What’s the funniest thing about recent or historic challenge you faced? \n11. What past moment made you laugh so hard you forgot you were supposed to be stressed?\n**Perspective Shifts and Shared Laughter:**\n12. \"What’s something you took seriously in the past but laugh about now?\" \n13. \"If you could go back and give your past self a piece of advice in the form of a stand-up joke, what would it be?\n**Transforming Past Challenges:** \n14. \"How can you turn a past failure into a funny story that makes you laugh now?\" \n15. \"What’s a challenge from the past that you can now see as a hilarious learning experience?\"\n**Finding Light Moments:** \n16.

This work was inspired by our experiences with social entrepreneurs affected by the Beirut blast, where we observed both the devastating impact and the unexpected resilience within our program communities.\n\nOur findings revealed that deliberate rumination, social support, and narrative reappraisal are key factors in promoting post-traumatic growth (PTG). Interestingly, our pre/post assessments showed that humor had the strongest connection with PTG. We believe humor's ability to diffuse stress, open possibility spaces, and foster cognitive flexibility aligns with the skills needed for creative problem-solving in challenging situations.\n\nThe great news is that activities supporting people in difficult times also promote connections between teams and creativity in daily challenges. Daily check-ins, common in businesses, schools, and teams, can nurture relationships, provide a platform for sharing challenges, and become a stable foundation during unstable times.\n\nWhile check-in questions can vary to serve your organization's goals, we encourage incorporating questions that spark deliberate rumination and community building.

            "extracted_content": "Nurturing Resilience \nInsights from the First Edition of the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation Program\n\n2020 was a difficult year internationally, and in Lebanon, it was a particularly difficult year. At Bloom, we ran the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation (ACSI) program with teams across Lebanon. We faced these shared challenges, from the pandemic, political and economic destabilization, and an enormous port explosion that shocked the nation. After the program ended, we started the sense-making process, and the figurative and literal dust settled. We went on a research adventure to dig into how social entrepreneurs lived through those days. We looked at the difficulties, and we were especially keen to identify what supports social entrepreneurs in surviving and potentially growing through difficult experiences. We do not discount the reality of the difficulty, nor do we suggest that growth is a consequence of challenge; we do find evidence supporting factors that increase its likelihood. Working in an environment and an age of seemingly accelerating incidences of social, political, and environmental challenges, finding the factors that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical. We find that the ACSI program wound up being more than just business support; it established support relationships in tough times, and it’s been helping people in their ventures and personal lives, too.\nThroughout the ACSI program, Lebanon went through a global pandemic, economic meltdown, political chaos, shortages, unemployment, and the heart-wrenching Beirut Port Explosion, leaving many dead, injured, and homeless - including team members in our program. Amid all this madness, the ACSI program continued operating, continuing to holding our convening circles the week after the blast, using our principles-based training approach, and leveraging the Values in Action Character profile (VIA) to support teams and to be able to monitor how all this affected our participants.\nThe VIA is a countermeasure to what is standardly measured in psychology, assessing what is working and good in a life of flourishing. So, monitoring this psychometrically validated instrument for teams in our program before and after and contrasting with teams before the program who weren’t able to participate who were also assessed after we found that teams who were participating in our program were more resilient in the face of the acute challenges and it made us question why. What was it about being a part of the ACSI program that promoted resilience?\nDiving into the literature, we found connections between social support, asking meaningful questions, and PTG. While traumatic events destabilize the status quo by disrupting the narratives we may tell ourselves about life, how we reconstruct those narratives is critically important. The originators of the concept of PTG, Tedeschi, and Calhoun, identify Deliberate Rumination and Positive Social Support as important factors in promoting the possibility of growth after a difficulty. We believe one of the reasons teams in the ACSI program fared better is that we developed a “pre-resilience” habit of holding a space where important questions are raised in a socially supportive setting, our check-in circles. \nWhile many people experience PTG after a difficulty, it must be made clear that not everyone does, nor is it something to expect from everyone going through a difficulty. Everyone’s prior life experiences, life schemas, and diversity come into play. What’s important is that for those with the ability to convene and hold space, we believe that there is a real opportunity to help more people attain the new strengths, perspectives, and a deeper love for life that comes after wrestling with tough times. For those running social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses, understanding how simple adjustments to the environment and meeting structure can help promote PTG can support the conditions that not only make these environments more meaningful and enjoyable but also increase the likelihood that the group will be there for each other when they need each other the most.\nOur research is a starting point for a conversation on the kinds of spaces and expectations entrepreneurship training programs can hold. While the research group may be small, the results were revealing, and we would love to explore research collaborations with other organizations. \nBloom works with partners like the Asfari Foundation to unlock human potential for positive change, and that’s why the ACSI program develops more than business skills; it's also about building up your strengths and creating communities of mutual support. It’s only with a vision of the long term that we realize that social impact takes time. With time, we all go through ups and downs and sometimes great difficulty, so we must prepare the grounds for taking advantage of the disadvantages. The research on Post Traumatic Growth demonstrates the importance of community. Through our programs, which blend character and universal skills and boost traits connected to PTG, like Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude, we create a space where folks can navigate trauma with support.\nWe hope you take something away from reading the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation's first research report. It’s not just data; these are real people, real teams working to create impact in a difficult environment. It’s a story of bouncing back, growing, and finding transformative power in social entrepreneurship.\n\nDownload the Research Report here: Character Strengths And Fostering PTG (draft to publish)\n\n\n"

This report outlines how the program not only persevered but also fostered resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) among its participants. Our findings suggest that structured social support and deliberate reflection can significantly enhance resilience in social entrepreneurs, even amid extreme adversity.\n\n## Introduction\n\n2020 was a year of extraordinary challenges globally, with Lebanon facing particularly severe hardships. As we ran the ACSI program with teams across Lebanon, we encountered a perfect storm of crises:\n\n- Global COVID-19 pandemic\n- Severe economic downturn\n- Political instability\n- Resource shortages\n- Rising unemployment\n- The catastrophic Beirut Port explosion\n\nThese events profoundly impacted our participants, with some team members directly affected by the port explosion. Despite these challenges, the ACSI program continued, adapting to provide crucial support during this tumultuous period.\n\n## Program Approach\n\nThe ACSI program employed several key strategies:\n\n1. **Principles-based training**: We focused on core principles of social innovation rather than rigid methodologies, allowing for flexibility in application.\n\n2. **Values in Action (VIA) Character profile**: This psychometrically validated tool helped us assess and support participants' character strengths.\n\n3. **Regular convening circles**: We maintained consistent check-ins, even in the immediate aftermath of the port explosion, fostering a supportive community.\n\n## Research Findings\n\nOur research compared ACSI participants with a control group of individuals who were assessed but unable to participate in the program. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Enhanced resilience**: ACSI participants demonstrated greater resilience in the face of acute challenges.\n\n2. **Positive impact of social support**: Regular check-ins and a supportive community correlated with improved coping mechanisms.\n\n3. **Importance of deliberate rumination**: Structured reflection on experiences contributed to personal growth.\n\n4. **Character strength development**: Participants showed increases in traits associated with PTG, such as Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude.\n\n## Theoretical Framework\n\nOur findings align with established research on Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) by Tedeschi and Calhoun. Two critical factors in promoting PTG emerged:\n\n1. **Deliberate Rumination**: Thoughtful, intentional reflection on experiences.\n2. **Positive Social Support**: A supportive community that allows for sharing and processing of experiences.\n\nWe hypothesize that the ACSI program's structure, particularly its regular check-in circles, created a \"pre-resilience\" habit. This habit provided a space for important questions to be raised in a socially supportive setting, potentially priming participants for PTG when faced with significant challenges.\n\n## Implications and Applications\n\nWhile our research group was relatively small, the results offer valuable insights for social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses:\n\n1. **Creating supportive environments**: Regular check-ins and supportive communities can be integrated into various organizational structures.\n\n2. **Fostering deliberate reflection**: Incorporating structured reflection can enhance personal and professional growth.\n\n3. **Character strength focus**: Programs can benefit from explicitly developing traits associated with resilience and PTG.\n\n4. **Long-term vision**: Recognizing that social impact takes time and involves ups and downs can help in designing more holistic support programs.\n\n## Limitations and Future Research\n\nIt's important to note that while many people experience PTG after difficulty, it's not universal or expected from everyone. Factors such as prior life experiences, personal schemas, and individual differences play significant roles.\n\nOur study's limitations include a small sample size and focus on a specific geographic and cultural context. Future research could explore:\n\n- Larger-scale studies across diverse contexts\n- Longitudinal studies to assess long-term impacts\n- Comparative studies of different support methodologies\n\nWe welcome collaboration opportunities with other organizations to expand this research.\n\n## Conclusion and Call to Action\n\nThe ACSI program's experience during 2020 demonstrates the potential for entrepreneurship training programs to go beyond business skills, fostering resilience and personal growth. We encourage other organizations to:\n\n1. Implement regular check-ins and supportive community structures\n2. Incorporate character strength assessments and development\n3. Create spaces for deliberate reflection and meaningful questions\n4. Consider how their programs can prepare participants for long-term challenges\n\nBy sharing these insights, we hope to contribute to a broader conversation on creating resilient communities of social entrepreneurs capable of driving positive change, even in the face of significant adversity.\n\nFor more detailed information and data, please download our full research report: \"Character Strengths and Fostering PTG\" [Insert download link]\n\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis rewritten version incorporates the suggested improvements by:\n\n1.

Thus, identifying the factors that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical. \nProgram Approach\nThe ACSI program employed several key strategies:\nPrinciples-based training: We focused on core principles of social innovation rather than rigid methodologies, allowing for flexibility in application.\nQuantitative/Qualitative data and reflection: Using the Values In Action Character Profile(VIA) - a psychometrically validated tool - helped us assess and support participants' character strengths.\nRegular convening circles: We maintained consistent check-ins, even in the immediate aftermath of the port explosion, fostering a supportive community.\nResearch Findings\nOur research compared ACSI participants with a control group of individuals who were assessed but unable to participate in the program. Key findings include:\nEnhanced resilience: ACSI participants demonstrated greater resilience in the face of acute challenges.\nPositive impact of social support: Regular check-ins and a supportive community correlated with improved coping mechanisms.\nImportance of deliberate rumination: Structured reflection on experiences contributed to personal growth.\nCharacter strength development: Participants showed increases in traits associated with PTG, such as Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude.\nThe VIA is a countermeasure to what is standardly measured in psychology, assessing what is working and good in a life of flourishing. So, monitoring this psychometrically validated instrument for teams in our program before and after and contrasting with teams before the program who weren’t able to participate who were also assessed after we found that teams who were participating in our program were more resilient in the face of the acute challenges and it made us question what was it about being a part of the ACSI program that promoted resilience?\nDiving into the literature, we found connections between social support, asking meaningful questions, and PTG. While traumatic events destabilize the status quo by disrupting the narratives we may tell ourselves about life, how we reconstruct those narratives is critically important. The originators of the concept of PTG, Tedeschi, and Calhoun, identify Deliberate Rumination and Positive Social Support as important factors in promoting the possibility of growth after a difficulty. We believe one of the reasons teams in the ACSI program fared better is that we developed a “pre-resilience” habit of holding a space where important questions are raised in a socially supportive setting, our check-in circles. \nImplications and Applications\nWhile our research group was relatively small, the results offer valuable insights for social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses:\nCreating supportive environments: Regular check-ins and supportive communities can be integrated into various organizational structures.\nFostering deliberate reflection: Incorporating structured reflection can enhance personal and professional growth.\nPersonal and professional growth focus: Programs can benefit from explicitly developing traits associated with resilience and PTG.\nLong-term vision: Recognizing that social impact takes time and involves ups and downs can help in designing more holistic support programs.\nLimitations and Future Research\nIt's important to note that while many people experience PTG after difficulty, it's not universal or expected from everyone. Factors such as prior life experiences, personal schemas, and individual differences play significant roles.\nOur study's limitations include a small sample size and focus on a specific geographic and cultural context. Future research could explore:\nLarger-scale studies across diverse contexts\nLongitudinal studies to assess long-term impacts\nComparative studies of different support methodologies\nWe welcome collaboration opportunities with other organizations to expand this research.\nCall to Action\nThe Asfari Foundation’s ACSI program and the experience we went through during 2020 demonstrate the potential for entrepreneurship training programs to go beyond business skills, fostering resilience and personal growth. Some simple recommendations we offer to other organizations:\nImplement regular check-ins and supportive community structures\nIncorporate personal/professional assessments and development\nCreate spaces for deliberate reflection and meaningful questions\nConsider how their programs can prepare participants for long-term challenges\nBy sharing these insights, we hope to contribute to a broader conversation on creating resilient communities of social entrepreneurs capable of driving positive change, by placing themselves and their wellbeing and growth at the center of the impact they are creating, and building systems and communities that support them.\nFor those running social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses, understanding how simple adjustments to the environment and meeting structure can help promote PTG can support the conditions that not only make these environments more meaningful and enjoyable but also increase the likelihood that the group will be there for each other when they need each other the most.\nBloom works with partners like the Asfari Foundation to unlock human potential for positive change, and to ensure our teams thrive and continue to support the positive impact they’re working toward, we must also consider holistic support, especially support when times are tough.\nBy sharing these insights, we hope to contribute to a broader conversation on creating resilient communities of social entrepreneurs capable of driving positive change, even in the face of significant adversity.\nFor more detailed information and data, please download our full research report: \"Character Strengths and Fostering PTG\" [Insert download link]\nCharacter Strengths And Fostering PTG (draft to publish)\n\n\n"

This report outlines how the program not only persevered but also fostered resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) among its participants. Our findings suggest that structured social support and deliberate reflection can significantly enhance resilience in social entrepreneurs, even amid extreme adversity. Key recommendations include implementing regular check-ins, fostering deliberate reflection, and creating supportive communities within entrepreneurship support programs.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Context: Lebanon in 2020\n\n2020 was a year of extraordinary challenges globally, with Lebanon facing particularly severe hardships. As we ran the ACSI program with teams across Lebanon, we encountered a perfect storm of crises:\n\n- Global COVID-19 pandemic\n- Severe economic downturn\n- Political instability\n- Resource shortages\n- Rising unemployment\n- The catastrophic Beirut Port explosion\n\nThese events profoundly impacted our participants, with some team members directly affected by the port explosion.\n\n### 1.2 The ACSI Program\n\nDespite these challenges, the ACSI program continued, adapting to provide crucial support during this tumultuous period. Social Entrepreneurship support organizations, like Bloom, are working in an environment of seemingly accelerating social, political, and environmental challenges. Thus, identifying factors that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical.\n\n## 2. Methodology\n\n### 2.1 Program Approach\n\nThe ACSI program employed several key strategies:\n\n1. **Principles-based training**: We focused on core principles of social innovation rather than rigid methodologies, allowing for flexibility in application.\n\n2. **Quantitative/Qualitative data and reflection**: Using the Values In Action Character Profile (VIA) - a psychometrically validated tool - helped us assess and support participants' character strengths.\n\n3. **Regular convening circles**: We maintained consistent check-ins, even in the immediate aftermath of the port explosion, fostering a supportive community.\n\n### 2.2 Data Collection and Analysis\n\nWe used the VIA assessment to measure participants' character strengths at two points:\n1. Before the ACSI program\n2. After the program's completion\n\nAdditionally, we assessed a control group of individuals who were unable to participate in the program. This allowed us to compare the resilience and growth of ACSI participants with non-participants facing similar challenges.\n\n## 3. Findings\n\n### 3.1 Enhanced Resilience\n\nACSI participants demonstrated greater resilience in the face of acute challenges compared to the control group. Our VIA assessment results showed significant improvements in key character strengths associated with resilience:\n\n[Insert bar graph here showing pre- and post-program scores for Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude]\n\nFigure 1: Changes in Character Strengths Before and After ACSI Program\n\n### 3.2 Impact of Social Support\n\nRegular check-ins and a supportive community correlated with improved coping mechanisms among participants. The \"pre-resilience\" habit of holding a space where important questions are raised in a socially supportive setting appeared to be a key factor in this enhanced resilience.\n\n### 3.3 Role of Deliberate Reflection\n\nStructured reflection on experiences contributed to personal growth. Participants who engaged more deeply in the reflection activities showed greater increases in PTG-associated traits.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\n### 4.1 Connections to PTG Theory\n\nOur findings align with established research on Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) by Tedeschi and Calhoun. Two critical factors in promoting PTG emerged:\n\n1. **Deliberate Rumination**: The intentional and constructive reflection on one's experiences and their meaning.\n2. **Positive Social Support**: A supportive environment that allows individuals to process their experiences and reconstruct their narratives.\n\nWe believe these factors, intentionally fostered in the ACSI program, contributed significantly to participants' resilience and growth.\n\n### 4.2 Implications for Social Entrepreneurship Support\n\nWhile traumatic events can destabilize the status quo by disrupting personal narratives, how we reconstruct those narratives is critically important. The ACSI program's structure appears to have provided a framework for positive narrative reconstruction, even in the face of severe challenges.\n\n## 5. Limitations and Future Research\n\nIt's important to note that while many people experience PTG after difficulty, it's not universal or expected from everyone. Factors such as prior life experiences, personal schemas, and individual differences play significant roles.\n\nOur study's limitations include:\n- Small sample size\n- Focus on a specific geographic and cultural context\n- Relatively short timeframe for observing long-term effects\n\nFuture research could explore:\n- Larger-scale studies across diverse contexts\n- Longitudinal studies to assess long-term impacts\n- Comparative studies of different support methodologies\n\nWe welcome collaboration opportunities with other organizations to expand this research.\n\n## 6. Recommendations for Organizations\n\nBased on our findings, we recommend the following actions for social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses:\n\n1. **Implement Regular Check-ins**: \n   - Establish consistent times for team or community gatherings.\n   - Example: Weekly \"Circle Time\" where participants share challenges and successes.\n\n2. **Foster Deliberate Reflection**: \n   - Incorporate structured reflection activities into programs.\n   - Example: Monthly journaling prompts focused on personal and professional growth.\n\n3. **Develop Character Strengths**: \n   - Use validated tools like the VIA assessment to identify and nurture key traits.\n   - Example: Design workshops around developing Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude.\n\n4. **Create Supportive Communities**: \n   - Facilitate peer support networks within and beyond formal program structures.\n   - Example: Establish a mentorship program pairing experienced entrepreneurs with newcomers.\n\n5. **Adopt a Long-term Vision**: \n   - Design programs that acknowledge and prepare for long-term challenges.\n   - Example: Include modules on personal resilience and stress management in entrepreneurship curricula.\n\n## 7. Conclusion and Call to Action\n\nThe ACSI program's experience during 2020 demonstrates the potential for entrepreneurship training programs to go beyond business skills, fostering resilience and personal growth. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, organizations can create more supportive, resilient, and growth-oriented environments for social entrepreneurs.\n\nWe invite other organizations to join us in this important work.

This report outlines how the program participants not only persevered but also fostered resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Our findings suggest that structured social support and deliberate reflection can significantly enhance resilience in social entrepreneurs, even amid extreme adversity.\nIntroduction\n2020 was a year of extraordinary challenges globally, with Lebanon facing particularly severe hardships. As we ran the ACSI program with teams across Lebanon, we encountered a perfect storm of crises:\nGlobal COVID-19 pandemic\nSevere economic downturn\nPolitical instability\nResource shortages\nRising unemployment\nThe catastrophic Beirut Port explosion\nThese events profoundly impacted our participants, with some team members directly affected by the port explosion. Despite these challenges, the ACSI program continued, adapting to provide crucial support during this tumultuous period.\nSocial Entrepreneurship support organizations, like Bloom, are working in an environment and an age of seemingly accelerating incidences of social, political, and environmental challenges. Thus, identifying the factors that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical. \nProgram Approach\nThe ACSI program employed several key strategies:\nPrinciples-based training: We focused on core principles of social innovation rather than rigid methodologies, allowing for flexibility in application.\nQuantitative/Qualitative data and reflection: Using the Values In Action Character Profile(VIA) - a psychometrically validated tool - helped us assess and support participants' character strengths.\nRegular convening circles: We maintained consistent check-ins, even in the immediate aftermath of the port explosion, fostering a supportive community.\nResearch Findings\nOur research compared ACSI participants with a control group of individuals who were assessed but unable to participate in the program. Key findings include:\nEnhanced resilience: ACSI participants demonstrated greater resilience in the face of acute challenges.\nPositive impact of social support: Regular check-ins and a supportive community correlated with improved coping mechanisms.\nImportance of deliberate rumination: Structured reflection on experiences contributed to personal growth.\nCharacter strength development: Participants showed increases in traits associated with PTG, such as Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude.\nThe Values In Action (VIA) assessment offers a unique perspective in psychological measurement. While traditionally Psychological measures measure what goes wrong, the VIA identifies what is working well in a flourishing life. We used this psychometrically validated instrument to assess teams before the ACSI accelerator program and after the program's completion.\nAdditionally, we assessed a control group of teams who were unable to participate in the program. Our findings revealed a difference: teams who participated in the ACSI program demonstrated greater resilience when facing acute challenges. This observation led us to a crucial question: What specific aspects of the ACSI program contributed to this enhanced resilience?\nDiving into the literature, we found connections between social support, asking meaningful questions, and PTG. \nImplications for Social Entrepreneurship Support\nWhile traumatic events can destabilize the status quo by disrupting our worldview, how we reconstruct those narratives is critically important. The ACSI program's structure appears to have provided a framework for positive narrative reconstruction, even in the face of severe challenges. \nThe originators of the concept of PTG, Tedeschi, and Calhoun, identify Deliberate Rumination and Positive Social Support as important factors in promoting the possibility of growth after a difficulty. We believe one of the reasons teams in the ACSI program fared better is that we developed a “pre-resilience” habit of holding a space where important questions are raised in a socially supportive setting, our check-in circles.\nLimitations and Future Research\nIt's important to note that while many people experience PTG after difficulty, it's not universal or expected from everyone. Factors such as prior life experiences, personal schemas, and individual differences play significant roles.\nOur study's limitations include:\nSmall sample size\nFocus on a specific geographic and cultural context\nRelatively short timeframe for observing long-term effects\nFuture research could explore:\nLarger-scale studies across diverse contexts\nLongitudinal studies to assess long-term impacts\nComparative studies of different support methodologies\nWe welcome collaboration opportunities with other organizations to expand this research.\nRecommendations for Organizations\nBased on our findings, we recommend the following actions for social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses:\nImplement Regular Check-ins:\nEstablish consistent times for team or community gatherings.\nExample: Establish regular check-in sessions where participants share challenges and successes.\nFoster Deliberate Reflection:\nIncorporate structured reflection activities into programs.\nDevelop Personal and Professional Strengths\nUse assessments and activities to help people identify personal and professional strengths. \nExample: Consider using the VIA assessment to identify and nurture key traits and measure flourishing.\nCreate Supportive Communities:\nFacilitate peer support networks within and beyond formal program structures.\nConclusion and Call to Action\nThe ACSI program's experience during 2020 demonstrates the potential for entrepreneurship training programs to go beyond business skills, fostering resilience and personal growth. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, organizations can create more supportive, resilient, and growth-oriented environments for social entrepreneurs.\nWe invite other organizations to join us in this important work.
