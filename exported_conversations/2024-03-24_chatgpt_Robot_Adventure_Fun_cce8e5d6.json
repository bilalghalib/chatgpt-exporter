Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.",

      "content": "Sure, let's brainstorm three different analogies for explaining how learning and exploring knowledge with AI can be like revealing parts of a map in a game, but without referencing any specific game.\n\n1. **The Magic Flashlight in a Dark Forest:** Imagine you're in a big, dark forest at night, and you have a magic flashlight. When you first enter, you can't see much – it's like the things you don't know yet. But as you use your flashlight, it lights up different parts of the forest. Each beam of light shows you new trees, animals, and paths – these are like the new things you learn. The more you explore with your flashlight, the more of the forest you can see. Your knowledge grows as the forest becomes brighter and more familiar.\n\n2. **The Treasure Map Adventure:** Picture yourself as an explorer with an old, blank treasure map. At first, the map is almost empty, with lots of hidden areas – just like when you start learning something new. As you go on adventures, you fill in parts of the map with mountains, rivers, and treasures, representing the new knowledge you gain. Sometimes, you might find clues that lead you to hidden areas of the map, showing you things you didn't even know were there!\n\n3. **The Mysterious Island Exploration:** Imagine being on a boat, arriving at a mysterious island covered in mist. At first, you only see the beach, but as you walk around, the mist clears, revealing more of the island – the trees, the hills, and hidden caves. This is like learning new things. Every step you take helps clear the mist a little more, showing you parts of the island (or areas of knowledge) that you've never seen before.\n\n**Critique and Selection:**\n- The **Magic Flashlight** analogy is vivid and engaging, making it easy to visualize the process of exploring and discovering. However, it might slightly underplay the aspect of gradually building up a bigger picture.\n- The **Treasure Map** analogy is great for depicting the idea of gradually uncovering knowledge, with the concept of filling in a map being quite intuitive. It might, however, lack the sense of immediate, surrounding discovery.\n- The **Mysterious Island** analogy captures the sense of a gradual reveal and the excitement of exploring an unknown territory. It combines the ideas of immediate discovery and the progressive expansion of knowledge quite well.\n\nBased on this critique, the **Mysterious Island Exploration** analogy seems to be the best fit. It effectively conveys the concept of expanding knowledge and exploration in a way that's exciting and easy for a child to understand.\n\n---\n\n#### **Hello Young Explorer!**\n\n#### **Discovering the Mysterious Island of Knowledge!**\n\n**Welcome to an amazing adventure!** Imagine you're on a boat, arriving at a mysterious island. At first, all you see is a foggy beach. This is like starting to learn something new – you only see a little bit at the beginning.\n\n**The Island and Its Secrets:** As you step off your boat and start walking, something magical happens. The mist begins to clear with every step you take. First, you see the trees, then the hills, and even hidden caves. Each step reveals a new part of the island, just like how each question you ask and every answer you find helps you learn and understand more.\n\n**Your Journey of Learning:** This island is like the world of knowledge. At first, much of it is hidden, like it's covered in mist. But as you explore – ask questions, listen, and learn – the mist clears. You start to see how everything connects, like the paths leading to different parts of the island.\n\n**Your Guide in This Adventure:** In this journey, you're not alone! You have a special guide, your talking robot friend, helping you clear the mist faster. It's like having a magical compass that points out interesting things you haven't seen yet.\n\n**The Excitement of Discovery:** Imagine finding a hidden waterfall or a secret cave full of treasures. That's what learning can be like! Each new thing you learn is like discovering a new, exciting part of the island.\n\n**Ready to Explore?** So, put on your explorer's hat, and let's start this adventure! Let's see how much of the island we can explore and what amazing secrets we can uncover together!\n\n---\n\nThis version of the introduction uses the Mysterious Island Exploration analogy to convey the excitement and process of learning and discovery in a way that's engaging and easy for a young child to understand.",

      "content": "Understood. Let's rework the analogy to emphasize the role of the \"magic compass\" (representing GPT) in guiding the exploration and helping to ask new, insightful questions.\n\n1. **The Guide Star in the Night Sky:** Imagine exploring a vast land at night under the stars. You have a special guide star that doesn't just shine brightly but also talks to you, helping you decide which way to go. This star helps you ask questions about the land around you, guiding you to places you never thought to explore. It lights up hidden paths and secret spots that you wouldn't know to look for on your own.\n\n2. **The Wise Talking Parrot on a Pirate Adventure:** Picture yourself as a pirate on a grand adventure across the seas. You have a wise talking parrot with you, who knows the seas better than any pirate. This parrot doesn't just repeat what you say but helps you think of questions about uncharted waters and hidden treasures – questions a pirate wouldn't normally think to ask.\n\n3. **The Enchanted Compass in a Mystical Land:** Imagine being in a mystical land full of unknown wonders. You have an enchanted compass that does more than point north; it talks and thinks! It suggests where to go next and helps you think of questions about mysterious places in the land that you wouldn't know to ask about on your own.\n\n**Critique and Selection:**\n- The **Guide Star** analogy captures the guiding aspect well, but it might be a bit abstract in how it interacts with the explorer.\n- The **Talking Parrot** is a fun and engaging concept, suggesting a direct interaction. However, it might overly personify the AI, shifting focus from guidance to companionship.\n- The **Enchanted Compass** strikes a balance between being a guiding tool and an interactive element. It stays true to the concept of a compass while adding the magical, guiding aspect relevant to AI.\n\nThe **Enchanted Compass in a Mystical Land** seems to be the best analogy, effectively conveying the idea of the AI (GPT) as a guiding tool that helps the user ask new questions and explore unthought-of paths.\n\n---\n\n#### **Hello Young Explorer!**\n\n#### **Embark on a Quest with Your Enchanted Compass!**\n\n**Welcome to a land of mysteries and wonders!** In this adventure, you're not just any explorer – you're a brave seeker in a mystical land. And guess what? You have a magical tool to help you: an enchanted compass. This isn't an ordinary compass; it's special because it can talk and think!\n\n**Your Magical Guide:** The enchanted compass is your guide. It does more than show directions; it helps you think of amazing questions about the world around you – questions that help you discover secrets and adventures you never knew existed.\n\n**Exploring the Mystical Land:** As you walk through this magical land, your enchanted compass suggests where to look and what to wonder about. It might say, \"Why don't you check out that hidden cave?\" or \"Have you ever wondered what's at the top of that tall tower?\" It's helping you find exciting places and ideas that you wouldn't find on your own.\n\n**The Power of Questions:** The compass's true magic lies in the questions it helps you ask. Each new question is like opening a door to a world of knowledge, secrets, and fun. You might find a forest of talking trees or a stream that flows upwards – all because the compass helped you ask, \"What's over there?\"\n\n**Your Journey of Discovery:** Remember, in this mystical land, every step you take with your enchanted compass reveals something new and amazing. It's your guide, but you're the hero of this story. You decide where to go and what to explore next.\n\n**Ready for an Enchanting Adventure?** So, grab your enchanted compass and let's set off! Who knows what mysteries we'll uncover and what incredible places we'll find on our journey together!\n\n---\n\nThis revised introduction uses the \"Enchanted Compass in a Mystical Land\" analogy to illustrate how the AI (like GPT) acts as a guiding tool, helping the child to explore new areas of knowledge by suggesting questions and directions they might not think of on their own.",

      "content": "You're right about the limitations of the compass analogy. Let's think of another way to express this concept, keeping in mind the interactive and knowledgeable aspects of the AI, similar to the talking parrot. Here are three new ideas:\n\n1. **The Curious Owl Guide:** Imagine having a wise owl with you on your journey. This owl is no ordinary bird; it can talk and see things from high above. It guides you through the forest, suggesting where to go and helping you ask questions about mysterious shadows, hidden streams, or unseen paths in the woods that you wouldn't notice on your own.\n\n2. **The Explorer's Magic Lens:** Picture yourself with a magic lens that reveals hidden worlds. When you look through this lens, it doesn't just magnify; it speaks and suggests where to explore next. It might prompt you to look at a tiny insect on a leaf and ask, \"What's the story of this little creature?\" or point you towards a cluster of stars and suggest, \"Why don't we learn what constellations are up there?\"\n\n3. **The Navigator's Talking Map:** Imagine having a talking map on your exploration. This isn't just a map that shows roads and rivers; it's a map that knows all sorts of things and can speak to you. It suggests exploring the secret cave in the corner of the map or asks you if you've ever wondered what lives in the deep blue lake it displays. It helps you think of new places to explore and questions to ask about them.\n\n**Critique and Selection:**\n- The **Curious Owl Guide** presents a knowledgeable, interactive guide that can see things from a unique perspective, but it might lean a bit towards an animal companion rather than a tool of exploration.\n- The **Explorer's Magic Lens** is an intriguing concept that combines the tool aspect with the ability to suggest and inspire inquiry. However, it might be too focused on seeing rather than guiding through a journey.\n- The **Navigator's Talking Map** bridges the gap between guidance and knowledge. It retains the map aspect but adds the interactive, knowledge-sharing dimension.\n\nConsidering these points, the **Navigator's Talking Map** seems to be the most suitable analogy. It captures the essence of AI as a tool that guides exploration and stimulates inquiry, while being an interactive and knowledgeable companion.\n\n---\n\n#### **Hello Young Explorer!**\n\n#### **Set Sail on an Adventure with Your Navigator's Talking Map!**\n\n**Welcome to a world of discovery and imagination!** On this journey, you're not just wandering; you're an intrepid navigator with a very special companion – a talking map. This map is no ordinary piece of paper; it's alive with knowledge and adventure!\n\n**Your Interactive Guide:** The talking map knows about every nook and cranny of the world. It doesn't just show you places; it talks about them, suggests where to explore, and helps you think of questions about unknown corners of the world.\n\n**Journey Across the Map:** As you travel with your map, it might say, \"Have you ever wondered what lies beyond that mountain range?\" or \"Let's explore what's at the bottom of this deep forest!\" It's always ready to take you to new places and open up worlds you haven't thought to discover.\n\n**The Power of Curiosity:** Your map's magic lies in its ability to spark your curiosity. Every new place it points out and every question it suggests is like unlocking a hidden treasure of knowledge. It encourages you to think, explore, and learn about things far beyond the ordinary.\n\n**Navigating the Unknown:** Remember, with your talking map, you're the navigator of your own adventure. It's there to guide you, show you hidden paths, and inspire you to ask questions and find answers.\n\n**Ready to Discover Hidden Treasures?** So, grab your navigator's talking map and let's embark on a journey of discovery and learning. Who knows what wonders we'll uncover together!\n\n---\n\nThis revised introduction uses the \"Navigator's Talking Map\" analogy to illustrate the role of AI in guiding exploration and stimulating inquiry, capturing the essence of a knowledgeable and interactive tool that enhances the learning journey.",

Let's craft an introduction that conveys this concept of a \"map of everything\" helping you explore new and unexpected places from your \"map of something.\" Here's how it could be structured:\n\n---\n\n#### **Hello Young Explorer!**\n\n#### **Embark on an Epic Quest with Your Map of Everything!**\n\n**Welcome to a world brimming with endless possibilities!** Imagine you're starting a grand adventure with two special maps in your hands. The first is your \"map of something\" – it's a map of what you already know, like your neighborhood, your favorite park, or the subjects you've learned in school. The second is a truly magical map, the \"map of everything,\" and it knows every secret and wonder in the world.\n\n**Your Personal Map and the Map of Everything:** Your personal map might show where you live, where your school is, or where you've been on vacation. It's familiar and comfortable. But the \"map of everything\" is different. It's like a guide that knows all the places you've never seen or even imagined. When you tell this map about the places on your personal map, it starts to create paths to new, incredible destinations.\n\n**Journey Beyond the Known:** Think of your \"map of everything\" as a magical companion. Once you share with it where you are on your \"map of something,\" it begins to light up paths to extraordinary places. It could reveal a path from your backyard to a jungle full of talking animals, or from your classroom to a castle in the clouds!\n\n**Discovering New Worlds Together:** Your \"map of everything\" doesn't just take you to new places; it also asks you questions and suggests adventures. It might ask, \"Do you want to see where the dinosaurs lived?\" or suggest, \"Let's find out what's at the edge of the universe!\" With every question and suggestion, it helps you explore worlds beyond your wildest dreams.\n\n**Your Adventure Awaits:** With these two maps, you're not just an explorer – you're a master navigator of knowledge and imagination. The \"map of everything\" is there to guide you to the unknown, to help you discover and learn about amazing things you've never even thought about.\n\n**Are You Ready to Explore the Unknown?** Grab your \"map of something\" and join hands with your \"map of everything.\" Let's set off on a journey of endless discovery, where each step takes you to a new world of wonder and excitement!\n\n---\n\nThis introduction sets the stage for an adventurous and imaginative journey, highlighting the dynamic interplay between what the child already knows and the endless possibilities that the \"map of everything\" can reveal.",

Keep it close to the original yet simplify:\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.\n\n\n",

Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.\n\n\nlet's get a response from each of them for initial feedback and their first question",

However, I can craft hypothetical responses based on their known areas of expertise and public work. Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n1. **Sal Khan (Founder of Khan Academy, Expert in Educational Technology):**\n   - **Feedback:** \"This framework effectively uses the principles of self-guided learning, a cornerstone of modern educational technology. The child-friendly version is particularly impressive for its simplicity and engagement. However, the adult version could benefit from more practical examples and real-life applications to make the concepts more relatable.\"\n   - **First Question:** \"How would you propose integrating this framework into a conventional educational curriculum to enhance classroom learning?\"\n\n2. **Julie Dirksen (Learning Design Expert):**\n   - **Feedback:** \"The S.C.R.I.B.E.R framework presents an innovative way of using AI for learning. The step-by-step process aligns well with proven instructional design principles. However, the framework might be overwhelming for some learners. Consider simplifying it further and perhaps include more interactive elements to maintain engagement.\"\n   - **First Question:** \"Can you suggest ways to assess the effectiveness of this framework in real learning scenarios?\"\n\n3. **Cathy Moore (Instructional Design Specialist):**\n   - **Feedback:** \"Your approach resonates with action mapping, focusing on practical applications. The adult version successfully encourages critical thinking, yet it might be enhanced by incorporating more storytelling elements, as in the kid's version, to boost learner engagement.\"\n   - **First Question:** \"How do you envision adapting this framework for different learning styles and environments?\"\n\n4. **Stephen Pressfield (Author, Known for Writing on Creativity):**\n   - **Feedback:** \"The conceptualization of using AI as a tool for self-discovery and learning is quite profound. It parallels the creative process of uncovering hidden truths. The narrative style is compelling, but the framework could benefit from highlighting the 'resistance' or challenges one might face while navigating AI-driven learning.\"\n   - **First Question:** \"What obstacles do you foresee learners encountering with this framework, and how might they overcome them?\"\n\n5. **Neil Postman (Renowned Media Theorist, now deceased but assuming a hypothetical response based on his work):**\n   - **Feedback:** \"The framework intriguingly combines technological advancement with education. It underscores the need for critical thinking in the age of information overload. However, caution should be exercised in relying too heavily on technology for cognitive development.\"\n   - **First Question:** \"How does this framework address the balance between technological dependence and fostering independent critical thinking?\"\n\nThese hypothetical responses and questions are crafted to reflect the expertise and focus areas of each individual. They offer diverse perspectives on the S.C.R.I.B.E.R framework, considering both its strengths and potential areas for improvement.",

I asked the AI to give me my own unique guided journal talking to worldclass experts. This is what i call recurse, do you think there's a better way to describe this approach? What does our panel think about this, I'm especially interested in panelists who are thinking about simplifying and creating narrative around the framework.

It helps in internalizing knowledge and making learning a personal journey. However, consider simplifying the terminology and process to make it more accessible. Perhaps using storytelling or real-life scenarios could illustrate how 'recurse' works in practice.\"\n\n2. **Cathy Moore (Instructional Design Specialist):**\n   - **Thought Process:** Cathy would likely see the value in the recursive method for active learning but might suggest improvements for clarity and engagement.\n   - **Feedback:** \"The recurse element has potential for deep learning but could be lost in technical jargon. Simplifying its description and embedding it in a clear, relatable narrative could make it more understandable. How about framing it as a 'learning conversation' with the AI, where each question leads to a deeper exploration?\"\n\n3. **Sal Khan (Founder of Khan Academy):**\n   - **Thought Process:** Sal might focus on how this element can be practically implemented in educational content.\n   - **Feedback:** \"The concept of using recursive questioning is innovative. It aligns with self-paced, mastery-based learning. For broader understanding, perhaps integrate this into a series of interactive exercises or videos demonstrating its practical use in everyday learning.\"\n\n4. **Stephen Pressfield (Author):**\n   - **Thought Process:** Interested in the internal creative struggle, Pressfield might see the recurse concept as a tool for overcoming internal barriers.\n   - **Feedback:** \"The recurse approach seems like a powerful tool for learners to confront and overcome their inner obstacles. It encourages a deeper self-dialogue. Making this process a central theme of your narrative could resonate well with learners, helping them to see the importance of self-questioning in the learning process.\"\n\n5. **Neil Postman (Media Theorist):**\n   - **Thought Process:** Postman would likely appreciate the recursive element as a means of fostering independent thought.\n   - **Feedback:** \"Focusing on the recurse aspect does address my concerns about fostering independent thinking. It's crucial, however, to ensure that this process is not too complex or abstract for learners. Can you provide concrete examples or stories to illustrate how this recursive dialogue works in practice?\"\n\nIn summary, the panel seems to suggest that while the recurse element is a significant innovation, it could benefit from clearer, more relatable explanations. Simplifying its presentation, using storytelling or practical examples, and embedding it into narratives or interactive content could make it more accessible and understandable. This approach can highlight its role in fostering deep, reflective, and independent learning.",

The navigation through prompting and using langugae to guide us to a place between two points. Let's say you know something about educaiton, you know there's a school where people learn how to become teachers. You know another thing - schools have books and famous educators that teach. With these two knowledge points you can imagine that there's a space in a coordinate space where you can place them and between them is a lot of things you don't know anything about - specifically what kind of books do people study in the school where teachers learn to be teachers. you don't know the word pedagogy, yet you'll discover it there. this is how you can use the points in the coordinate space of things you understand to ifnd the things you don't. the technique to uncover it is to then use language and conversation to \"talk things into existence into the light\" by asking the ai to ask you the things that a person who goes to school to learn to be a teacher might need to know - or to ask it to go to that space and find 10 diverse thinkers in that field who might disagree with each other, to expand into the vector space and then offer the person the ability to see/think/select from that space based on curiosity and current understanding. So both talking and selection based on curiosity helps narrow, the AI's job is to elucidate the unseen and help guide further out into dark areas the users job is to narrow and specifiy and select what's useful and to take things out of the system when they're done. it should feel like a gym, like a brain workout. And then they should make NEW knowledge that's the third step. Go into dark with AI between two points, bring into light by selection or answering questions, and then making thinking tools like journal entrees or workplans or workbooks to fill in and make NEW knowledge not in the map. Think of our initial framework, how does what I just described align and how does it expand or bring thigns afresh. review this text in this prompt compared to the scriber framework and find the 5 things that are similar and the 5 things that are unique.
