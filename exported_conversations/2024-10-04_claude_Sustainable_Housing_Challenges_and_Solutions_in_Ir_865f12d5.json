Food prices increased due to a drought linked to climate change. \n\nPeer discussions:\nWhat are the main challenges Iraq faces due to climate change?\nSource: https://kapita.iq/storage/app/media/New%20Research%20Publications/Climate%20Change%20Overview.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nThe fact that Climate Changes Impact are causing droughts and increased desertification is becoming quite evident in recent years in Iraq and Syria forming the two limbs of what is known as the “Fertile Crescent”.\nA direct consequence of the increased aridity, which is strongly felt, is the occurrence of sandstorms. According to the United Nations report, it indicates that the Iraqi Ministry of Environment has recorded 122 dust storms and 283 dusty days in 2012 and it estimates that this will increase to 300 dusty days per year in the next ten years. \nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nBy the end of this century, the “Fertile Crescent” would lose its current shape and could disappear altogether. The area shown in picture witnessed one of the most devastating droughts in decades in (2007-2008) which scientists have linked to Climate Changes. This severe drought hit most of Syria and northern Iraq during what is normally the wettest time of the year. \nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nDust storms have increased by 10x over the since the 1990s.\nDust storms have resulted in the closure of airports and hospitalizations  resulting from dust-induced respiratory illnesses.\nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nWater Scarcities\nWater withdrawals in riparian countries, particularly Turkey, Iran, and to a lesser extent Syria, are increasing due to rising demand. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources, future projections under climate change indicate worsening conditions for the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Studies suggest the Euphrates-Tigris discharge could decline by 9.5% between 2040 and 2069, with some estimates predicting up to a 73% reduction in the Euphrates River's annual flow.\nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nSea Level Rise (SLR)\nThe increase in the sea level due to climate change is more likely to impact many coastal areas and inundate low-lying regions. And the most concerning area is Basrah Governorate with their seven districts.\nReduced flow from the rivers along with a rising sea level creates high saline levels in the rivers, harming agriculture, livestock and the people living off of them.\nSea water comes as far as 189 kilometers upstream from the Persian Gulf and destroying 24,000 hectares of agricultural land and 30,000 trees. \nWithout inundations of fresh water, pollutants from agriculture, the oil and gas industry, and sewage have also become more concentrated.\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349103014_The_Impacts_of_Sea_Level_Rise_on_Basrah_City_Iraq \n\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349103014_The_Impacts_of_Sea_Level_Rise_on_Basrah_City_Iraq \nhttps://e360.yale.edu/features/iraq-marshes-drought-climate-change \n\nPortion of the original population displaced due to environmental factors.

With more than 80% of Iraq's electricity derived from fossil fuels, including oil and gas, this reliance contributes to environmental degradation and inefficient energy use, which are not sustainable for the long-term development of infrastructure.\nIn 2021, the Iraq energy consumption per person was 1.3 toe/person. About 1030 kWh of electricity were used per person in 2021 in Iraq. The total energy usage increase by 12%–50 Mtoe in 2021.\nAbout 77% of the total energy use in 2021 come from oil; the remaining 23% come from gas and 4% come from renewables.\nBy 2018, CO2 emissions had increased by 69% compared to 2009 levels.\nElectricity and heat producers generate the highest levels of emissions, followed by the transport sector and households. \n\nSource:\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nEnvironmental pollution\n\n\nSource:\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nIn 2018, a total of 85.9 Mt CO2 was emitted from the electricity and heat generation sectors. The oil sector is the source of 73% of the emissions, while the natural gas sector accounts for the remainder.. Most of the air pollution is caused by the leakage of industrial waste and traffic fumes\nSource:\n\nSource: https://kapita.iq/storage/app/media/New%20Research%20Publications/Climate%20Change%20Overview.pdf \n\nCarbon Emissions Per Person\n\nThe peak demand for electricity has recorded an increase of about 46% in recent years due to the prolonged, extremely hot summers and is projected to further expand. \nThe energy reliance on fossil fuels and the fall of hydro power generation intensified CO2 emissions by 194% between the last two decades.\nSource: https://kapita.iq/storage/app/media/New%20Research%20Publications/Climate%20Change%20Overview.pdf \n\nElectricity Supply and Demand \nIraq’s power grid inefficiencies during peak summer months result in frequent power cuts, leading to reliance on costly 9, costing up to $4 billion annually in 2018.\nTo meet future demand, measures include improving distribution networks, reducing losses, increasing capacity with mobile generators, utilizing captured gas, and boosting renewable energy sources to supply 24-hour power by 2030.\n\nRelationship between Housing and Climate Change\nDisplacement Due to Environmental Degradation: The depletion of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is forcing rural populations to migrate to urban areas, straining housing infrastructure.\nImpact of Sand and Dust Storms on Housing: Dust storms are damaging building materials, increasing the need for housing repairs.\nEnergy Inefficiency in Traditional Housing: Modern housing methods lack energy efficiency, increasing energy consumption for cooling.\nUrban Heat and Cooling Demands: The need for cooling systems during hot summers has led to higher energy demands, especially in inefficient housing.\n\nOk, where is the good news?\nPeer discussions:\nWhat are some possible solutions the housing sector can provide?\nSource: https://kapita.iq/storage/app/media/New%20Research%20Publications/Climate%20Change%20Overview.pdf \n\nPart 2\n\nGreen Building Solutions\n\nIntroduction to Green and Sustainable Building Practices\nGreen building is an innovative construction approach that centers on sustainable practices to minimize the environmental impact of a structure. It involves sustainable materials, efficient energy systems, green roofs, and other eco-friendly features. Green practices are a growing trend in the construction industry, with more and more builders adopting them in buildings to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nGreen building practices have evolved from traditional construction methods, with increased focus on sustainability due to global environmental challenges.\nSource: https://safetyculture.com/topics/green-building/ \n\nhttps://www.undp.org/iraq/press-releases/iraq-reaffirms-commitment-climate-action-under-paris-agreement-draft-nationally-determined-contributions-document-finalized \n\nGreen Building Standards Around the World\nLEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design): \u000bThe most widely recognized green building certification globally, covering key areas like water efficiency, energy use, materials, and indoor environmental quality.\nBREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method): \u000bA British standard for sustainability in construction, focusing on energy performance, waste management, and health and well-being.\nGreen Globes: \u000bA flexible certification system often used in North America, focusing on energy, water efficiency, and sustainable materials.\nWELL Building Standard: \u000bA certification that focuses on enhancing human health through design features such as air quality, lighting, and ergonomics.\n\nLEED and BREEAM\n\nDesigning a Green Home\nDesigning a green home focuses on creating a sustainable, energy-efficient, and healthy living environment that minimizes environmental impact while enhancing comfort and well-being.\n\nEnergy-Efficient Design Strategies:\nPassive Solar Design: Orienting the home to capture sunlight in the winter while blocking excessive heat in the summer. This reduces the need for mechanical heating and cooling systems.\nInsulation and Airtightness: High-quality insulation in walls, roofs, and floors, combined with airtight construction, helps reduce heat loss and energy consumption.\nEnergy-Efficient Windows: Double or triple-glazed windows with low-E coatings improve insulation and reduce heat transfer, enhancing energy efficiency.\nRenewable Energy Integration: Green homes often feature solar panels, solar water heating systems, and even small-scale wind turbines to generate clean, renewable energy on-site.\nEnergy Recovery Ventilation: Energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) or heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) exchange stale indoor air with fresh outdoor air while minimizing energy loss.\n\n\nDesigning a Green Home\nIndoor Air Quality and Health\nEnsuring good indoor air quality is essential for a healthy living environment. Green homes prioritize IAQ through:\nLow-VOC and Non-Toxic Materials: Using paints, adhesives, and finishes that emit little to no volatile organic compounds (VOCs) improves IAQ.\nProper Ventilation: Mechanical ventilation systems like ERVs or HRVs bring fresh air into the home while maintaining energy efficiency. Natural ventilation through operable windows also helps enhance air quality.\nHumidity Control: Managing indoor humidity levels reduces the risk of mold growth and contributes to a healthier indoor environment.\n\nDesigning a Green Home\nSite Selection and Sustainable Landscaping\nThe location and landscaping of a green home are important factors in its overall sustainability:\nSite Orientation: Positioning the home to take advantage of natural sunlight and wind patterns reduces the need for artificial lighting, heating, and cooling.\nSolar Shading: Incorporating shading devices like overhangs, awnings, or trees to prevent overheating in summer months while allowing sunlight in winter.\nNative and Drought-Tolerant Plants: Landscaping with native plants reduces the need for water and chemical fertilizers, supporting local ecosystems and promoting biodiversity.\nPermeable Surfaces: Using permeable materials for driveways and walkways helps reduce stormwater runoff and promotes groundwater recharge.\n\nDesigning a Green Home - Case Study\nCasa GG (Yucatán, Mexico): A passive house design that uses local materials, natural ventilation, and shading to minimize energy consumption in a hot climate.\n\nGreen Building in Iraq\nIraq has a rich history of sustainable construction practices and eco-friendly architecture.\nGreen building initiatives have been instrumental in promoting sustainable development in Iraq.\n\nGreen Building in Iraq\nThe Green Zone's transformation in Baghdad showcases Iraq's commitment to sustainable development, serving as a symbol of resilience and innovation in post-war reconstruction.

Consider setting the temperature 2 degrees higher to save energy.\")\n- Visualization of energy usage breakdown (pie chart or bar graph)\n- Printable or saveable results summary\n\n2. Iraq Sustainability Challenge Quiz\n\nThis app can cover broader topics from the workshop, testing and reinforcing key concepts.\n\nFeatures:\n- Multiple-choice quiz covering climate change impacts, sustainable building practices, and energy-saving tips\n- Immediate feedback on answers with brief explanations\n- Score tracker\n- Final results page with suggestions for further learning based on performance\n- Option to retry the quiz\n\nFor both apps:\n\n- Keep the interface simple and intuitive\n- Use client-side JavaScript for calculations and interactivity to avoid need for a database\n- Ensure mobile responsiveness for ease of use on various devices\n- Include clear instructions and a brief tutorial\n\nTo make these more engaging, we could add:\n\n1. For the Home Energy Audit app:\n   - A simple slider for each appliance to adjust usage hours\n   - A \"what-if\" scenario calculator: \"If you reduced your AC usage by 2 hours, you could save X amount of energy\"\n   - A simple animation showing energy savings as users input data\n\n2. For the Sustainability Challenge Quiz:\n   - A timer option for added challenge\n   - \"Did you know?\" facts displayed between questions\n   - A shareable results card for social media\n\nThese apps would provide interactive, engaging elements to your workshop without being overly complex. They reinforce key concepts while giving participants practical tools they can use beyond the workshop. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these ideas or start working on the implementation of one of these apps?",

More comprehensive input fields based on the energy audit worksheet, including house details, various appliances, and lighting information.\n\n2. Tailored to the Iraqi context with specific appliances like evaporative coolers and consideration of different AC types.\n\n3. More detailed energy calculations for each appliance and lighting type.\n\n4. A pie chart visualization of energy usage breakdown using Chart.js.\n\n5. More specific recommendations based on the user's energy consumption patterns.\n\n6. Estimation of monthly energy costs in Iraqi Dinars (IQD).\n\n7. Improved user interface with sections for different categories of input.\n\nThis web app now provides a more thorough and engaging energy audit experience, allowing users to better understand their energy consumption and receive tailored advice for improvement. The visual representation of energy usage helps users quickly identify which areas of their home consume the most energy.\n\nTo further improve this app, you could:\n\n1. Add more specific data on average energy consumption in different regions of Iraq.\n2. Include seasonal variations in energy usage calculations.\n3. Provide more detailed information on locally available energy-efficient appliances and materials.\n4. Add a feature to save and compare results over time.\n\nWould you like me to make any further modifications or additions to this web app?",

More specific data on average energy consumption in different regions of Iraq:\n   - Updated the `regionalAverages` object with more accurate data for Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, and Erbil.\n   - The averages now vary by season for each region.\n\n2. Seasonal variations in energy usage calculations:\n   - Implemented seasonal multipliers for AC, evaporative cooler, and water heater usage.\n   - The calculations now take into account the selected season when estimating energy consumption.\n\n3. More detailed information on locally available energy-efficient appliances:\n   - Expanded the `efficientAppliances` object to include specific models, efficiency ratings, and key features.\n   - Added a new section that displays detailed recommendations for energy-efficient appliances after the calculation.\n\n4. Error resolution:\n   - Removed any potential syntax errors by ensuring consistent use of quotes and proper JavaScript syntax.\n   - Simplified the code structure to reduce the likelihood of unexpected identifiers.\n\n5. Improved user interface:\n   - Enhanced the layout and styling of the results and recommendations sections.\n   - Updated the chart to use the latest Chart.js syntax for better compatibility.\n\nThese enhancements make the web app more accurate, informative, and useful for users in different parts of Iraq and during different seasons. The addition of specific energy-efficient appliance recommendations provides actionable advice for users looking to upgrade their home appliances.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to modify or add to this web app?",
