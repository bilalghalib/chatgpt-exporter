Harmful bacteria can also accompany mold growth, which may cause foodborne illness. For safety, it’s better to discard the entire tomato if any part of it is moldy.",

      "content": "The worst that can happen from eating moldy tomatoes is the risk of food poisoning, which could lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. In rare cases, certain molds produce mycotoxins that can be harmful and lead to more severe health issues like respiratory problems or allergic reactions, especially in people with weakened immune systems. While not all molds are dangerous, it’s hard to tell which type is present, so it’s safer to avoid consuming moldy food altogether.",

      "content": "It's generally not safe to eat moldy tomatoes, even if you cut off the black or moldy spots. Mold on tomatoes can penetrate deep into the fruit, and harmful bacteria might be present alongside the mold. While some firmer foods like hard cheese can be safely consumed after cutting off the moldy part, soft foods like tomatoes are more likely to harbor mold and bacteria throughout.\n\nPrunella (Black Hat) here would advise against it due to the risks of foodborne illness. Mold on tomatoes can produce mycotoxins, which are harmful to health. Even if the visible mold is cut away, some of it may still be present in parts of the tomato that look fine. Better to err on the side of caution and discard the moldy tomatoes.",
