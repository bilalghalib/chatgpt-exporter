            "extracted_content": "Alright, I'm gonna do a really brief download because I feel like we had a great conversation and I am still kind of reverberating, as I say it, with what we said and so I'm gonna try to, before I lose it, get some thoughts out.\n\nSo, I think one of them was around this idea of surprise and how, because of the VUCA world that we've been talking about for ages, I think it's really important to be a little bit more, \"Ah, humility is another thing that I believe is like a core value.\"\n\nAnd it leads me, it's like humility, you know how I was always like, \"Oh yeah, love of learning is my thing.\"\n\nAnd then I realized that when I do love of learning, it wasn't bringing me to life and you have to look deeper.\n\nI feel like, and the thing that probably is bugging me about the different perspective, isn't that it's just a different perspective, is that it's like a value of humility that is missing, but the humility is what leads me to value surprise.\n\nAnd humility is probably because of a different belief and this is why I think something about my belief system and I'm not sure what Mounier's belief system is matters and actually one of the things I'm wondering about is for me to get that deep of a level.\n\nIt's not just your values, it's like how do those values touch your perspective?\n\nFor me, a lot of my thoughts actually come from the Muslim tradition, from what I think is the tradition of what I called \"Qataba today.\"\n\nIt's like the natural, the national realness.\n\nAnd yeah, this idea that people have this divine spark is really core to the idea of lighting a fire instead of filling a pail.\n\nAnd if you think in reductionist terms that there is a brain and that there's a mechanical world that humans are adapted to advantageously design systems around them to get fat and procreate more and we are winning the world because we're like that and we can do it better with better systems, we just have to get smarter and figure it out versus all of us in the world need to realize that in this dynamic, complex, crazy system we have no idea what we're doing every time you put something in and so whenever you try to measure something it's basically like you're stepping on a water bed and you're trying to write on it while people are walking.\n\nAnd this is what Mounir is doing, in my opinion.\n\nSorry, please delete this.\n\nBut you get it?\n\nI'm not crazy, right?\n\nI'm not crazy in this thinking because I really think that people are trying to reduce the world into something that you can comprehend.\n\nAnd once you can do that, you can control it so you can control the environment.\n\nLike I'm sure maybe Mounir would be pro-climate control in terms of putting a bunch of, you know, would it sulfur into the air to reflect something or something?\n\nI don't know, like there's people that are there, like we built it, we can rebuild it and it'll be better.\n\nBut I really think that instead of trusting a few people with a lot of resources to do these big grand scale things that impact the ecosystem in such a horrible way, if you really think about it, the problem with the environment comes from the fact that wealth is controlled by such a small fraction of the population and they have an outsized control because they think they know what good looks like and good looks like businesses where, initially it was businesses where they do well and then businesses where they do well and others do well enough and then it's businesses where they do well and others do well enough and that it supports the world and the planet that it's on but it's still under the control of a few people.\n\nAnd that's what happens to complex systems is it gets even more unpredictable when you have large outsized levers.\n\nAnd I think that maybe this is me and the whole vision that I have of a thousand flowers blooming and the super bloom is not to have like a hundred billion dollar companies in the Middle East where they can then reinvest and we have the PayPal mafia and they're trying to create the next generation of the hundred billion dollar companies and the Forbes 100 changes so dynamically all the time because people are vying for those billion dollar spots and the world changes.\n\nI don't think that's what I want.\n\nLike I think there's beauty in the small and the close and in the personal and in the meaningful and in the humane and I think we have scale because we have the capacity for technology but I also this is another thing I want to add to the vision is that I feel like technology needs to be within arms reach.\n\nSo for instance, I believe it's really important that we invented the wheel.\n\nIt's a good invention.\n\nTechnology.\n\nAwesome.\n\nLove it.\n\nI think it's really good that we invented the hoe.\n\nEven like the thing with wheel and carriage on the calf.\n\nAwesome.\n\nIt lets us feed more people and you are still able to touch your values and see them in action in the world.\n\nYou run over a cat while you're pulling the hoe.\n\nYou will cry.\n\nYou will be more careful next time.\n\nToday we have combines that are like tearing up hundreds of acres in a day that are like hundreds and meters, hundreds and hundreds of meters across.\n\nYou can't see the end when you're driving and you're probably tearing up like thousands of cats and you will never know.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's just one.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd then there's like all sorts of technologies that have this kind of outsized reach where farmers are committing suicide instead of farmers becoming friends with their neighbors because they rely on each other and there's so much respect for the skill and the witnessing of nature and the ability for a farmer to feed you versus a farmer that is destroying the earth for a short-term profit knowing that they won't be able to do it their whole lives to fund some Monsanto giant corporation.\n\nAnd this is this is this is scale.\n\nThis is where I have a problem with technology.\n\nThis is where it goes from okay and valuable and definitely cool and wonderful to too much.\n\nAnd I feel like in our systems that we're designing there's a thing between you know creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper and they're taking an assessment or you know on the phone or whatever and they have an aha moment and they make a commitment in front of a colleague or in front of their mentor or in front of one of their peer peers from the program and then they're like yeah I took this assessment let me realize this and I'm gonna do this from now on and I've decided to change them.\n\nAnd really you know like whatever it is that moments of commitments that moments of being witnessed of togetherness that's a great use of technology right and in terms of impact let's count it by seconds right the rest of their life the seconds are now in our impact bank right you can count that especially if they have been true to their promise if it was a deep enough moment people have near-death experiences they're transformed for life people go visit what's his face and the power within Tony Robbins they're changed for life that happens I know I met people like that and it's changed them and we can do that that's possible and Tony is slightly scalable he writes books he has his you know Waking the Tiger Within empowering the power within or whatever it is online where he has like screens in a giant circle around him and people are on zoom but he's there and it's his time and it's limited it's that moment right then and there with him and it's present and it's true and it's real and when you witness that it's different than a recording and I feel like we need to acknowledge that and look at our recordings all of them which ones has ever helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody and one is scalable one we can like put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand people and the other you kind of have to have been there and there's a thing about that the moment and the presence and the reality of it that I think is also a part of what I'm getting at in this subtle like linear versus dynamic or linear versus sfumato if you want to go Italian or like lingerie versus full frontal I don't know which one to call it but like this approach that I've been talking to you about and thinking about like why how I feel like I differ and I'm just gonna okay I'm using count this as the thing I might even send this as a part one and tell you not to listen to it I didn't see for me like recording to myself is very different than having a persona in mind and that's the thing that's here's another really important thing Mr.\n\nRogers when he was in doing the TV shows he said that every time he looked into the camera he had a specific child in his mind he didn't just record videos he was recording for someone and you can't for anything which is where your humanity shows up for a stand for something when you're creating a autonomous system that doesn't include your human element and for me like when I came to Lebanon I tried to do both like I was with Munir on the scalable stuff because it's important and I also love the facilitation I wanted to create like a dynamic learning experience rather than a linear learning experience where people can do the right thing at the right time and actually you know Munir the way I don't know if you know how everything started but Munir was like can you run an entrepreneurship program?\n\nHere's our program and it was basically you know the business model canvas or something in a linear way one after another kind of boot campy or I don't know it was something and I had this realization that like you know we don't have to do it like this like not everyone needs the same thing from everyone else I think even Taro said this like one of the problems that they were having I was like asking people what are the problems of the programs like not everyone needs the same thing and so because I'm an aerator I'm like okay well how can we make it so people can do different things at the same time and that became pitch worthy and it became boom and the initial framework the initial like structure was like the pitch deck it's like it's the thing that gives the person the complete information as much as possible or at least it should you know the most important components and so if you do that right you do everything well right so once you get that right that's why it's pitch worthy it'd be worth pitching if you get that right and then it comes to the like personal and interpersonal because you have to work on yourself to be able to pitch you have to and so I found I thought that was like a really leverageable moment and I'm glad to see it still is there actually it's like the boot camp leads up to a pitch the sessions all of them right like it's it's there it's not moments of together in a live way that the transmission of the idea happens the question happens where the realness of what you're doing is palpably felt and is how people make decisions right I think it's really important you know and is related and you can even see that the intuition inside of the ecosystem has adapted right of course they always say they invest in people not the product they don't invest in the thing because a transforming person not a transformed person I think we need to change that language it's like a transforming person continuously a verb is going to be able to do things differently you know they're going to be able to be quiet as Joe is in the other room doing an interview for a job a transforming person you can see their trajectory and this is kind of why I wanted to bring you onto the board earlier rather than later because I could see you transforming nature and I could kind of see the direction I was like yeah that's that's what I want to go to you know and and yeah so I have been reflecting on so many things and I'm going to take a pause here and then try to start again I'm just going to tell you not to listen to this just in case I lose this audio\n\nOkay, yeah, so continuing the thing that I've been trying to parse is like, what is the relationship between the way that Muneer was wanting every assessment to make these levels move on the entrepreneurship scale from beginner to end in this linear sort of way, versus that being his intuition of good, total like the bar chart, what percentage of people in our programs are moving towards an exit versus my perspective of encouraging people to internalize the scriber framework and then disappearing until they need us or watching from afar and collecting stories of impact and being surprised 10 years later and making sure that it's true and it's real and it gets implemented and that it's trained well and that it's actually helping, but it's about respect as well.\n\nAnd this is like upside down pyramid is really like some of these other values that don't sound fun, like humility, respect, you know, the things that your dad might say, those are the things that I feel are, sorry, I don't mean your dad, I mean, you know, like not so fun and love, humor, joy stuff, which is also important but like, I do think that the thing that might be different is this respecting people, because they contain a flame that is worth lighting and to watch and to be in witness and in awe, and to be in the uncertainty of what that person will do.\n\nAnd of course, to help them guide, help them learn how to guide themselves connect them to new ideas and new things inspire frameworks help them expand their view of what's possible what's important, tell them value the parts of themselves that they don't value necessarily and to help them realize that that is potentially what businesses need, so that when they apply when they start their business they can say hey, I'm bringing humor and it's worth it, or hey I'm bringing humility, and it's worth it, you know, and to talk about, these are like simple ways of talking about these things and this is not really want to talk about values and we'll talk about values in a more in a richer way.\n\nBut even in this like simple way, I think the basic idea is coming across.\n\nAnd so, I feel like this, this difference might be fundamentally a difference of our perspective of what a human being is.\n\nAnd I think, I think it's clear from how I talk and do programs and design things that for me, there's something precious there, that needs to be respected trusted, and that basically the other important thing is that God, to me, isn't a once and done God, and that he didn't create the universe and step out and that we're here and it's like a mechanical, like everything clicks and clacks and kind of goes forward and the deterministic and even like quantum is like opening some weird doors for people but even then they're like yeah it doesn't have any real say for what happens in this world and even if you can figure it out, once you figure out the quantum world it's just another just weird click, click, right?\n\nIt's like okay so that was entangled in that way and we're creating quantum computers and so you can see that even this like quantification of the quantum and the practicalization of the uncertainty of that weird world is just another type of reductionistic perspective.\n\nBut in my worldview and in the listening worldview and I think a lot of tribal and native people like there is continual unfolding and new, right?\n\nAnd that new, you can, you go and I think that's why you are in awe when you see something majestic in nature, because it's the first time you've ever seen it.\n\nThe first time the baby held his foot he was in awe, I swear you could see it in his eyes.\n\nFirsts are always awful in the best of ways and so when you have humility and when you acknowledge like you trust somebody, that's the other thing, that's where love comes from too, right?\n\nLike you say hey listen so here's the framework, here's how you teach yourself like I believe in your goodness and I believe that you can figure out the qualities that you were born with that make you who you are and that you can figure out how to bring that out into the world in a beautiful way.\n\nAnd if you have the qualities of leadership and if you incline towards that way, I believe that you can form a team of a compilation of people around a beautiful vision.\n\nAnd if the vision is beautiful enough, you'll do the right thing.\n\nAnd we don't have to even use the word social enterprise, you know, we use the ability for people to recognize their own sources of beauty, their skills, and to motivate them and inspire them to act.\n\nI really feel like this is how learning works, right?\n\nYou have a thing that you direct yourself towards and this is why actually like sometimes we might not know why we're learning, right?\n\nLike when you like a person, you suddenly learn a lot about the music that they like and the backgrounds of the countries that they visited or, you know, and it's because of love, right?\n\nOne thing.\n\nAnd so the other thing is there's because in our world today, you need to eat food, you need to have a sort of stable life and structure.\n\nAnd the way that we do that today is by exchanging value for money.\n\nAnd I think the challenges and the important thing is to really kind of look at this.\n\nAnd I think this is why entrepreneurship education earlier is more valuable in my opinion.\n\nWhen people are in high school or even in college where somebody else is paying for things, they will need at some point to figure out how to answer that question.\n\nBut if they can really know who they are and be in that transforming state when they leave college, I hope that they don't have to make compromises like so many people today.\n\nSo many people today wind up going into what do you say like day trading.\n\nLiterally, I know people who were super smart, love math.\n\nThey had a talent and a skill that was divine, God given, you could even say.\n\nI can sanitize my language of the word God if you prefer, but that's one simple and for me true, we just have to define God.\n\nBut still, God given talent to do mathematics and wanted to pursue it.\n\nAnd they told me, I'm going to go to the stock floor in New York, and I'm going to work for X number of years.\n\nAnd then I'm going to get back to it.\n\nJust to pay off my student loans.\n\nAnd so these things like student loans, pressure from parents and family, these exogenous motives that aren't in AIDS corrupt the ability for someone to see clearly the question that God asked with their birth.\n\nAnd this is entrepreneurship in some way that entrepreneur is one that's like, Who am I?\n\nWhere am I here?\n\nWhat skills have I been given?\n\nBecause I really believe that fundamentally, the thing that makes life really meaningful is giving all that you can with all that you are and feeling used and useful.\n\nAnd like the blessings that are infinitely showering down on you, the fact that you have this billion person ancestry that made it possible for you to live in this moment where you can take a train from Turkey to Paris and fly to New York and taste the foods of the world and to have a family to hold your, you know, nieces or nephews hands like there's just such beauty, right?\n\nThat you've been given, we've been all given.\n\nAnd I think that there's like gratitude for sure.\n\nAnd then also like, what can you do to be a part of creating beauty and be a part of that most meaningful thing for others, right?\n\nAnd sometimes that looks like you're a researcher, because that's how you best utilize the things.\n\nAnd sometimes the things that were given to you from birth, and that you've, you know, whatever your early life experience, there's this, you know, they say that there's this moment of Elysium, right, the river, and that when you die, you're reincarnated, you come back, you have all of the world's knowledge, but then you drink the waters of Elysium, and then you're born again.\n\nAnd that's where it all ends.\n\nBut I really think that there's everyone gets shaped into this unique crystal of, you know, however your parents traumatized you and whatever society that you grew up in, the ideas that you've had and the innate inclinations that are, you know, partially biological, partially, you know, divine in origin, or just who you are, whatever that is, right?\n\nAll of that comes together before you're aware of it.\n\nAnd the waters of Elysium, in my opinion, is the last sip of mother's milk, because that usually starts coming when there's a little bit of awareness beginning to peak up, and you're there, you have arrived.\n\nAnd so that little kid, three, four, I don't know how old, that very little kid, I think has the qualities, maybe six, I don't know, but it's like this early, early childhood.\n\nAnd this is why I think maybe one thing we need to look into our programs is that Venso Shar, talking about her childhoods.\n\nAnd ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be an inventor.\n\nI've always had ideas.\n\nThis is like, this is me, I'm in my element when I'm coming up with ideas and implementing them and doing them and nerding out like totally in the zone, ignore everybody, leave me alone, I'm building stuff, you know.\n\nAnd I'm sure maybe if you look into your life, there's something like that.\n\nAnd I think like, in the Muslim tradition, it says God doesn't do anything for no reason.\n\nAnd in the chaotic system that we're talking about, that is non ambitious, that is like locally relevant, where, you know, you don't optimize for the whole at the expense of the local, right?\n\nThat's what I think you could say that some people do when they're like, okay, screw here, I'm gonna go fly to New Zealand and get a bunker, but build a business that works internationally.\n\nOkay.\n\nNo, look at yourself.\n\nLook at your surrounding.\n\nThat's what the news is.\n\nThat's where the genius is.\n\nGenius loci was what genius used to be.\n\nIt's the genius in a space.\n\nIt's not a genius.\n\nBecause the person is so cool.\n\nLook, we put them on the pedestal.\n\nIt's the combination of everything right there that makes sense.\n\nAnd in Arabic, there's this thing called adab, A-T-A-B.\n\nAnd that's when things are in the right place.\n\nAnd someone that is in right relationship is in the right place, doing the right thing, using their gifts in the right way, and interacting in a relevant way within the context that they are aware of.\n\nAnd then if we take on this deliberately developmental framework and Leo, Theo Dawson and P.I.J. and all that, you can realize that there are moments that it might not make sense for somebody to start a business that is operating on an international scale, because they don't have the mental complexity to handle it.\n\nAnd we encouraging everybody to go big or go home destroys the possibility of people being mua-dabine, M-U-A-T-A-B-E-E-N, and being in the right place, using the skills for the right thing at the right time.\n\nAnd this ambition is the problem, and this ambition is usually not coming from an innate place.\n\nYou know?\n\nOftentimes we would run programs and people would be like, \"I want to run a hair salon.\"\n\nAnd we're like, \"No, no, no.\n\nCan't you think of something scalable?\"\n\nNo, they shouldn't until that happens.\n\nThey should come up with a hair salon that serves a real need, do it uniquely, make money.\n\nMaybe it's their kids that are going to go to school and be able to have the mental complexity for the other one.\n\nOr once they satisfy their fundamental needs and they're able to settle into a routine and they start, I don't know, having evening hours for contemplating or reading, or they get exposed to different communities because they're now a business owner, then maybe, yeah.\n\nBut trying to do that early because that's what funders want, because we want to impress investors.\n\nI don't want to impress investors unless investors are investing in transformation, not in the lining of their pockets too soon.\n\nI really think investing needs to change.\n\nIt needs to have a different measure.\n\nIt's like I was talking about algebra versus calculus.\n\nYou don't just add, add, add.\n\nYou need to measure rates of change.\n\nAnd so rather than an investor looking at how fast your bank account grows and how fast it's possible to get this return, I was talking to my friend Doug.\n\nAnd I like Doug, and I think he's smart, but I think he's really dumb at the same time about this one particular thing, which is he really believes in the power.\n\nMaybe I need to change my mind about this because I kind of, I can see his point in the individual with a lot of money to do a lot of good.\n\nAnd that is the kind of thing that he wants to invest in because it creates like the aristocracy of modernity, where people can do stuff that makes no sense, like start a foundation.\n\nWe don't have divine right of kings or aristocracy or the ability to enslave people officially.\n\nWe have to create structures that we own and that create outsized value.\n\nI think it's possible to do that in a good way.\n\nAnd I think Doug is that kind of person.\n\nAnd totally, it makes sense.\n\nBut I think incentivizing the entire ecosystem towards this end.\n\nFirst of all, one problem I see in that is everyone knows that capitalism needs to change very soon, and that it needs to be restructured.\n\nAnd that pretending like we can just build the same kind of businesses without creating wealth inequality that destroys the fabric of society, that's already happening.\n\nIt's there.\n\nBillionaires are one of the most hated populations in the planet, even while their numbers keep growing.\n\nAnd I think that there is some interesting things about the adab or like the right place and the right person who is the right kind of framing and structure and individual that is able to hold that space well.\n\nAnd it might be only held well in collectives.\n\nI don't know.\n\nThis is something I'm just thinking about now, but like, I'm not sure I buy into this idea of scale, partially because of the technological element and the problems that we spoke above about expanding being beyond your reach of comprehension.\n\nAnd then partially because of the systems that satisfy human need.\n\nAnd so learning, getting back to that as the core of what's happening, happens when there's an objective, and then an individual explores, experiences, reflects along the path towards the subjective.\n\nAnd so what is the objective?\n\nAnd this is why we start with why, right?\n\nBecause once you get the right why, an objective is right for you.\n\nI think that's another thing we should add to the start with why thing needs to be right for you.\n\nIt needs to be your why, you know, not just start with why.\n\nIt's like start with your why.\n\nAnd when you get that, you will find out all the things you need to find out to go towards that objective.\n\nAnd if the objective is embarrassing to share in front of others, because it's like, well, somebody actually in my last cohort was like, I want money.\n\nAnd that's another why you have to ask a couple of levels deep.\n\nAnd of course, people want money.\n\nThey need money.\n\nWe're in a world where there's a lot of difficulty.\n\nAnd this is why partially, like, I would be open to only working with college students and under, and having that be a cap.\n\nAnd I don't think it's a horrible idea to actually describe why we need this cap.\n\nAnd initially, I wanted to like change the world by getting people to do the things.\n\nBut I realized that like, we don't know what those things are.\n\nAnd it's probably...\n\nLike, if we had started with this vision, 10 years ago, I was a youth back then, I guess it only makes sense now.\n\nBut like, if we started with this 10 years ago, the generation today would have failed the right number of failures and grown the number of times in their mental complexity and capacity, and that leadership to potentially be those scalable, high impact, change the world businesses and change their world businesses in the right way.\n\nSo I think I'm trying to come up with a better language.\n\nIt's not that I don't like scale and want scale, as I want the right people doing the things that are right for them.\n\nAnd that requires us to be more humble and to trust, rather than to know what we want to see in the world and to pay to make it happen and to promise investors and to promise funders that we will make X number of social enterprises that create Y number of impacted individuals that are pulling X number of people out of poverty and feeding the hungry and solving the climate crisis at the same time.\n\nI think like what I would rather do is measure those inputs rather than the outputs.\n\nLike, are we creating transformational experiences?\n\nDo we trust in the innate goodness of people and are they feeling committed?\n\nLike, how can we measure their commitments towards their why?\n\nAnd we ask them, is your why still, are you still on fire about your why?\n\nYeah, why or why not?\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, if you're still on fire, what are you doing about it?\n\nAre you learning?\n\nWhy or why not?\n\nOkay, if you're not learning, do you need mentorship?\n\nDo you need community?\n\nDo you know yourself?\n\nThis is where we get into the inner work stuff.\n\nAnd so it's not about scale.\n\nIt's about the right person scaling at the right time in their life being ready because, you know, you give a teenager a Ferrari and they're going to kill themselves.\n\nDon't give a teenager a Ferrari.\n\nThey shouldn't even be in the car.\n\nWe shouldn't even be encouraging them to make money in crypto to buy a Lambo, right?\n\nBut there are these kids out there.\n\nAnd I'm sure definitely if I look, I don't want to.\n\nThere's some silly kid that got rich in crypto that is dead in a Lambo.\n\nThat would be like the equivalent.\n\nThat would be the thing.\n\nMaybe that's the name of this.\n\nThis podcast or this blog post is don't put the crypto kids in the Ferrari, something like that.\n\nThat was 45 minutes.\n\nOkay, so I talked a lot.\n\nI talked a lot about a lot of things.\n\nI don't know, Dada, if I missed anything from what I shared with you.\n\nBut I will.\n\nYeah, transcribe this and cluster the concepts with AI and then follow the inspire framework, by the way, it's inspiring.\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nIt's like evolving and I'm getting deeper and deeper as I look into it and realizing that, yeah, we're really like getting back to the fundamentals of research.\n\nThis is another thing of humility.\n\nIt's like, don't make things up yourself.\n\nRealize that you're aligning along a movement and that you're a tiny part of a wave peeking your head up and realizing that you're an individual and a bigger thing.\n\nAnd this is why it's not about us scaling and taking over the world.\n\nImagine a tsunami.\n\nWe shouldn't be a tsunami.\n\nWe should be a wave that goes forth, nourishes the shore, leaves space for the crabs and draws back out when the tide goes and then somebody else is going to come in our place and we're a part of this way.\n\nAnd we'll come back to, you know, maybe next year, maybe next program.\n\nWho knows?\n\nMaybe we do need to take this break.\n\nBut I really think that, yeah, like these intuitions about humility, about trusting others, about being a part of a movement that's already happening.\n\nInstead of like Cree using our platform or us integrating with Cree or whatever, like, actually it's okay for there to be diversity.\n\nThat is the world that is most beautiful is the one where you see two birds that are almost the same, but they're different.\n\nEach of them has their unique qualities and you love it.\n\nRight?\n\nAnd there's a lot of people and there's a lot of growing up to do as humanity.\n\nAnd I think we can be a part of that if we're humble, if we respect the soul, and if we truly believe in the fundamental goodness of people and their ability to sacrifice, actually, if you think about it, to work on change is to work on a mini death.\n\nIt's like a very Jesus moment, right?\n\nIt's like, who do you need to become?\n\nAnd then when you do that, you know, the process of that, you're nailing yourselves to the cross.\n\nYou know, this is super, figured it might as well, like, you know, if I'm going to go all Muslim style, I should get some Jesus style up in here too.\n\nYou know, I consider to be a Muslim and a very fitly, natural oriented person.\n\nBut anyway, that's just my perspective.\n\nOkay, I'm going to go work on something else now.\n\nAnd I'll let this simmer in my mind.\n\nAnd I'll listen to something else.\n\nAnd thank you for the call.\n\nThank you for money or for actually bringing up the idea of you being a co founder.\n\nI think that's really promising.\n\nAnd yeah, I should not ignore his messages.\n\nI'm just kind of like, you know, like, that's the point where I just don't want, I don't want to look and don't want to talk.\n\nAnd like when we had that call, and he was trying to do that alignment, I was like, Oh, no, yeah, this is not my place.\n\nThis is not for me.\n\nBut yeah, I think if you're right that he's changing.\n\nAnd if you're right that he thinks differently, and he wants to go slower.\n\nThat's another thing I wanted to remember to tell myself go slower, raising enough money so that we can actually do the things that are right, rather than the things that are fast, because we think we can leverage that to do something else, right?\n\nI'm actually thinking about taking all of my savings from crypto, which I never touched because I'm like a 1520 30 year crypto person, and whatever it is right now, taking it out.\n\nAnd just like investing in me and more working on the badges, I thought that could be a cool thing.\n\nPay for an apartment, you know, for him to visit once a month, and I can only work with him in person.\n\nSo I would pay for that.\n\nOr to explore like working with the boy or something else and just give myself space, right.\n\nAnd to, I already paid an advanced rent to Josephine for like four months, because I don't want to worry about it.\n\nI want to be able to think and be free and to plan and to do, and to learn about myself and how I like to work and what's what is actually my role here in this world.\n\nAnd obviously a big part of it is talking.\n\nI hope that this isn't like arrogance or just too foul.\n\nAnd I hope that it's inspired because sometimes I do feel inspired.\n\nI feel like where the hell is this coming from?\n\nYou know, you could literally give me a microphone and a topic and I would I could go on for an hour.\n\nBut anything, I think, you know, because I would connect it to something else.\n\nAnd I see within myself and I'm learning as I'm speaking.\n\nIt's the craziest thing.\n\nI feel like this kind of trust in the Socratic method and the ability to discover something beautiful and unique in others rather than try to get them to conform to a scale.\n\nEven though right now, I think we can do both.\n\nWe can build the bridge and the glue is chagipiti.\n\nAnd I realized that what chagipiti has is all of the past, but not the continual present unfolding that is within me right now.\n\nAnd the less I go, the less I'm going to describe this phrase, these languages, these thoughts, the deeper I go and the less contrived and the less sort of stuck on the past I am and coming from a moment of like deep stillness.\n\nI'm not orthogonally positioned to the rest of the vector spaces.\n\nAnd that is the gold of the future.\n\nAnd that is what we're trying to help the teams discover as their unique voice.\n\nAnd that is the right thing for them to say right now, not the right thing that an investor wants to hear because of the past.\n\nLet's leverage these large language models to bridge the qualitative and the quantitative by reducing the number of qualitative decisions and increasing the number of human interaction moments.\n\nAnd that measure, like quality human moments of human interaction.\n\nQ-M-O-H-I.\n\nYeah, if you get it for a week, get their daily bread.\n\nYou only get your daily bread when you have a quality moment of human interaction.\n\nAnd you can get to that after you've exhausted your capacity to be surfing your growth edge.\n\nAnd the state of flow for a person who has identified their why, they know themselves, they understand the motives that might be exogenous or external.\n\nAnd they are in a developmental path where they realize this.\n\nAnd maybe that could be the next badge system.\n\nInstead of us trying to guess developmentally where people are, are they in a socialized state of mind?\n\nOr are they self-transforming?\n\nOr where on the scale are they able to hold a complex system and work on it because they have the mental flexibility to do that?\n\nOr should they be more in a tribal situation where they understand all their neighbors and they're going to sell them the boulangerie or get the coiffel?\n\nIf we tell people that this is an important element and also tell people about maybe stories of the failure points where successful people realize they had failed themselves because they didn't become, they followed a trend or something like that.\n\nAnd then also the money question is really big.\n\nAnd so either, this is why I always wanted to try to turn our programs into cooperatives where if anybody was successful there is a baseline salary when you come into the program.\n\nI know people think like an American would be like, that's not great.\n\nThat's not going to incentivize them to work hard and suffer.\n\nWell, that's because we're changing the incentives mechanism.\n\nAnd if people aren't incentivized by their why and they're not on fire, that should be the other thing that we're measuring.\n\nIf they're not inspired by that enough to kill themselves or whatever.\n\n\nIf they're not inspired enough, not to kill themselves, I really should not have said that, but like if they're not inspired enough to like push and in a balanced way, realize, well first of all, if they're not inspired enough by what they're doing, it won't motivate them to act.\n\nBut also, that inspiration sits in the same chest, in the same way as love of your children.\n\nAnd this is where \"work-life balance\" comes from, because it's not opposites that you're comparing, it's not you're looking at your children and thinking they're going to starve because you have to hustle to bring home the bacon.\n\nIt's, \"I will die if I don't feed my inspiration.\n\nThis is how meaning is coming into my life and how I can smile honestly and show my child what it means to be human, right?\n\nAnd I need to make time for my family.\"\n\nAnd that light, they're both light.\n\nYou can hold this in your heart at the same time.\n\nI don't think you can hold your baby and stress about your boss firing you at the same time in the same kind of way.\n\nThey're different.\n\nAnd so I think there's a really important element of finances that we need to bring into our programs to relieve the stress, increase the duration, because, and to change it all, really.\n\nThis is the transforming nature that needs to happen.\n\nPeople are talking about new forms of work, and people are trying to bring in more education into classrooms.\n\nAnd I really wonder if we look.\n\nThere's certainly some people that can change, right?\n\nThere's certainly people that have an innate inclination in their childhood towards something, but they're not exposed to something different in their adult life.\n\nAnd it might totally invigorate and inspire, and then they might just fall down, like, \"Oh my God, I should have been a Tibetan Buddhist, and I'm going to move to Tibet and become a follower of the Dalai Lama, and that's it.\"\n\nI met people, literally people that are like that, and her name is, it doesn't matter, she's great.\n\nAnd it might be a complete surprise.\n\nAnd so that is one of the questions.\n\nThe other things about first principles, in terms of talking about the foundation of things, we need to get also the first principles of things.\n\nAnd so some of my first principles are, I believe that humans are good.\n\nThere's goodness that wants to come through humans.\n\nAnd this partially comes from two things.\n\nOne is rational, and the other is emotional, spiritual belief.\n\nThe rational one is, if I didn't believe that most people that don't have a potential psychological problem, mental disability, tumor in their brain that suppresses their compassion, most people are fundamentally, they have goodness that wants to flow through them.\n\nAnd if that wasn't true, if that wasn't true, I would kill myself.\n\nThis is in the reductionist, \"I don't believe in God\" world, okay?\n\nBecause I wouldn't want to be in a world like that, where I had to look over my back and not trust anybody and think that everyone's a potential sociopath, and it would be exhausting and difficult, and not actually the experience that I have in reality.\n\nThe reality is, if people aren't traumatized, hurt, or suffering, the vast majority of them want to be friendly and kind and generous, and a few might, no matter what happens, have these negative traits.\n\nAnd also, most people aren't living in a peaceful world, where everything's okay.\n\nPeople are hurt by their families, they're hurt by society, they're hurt by many things that create contortions that cause people to behave in ways against themselves.\n\nBut like I said in the beginning of this giant monologue, that there's a good part of us that wants to come forth.\n\nSo that's like one of the foundational beliefs.\n\nAnother foundational belief is that I don't know, is that it's better to go up into the system of transformation and generation, than into the systems of creation and concretization, of measurement.\n\nIt's better to measure the things that are about human interaction and the uncertainty of the conversation that will manifest in the now and in the presence, and to reduce the investment in measuring the past, the done deal, the money in the bank, especially because that's all dead.\n\nThis is a life.\n\nAnd sure, money in the bank is important, but what if we started measuring the other thing?\n\nI think we would change capitalism in a way.\n\nWe would actually talk more about, like imagine if the measurement was family conversations over dinner.\n\nDinner would have to be there, right?\n\nSo the farmer has the farm, and all that.\n\nBut if the farmer is stressing themselves out and overexerting and trying to get the combine, and it's working all day and all night, and then it's getting robots, whatever, and then the farmer doesn't have a job anymore, so he's on the streets and he's begging, then we're not having family conversation, quality family conversations over dinner.\n\nAnd another important element here is quality.\n\nHow are we going to measure that?\n\nAre we going to use an AI?\n\nIs this a good conversation?\n\nOr are we going to try to ask people how they feel?\n\nWhat was meaningful about it?\n\nThis will be able to expose the values.\n\nAnd then, if these are the things that we measure, these are the types of businesses that are approaching those measurements are going to be the ones that are meaningful for everybody.\n\nAnd then it's sort of like holding those two lights in your chest.\n\nIt's not my children or my inspiration.\n\nIt's not me winning in my business or you winning in yours.\n\nIt's like there's some values that are important that fundamentally are like need to have a common humanity where people are respected and they're able to pursue meaning and have lives with fundamental human rights of food and water and all of this stuff, right?\n\nLike if that is the baseline and we measure our business accordingly by finding the things that we find most meaningful, that's your why, actually.\n\nThis is why, actually, here, this is an interesting part.\n\nThis is how we can transform the start with why.\n\nWe need to start asking people for meaningful moments and do Joe Edelman's process of values articulation.\n\nWhen they can articulate their values, they articulate both their why but also potentially the thing that they want to measure and see happen or at least like a proxy for it.\n\nSo for instance, let me think about like, and you start with, emotions are, values articulation by finding an emotion.\n\nAnd so, yeah, so for me, oh my goodness, well, a lot of my emotions these days are about faith and trust and commitments to a spiritual tradition because I struggled a lot with that in my younger years.\n\nAnd, you know, the right way to do it would be to go deep into the story but I'm already like an hour plus into this conversation.\n\nSo for me, I have found myself committing and walking a path based on an inner sight and knowing that is real and as real as seeing with my eyes because there's trial and confirmation, you know, like you see with your eyes, something looks like a step and you can step on it and it'll hold you up and it's great.\n\nIt's real, you've confirmed.\n\nSimilarly, I see something that looks like a step with my heart.\n\nAnd it says, it's like, there's promises, like, for instance, in the tradition it says, you will not give charity and be impoverished.\n\nAnd so, you step on that step with faith and confidence and you see if it holds you up.\n\nAnd, alhamdulillah, like I have had in the last weeks and months more and more confirmation that there's a glass bridge.\n\nAnd I realize, like, for me, this glass bridge is real and it elevates people.\n\nQuite like in my imagination, literally, you see these people and they are of good character and they're flying high and they're in the sky and they yell down and they say, I'm not flying, it's a glass bridge.\n\nI'm just walking on a glass bridge, bro.\n\nAnd then, you're at the edge of this thing and you can't see it, but you stub it with your toe and you're like, oh shoot, there's something here.\n\nWhat the heck is this?\n\nAnd you follow your inspiration and you try to see with the eye of your heart and you start trepidation walking.\n\nImagine, you can't see anything at all and it looks like you're in the sky and you're stepping one foot after another.\n\nAt any moment, you lose faith, you feel like you can fall down a thousand feet, but you're walking and the more you walk, the more confidence you gain in the reality of this unseen thing that people think you're crazy about.\n\nBut it's just glass, it's just transparent.\n\nAnd it's like, you know, you know how there's some things that are transparent to different wavelengths, but opaque to others?\n\nIt's transparent to the eyes that are in your head that are all thinking, but it's real and solid to the eye of the heart.\n\nAnd it will allow you to do things that will make me, allow me to do things that make me proud of myself and go through difficulty gracefully and understand things differently and cause that understanding to become a kind of a unique life that is, for me, really beautiful.\n\nAnd I think the thing, again, I'm just going to come back to it, is like this idea of surprise.\n\nAnd awe and humility and all of that, and how it connects to this moment of amazement and being like, \"Oh my God, is the soul real?\n\nAre we not just meat machines?\n\nOh my God, this is real.\n\nI'm on this bridge.\n\nI think I believe this.\"\n\nAnd so for me, realizing that I believe this, and so much of my inspiration also comes from the Muslim tradition.\n\nLike you can see in our old table, there's like the 99 names of God.\n\nAnd I was trying to align them to the via, because I really believe in this values, articulation, and parallel, and creation, and that the one God revealed only one religion to the whole world, to align them with their most natural state.\n\nAnd it's just us who can get confused and get lost.\n\nAnd because we're overly complicated brains, we think, you know, to be safe I need to hoard money, or to be safe I need to push other people down.\n\nAnd it's fear and it's confusion that creates all of this stuff.\n\nAnd when you live according to your values and trust and vision and beauty and wonder, first of all, it's true you might die.\n\nPeople in Al-Qaza, they believe and they die.\n\nBut you see also, they die with dignity, and they die happy, and they die consented with God.\n\nAngry with the people, of course, but I do not see, and I have not heard so many people talking to their dead children, asking them to send their regards to the Prophet.\n\nThat's surprising.\n\nI think it's surprising the world.\n\nAnd that's beautiful and that's amazing.\n\nAnd I think that when I start really realizing, \"Whoa, this is crazy.\n\nI can't believe, I believe in God.\"\n\nOne second.\n\nI'm going to talk with Josephine.\n\nSo this is the end of this, but I think this is where I'm at right now.\n\nIt's about surprise, awe, wonder and amazement, and how that results in the frameworks and the beauty and the way that we do our programs and why I measure different things and values and how they're all connected to summarize this.\n\nThank you, A.I.\n\nThank you, Dara.\n\nYou want to say hi to Dara real quick?\n\nHi, bye.\n\nHi, Dara.\n\nDara.\n\nDara, Dara.\n\nNo, sorry.\n\nHi, Dara.\n\nWhatever Biral said, it's a long message already.\n\nYou're used to it, but...\n\nYou had a good call?\n\nI had an amazing call.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'll talk to her about her amazing call, and I'll talk to you soon.\n\nOh, it's perfect.\n\nIt's exactly noon.\n\nAnd Suly really likes your...\n\nOh my God, yeah.\n\nWe need to give it a name, actually.\n\nDoodoo is not, you know...\n\nDoodoo?\n\nDoodoo number...\n\nDara...\n\nDara...\n\nDaru?\n\nDuru, Dara?\n\nI think Doodoo is already good.\n\nYeah, Doodoo.\n\nDoodoo,

How would you explain the link between spirituality, values and your views on entrepreneurship and education to someone less versed in these traditions?\n\nLet me know your thoughts on these questions. I'll then work on clustering the key concepts, developing an outline, and drafting the actual essay. At each stage, I'll review the previous steps to make sure the core ideas are being captured and communicated clearly. Looking forward to working on this together!",

Ken Robinson - Known for his work on creativity and innovation in education, Robinson emphasizes the importance of nurturing individual talents and fostering a love of learning. His ideas on transforming education resonate with your thoughts on entrepreneurship and personal development.\n\n2. Brené Brown - A research professor who studies courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy, Brown's work on embracing uncertainty and cultivating resilience aligns with your ideas on humility and the importance of meaningful human interactions.\n\n3. Charles Eisenstein - An author and speaker who explores themes of civilization, consciousness, money, and human cultural evolution, Eisenstein's ideas on the need for a more compassionate and interconnected world resonate with your thoughts on spirituality and moving beyond purely financial metrics.\n\nDisagreeing Researchers and Thinkers:\n1. Steven Pinker - A cognitive psychologist and author who argues that reason, science, and humanism have led to significant progress in human well-being. Pinker's more rationalist and optimistic view of human nature and society may conflict with your emphasis on spirituality and the limits of reductionism.\n\n2. Ray Kurzweil - A futurist and inventor who predicts the rapid advancement of technology, particularly artificial intelligence, leading to a technological singularity. Kurzweil's views on the transformative potential of technology may clash with your concerns about the dangers of unchecked scale and the importance of human interaction.\n\n3. Ayn Rand - A philosopher and novelist who developed the theory of Objectivism, which emphasizes rational self-interest and the pursuit of individual happiness. Rand's ideas on the primacy of reason and individualism may stand in contrast to your focus on humility, spirituality, and the interconnectedness of people.\n\nHere is a table presenting the five clusters, your thoughts, and the perspectives of the researchers:\n\n| Cluster | Bilal's Thoughts | Aligning Researchers | Disagreeing Researchers |\n|---------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| 1.

      "content": " This verse from the Quran beautifully illustrates the contrast between the two worldviews. The reductionist perspective suggests that everything in the universe can be understood and explained through the recombination of existing elements, implying a finite and ultimately comprehensible reality. In contrast, the verse points to the infinite and inexhaustible nature of God's Words, which can be interpreted as the limitless potential for new creation, knowledge, and experience.\n\nEmbracing uncertainty and wonder opens up the possibility for personal growth and societal progress by encouraging individuals to explore uncharted territories, both within themselves and in the world around them. When we recognize that there is always more to discover and learn, we are motivated to push beyond our current limitations and seek out new ideas and experiences. This mindset fosters innovation, creativity, and a willingness to take risks, which are essential for personal and collective advancement.\n\nYour example of respecting people who may not speak English, read, or write, and seeing them as portals to the infinite mystery, highlights the transformative power of recognizing the \"divine spark\" in others. By acknowledging the inherent dignity and potential in every individual, regardless of their background or abilities, we create opportunities for meaningful connection and mutual understanding. This recognition can break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and foster a sense of unity and compassion that transcends superficial differences.\n\nMoreover, when we appreciate the divine spark within ourselves, we tap into a source of inner wisdom, resilience, and purpose that can guide us through life's challenges and uncertainties. This inner connection allows us to navigate the world with greater clarity, confidence, and authenticity, as we align our actions with our deepest values and aspirations.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between the reductionist/mechanistic worldview and the perspective that allows for uncertainty, wonder, and the divine spark in people are:\n\n1. The former sees reality as finite and ultimately comprehensible, while the latter acknowledges the infinite potential for new creation and discovery.\n2. The reductionist view may limit our understanding of human potential and capacity for change, while embracing uncertainty and wonder encourages personal growth and societal progress.\n3. Recognizing the divine spark in others fosters meaningful connection, compassion, and unity, while acknowledging it within ourselves provides a source of inner wisdom and purpose.\n\nUltimately, embracing a worldview that allows for uncertainty, wonder, and the divine spark in people is essential for unlocking our full potential as individuals and as a society, and for creating a more inclusive, compassionate, and meaningful world.",

      "content": " Thank you for your thoughtful responses! They provide valuable insights into the key themes you want to explore and the overall direction you envision for the essay. Let me propose three alternative flows for the essay, each with a specific main goal and objective:\n\nFlow 1: The Importance of Surprise and Humility in Personal and Societal Transformation\nMain Goal: To argue that embracing surprise and humility is essential for fostering genuine transformation in individuals and society, especially during times of change.\nObjective: Encourage readers to value the role of surprise and humility in their personal lives and in shaping societal progress.\n\n1. Introduction: Present the central idea that transformational times require transforming people who regularly change.\n2. The Limitations of Goal-Setting: Discuss how an overemphasis on setting and achieving goals can hinder authentic personal growth and limit our ability to adapt to new circumstances.\n3. The Power of Surprise: Explore how surprise, rooted in humility, allows for unexpected discoveries and growth opportunities.\n4. Cultivating Humility: Examine ways to foster humility and openness to surprise in personal development and education.\n5. Societal Implications: Consider how embracing surprise and humility can lead to more inclusive, adaptable, and resilient communities.\n6. Conclusion: Reiterate the importance of surprise and humility in navigating change and fostering meaningful transformation.\n\nFlow 2: Redefining Success: Quality over Scale\nMain Goal: To challenge the prevailing notion that scale and objective outcomes should be the primary measures of success, advocating instead for a focus on quality and meaning.\nObjective: Encourage readers to reassess their definition of success and consider the importance of prioritizing quality and meaning in their personal and professional lives.\n\n1. Introduction: Present the central idea that our current systems often prioritize scale over quality, leading to a misguided understanding of success.\n2. The Pitfalls of Scale: Discuss how an overemphasis on scale can lead to negative consequences, such as wealth inequality and a lack of genuine fulfillment.\n3. Quality as a Measure of Meaning: Argue that focusing on the quality of experiences and contributions, rather than objective outcomes, is essential for fostering a sense of purpose and well-being.\n4. Redefining Success: Explore alternative ways to measure success that prioritize meaning, connection, and personal growth.\n5. Implications for Business and Society: Consider how shifting our definition of success could lead to more equitable, fulfilling, and sustainable practices in various sectors.\n6. Conclusion: Urge readers to embrace a new understanding of success that values quality and meaning over scale and objective outcomes.\n\nFlow 3: Spirituality, Values, and the Divine Spark: A New Approach to Entrepreneurship and Education\nMain Goal: To explore how integrating spirituality, values, and a recognition of the divine spark in people can transform entrepreneurship and education.\nObjective: Inspire readers to consider the role of spirituality and values in shaping a more compassionate, purpose-driven approach to entrepreneurship and education.\n\n1. Introduction: Present the central idea that spirituality, values, and recognizing the divine spark in people are essential for creating a more meaningful and fulfilling approach to entrepreneurship and education.\n2. The Limitations of Current Models: Discuss how prevailing approaches to entrepreneurship and education often neglect the inner life and unique potential of individuals.\n3. Spirituality and Values as Guiding Forces: Explore how integrating spirituality and values can provide a foundation for more authentic, purpose-driven endeavors.\n4. Recognizing the Divine Spark: Argue that acknowledging the inherent worth and potential in every individual is crucial for fostering compassionate, inclusive, and transformative learning and work environments.\n5. Implications for Entrepreneurship and Education: Consider how embracing spirituality, values, and the divine spark could lead to more meaningful, impactful, and fulfilling practices in these fields.\n6. Conclusion: Encourage readers to integrate spirituality, values, and a recognition of the divine spark in their approach to entrepreneurship, education, and personal growth.\n\nCritique:\nFlow 1 offers a strong focus on the importance of surprise and humility, providing a clear roadmap for exploring this theme in depth. However, it may not fully address the other key themes, such as quality over scale and the role of spirituality.\n\nFlow 2 effectively challenges the prevailing notion of success and offers a compelling alternative focused on quality and meaning. However, it may not delve as deeply into the role of surprise and humility or the importance of spirituality and values.\n\nFlow 3 provides a comprehensive approach that integrates spirituality, values, and the recognition of the divine spark in people, offering a fresh perspective on entrepreneurship and education. While it may not explicitly address surprise and humility or the quality over scale theme, these ideas could be woven into the discussion of spirituality and values.\n\nBased on your priorities and the themes you want to emphasize, Flow 3 seems to offer the most comprehensive and cohesive approach, as it integrates spirituality, values, and the recognition of the divine spark while still allowing room to touch on the importance of surprise, humility, and quality over scale. However, the final decision depends on which aspects you feel are most crucial to convey in your essay.",

While I agree that these tools are necessary for organization and accountability, I believe that the true essence of our mission lies in the transformative moments of presence and \"AHA\" that occur during our live facilitations.\n\nWhen we are fully engaged in the present moment, we create a space for our participants to connect with their own presence and access a deeper level of understanding and self-discovery. These \"AHA\" moments are the sparks that ignite real transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard.\n\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound breakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their eyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of insight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this work in the first place.\n\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater sense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task managers. By prioritizing these moments of \"AHA\" and presence in our work, we honor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact of our mission.\n\nI understand that measurable progress is important, and I'm not suggesting we abandon our taskboards altogether. However, I believe that we need to find a balance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work.\n\nI invite you to consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can create a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work and the life-changing potential of our live facilitations. Together, we can find a way to measure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"AHA\" moments.\n\nWith gratitude and respect,\n[Your Name]",

While I agree that these tools are necessary for organization and accountability, I believe that the true essence of our mission lies in the transformative moments of presence and \"AHA\" that occur during our live facilitations.\n\nWhen we are fully engaged in the present moment, we create a space for our participants to connect with their own presence and access a deeper level of understanding and self-discovery. These \"AHA\" moments are the sparks that ignite real transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard.\n\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound breakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their eyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of insight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this work in the first place.\n\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater sense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task managers. By prioritizing these moments of \"AHA\" and presence in our work, we honor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact of our mission.\n\nI understand that measurable progress is important, and I'm not suggesting we abandon our taskboards altogether. However, I believe that we need to find a balance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work.\n\nI invite you to consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can create a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work and the life-changing potential of our live facilitations. Together, we can find a way to measure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"AHA\" moments.\n\nWith gratitude and respect,\n[Your Name]",

            "extracted_content": "Alright, I'm gonna do a really brief download because I feel like we had a great conversation and I am still kind of reverberating, as I say it, with what we said and so I'm gonna try to, before I lose it, get some thoughts out.\n\nSo, I think one of them was around this idea of surprise and how, because of the VUCA world that we've been talking about for ages, I think it's really important to be a little bit more, \"Ah, humility is another thing that I believe is like a core value.\"\n\nAnd it leads me, it's like humility, you know how I was always like, \"Oh yeah, love of learning is my thing.\"\n\nAnd then I realized that when I do love of learning, it wasn't bringing me to life and you have to look deeper.\n\nI feel like, and the thing that probably is bugging me about the different perspective, isn't that it's just a different perspective, is that it's like a value of humility that is missing, but the humility is what leads me to value surprise.\n\nAnd humility is probably because of a different belief and this is why I think something about my belief system and I'm not sure what Mounier's belief system is matters and actually one of the things I'm wondering about is for me to get that deep of a level.\n\nIt's not just your values, it's like how do those values touch your perspective?\n\nFor me, a lot of my thoughts actually come from the Muslim tradition, from what I think is the tradition of what I called \"Qataba today.\"\n\nIt's like the natural, the national realness.\n\nAnd yeah, this idea that people have this divine spark is really core to the idea of lighting a fire instead of filling a pail.\n\nAnd if you think in reductionist terms that there is a brain and that there's a mechanical world that humans are adapted to advantageously design systems around them to get fat and procreate more and we are winning the world because we're like that and we can do it better with better systems, we just have to get smarter and figure it out versus all of us in the world need to realize that in this dynamic, complex, crazy system we have no idea what we're doing every time you put something in and so whenever you try to measure something it's basically like you're stepping on a water bed and you're trying to write on it while people are walking.\n\nAnd this is what Mounir is doing, in my opinion.\n\nSorry, please delete this.\n\nBut you get it?\n\nI'm not crazy, right?\n\nI'm not crazy in this thinking because I really think that people are trying to reduce the world into something that you can comprehend.\n\nAnd once you can do that, you can control it so you can control the environment.\n\nLike I'm sure maybe Mounir would be pro-climate control in terms of putting a bunch of, you know, would it sulfur into the air to reflect something or something?\n\nI don't know, like there's people that are there, like we built it, we can rebuild it and it'll be better.\n\nBut I really think that instead of trusting a few people with a lot of resources to do these big grand scale things that impact the ecosystem in such a horrible way, if you really think about it, the problem with the environment comes from the fact that wealth is controlled by such a small fraction of the population and they have an outsized control because they think they know what good looks like and good looks like businesses where, initially it was businesses where they do well and then businesses where they do well and others do well enough and then it's businesses where they do well and others do well enough and that it supports the world and the planet that it's on but it's still under the control of a few people.\n\nAnd that's what happens to complex systems is it gets even more unpredictable when you have large outsized levers.\n\nAnd I think that maybe this is me and the whole vision that I have of a thousand flowers blooming and the super bloom is not to have like a hundred billion dollar companies in the Middle East where they can then reinvest and we have the PayPal mafia and they're trying to create the next generation of the hundred billion dollar companies and the Forbes 100 changes so dynamically all the time because people are vying for those billion dollar spots and the world changes.\n\nI don't think that's what I want.\n\nLike I think there's beauty in the small and the close and in the personal and in the meaningful and in the humane and I think we have scale because we have the capacity for technology but I also this is another thing I want to add to the vision is that I feel like technology needs to be within arms reach.\n\nSo for instance, I believe it's really important that we invented the wheel.\n\nIt's a good invention.\n\nTechnology.\n\nAwesome.\n\nLove it.\n\nI think it's really good that we invented the hoe.\n\nEven like the thing with wheel and carriage on the calf.\n\nAwesome.\n\nIt lets us feed more people and you are still able to touch your values and see them in action in the world.\n\nYou run over a cat while you're pulling the hoe.\n\nYou will cry.\n\nYou will be more careful next time.\n\nToday we have combines that are like tearing up hundreds of acres in a day that are like hundreds and meters, hundreds and hundreds of meters across.\n\nYou can't see the end when you're driving and you're probably tearing up like thousands of cats and you will never know.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's just one.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd then there's like all sorts of technologies that have this kind of outsized reach where farmers are committing suicide instead of farmers becoming friends with their neighbors because they rely on each other and there's so much respect for the skill and the witnessing of nature and the ability for a farmer to feed you versus a farmer that is destroying the earth for a short-term profit knowing that they won't be able to do it their whole lives to fund some Monsanto giant corporation.\n\nAnd this is this is this is scale.\n\nThis is where I have a problem with technology.\n\nThis is where it goes from okay and valuable and definitely cool and wonderful to too much.\n\nAnd I feel like in our systems that we're designing there's a thing between you know creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper and they're taking an assessment or you know on the phone or whatever and they have an aha moment and they make a commitment in front of a colleague or in front of their mentor or in front of one of their peer peers from the program and then they're like yeah I took this assessment let me realize this and I'm gonna do this from now on and I've decided to change them.\n\nAnd really you know like whatever it is that moments of commitments that moments of being witnessed of togetherness that's a great use of technology right and in terms of impact let's count it by seconds right the rest of their life the seconds are now in our impact bank right you can count that especially if they have been true to their promise if it was a deep enough moment people have near-death experiences they're transformed for life people go visit what's his face and the power within Tony Robbins they're changed for life that happens I know I met people like that and it's changed them and we can do that that's possible and Tony is slightly scalable he writes books he has his you know Waking the Tiger Within empowering the power within or whatever it is online where he has like screens in a giant circle around him and people are on zoom but he's there and it's his time and it's limited it's that moment right then and there with him and it's present and it's true and it's real and when you witness that it's different than a recording and I feel like we need to acknowledge that and look at our recordings all of them which ones has ever helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody and one is scalable one we can like put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand people and the other you kind of have to have been there and there's a thing about that the moment and the presence and the reality of it that I think is also a part of what I'm getting at in this subtle like linear versus dynamic or linear versus sfumato if you want to go Italian or like lingerie versus full frontal I don't know which one to call it but like this approach that I've been talking to you about and thinking about like why how I feel like I differ and I'm just gonna okay I'm using count this as the thing I might even send this as a part one and tell you not to listen to it I didn't see for me like recording to myself is very different than having a persona in mind and that's the thing that's here's another really important thing Mr.\n\nRogers when he was in doing the TV shows he said that every time he looked into the camera he had a specific child in his mind he didn't just record videos he was recording for someone and you can't for anything which is where your humanity shows up for a stand for something when you're creating a autonomous system that doesn't include your human element and for me like when I came to Lebanon I tried to do both like I was with Munir on the scalable stuff because it's important and I also love the facilitation I wanted to create like a dynamic learning experience rather than a linear learning experience where people can do the right thing at the right time and actually you know Munir the way I don't know if you know how everything started but Munir was like can you run an entrepreneurship program?\n\nHere's our program and it was basically you know the business model canvas or something in a linear way one after another kind of boot campy or I don't know it was something and I had this realization that like you know we don't have to do it like this like not everyone needs the same thing from everyone else I think even Taro said this like one of the problems that they were having I was like asking people what are the problems of the programs like not everyone needs the same thing and so because I'm an aerator I'm like okay well how can we make it so people can do different things at the same time and that became pitch worthy and it became boom and the initial framework the initial like structure was like the pitch deck it's like it's the thing that gives the person the complete information as much as possible or at least it should you know the most important components and so if you do that right you do everything well right so once you get that right that's why it's pitch worthy it'd be worth pitching if you get that right and then it comes to the like personal and interpersonal because you have to work on yourself to be able to pitch you have to and so I found I thought that was like a really leverageable moment and I'm glad to see it still is there actually it's like the boot camp leads up to a pitch the sessions all of them right like it's it's there it's not moments of together in a live way that the transmission of the idea happens the question happens where the realness of what you're doing is palpably felt and is how people make decisions right I think it's really important you know and is related and you can even see that the intuition inside of the ecosystem has adapted right of course they always say they invest in people not the product they don't invest in the thing because a transforming person not a transformed person I think we need to change that language it's like a transforming person continuously a verb is going to be able to do things differently you know they're going to be able to be quiet as Joe is in the other room doing an interview for a job a transforming person you can see their trajectory and this is kind of why I wanted to bring you onto the board earlier rather than later because I could see you transforming nature and I could kind of see the direction I was like yeah that's that's what I want to go to you know and and yeah so I have been reflecting on so many things and I'm going to take a pause here and then try to start again I'm just going to tell you not to listen to this just in case I lose this audio\n\nOkay, yeah, so continuing the thing that I've been trying to parse is like, what is the relationship between the way that Muneer was wanting every assessment to make these levels move on the entrepreneurship scale from beginner to end in this linear sort of way, versus that being his intuition of good, total like the bar chart, what percentage of people in our programs are moving towards an exit versus my perspective of encouraging people to internalize the scriber framework and then disappearing until they need us or watching from afar and collecting stories of impact and being surprised 10 years later and making sure that it's true and it's real and it gets implemented and that it's trained well and that it's actually helping, but it's about respect as well.\n\nAnd this is like upside down pyramid is really like some of these other values that don't sound fun, like humility, respect, you know, the things that your dad might say, those are the things that I feel are, sorry, I don't mean your dad, I mean, you know, like not so fun and love, humor, joy stuff, which is also important but like, I do think that the thing that might be different is this respecting people, because they contain a flame that is worth lighting and to watch and to be in witness and in awe, and to be in the uncertainty of what that person will do.\n\nAnd of course, to help them guide, help them learn how to guide themselves connect them to new ideas and new things inspire frameworks help them expand their view of what's possible what's important, tell them value the parts of themselves that they don't value necessarily and to help them realize that that is potentially what businesses need, so that when they apply when they start their business they can say hey, I'm bringing humor and it's worth it, or hey I'm bringing humility, and it's worth it, you know, and to talk about, these are like simple ways of talking about these things and this is not really want to talk about values and we'll talk about values in a more in a richer way.\n\nBut even in this like simple way, I think the basic idea is coming across.\n\nAnd so, I feel like this, this difference might be fundamentally a difference of our perspective of what a human being is.\n\nAnd I think, I think it's clear from how I talk and do programs and design things that for me, there's something precious there, that needs to be respected trusted, and that basically the other important thing is that God, to me, isn't a once and done God, and that he didn't create the universe and step out and that we're here and it's like a mechanical, like everything clicks and clacks and kind of goes forward and the deterministic and even like quantum is like opening some weird doors for people but even then they're like yeah it doesn't have any real say for what happens in this world and even if you can figure it out, once you figure out the quantum world it's just another just weird click, click, right?\n\nIt's like okay so that was entangled in that way and we're creating quantum computers and so you can see that even this like quantification of the quantum and the practicalization of the uncertainty of that weird world is just another type of reductionistic perspective.\n\nBut in my worldview and in the listening worldview and I think a lot of tribal and native people like there is continual unfolding and new, right?\n\nAnd that new, you can, you go and I think that's why you are in awe when you see something majestic in nature, because it's the first time you've ever seen it.\n\nThe first time the baby held his foot he was in awe, I swear you could see it in his eyes.\n\nFirsts are always awful in the best of ways and so when you have humility and when you acknowledge like you trust somebody, that's the other thing, that's where love comes from too, right?\n\nLike you say hey listen so here's the framework, here's how you teach yourself like I believe in your goodness and I believe that you can figure out the qualities that you were born with that make you who you are and that you can figure out how to bring that out into the world in a beautiful way.\n\nAnd if you have the qualities of leadership and if you incline towards that way, I believe that you can form a team of a compilation of people around a beautiful vision.\n\nAnd if the vision is beautiful enough, you'll do the right thing.\n\nAnd we don't have to even use the word social enterprise, you know, we use the ability for people to recognize their own sources of beauty, their skills, and to motivate them and inspire them to act.\n\nI really feel like this is how learning works, right?\n\nYou have a thing that you direct yourself towards and this is why actually like sometimes we might not know why we're learning, right?\n\nLike when you like a person, you suddenly learn a lot about the music that they like and the backgrounds of the countries that they visited or, you know, and it's because of love, right?\n\nOne thing.\n\nAnd so the other thing is there's because in our world today, you need to eat food, you need to have a sort of stable life and structure.\n\nAnd the way that we do that today is by exchanging value for money.\n\nAnd I think the challenges and the important thing is to really kind of look at this.\n\nAnd I think this is why entrepreneurship education earlier is more valuable in my opinion.\n\nWhen people are in high school or even in college where somebody else is paying for things, they will need at some point to figure out how to answer that question.\n\nBut if they can really know who they are and be in that transforming state when they leave college, I hope that they don't have to make compromises like so many people today.\n\nSo many people today wind up going into what do you say like day trading.\n\nLiterally, I know people who were super smart, love math.\n\nThey had a talent and a skill that was divine, God given, you could even say.\n\nI can sanitize my language of the word God if you prefer, but that's one simple and for me true, we just have to define God.\n\nBut still, God given talent to do mathematics and wanted to pursue it.\n\nAnd they told me, I'm going to go to the stock floor in New York, and I'm going to work for X number of years.\n\nAnd then I'm going to get back to it.\n\nJust to pay off my student loans.\n\nAnd so these things like student loans, pressure from parents and family, these exogenous motives that aren't in AIDS corrupt the ability for someone to see clearly the question that God asked with their birth.\n\nAnd this is entrepreneurship in some way that entrepreneur is one that's like, Who am I?\n\nWhere am I here?\n\nWhat skills have I been given?\n\nBecause I really believe that fundamentally, the thing that makes life really meaningful is giving all that you can with all that you are and feeling used and useful.\n\nAnd like the blessings that are infinitely showering down on you, the fact that you have this billion person ancestry that made it possible for you to live in this moment where you can take a train from Turkey to Paris and fly to New York and taste the foods of the world and to have a family to hold your, you know, nieces or nephews hands like there's just such beauty, right?\n\nThat you've been given, we've been all given.\n\nAnd I think that there's like gratitude for sure.\n\nAnd then also like, what can you do to be a part of creating beauty and be a part of that most meaningful thing for others, right?\n\nAnd sometimes that looks like you're a researcher, because that's how you best utilize the things.\n\nAnd sometimes the things that were given to you from birth, and that you've, you know, whatever your early life experience, there's this, you know, they say that there's this moment of Elysium, right, the river, and that when you die, you're reincarnated, you come back, you have all of the world's knowledge, but then you drink the waters of Elysium, and then you're born again.\n\nAnd that's where it all ends.\n\nBut I really think that there's everyone gets shaped into this unique crystal of, you know, however your parents traumatized you and whatever society that you grew up in, the ideas that you've had and the innate inclinations that are, you know, partially biological, partially, you know, divine in origin, or just who you are, whatever that is, right?\n\nAll of that comes together before you're aware of it.\n\nAnd the waters of Elysium, in my opinion, is the last sip of mother's milk, because that usually starts coming when there's a little bit of awareness beginning to peak up, and you're there, you have arrived.\n\nAnd so that little kid, three, four, I don't know how old, that very little kid, I think has the qualities, maybe six, I don't know, but it's like this early, early childhood.\n\nAnd this is why I think maybe one thing we need to look into our programs is that Venso Shar, talking about her childhoods.\n\nAnd ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be an inventor.\n\nI've always had ideas.\n\nThis is like, this is me, I'm in my element when I'm coming up with ideas and implementing them and doing them and nerding out like totally in the zone, ignore everybody, leave me alone, I'm building stuff, you know.\n\nAnd I'm sure maybe if you look into your life, there's something like that.\n\nAnd I think like, in the Muslim tradition, it says God doesn't do anything for no reason.\n\nAnd in the chaotic system that we're talking about, that is non ambitious, that is like locally relevant, where, you know, you don't optimize for the whole at the expense of the local, right?\n\nThat's what I think you could say that some people do when they're like, okay, screw here, I'm gonna go fly to New Zealand and get a bunker, but build a business that works internationally.\n\nOkay.\n\nNo, look at yourself.\n\nLook at your surrounding.\n\nThat's what the news is.\n\nThat's where the genius is.\n\nGenius loci was what genius used to be.\n\nIt's the genius in a space.\n\nIt's not a genius.\n\nBecause the person is so cool.\n\nLook, we put them on the pedestal.\n\nIt's the combination of everything right there that makes sense.\n\nAnd in Arabic, there's this thing called adab, A-T-A-B.\n\nAnd that's when things are in the right place.\n\nAnd someone that is in right relationship is in the right place, doing the right thing, using their gifts in the right way, and interacting in a relevant way within the context that they are aware of.\n\nAnd then if we take on this deliberately developmental framework and Leo, Theo Dawson and P.I.J. and all that, you can realize that there are moments that it might not make sense for somebody to start a business that is operating on an international scale, because they don't have the mental complexity to handle it.\n\nAnd we encouraging everybody to go big or go home destroys the possibility of people being mua-dabine, M-U-A-T-A-B-E-E-N, and being in the right place, using the skills for the right thing at the right time.\n\nAnd this ambition is the problem, and this ambition is usually not coming from an innate place.\n\nYou know?\n\nOftentimes we would run programs and people would be like, \"I want to run a hair salon.\"\n\nAnd we're like, \"No, no, no.\n\nCan't you think of something scalable?\"\n\nNo, they shouldn't until that happens.\n\nThey should come up with a hair salon that serves a real need, do it uniquely, make money.\n\nMaybe it's their kids that are going to go to school and be able to have the mental complexity for the other one.\n\nOr once they satisfy their fundamental needs and they're able to settle into a routine and they start, I don't know, having evening hours for contemplating or reading, or they get exposed to different communities because they're now a business owner, then maybe, yeah.\n\nBut trying to do that early because that's what funders want, because we want to impress investors.\n\nI don't want to impress investors unless investors are investing in transformation, not in the lining of their pockets too soon.\n\nI really think investing needs to change.\n\nIt needs to have a different measure.\n\nIt's like I was talking about algebra versus calculus.\n\nYou don't just add, add, add.\n\nYou need to measure rates of change.\n\nAnd so rather than an investor looking at how fast your bank account grows and how fast it's possible to get this return, I was talking to my friend Doug.\n\nAnd I like Doug, and I think he's smart, but I think he's really dumb at the same time about this one particular thing, which is he really believes in the power.\n\nMaybe I need to change my mind about this because I kind of, I can see his point in the individual with a lot of money to do a lot of good.\n\nAnd that is the kind of thing that he wants to invest in because it creates like the aristocracy of modernity, where people can do stuff that makes no sense, like start a foundation.\n\nWe don't have divine right of kings or aristocracy or the ability to enslave people officially.\n\nWe have to create structures that we own and that create outsized value.\n\nI think it's possible to do that in a good way.\n\nAnd I think Doug is that kind of person.\n\nAnd totally, it makes sense.\n\nBut I think incentivizing the entire ecosystem towards this end.\n\nFirst of all, one problem I see in that is everyone knows that capitalism needs to change very soon, and that it needs to be restructured.\n\nAnd that pretending like we can just build the same kind of businesses without creating wealth inequality that destroys the fabric of society, that's already happening.\n\nIt's there.\n\nBillionaires are one of the most hated populations in the planet, even while their numbers keep growing.\n\nAnd I think that there is some interesting things about the adab or like the right place and the right person who is the right kind of framing and structure and individual that is able to hold that space well.\n\nAnd it might be only held well in collectives.\n\nI don't know.\n\nThis is something I'm just thinking about now, but like, I'm not sure I buy into this idea of scale, partially because of the technological element and the problems that we spoke above about expanding being beyond your reach of comprehension.\n\nAnd then partially because of the systems that satisfy human need.\n\nAnd so learning, getting back to that as the core of what's happening, happens when there's an objective, and then an individual explores, experiences, reflects along the path towards the subjective.\n\nAnd so what is the objective?\n\nAnd this is why we start with why, right?\n\nBecause once you get the right why, an objective is right for you.\n\nI think that's another thing we should add to the start with why thing needs to be right for you.\n\nIt needs to be your why, you know, not just start with why.\n\nIt's like start with your why.\n\nAnd when you get that, you will find out all the things you need to find out to go towards that objective.\n\nAnd if the objective is embarrassing to share in front of others, because it's like, well, somebody actually in my last cohort was like, I want money.\n\nAnd that's another why you have to ask a couple of levels deep.\n\nAnd of course, people want money.\n\nThey need money.\n\nWe're in a world where there's a lot of difficulty.\n\nAnd this is why partially, like, I would be open to only working with college students and under, and having that be a cap.\n\nAnd I don't think it's a horrible idea to actually describe why we need this cap.\n\nAnd initially, I wanted to like change the world by getting people to do the things.\n\nBut I realized that like, we don't know what those things are.\n\nAnd it's probably...\n\nLike, if we had started with this vision, 10 years ago, I was a youth back then, I guess it only makes sense now.\n\nBut like, if we started with this 10 years ago, the generation today would have failed the right number of failures and grown the number of times in their mental complexity and capacity, and that leadership to potentially be those scalable, high impact, change the world businesses and change their world businesses in the right way.\n\nSo I think I'm trying to come up with a better language.\n\nIt's not that I don't like scale and want scale, as I want the right people doing the things that are right for them.\n\nAnd that requires us to be more humble and to trust, rather than to know what we want to see in the world and to pay to make it happen and to promise investors and to promise funders that we will make X number of social enterprises that create Y number of impacted individuals that are pulling X number of people out of poverty and feeding the hungry and solving the climate crisis at the same time.\n\nI think like what I would rather do is measure those inputs rather than the outputs.\n\nLike, are we creating transformational experiences?\n\nDo we trust in the innate goodness of people and are they feeling committed?\n\nLike, how can we measure their commitments towards their why?\n\nAnd we ask them, is your why still, are you still on fire about your why?\n\nYeah, why or why not?\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, if you're still on fire, what are you doing about it?\n\nAre you learning?\n\nWhy or why not?\n\nOkay, if you're not learning, do you need mentorship?\n\nDo you need community?\n\nDo you know yourself?\n\nThis is where we get into the inner work stuff.\n\nAnd so it's not about scale.\n\nIt's about the right person scaling at the right time in their life being ready because, you know, you give a teenager a Ferrari and they're going to kill themselves.\n\nDon't give a teenager a Ferrari.\n\nThey shouldn't even be in the car.\n\nWe shouldn't even be encouraging them to make money in crypto to buy a Lambo, right?\n\nBut there are these kids out there.\n\nAnd I'm sure definitely if I look, I don't want to.\n\nThere's some silly kid that got rich in crypto that is dead in a Lambo.\n\nThat would be like the equivalent.\n\nThat would be the thing.\n\nMaybe that's the name of this.\n\nThis podcast or this blog post is don't put the crypto kids in the Ferrari, something like that.\n\nThat was 45 minutes.\n\nOkay, so I talked a lot.\n\nI talked a lot about a lot of things.\n\nI don't know, Dada, if I missed anything from what I shared with you.\n\nBut I will.\n\nYeah, transcribe this and cluster the concepts with AI and then follow the inspire framework, by the way, it's inspiring.\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nIt's like evolving and I'm getting deeper and deeper as I look into it and realizing that, yeah, we're really like getting back to the fundamentals of research.\n\nThis is another thing of humility.\n\nIt's like, don't make things up yourself.\n\nRealize that you're aligning along a movement and that you're a tiny part of a wave peeking your head up and realizing that you're an individual and a bigger thing.\n\nAnd this is why it's not about us scaling and taking over the world.\n\nImagine a tsunami.\n\nWe shouldn't be a tsunami.\n\nWe should be a wave that goes forth, nourishes the shore, leaves space for the crabs and draws back out when the tide goes and then somebody else is going to come in our place and we're a part of this way.\n\nAnd we'll come back to, you know, maybe next year, maybe next program.\n\nWho knows?\n\nMaybe we do need to take this break.\n\nBut I really think that, yeah, like these intuitions about humility, about trusting others, about being a part of a movement that's already happening.\n\nInstead of like Cree using our platform or us integrating with Cree or whatever, like, actually it's okay for there to be diversity.\n\nThat is the world that is most beautiful is the one where you see two birds that are almost the same, but they're different.\n\nEach of them has their unique qualities and you love it.\n\nRight?\n\nAnd there's a lot of people and there's a lot of growing up to do as humanity.\n\nAnd I think we can be a part of that if we're humble, if we respect the soul, and if we truly believe in the fundamental goodness of people and their ability to sacrifice, actually, if you think about it, to work on change is to work on a mini death.\n\nIt's like a very Jesus moment, right?\n\nIt's like, who do you need to become?\n\nAnd then when you do that, you know, the process of that, you're nailing yourselves to the cross.\n\nYou know, this is super, figured it might as well, like, you know, if I'm going to go all Muslim style, I should get some Jesus style up in here too.\n\nYou know, I consider to be a Muslim and a very fitly, natural oriented person.\n\nBut anyway, that's just my perspective.\n\nOkay, I'm going to go work on something else now.\n\nAnd I'll let this simmer in my mind.\n\nAnd I'll listen to something else.\n\nAnd thank you for the call.\n\nThank you for money or for actually bringing up the idea of you being a co founder.\n\nI think that's really promising.\n\nAnd yeah, I should not ignore his messages.\n\nI'm just kind of like, you know, like, that's the point where I just don't want, I don't want to look and don't want to talk.\n\nAnd like when we had that call, and he was trying to do that alignment, I was like, Oh, no, yeah, this is not my place.\n\nThis is not for me.\n\nBut yeah, I think if you're right that he's changing.\n\nAnd if you're right that he thinks differently, and he wants to go slower.\n\nThat's another thing I wanted to remember to tell myself go slower, raising enough money so that we can actually do the things that are right, rather than the things that are fast, because we think we can leverage that to do something else, right?\n\nI'm actually thinking about taking all of my savings from crypto, which I never touched because I'm like a 1520 30 year crypto person, and whatever it is right now, taking it out.\n\nAnd just like investing in me and more working on the badges, I thought that could be a cool thing.\n\nPay for an apartment, you know, for him to visit once a month, and I can only work with him in person.\n\nSo I would pay for that.\n\nOr to explore like working with the boy or something else and just give myself space, right.\n\nAnd to, I already paid an advanced rent to Josephine for like four months, because I don't want to worry about it.\n\nI want to be able to think and be free and to plan and to do, and to learn about myself and how I like to work and what's what is actually my role here in this world.\n\nAnd obviously a big part of it is talking.\n\nI hope that this isn't like arrogance or just too foul.\n\nAnd I hope that it's inspired because sometimes I do feel inspired.\n\nI feel like where the hell is this coming from?\n\nYou know, you could literally give me a microphone and a topic and I would I could go on for an hour.\n\nBut anything, I think, you know, because I would connect it to something else.\n\nAnd I see within myself and I'm learning as I'm speaking.\n\nIt's the craziest thing.\n\nI feel like this kind of trust in the Socratic method and the ability to discover something beautiful and unique in others rather than try to get them to conform to a scale.\n\nEven though right now, I think we can do both.\n\nWe can build the bridge and the glue is chagipiti.\n\nAnd I realized that what chagipiti has is all of the past, but not the continual present unfolding that is within me right now.\n\nAnd the less I go, the less I'm going to describe this phrase, these languages, these thoughts, the deeper I go and the less contrived and the less sort of stuck on the past I am and coming from a moment of like deep stillness.\n\nI'm not orthogonally positioned to the rest of the vector spaces.\n\nAnd that is the gold of the future.\n\nAnd that is what we're trying to help the teams discover as their unique voice.\n\nAnd that is the right thing for them to say right now, not the right thing that an investor wants to hear because of the past.\n\nLet's leverage these large language models to bridge the qualitative and the quantitative by reducing the number of qualitative decisions and increasing the number of human interaction moments.\n\nAnd that measure, like quality human moments of human interaction.\n\nQ-M-O-H-I.\n\nYeah, if you get it for a week, get their daily bread.\n\nYou only get your daily bread when you have a quality moment of human interaction.\n\nAnd you can get to that after you've exhausted your capacity to be surfing your growth edge.\n\nAnd the state of flow for a person who has identified their why, they know themselves, they understand the motives that might be exogenous or external.\n\nAnd they are in a developmental path where they realize this.\n\nAnd maybe that could be the next badge system.\n\nInstead of us trying to guess developmentally where people are, are they in a socialized state of mind?\n\nOr are they self-transforming?\n\nOr where on the scale are they able to hold a complex system and work on it because they have the mental flexibility to do that?\n\nOr should they be more in a tribal situation where they understand all their neighbors and they're going to sell them the boulangerie or get the coiffel?\n\nIf we tell people that this is an important element and also tell people about maybe stories of the failure points where successful people realize they had failed themselves because they didn't become, they followed a trend or something like that.\n\nAnd then also the money question is really big.\n\nAnd so either, this is why I always wanted to try to turn our programs into cooperatives where if anybody was successful there is a baseline salary when you come into the program.\n\nI know people think like an American would be like, that's not great.\n\nThat's not going to incentivize them to work hard and suffer.\n\nWell, that's because we're changing the incentives mechanism.\n\nAnd if people aren't incentivized by their why and they're not on fire, that should be the other thing that we're measuring.\n\nIf they're not inspired by that enough to kill themselves or whatever.\n\n\nIf they're not inspired enough, not to kill themselves, I really should not have said that, but like if they're not inspired enough to like push and in a balanced way, realize, well first of all, if they're not inspired enough by what they're doing, it won't motivate them to act.\n\nBut also, that inspiration sits in the same chest, in the same way as love of your children.\n\nAnd this is where \"work-life balance\" comes from, because it's not opposites that you're comparing, it's not you're looking at your children and thinking they're going to starve because you have to hustle to bring home the bacon.\n\nIt's, \"I will die if I don't feed my inspiration.\n\nThis is how meaning is coming into my life and how I can smile honestly and show my child what it means to be human, right?\n\nAnd I need to make time for my family.\"\n\nAnd that light, they're both light.\n\nYou can hold this in your heart at the same time.\n\nI don't think you can hold your baby and stress about your boss firing you at the same time in the same kind of way.\n\nThey're different.\n\nAnd so I think there's a really important element of finances that we need to bring into our programs to relieve the stress, increase the duration, because, and to change it all, really.\n\nThis is the transforming nature that needs to happen.\n\nPeople are talking about new forms of work, and people are trying to bring in more education into classrooms.\n\nAnd I really wonder if we look.\n\nThere's certainly some people that can change, right?\n\nThere's certainly people that have an innate inclination in their childhood towards something, but they're not exposed to something different in their adult life.\n\nAnd it might totally invigorate and inspire, and then they might just fall down, like, \"Oh my God, I should have been a Tibetan Buddhist, and I'm going to move to Tibet and become a follower of the Dalai Lama, and that's it.\"\n\nI met people, literally people that are like that, and her name is, it doesn't matter, she's great.\n\nAnd it might be a complete surprise.\n\nAnd so that is one of the questions.\n\nThe other things about first principles, in terms of talking about the foundation of things, we need to get also the first principles of things.\n\nAnd so some of my first principles are, I believe that humans are good.\n\nThere's goodness that wants to come through humans.\n\nAnd this partially comes from two things.\n\nOne is rational, and the other is emotional, spiritual belief.\n\nThe rational one is, if I didn't believe that most people that don't have a potential psychological problem, mental disability, tumor in their brain that suppresses their compassion, most people are fundamentally, they have goodness that wants to flow through them.\n\nAnd if that wasn't true, if that wasn't true, I would kill myself.\n\nThis is in the reductionist, \"I don't believe in God\" world, okay?\n\nBecause I wouldn't want to be in a world like that, where I had to look over my back and not trust anybody and think that everyone's a potential sociopath, and it would be exhausting and difficult, and not actually the experience that I have in reality.\n\nThe reality is, if people aren't traumatized, hurt, or suffering, the vast majority of them want to be friendly and kind and generous, and a few might, no matter what happens, have these negative traits.\n\nAnd also, most people aren't living in a peaceful world, where everything's okay.\n\nPeople are hurt by their families, they're hurt by society, they're hurt by many things that create contortions that cause people to behave in ways against themselves.\n\nBut like I said in the beginning of this giant monologue, that there's a good part of us that wants to come forth.\n\nSo that's like one of the foundational beliefs.\n\nAnother foundational belief is that I don't know, is that it's better to go up into the system of transformation and generation, than into the systems of creation and concretization, of measurement.\n\nIt's better to measure the things that are about human interaction and the uncertainty of the conversation that will manifest in the now and in the presence, and to reduce the investment in measuring the past, the done deal, the money in the bank, especially because that's all dead.\n\nThis is a life.\n\nAnd sure, money in the bank is important, but what if we started measuring the other thing?\n\nI think we would change capitalism in a way.\n\nWe would actually talk more about, like imagine if the measurement was family conversations over dinner.\n\nDinner would have to be there, right?\n\nSo the farmer has the farm, and all that.\n\nBut if the farmer is stressing themselves out and overexerting and trying to get the combine, and it's working all day and all night, and then it's getting robots, whatever, and then the farmer doesn't have a job anymore, so he's on the streets and he's begging, then we're not having family conversation, quality family conversations over dinner.\n\nAnd another important element here is quality.\n\nHow are we going to measure that?\n\nAre we going to use an AI?\n\nIs this a good conversation?\n\nOr are we going to try to ask people how they feel?\n\nWhat was meaningful about it?\n\nThis will be able to expose the values.\n\nAnd then, if these are the things that we measure, these are the types of businesses that are approaching those measurements are going to be the ones that are meaningful for everybody.\n\nAnd then it's sort of like holding those two lights in your chest.\n\nIt's not my children or my inspiration.\n\nIt's not me winning in my business or you winning in yours.\n\nIt's like there's some values that are important that fundamentally are like need to have a common humanity where people are respected and they're able to pursue meaning and have lives with fundamental human rights of food and water and all of this stuff, right?\n\nLike if that is the baseline and we measure our business accordingly by finding the things that we find most meaningful, that's your why, actually.\n\nThis is why, actually, here, this is an interesting part.\n\nThis is how we can transform the start with why.\n\nWe need to start asking people for meaningful moments and do Joe Edelman's process of values articulation.\n\nWhen they can articulate their values, they articulate both their why but also potentially the thing that they want to measure and see happen or at least like a proxy for it.\n\nSo for instance, let me think about like, and you start with, emotions are, values articulation by finding an emotion.\n\nAnd so, yeah, so for me, oh my goodness, well, a lot of my emotions these days are about faith and trust and commitments to a spiritual tradition because I struggled a lot with that in my younger years.\n\nAnd, you know, the right way to do it would be to go deep into the story but I'm already like an hour plus into this conversation.\n\nSo for me, I have found myself committing and walking a path based on an inner sight and knowing that is real and as real as seeing with my eyes because there's trial and confirmation, you know, like you see with your eyes, something looks like a step and you can step on it and it'll hold you up and it's great.\n\nIt's real, you've confirmed.\n\nSimilarly, I see something that looks like a step with my heart.\n\nAnd it says, it's like, there's promises, like, for instance, in the tradition it says, you will not give charity and be impoverished.\n\nAnd so, you step on that step with faith and confidence and you see if it holds you up.\n\nAnd, alhamdulillah, like I have had in the last weeks and months more and more confirmation that there's a glass bridge.\n\nAnd I realize, like, for me, this glass bridge is real and it elevates people.\n\nQuite like in my imagination, literally, you see these people and they are of good character and they're flying high and they're in the sky and they yell down and they say, I'm not flying, it's a glass bridge.\n\nI'm just walking on a glass bridge, bro.\n\nAnd then, you're at the edge of this thing and you can't see it, but you stub it with your toe and you're like, oh shoot, there's something here.\n\nWhat the heck is this?\n\nAnd you follow your inspiration and you try to see with the eye of your heart and you start trepidation walking.\n\nImagine, you can't see anything at all and it looks like you're in the sky and you're stepping one foot after another.\n\nAt any moment, you lose faith, you feel like you can fall down a thousand feet, but you're walking and the more you walk, the more confidence you gain in the reality of this unseen thing that people think you're crazy about.\n\nBut it's just glass, it's just transparent.\n\nAnd it's like, you know, you know how there's some things that are transparent to different wavelengths, but opaque to others?\n\nIt's transparent to the eyes that are in your head that are all thinking, but it's real and solid to the eye of the heart.\n\nAnd it will allow you to do things that will make me, allow me to do things that make me proud of myself and go through difficulty gracefully and understand things differently and cause that understanding to become a kind of a unique life that is, for me, really beautiful.\n\nAnd I think the thing, again, I'm just going to come back to it, is like this idea of surprise.\n\nAnd awe and humility and all of that, and how it connects to this moment of amazement and being like, \"Oh my God, is the soul real?\n\nAre we not just meat machines?\n\nOh my God, this is real.\n\nI'm on this bridge.\n\nI think I believe this.\"\n\nAnd so for me, realizing that I believe this, and so much of my inspiration also comes from the Muslim tradition.\n\nLike you can see in our old table, there's like the 99 names of God.\n\nAnd I was trying to align them to the via, because I really believe in this values, articulation, and parallel, and creation, and that the one God revealed only one religion to the whole world, to align them with their most natural state.\n\nAnd it's just us who can get confused and get lost.\n\nAnd because we're overly complicated brains, we think, you know, to be safe I need to hoard money, or to be safe I need to push other people down.\n\nAnd it's fear and it's confusion that creates all of this stuff.\n\nAnd when you live according to your values and trust and vision and beauty and wonder, first of all, it's true you might die.\n\nPeople in Al-Qaza, they believe and they die.\n\nBut you see also, they die with dignity, and they die happy, and they die consented with God.\n\nAngry with the people, of course, but I do not see, and I have not heard so many people talking to their dead children, asking them to send their regards to the Prophet.\n\nThat's surprising.\n\nI think it's surprising the world.\n\nAnd that's beautiful and that's amazing.\n\nAnd I think that when I start really realizing, \"Whoa, this is crazy.\n\nI can't believe, I believe in God.\"\n\nOne second.\n\nI'm going to talk with Josephine.\n\nSo this is the end of this, but I think this is where I'm at right now.\n\nIt's about surprise, awe, wonder and amazement, and how that results in the frameworks and the beauty and the way that we do our programs and why I measure different things and values and how they're all connected to summarize this.\n\nThank you, A.I.\n\nThank you, Dara.\n\nYou want to say hi to Dara real quick?\n\nHi, bye.\n\nHi, Dara.\n\nDara.\n\nDara, Dara.\n\nNo, sorry.\n\nHi, Dara.\n\nWhatever Biral said, it's a long message already.\n\nYou're used to it, but...\n\nYou had a good call?\n\nI had an amazing call.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'll talk to her about her amazing call, and I'll talk to you soon.\n\nOh, it's perfect.\n\nIt's exactly noon.\n\nAnd Suly really likes your...\n\nOh my God, yeah.\n\nWe need to give it a name, actually.\n\nDoodoo is not, you know...\n\nDoodoo?\n\nDoodoo number...\n\nDara...\n\nDara...\n\nDaru?\n\nDuru, Dara?\n\nI think Doodoo is already good.\n\nYeah, Doodoo.\n\nDoodoo, vajoub.\n\nYeah, mais.\n\nSalaam.\n\n"

      "content": " Dear [Cofounder],\n\nIn our work, we often talk about the importance of measuring progress and tracking tasks on our taskboard. While I agree that these tools are necessary for organization and accountability, I believe that the true essence of our mission lies in the transformative moments of presence and \"AHA\" that occur during our live facilitations.\n\nWhen we are fully engaged in the present moment, we create a space for our participants to connect with their own presence and access a deeper level of understanding and self-discovery. These \"AHA\" moments are the sparks that ignite real transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard. It's like in our systems that we're designing, there's a thing between, you know, creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper, and they're taking an assessment, or, you know, on the phone or whatever, and they have an aha moment, and they make a commitment in front of a colleague or in front of their mentor or in front of one of their peer peers from the program, and then they're like, \"Yeah, I took this assessment. It made me realize this, and I'm gonna do this from now on.\" And I've decided to change them.\n\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound breakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their eyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of insight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this work in the first place. And really, you know, like whatever it is, those moments of commitments, those moments of being witnessed, of togetherness, that's a great use of technology, right? And in terms of impact, let's count it by seconds, right? The rest of their life, the seconds are now in our impact bank, right? You can count that, especially if they have been true to their promise, if it was a deep enough moment.\n\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater sense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task managers. By prioritizing these moments of \"AHA\" and presence in our work, we honor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact of our mission.\n\nI understand that measurable progress is important, and I'm not suggesting we abandon our taskboards altogether. However, I believe that we need to find a balance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work. It's that moment right then and there with him, and it's present, and it's true, and it's real. And when you witness that, it's different than a recording. And I feel like we need to acknowledge that and look at our recordings, all of them. Which ones has ever helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody? And one is scalable, one we can like put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand people, and the other, you kind of have to have been there. And there's a thing about that - the moment, and the presence, and the reality of it. That, I think, is also a part of what I'm getting at.\n\nI invite you to consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can create a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work and the life-changing potential of our live facilitations. Together, we can find a way to measure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"AHA\" moments.\n\nWith gratitude and respect,\n[Your Name]",

By prioritizing these moments of \"AHA\" and presence in our work, we honor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact of our mission.\n\nI understand that measurable progress is important, and I'm not suggesting we abandon our taskboards altogether. However, I believe that we need to find a balance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work. It's that moment right then and there with him, and it's present, and it's true, and it's real. And when you witness that, it's different than a recording. And I feel like we need to acknowledge that and look at our recordings, all of them. Which ones has ever helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody? And one is scalable, one we can like put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand people, and the other, you kind of have to have been there. And there's a thing about that - the moment, and the presence, and the reality of it. That, I think, is also a part of what I'm getting at.\n\nI invite you to consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can create a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work and the life-changing potential of our live facilitations. Together, we can find a way to measure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"AHA\" moments.\n\nWith gratitude and respect,\n[Your Name]",

As a professional editor, my goal would be to transform the stream of consciousness document into a well-structured, philosophically sound argument with clear and concise language. Here are the steps I would take, along with my reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Read through the entire document to understand the main ideas and themes.\nReasoning: Before making any changes, it's essential to grasp the overall message and identify the key points the author wants to convey. This will help ensure that the editing process enhances the original intent rather than detracting from it.\n\nStep 2: Identify and cluster related concepts and ideas.\nReasoning: In a stream of consciousness document, ideas may be scattered throughout the text. By grouping related concepts together, we can create a more coherent and logical flow of information. This will make it easier for readers to follow the argument and understand the connections between different points.\n\nStep 3: Create an outline to organize the content.\nReasoning: An outline serves as a roadmap for the essay, ensuring that the argument progresses logically from one point to the next. It helps to identify any gaps in the reasoning or areas that need further development. The outline should include an introduction, main body paragraphs, and a conclusion.\n\nStep 4: Refine the language and syntax.\nReasoning: Clear and concise language is crucial for effectively communicating ideas. By refining the syntax, we can improve the readability and impact of the argument. This may involve breaking down long, complex sentences into shorter, more manageable ones, eliminating redundancies, and ensuring that each sentence contributes to the overall point being made.\n\nStep 5: Develop the philosophical argument.\nReasoning: To create a philosophically sound argument, we need to ensure that the claims made are well-supported by evidence and reasoning. This may involve adding relevant examples, counterarguments, or thought experiments to strengthen the author's position. We should also check for logical consistency and address any potential objections or counterarguments.\n\nStep 6: Ensure a clear introduction and conclusion.\nReasoning: The introduction should provide a clear roadmap for the essay, outlining the main points to be discussed and engaging the reader's interest. The conclusion should summarize the key arguments and insights, leaving the reader with a strong understanding of the author's perspective and its implications.\n\nStep 7: Proofread and edit for grammar, spelling, and punctuation.\nReasoning: Errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation can distract from the content and undermine the credibility of the argument. By carefully proofreading the document, we can ensure that the final product is polished and professional.\n\nStep 8: Review the edited document for coherence and clarity.\nReasoning: After completing the editing process, it's important to review the document as a whole to ensure that the argument flows smoothly and that the main points are clearly communicated. This final review can help identify any remaining areas that need clarification or refinement.\n\nStep 9: Collaborate with the author to finalize the document.\nReasoning: Ultimately, the edited document should reflect the author's voice and intentions. By working closely with the author to incorporate their feedback and address any concerns, we can create a final product that effectively conveys their ideas while benefiting from the clarity and structure provided by the editing process.\n\nBy following these steps, we can transform the stream of consciousness document into a well-structured, philosophically sound argument that effectively communicates the author's ideas to their colleague.

This I believe\naddresses the problem of entangling ourselves with the participants decisions and\nbreaking the hting we’re trying to build: entrepreneurial self efficacy driven by a\nsincere values exploration and a rigorous understanding of self and world. (at\nleast that’s what I think we’re trying to go towards).\nI do not believe we will change the world. I do not believe I know what a better\nchanged world is for everyone in all places. I believe the world is complex and the\nbetter approach is to teach people how to learn, to find the others, build their\nentrepreneurial self efficacy, to give them inspiration, and support, and coaching and\nmentorship and to trust their decisions. Start with Why till we get to the Why that\ntouches the “Why me” Why was I born… was I born to do this? This is why this essay\ngets theological. I believe our fundamental differences starts with the difference in\nperspective we have on what is the human and what is the universe.\nOnce we align on these principles I believe we will align on measures and what to\nbuild.\nQuesitons: taskboard or not?\n\nShould we align all assessments with a linear progress bar going from “no business,\nand endinging with “sellable profitable business” and have the ultimate measure of\nour success be moving digitally click click clack up the ladder till we move x million\nof entrepreneurs x degrees towards their “success”\nOr is success independently chosen? Is it possible we can lead people to stress and\npotential financial ruin and potential visions of suicide?\nWhat is wellbeing and how does it relate to the concept of self? Human being or\nhuman doing?\nBear with me as this essay is a work in progress and not fully baked.\nMy ultimate goal is to conclude with this:\nFrist principles\nWhich results in these things to do and build at Bloom\nWhich have x,y,z as success measures that we will hold ourselves accountable to.\nWhile I believe you are likely to agree with many of the conclusions, the fact that I do\nnot know your answer to so many fundamental questions concerns me, we really\nshould have gone to ceremony more often ;D!\nHere are some ideas from our internal documentation and discussion:\n- BG Reflection on Foundational\nApr 6, 2024\nPrinciples Which Result in Differences in\nProgram Design and Measurement:\n- BG+DMN Whatsapp Convo\nApr 2, 2024\n\n1. As for VIA … nice points. I like it. As for the spiritual traditions … also interesting.\nWhere does the number 124,000 prophets come from? Curious to learn more about\nthat …\nHadith:\nIt was narrated that Abu Dharr said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, how many Prophets were\nthere? He said: “One hundred and twenty four thousand.” I said: O Messenger of Allah, how\nmany of them were Messengers? He said: “Three hundred and thirteen, a good number.” I\nsaid: O Messenger of Allah, who was the first of them? He said: “Adam.” …\nNarrated by Ibn Hibbaan, 361\nAlso … I’d be curious what most Muslims think about that. \n🙂\nMuslims believe that everyone is born muslim* always until their parents make them\nseomthing else. And that all prophets were “Muslim” meaing they do not follow the\nreligion of the end of time that we call islam. They were actually “muslim” in that\nthey submit to the will of God, which is the job of a human, to put aside their\nwounds, hurts, fears, and to submit to the reality of the creator of All being the Most\nMerciful. So how can we submit and enact our little part of that total mercy on earth\nis the question all prophets came down with and you’ll see the structure about how\nthat comes about below. I really apologize if this is all messy, you’ll see why I’m\nexplaining this religious stuff in such detail once you get through this part.\n* We realize we were muslim … why call muslims who were atheist or another faith\n“reverts” because it was their society conditions them so and then when they\nbecome muslim they “revert”. It’s like pressing control alt delete and rebooting the\nsystem to the original settings. This is something of preference as you can see from\nthe discussion here: A Convert or a Revert? How It Does Matter\nThis “everyone” is born muslim till their culture shifts them from the innate Fitra(very\nimportant concept) It means thenatural way, like all things are already in submission\nto God. fitra (comes from the word for mushroom by the way)\nOh it might be interesting to note that all things in Natural are submitting and in\nconstant worship all the time, so you can consider your cat, the evergreen tree you’re\nhugging to be a “muslim” in that regard. This is also orthodox belief. Also it’s believed\nthat prophets and saints could hear their constant praising.\nIt’s in the Quran directly and very explicitly:\n\nSurah Al-Isra - 1-111 - Quran.com says All things in the universe are in worship and\npraise, yet it’s only us who cannot understand.\nSome prophets could, for instance baby Suli is named after Solomon who laughed\nbecause he heard an ant who talked to her “people” saying you should rush into your\nnests for Suleiman might accidentally step on you. Which is insightful because in the\nquran it implies that the ant community understand cause and effect, and\nunderstand “accidentally” which is intent. Muslims believe (and must believe) that\neven ants have intent.\n\nSo not only does every human community get a messenger, and not only is everyone\non earth born human born on the innate natural state (note this is important for later\nwhen we get to Goodness, and unlocking human potential), all animals are already\n“Muslim” and not just that, they talk and have communities. This is directly from the\nQuran Surah Al-An'am - 38 - Quran.com\nThis is foundational orthodox belief across Sunni’s and Shia and any sect you can\nconsider since it’s foundational and in the Quran.\n\nThe foundation of the muslim tradition is sort of like an “upsidedown pyramid”\n(hohoho) and it has three layers that take you from basic action, to belief, to spiritual\ninsight and faith.\nFor me it’ simportant because it’s the process of submission of your will (physical, this\nis islam/prayer/fasting/etc follow in this regard) and then belief, in the quran it says\nthat animals have communities, do we have faith in that? Shouldn’t that be\nverifiable? Wellllllll\nGuess what? Using AI to Decode Animal Communication with Aza Raskin\n(youtube.com) Haha!\nI met this guy at the onBeing conference and he’s a long time friend of Joe Edelman,\nand currently closer to Tristan Hariss who was also at the OnBeing conf.\nOk, so now that we have this foundational information, that everything is in\nsubmission to God it’s important to note something about this God. First of all, what\ndo we know about God - well one thing is should we start with the Quran? What if\nwe aren’t there yet in terms of our ability to accept that content as foundational?\nWell for me I see my baby, when there’s no harm or hurt, the world is beautiful and\nfull of laughter and love.\nMany people find solace and healing in natural environments, especially those that\nare the most untouched by human hands.\nThe natural world is in a perfect equilibrium and harmony and when disequilibrium\nhappens (forest fire) things adapt and return, everything is in it’s right place\nThis idea of “right place” is called adab.\nGod is the origin of all things, and thus if there is anything in the world that is ugly it\nis due to the imbalance, as one knows beauty when one sees it and often beauty has\nelements of balance and proportionality, perfection, elegance harmony, rain, growth,\ndeath, refresh, rebirth, these things are the natural fitri way. Seeking unlimited life, or\nunlimited wealth, or unlimited power puts things into disarray because it breaks the\n\nscales of balance. Lions don’t have refrigerators, this is why they wont kill ALL the\ndeer in one night. We do, we have fridges full of food that goes bad while neighbors\ngo hungry because we are not in balance and trust.\nThe prophet (S) tells us, in language very similar to his “brother in preaching the\ntradition of Submission (wuwei):\n‘If you were to rely upon Allah with the reliance He is due, you would be given provision like the\nbirds: They go out hungry in the morning and come back with full bellies in the evening.”\nSunan Ibn Majah 4164 - Zuhd - \nبﺎﺗﻛدھزﻟا \n- Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of\nProphet Muhammad ( \nﻰﻠﺻﷲﮫﯾﻠﻋومﻠﺳ \n)\nThe difficult thing is that this requires so much faith, it’s said that the Prophet rarely\nslept with a dinar in his house over night before giving it away in charity, knowing\nthat provisions will come the day they’re needed and due. That’s faith.\nThe beautiful balance we are describing is the thing that humanity can align\nthemselves with. Adab, doing the right things or putting things in their rightful\nplaces is how we return things to balance, which God commands us to do in the\nChapter of Mercy:\n\nSurah Ar-Rahman - 1-78 - Quran.com\nWhy is the fact that this is in the Chapter of mercy so important? Well since God is\nthe ultimate source of creation and uncreated and capable of all things we need to\nunderstand that over ALL things is God’s Mercy. In a way we have to accept a\nfundamental principle that of all things that happen, good/bad it is impossible to say\nGod is punishing out of anything other than a mercy because this would break this\nlogical statement:\nSurah Al-A'raf - 156 - Quran.com\n\nGod’s mercy encompasses every thing.\nAlso know:\nThe prophet’s mission was to be the recipient and teacher of the holy book, the\nverbatim uncreated word of God the Quran. (how was it uncreated, that’s a whole\ntheological discussion, haha!)\nAnyhow! So here we see THE POINT. The point is to be a mercy to all things. And in\nthe chapter of Mercy (which by the way comes from the Womb like Mercy. RHM\nraham is the womb Rahman is the Most merciful lord. It’s the most often repeated\nword in Muslim prayers it’s what we start all thigns with, bismillah al rahman al\nraheem. It’s the only “non-paired” name other than Al- Iah (Allah swt) (The God)\nGod tells us his “true” name - the one that is Truely One - just as he is. The\nfoundational principle of creation and how he relates to it is this:\nI guess they translate it to compassionate, just know it’s the word “Al Rahman” and\n\nhere it puts it in equivalency to the word God and give humans permission to call\nhim by one or the other.\nIt’s the only name of all the 99 different attributes, which includes “difficult”\nattributes like The Just, the Avenger, what most muslims believe and teach their\nchildren is this:\nSo, here we are finally the world view that Muslims have that underlies some\nimportant philosophical reasons I think of structuring our programs a certain way\nand that I think of measuring differently than you do.\n● \nThe world is created by God who is The Most Merciful and all things that\nhappen in this world happen under his power and influence and thus are all\nalso acts of Mercy (if we know it or not)\n● \nAll things are in perfect harmony (the sun and the moon, the cyclical nature of\nthe seasons, the ebb and flow of predator pray populations, etc) because they\nare in submission and trust to the most beautiful, the most merciful. Even a\nmother lion killing and eating a gazelle is doing an act of mercy for her baby\ncubs. Only when one exeedes is one out of line and “sins”. Sinning is going out\nof balance to the way of Nature. The “Fitra” the way we are naturall inclined\ntowards:\n\n○\nBabies are altruistic because they haven’t been conditioned yet\nAltruistic babies? Study shows infants are willing to give up food, help\nothers | NSF - National Science Foundation\n● \nAll things in the universe are in submission(a state of “Islam” the act, not the\nreligion as defined in the English dictionary)\n● \nSubmission leads to balance, up a bit one day, down a bit the next. Muslims\nare encouraged to close shop if they made enough money in one day “Seek\nthe extra provisions but do not rely on them. Rely on Allah. Allah has destined\nyour rizq(wealth/provisions). He is the Provider. Wealth is like a medicine. If you\ntake more than the right dose, it might be fatal. You might overdose on it.”\n● \nWhen we realize we are muslim we can then follow this path:\nIslam->Iman->Ihsan (belief and action -> belief in the unseen stuff\n(books/prophets,etc) and then finally being in witness or being a witness of the\nDivine and through this perfecting your adab/qualities.\n● \nWhen you do that you become like the created leaf with no will other than the\nwill of God, as we read in the hadith, the eyes with which God sees… Hand with\nwhich God strikes, etc. you have subsumed your will. Now that’s a high status\nand that’s what the Sufi’s and others who want to purify themselves go for.\n● \nThe important thing is to understand that we have a part of ourselves that\ndesire things more than the balance requests, 20 wives, cheating on our\npartners, a mountain of food, wealth unlimited so we can become powerful\nand … uhh… enact good because we’re smart enough to accumulate so much\nwealth we must know what is good. Here is one important difference between\nthe ways we measure and why I prefer small being beautiful. If you can assure\nme that the person is in balance at that scale, that the person is in pure\nsubmission to the will of God, then let them be wealthy beyond measure. The\nProphet Solomon was, others from the people living with the Prophet had\nwealth. Yet more often then not people who aren’t working on their hearts\ndaily will not be able to pass the “test of wealth” - most people can, and it’s\nlikely easier, be patient with poverty. Handling wealth well is harder because it\nis likely that we are not going to be in the perfect harmony and balance that is\nbeautiful.\n\nOk, we have some premises already\nHumans are fundamentally good because a Good God created everything under his\nMercy. When humans operate in a bad way, it is due to scarcity mindset, fear\n(whispered by their lower selves and the devil(yes, muslims believe in this guy too,\nyet )\nSurah Al-Baqarah - 268 - Quran.com\nExcept instead of the devil being an evil annoying thing that whispers “Killll KILLLL\nKEEEELLLL” into your ear, he makes you remember poverty and worry and fear and\nthus accumulate wealth beyond measure and wind up breaking the balance of\njustice.\nWhy is that evil? Well: Link Between Wealth and Suicide Rates (businessinsider.com)\nSo, now what?\n\nLet’s dive a bit deeper into what Islam/submission is and what it implies and how it\nsupports fearlessness to poverty and how this brings about the unlocking of honest\ngoodness and positive action for our brothers and sisters.\nAlso, we need to understand why I believe it is more\nimportant that our programs change people within than\ncreate change in the outside world.\nThe reason this is important is because of the purpose of creation. Why is all this\nhere? I believe that fundamentally we are not here to have a beautiful life where we\nall dance and party and if we could dance and party in harmoney for eternity that we\nshould design things to do that as aubrey degray and other people working on\ncuring death might lead us to want.\nWhy do you think we are here? If you could have an IV drip of MDMA along with all\nhumanity so our fear is suppressed and we can create AI systems that manipulate\nour desires to map the needs of the world (fewer babies, perhaps, more babies if the\neconomy is slumping)\nThe bottom of the pyramid is Islam, some say it has pillars, so it’s like a house with\nthese pillars\nBelief, Praying, Fasting, Charity, Pilgrimage\nTo be a Muslim takes 5 seconds, all you need to do is believe and then say that there’s\nonly one God and that he didn’t leave us alone and sent us many prophets and the\nfinal one who’s responsible for all people on earth right now is the prophet\nMuhammed.\nMuslims believe if people have had the opportunity to learn about islam(Submission)\nthen refuse it because of arrogance, or a refusal to contemplate it seriously because\nyou’re distracted by your own whims or desires and ignore the reality of death and\nethics, then you have refused. Yet lots of people suggest that God is not unjust, most\npeople today, especially on Fox news in the west the see the face of islam as a\nmurderous sect, and the image people are given is so corrupted that it turns their\nhearts away from what should be a natural and pure truth and thus they are excused\nand forgiven as well. If you believe in Oness and you have not heard of the prophet (I\nassume lots of indigenous peoples fall into this) then you are still considered a\nmuwahid and likely to be forgiven and entered into heaven as God is not unjust. If\none is given the truth in a clear and honest way, and then refuses out of arrogance or\ntaqleed(just wanna do what my family or society or my whims say) then they are\nthose who have rejected.\n\nThat’s Islam (submission), once someone says shahada declaration of faith they’re a\nmuslim and no one can say not, even if they drink and don’t pray and still don’t know\nmuch about the tradition.\nIman (faith) is essentially the next leve, if you believe in a God who doesn’t leave us\nalone and he sent messengers you grow in faith and that encompasses what you’re\nprobably curious about:\nFinally the final layer, after you submit your will realizing that God is one, and\nlearning about the fact he didn’t leave us alone and sent us many messages to teach\nus about belief, the prophets and their ethical moral stories, about the reality of what\ncomes after death, and in predestination (the patience machine). You get to Ihsan,\nwhich has cognates with words for beauty.\nIt’s described like this:\nhttps://40hadithnawawi.com/hadith/2-islam-iman-ihsan\nThen he (the man) said, \"Inform me about Ihsan.\" He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, \"It is\nthat you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet\n(know that) He sees you.\"\n\none way muslims think about\nSalafi’s focus on the outward, the practical, the focus on the house. Do these things or else.\nIslam (practices, fundamental belief to say you believe) (outward)\nIman (belief in angles, all the other prophets, life after death, predestination, etc) (inward)\nDanger, sufism beyond here. People who want to purify their hearts start focusing on the “roof”.\nThey focus on the love of God and god tells us how to love him:\nA hadith through the Prophet (S) on behalf of God (SWT) called a Hadith Qudsi (a Holy Speech):\n“\nMy servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have\nenjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with extra non-obligated acts\nof worship so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his\nseeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks.\nWere he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I\nwould surely grant him it.”\nThis letting go of oneself and become an instrument of God on Earth has a clear progression:\nIslam->Iman->Ihsan\nSo why do I explain all this? Well because I believe the fundamental inspiration behind the pedagogy\nand the work that has brought Bloom such praise and enthusiastic fans is derived from my\nunderstanding of the Human from a Muslim Perspective.\nBilal’s Axioms:\n1. People are fundamentally Good.\na. Religion or not if I didn’t believe this I would not want to be alive on this planet.\n2. Goodness is an active force and does not remain within people, babies want to smile,\nneighbors want to help each other move, lovers give massages. The reason the world isn’t\nfull of goodness is because of blockages from hurts, wounds, and wrong interpretations\nwhich cause people to horde wealth, withhold love, fear the other - and sometimes for good\nreason, although for usually cyclical reasons. The “agressor” themselves were hurt initially.\n3. My life’s mission to “unlock human potential for positive change” is to find and address those\nblocks and create the right context to help people identify that beauty and goodness within\nand remove friction for them enacting it in the world.\n\na. Helpful things here to realize is that trust, faith, fearlessness, humor, positive\ninterpretation of reality, or desperate acknowledgement that a negative interpretation\nis self referential and self destructive.\n4. Bilal’s Beliefs on the nature of Goodness and where things become religious and not simply\na rigorous philosophical framework:\na. Goodness is the nature of Reality because God is Good. Goodness in people as well\nas the creative, motive force, our sense of justice and all things that “bring us to life”\ncome when we touch the divine attributes.\nb. God has 99 most beautiful names and qualities, and inside the human those qualities\nare latent. Most people have one (signature strength) that wants to come forth\nthrough them more than others.

God, really?!? (elevation, this is what Sufi’s are known\nfor.)\n~~\n2. As for Abdallah Rothman, I want to talk to him about values-oriented\nentrepreneurship education in UAE, culture shift, values, etc … both in general, and in\nthings we can possibly do together.\n~~\n3. As for “small is beautiful” … interesting thoughts, though I think I disagree with the\nbasic premise. Writing a book, working on culture stuff, budgets in the range of\nbillions, technology, etc … I think values can be connected to many of them. I think\nthe main issue is “values” rather than “scale”. The combine was popularized by\npeople with a different value-set, profit-maximizing, not caring about people or the\nenvironment, etc …\nBG: I concede yes, for sure. a book is small and a humble approach to impact billions\n(and so it’s true, the Quran has, as has the Bible and The Way of the Tao, and the\nBaghavad Gita, etc…\nThe question I have is are we at the level of the Buddah, are we receiving divine\nrevelation? Have we let go enough to be in the right state of mental complexity and\nopen hearted and handedness to write this book? I do not believe so, if only for the\n\nfact that if we were we would do the thing we thought was 100% right with no\ncompromise without consideration for funders or budgets.\nAs for being able to fathom a billion dollars in a budget … I think that’s definitely\npossible when broken down into tangible impacts on people’s lives. $1b would give 1\nmillion underprivileged university students $1000 for their education, etc, and sure,\nthen we can go talk to a bunch of them to see how the $1000 helped, etc.\nThere are also many things that are “released” and then not controllable /\ninfluenceable … such as a book, or a technology like the combine, etc … and then\nthere are some things that are maneuverable / influenceable in an ongoing way …\nsuch as working on a tech platform where others (and we) can constantly be\nlearning, adjusting, modifying, etc to enhance the desired outputs and reduce the\nless desired. The more important aspect there is values.\nBlitzscaling, militarized drones, atomic bombs, etc were built by people with different\nvalues … and I think we actually specifically need to think about how to support more\nscalable things that have positive values, positive culture, etc … which can both be\nbigger things (movies, tech platforms, cultural movements, religious movements,\nbooks, etc) … and lots lots of smaller things that contribute to those bigger changes.\nI also like the idea of maintaining connection with the people, the participants, the\ncommunity, etc. That can also be for bigger or smaller things.\n>> BG: Interesting. I think I’d like to sit with your disagreement in a google doc and\nactually reason by principles about it\n>> DMN: Cool sounds good … and yes, good things there to think about. \n🙂 \nI think it’s\ninteresting contemplations, and I like the idea of feeling the human connection, but\nthat also that doesn’t need to all be *me* feeling it to learn from it.\nThere’s something interesting there around culture, religion, or governance systems\n… systems, systems functioning, systems change, etc.\n\nI do believe in many ways the importance of “local governance” … systems where\npeople know and feel the impact of their decisions at a closer level (closer to the\nhoe), but there are other things that are important and work better at a larger level\n(the state/region?), even larger (the country?), even larger (international / universal /\nhumanity / etc).\n~~\n4. As relates to next steps on the framework stuff … yes I love it … great progress on\nthat. And sure, would love to continue thinking about that stuff.\n~~\n5. As relates to next things for us … I think we should use the available overhead funds\nas efficiently as possible to help us move towards revenue generation. I don’t think it\nshould go to backlog for either of us at this point (I think the backlog owed to me is\nprobably now 3-4x more than owed to you … so that would consume all our current\nminimal savings, and wouldn’t help us move forwards) …\nWe put suggested focus areas for you in the OrgDev doc, bottom of page 3 / top of\npage 4.

(Bootstrap\nquestion)\n○ \nQ, DMN: is it because the library is weak?\n○ \nA, Bilal: Perhaps. Although selling white labeled versions of Bloom\nwhere we digest your learning library and make it actionable and fit in\nthe db, and also make matching assessments by reverse engineering\n(get the “portfolio/evidence, make badges, make questions that lead to\nthem) sounds like something we can make/sell right now that would be\nawesome. And the value add of credentialing and helping organizations\nmake marketing material while simultaneously providing\nportfolio/evidence-based badges sounds like a triple win where the\n‘why do we have to take assessments’ is answered with something\nvaluable for everyone.\nDMN: We need to improve our standard templates for “what’s a good library item” …\nBG: Instead of a template we can make a reviewing prompt and a script that uses it\nagainst our library to produce a report. To do this it requires 3-5 good examples, and\nsome careful design, I suggest I can do this and build it as a learning experience for\nour team. In this way, we can both have a rubric and also something that can give us\na first-pass judge of what’s wrong and a first-pass recommendation of where human\nhearts and minds need to focus.\nDMN: You want to look into that? See if you can train an AI to format content for our\nLibrary of Activities?\nBG: Absolutely, that can be my week activity. It can also be where I include aligned\nevidence for all assessments - as long as we’re there, we’re there.\n\nDraft Text by AI after transcription:\nFirst Draft:\nDear Munir,\nIn our work, we often talk about the importance of measuring progress and tracking\ntasks on our taskboard.

While I agree that these tools are necessary for organization\nand accountability, I believe that the true essence of our mission lies in the\ntransformative moments of presence and \"AHA\" that occur during our live\nfacilitations.\nWhen we are fully engaged in the present moment, we create a space for our\nparticipants to connect with their own presence and access a deeper level of\nunderstanding and self-discovery. These \"AHA\" moments are the sparks that ignite\nreal transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on\na taskboard. It's like in our systems that we're designing, there's a thing between, you\nknow, creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper,\nand they're taking an assessment, or, you know, on the phone or whatever, and they\nhave an aha moment, and they make a commitment in front of a colleague or in\nfront of their mentor or in front of one of their peers from the program, and then\nthey're like, \"Yeah, I took this assessment. It made me realize this, and I'm gonna do\nthis from now on.\" And I've decided to change them.\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound\nbreakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their\neyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of\ninsight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this\nwork in the first place. And really, you know, like whatever it is, those moments of\ncommitments, those moments of being witnessed, of togetherness, that's a great\nuse of technology, right? And in terms of impact, let's count it by seconds, right? The\nrest of their life, the seconds are now in our impact bank, right? You can count that,\nespecially if they have been true to their promise, if it was a deep enough moment.\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater\nsense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task\nmanagers. By prioritizing these moments of \"AHA\" and presence in our work, we\nhonor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact\nof our mission.\nI understand that measurable progress is important, and I'm not suggesting we\nabandon our taskboards altogether. However, I believe that we need to find a\nbalance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work.\nIt's that moment right then and there with him, and it's present, and it's true, and it's\nreal. And when you witness that, it's different than a recording. And I feel like we\nneed to acknowledge that and look at our recordings, all of them. Which ones has\never helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody? And one is\n\nscalable, one we can like put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand\npeople, and the other, you kind of have to have been there. And there's a thing about\nthat - the moment, and the presence, and the reality of it. That, I think, is also a part\nof what I'm getting at.\nI invite you to consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can\ncreate a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work\nand the life-changing potential of our live facilitations. Together, we can find a way to\nmeasure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"AHA\"\nmoments.\nWith gratitude and respect,\nBilal Ghalib\n\nFreeform thought transcript:\nAlright, I'm gonna do a really brief download because I feel like we had a great\nconversation and I am still kind of reverberating, as I say it, with what we said and so\nI'm gonna try to, before I lose it, get some thoughts out.\nSo, I think one of them was around this idea of surprise and how, because of the\nVUCA world that we've been talking about for ages, I think it's really important to be\na little bit more, \"Ah, humility is another thing that I believe is like a core value.\"\nAnd it leads me, it's like humility, you know how I was always like, \"Oh yeah, love of\nlearning is my thing.\"\nAnd then I realized that when I do love of learning, it wasn't bringing me to life and\nyou have to look deeper.\nI feel like, and the thing that probably is bugging me about the different perspective,\nisn't that it's just a different perspective, is that it's like a value of humility that is\nmissing, but the humility is what leads me to value surprise.\nAnd humility is probably because of a different belief and this is why I think\nsomething about my belief system and I'm not sure what Mounier's belief system is\nmatters and actually one of the things I'm wondering about is for me to get that\ndeep of a level.\nIt's not just your values, it's like how do those values touch your perspective?\nFor me, a lot of my thoughts actually come from the Muslim tradition, from what I\nthink is the tradition of what I called \"Qataba today.\"\nIt's like the natural, the national realness.\nAnd yeah, this idea that people have this divine spark is really core to the idea of\nlighting a fire instead of filling a pail.\n\nAnd if you think in reductionist terms that there is a brain and that there's a\nmechanical world that humans are adapted to advantageously design systems\naround them to get fat and procreate more and we are winning the world because\nwe're like that and we can do it better with better systems, we just have to get\nsmarter and figure it out versus all of us in the world need to realize that in this\ndynamic, complex, crazy system we have no idea what we're doing every time you\nput something in and so whenever you try to measure something it's basically like\nyou're stepping on a water bed and you're trying to write on it while people are\nwalking.\nAnd this is what Mounir is doing, in my opinion.\nSorry, please delete this.\nBut you get it?\nI'm not crazy, right?\nI'm not crazy in this thinking because I really think that people are trying to reduce\nthe world into something that you can comprehend.\nAnd once you can do that, you can control it so you can control the environment.\nLike I'm sure maybe Mounir would be pro-climate control in terms of putting a\nbunch of, you know, would it sulfur into the air to reflect something or something?\nI don't know, like there's people that are there, like we built it, we can rebuild it and\nit'll be better.\nBut I really think that instead of trusting a few people with a lot of resources to do\nthese big grand scale things that impact the ecosystem in such a horrible way, if you\nreally think about it, the problem with the environment comes from the fact that\nwealth is controlled by such a small fraction of the population and they have an\noutsized control because they think they know what good looks like and good looks\n\nlike businesses where, initially it was businesses where they do well and then\nbusinesses where they do well and others do well enough and then it's businesses\nwhere they do well and others do well enough and that it supports the world and the\nplanet that it's on but it's still under the control of a few people.\nAnd that's what happens to complex systems is it gets even more unpredictable\nwhen you have large outsized levers.\nAnd I think that maybe this is me and the whole vision that I have of a thousand\nflowers blooming and the super bloom is not to have like a hundred billion dollar\ncompanies in the Middle East where they can then reinvest and we have the PayPal\nmafia and they're trying to create the next generation of the hundred billion dollar\ncompanies and the Forbes 100 changes so dynamically all the time because people\nare vying for those billion dollar spots and the world changes.\nI don't think that's what I want.\nLike I think there's beauty in the small and the close and in the personal and in the\nmeaningful and in the humane and I think we have scale because we have the\ncapacity for technology but I also this is another thing I want to add to the vision is\nthat I feel like technology needs to be within arms reach.\nSo for instance, I believe it's really important that we invented the wheel.\nIt's a good invention.\nTechnology.\nAwesome.\nLove it.\nI think it's really good that we invented the hoe.\n\nEven like the thing with wheel and carriage on the calf.\nAwesome.\nIt lets us feed more people and you are still able to touch your values and see them in\naction in the world.\nYou run over a cat while you're pulling the hoe.\nYou will cry.\nYou will be more careful next time.\nToday we have combines that are like tearing up hundreds of acres in a day that are\nlike hundreds and meters, hundreds and hundreds of meters across.\nYou can't see the end when you're driving and you're probably tearing up like\nthousands of cats and you will never know.\nOkay.\nThat's just one.\nRight.\nAnd then there's like all sorts of technologies that have this kind of outsized reach\nwhere farmers are committing suicide instead of farmers becoming friends with\ntheir neighbors because they rely on each other and there's so much respect for the\nskill and the witnessing of nature and the ability for a farmer to feed you versus a\nfarmer that is destroying the earth for a short-term profit knowing that they won't be\nable to do it their whole lives to fund some Monsanto giant corporation.\nAnd this is this is this is scale.\n\nThis is where I have a problem with technology.\nThis is where it goes from okay and valuable and definitely cool and wonderful to too\nmuch.\nAnd I feel like in our systems that we're designing there's a thing between you know\ncreating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper and\nthey're taking an assessment or you know on the phone or whatever and they have\nan aha moment and they make a commitment in front of a colleague or in front of\ntheir mentor or in front of one of their peer peers from the program and then they're\nlike yeah I took this assessment let me realize this and I'm gonna do this from now\non and I've decided to change them.\nAnd really you know like whatever it is that moments of commitments that\nmoments of being witnessed of togetherness that's a great use of technology right\nand in terms of impact let's count it by seconds right the rest of their life the seconds\nare now in our impact bank right you can count that especially if they have been true\nto their promise if it was a deep enough moment people have near-death\nexperiences they're transformed for life people go visit what's his face and the power\nwithin Tony Robbins they're changed for life that happens I know I met people like\nthat and it's changed them and we can do that that's possible and Tony is slightly\nscalable he writes books he has his you know Waking the Tiger Within empowering\nthe power within or whatever it is online where he has like screens in a giant circle\naround him and people are on zoom but he's there and it's his time and it's limited\nit's that moment right then and there with him and it's present and it's true and it's\nreal and when you witness that it's different than a recording and I feel like we need\nto acknowledge that and look at our recordings all of them which ones has ever\nhelped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody and one is\nscalable one we can like put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand people\nand the other you kind of have to have been there and there's a thing about that the\nmoment and the presence and the reality of it that I think is also a part of what I'm\ngetting at in this subtle like linear versus dynamic or linear versus sfumato if you\nwant to go Italian or like lingerie versus full frontal I don't know which one to call it\nbut like this approach that I've been talking to you about and thinking about like\nwhy how I feel like I differ and I'm just gonna okay I'm using count this as the thing I\nmight even send this as a part one and tell you not to listen to it I didn't see for me\nlike recording to myself is very different than having a persona in mind and that's the\nthing that's here's another really important thing Mr.\n\nRogers when he was in doing the TV shows he said that every time he looked into\nthe camera he had a specific child in his mind he didn't just record videos he was\nrecording for someone and you can't for anything which is where your humanity\nshows up for a stand for something when you're creating a autonomous system that\ndoesn't include your human element and for me like when I came to Lebanon I tried\nto do both like I was with Munir on the scalable stuff because it's important and I also\nlove the facilitation I wanted to create like a dynamic learning experience rather than\na linear learning experience where people can do the right thing at the right time\nand actually you know Munir the way I don't know if you know how everything\nstarted but Munir was like can you run an entrepreneurship program?\nHere's our program and it was basically you know the business model canvas or\nsomething in a linear way one after another kind of boot campy or I don't know it\nwas something and I had this realization that like you know we don't have to do it\nlike this like not everyone needs the same thing from everyone else I think even Taro\nsaid this like one of the problems that they were having I was like asking people\nwhat are the problems of the programs like not everyone needs the same thing and\nso because I'm an aerator I'm like okay well how can we make it so people can do\ndifferent things at the same time and that became pitch worthy and it became\nboom and the initial framework the initial like structure was like the pitch deck it's\nlike it's the thing that gives the person the complete information as much as\npossible or at least it should you know the most important components and so if you\ndo that right you do everything well right so once you get that right that's why it's\npitch worthy it'd be worth pitching if you get that right and then it comes to the like\npersonal and interpersonal because you have to work on yourself to be able to pitch\nyou have to and so I found I thought that was like a really leverageable moment and\nI'm glad to see it still is there actually it's like the boot camp leads up to a pitch the\nsessions all of them right like it's it's there it's not moments of together in a live way\nthat the transmission of the idea happens the question happens where the realness\nof what you're doing is palpably felt and is how people make decisions right I think\nit's really important you know and is related and you can even see that the intuition\ninside of the ecosystem has adapted right of course they always say they invest in\npeople not the product they don't invest in the thing because a transforming person\nnot a transformed person I think we need to change that language it's like a\ntransforming person continuously a verb is going to be able to do things differently\nyou know they're going to be able to be quiet as Joe is in the other room doing an\ninterview for a job a transforming person you can see their trajectory and this is kind\nof why I wanted to bring you onto the board earlier rather than later because I could\nsee you transforming nature and I could kind of see the direction I was like yeah\nthat's that's what I want to go to you know and and yeah so I have been reflecting on\n\nso many things and I'm going to take a pause here and then try to start again I'm\njust going to tell you not to listen to this just in case I lose this audio\nOkay, yeah, so continuing the thing that I've been trying to parse is like, what is the\nrelationship between the way that Muneer was wanting every assessment to make\nthese levels move on the entrepreneurship scale from beginner to end in this linear\nsort of way, versus that being his intuition of good, total like the bar chart, what\npercentage of people in our programs are moving towards an exit versus my\nperspective of encouraging people to internalize the scriber framework and then\ndisappearing until they need us or watching from afar and collecting stories of\nimpact and being surprised 10 years later and making sure that it's true and it's real\nand it gets implemented and that it's trained well and that it's actually helping, but\nit's about respect as well.\nAnd this is like upside down pyramid is really like some of these other values that\ndon't sound fun, like humility, respect, you know, the things that your dad might say,\nthose are the things that I feel are, sorry, I don't mean your dad, I mean, you know,\nlike not so fun and love, humor, joy stuff, which is also important but like, I do think\nthat the thing that might be different is this respecting people, because they contain\na flame that is worth lighting and to watch and to be in witness and in awe, and to\nbe in the uncertainty of what that person will do.\nAnd of course, to help them guide, help them learn how to guide themselves\nconnect them to new ideas and new things inspire frameworks help them expand\ntheir view of what's possible what's important, tell them value the parts of\nthemselves that they don't value necessarily and to help them realize that that is\npotentially what businesses need, so that when they apply when they start their\nbusiness they can say hey, I'm bringing humor and it's worth it, or hey I'm bringing\nhumility, and it's worth it, you know, and to talk about, these are like simple ways of\ntalking about these things and this is not really want to talk about values and we'll\ntalk about values in a more in a richer way.\nBut even in this like simple way, I think the basic idea is coming across.\nAnd so, I feel like this, this difference might be fundamentally a difference of our\nperspective of what a human being is.\n\nAnd I think, I think it's clear from how I talk and do programs and design things that\nfor me, there's something precious there, that needs to be respected trusted, and\nthat basically the other important thing is that God, to me, isn't a once and done\nGod, and that he didn't create the universe and step out and that we're here and it's\nlike a mechanical, like everything clicks and clacks and kind of goes forward and the\ndeterministic and even like quantum is like opening some weird doors for people but\neven then they're like yeah it doesn't have any real say for what happens in this world\nand even if you can figure it out, once you figure out the quantum world it's just\nanother just weird click, click, right?\nIt's like okay so that was entangled in that way and we're creating quantum\ncomputers and so you can see that even this like quantification of the quantum and\nthe practicalization of the uncertainty of that weird world is just another type of\nreductionistic perspective.\nBut in my worldview and in the listening worldview and I think a lot of tribal and\nnative people like there is continual unfolding and new, right?\nAnd that new, you can, you go and I think that's why you are in awe when you see\nsomething majestic in nature, because it's the first time you've ever seen it.\nThe first time the baby held his foot he was in awe, I swear you could see it in his\neyes.\nFirsts are always awful in the best of ways and so when you have humility and when\nyou acknowledge like you trust somebody, that's the other thing, that's where love\ncomes from too, right?\nLike you say hey listen so here's the framework, here's how you teach yourself like I\nbelieve in your goodness and I believe that you can figure out the qualities that you\nwere born with that make you who you are and that you can figure out how to bring\nthat out into the world in a beautiful way.\nAnd if you have the qualities of leadership and if you incline towards that way, I\nbelieve that you can form a team of a compilation of people around a beautiful\nvision.\n\nAnd if the vision is beautiful enough, you'll do the right thing.\nAnd we don't have to even use the word social enterprise, you know, we use the\nability for people to recognize their own sources of beauty, their skills, and to\nmotivate them and inspire them to act.\nI really feel like this is how learning works, right?\nYou have a thing that you direct yourself towards and this is why actually like\nsometimes we might not know why we're learning, right?\nLike when you like a person, you suddenly learn a lot about the music that they like\nand the backgrounds of the countries that they visited or, you know, and it's because\nof love, right?\nOne thing.\nAnd so the other thing is there's because in our world today, you need to eat food,\nyou need to have a sort of stable life and structure.\nAnd the way that we do that today is by exchanging value for money.\nAnd I think the challenges and the important thing is to really kind of look at this.\nAnd I think this is why entrepreneurship education earlier is more valuable in my\nopinion.\nWhen people are in high school or even in college where somebody else is paying for\nthings, they will need at some point to figure out how to answer that question.\n\nBut if they can really know who they are and be in that transforming state when they\nleave college, I hope that they don't have to make compromises like so many people\ntoday.\nSo many people today wind up going into what do you say like day trading.\nLiterally, I know people who were super smart, love math.\nThey had a talent and a skill that was divine, God given, you could even say.\nI can sanitize my language of the word God if you prefer, but that's one simple and\nfor me true, we just have to define God.\nBut still, God given talent to do mathematics and wanted to pursue it.\nAnd they told me, I'm going to go to the stock floor in New York, and I'm going to\nwork for X number of years.\nAnd then I'm going to get back to it.\nJust to pay off my student loans.\nAnd so these things like student loans, pressure from parents and family, these\nexogenous motives that aren't in AIDS corrupt the ability for someone to see clearly\nthe question that God asked with their birth.\nAnd this is entrepreneurship in some way that entrepreneur is one that's like, Who\nam I?\nWhere am I here?\nWhat skills have I been given?\n\nBecause I really believe that fundamentally, the thing that makes life really\nmeaningful is giving all that you can with all that you are and feeling used and\nuseful.\nAnd like the blessings that are infinitely showering down on you, the fact that you\nhave this billion person ancestry that made it possible for you to live in this moment\nwhere you can take a train from Turkey to Paris and fly to New York and taste the\nfoods of the world and to have a family to hold your, you know, nieces or nephews\nhands like there's just such beauty, right?\nThat you've been given, we've been all given.\nAnd I think that there's like gratitude for sure.\nAnd then also like, what can you do to be a part of creating beauty and be a part of\nthat most meaningful thing for others, right?\nAnd sometimes that looks like you're a researcher, because that's how you best\nutilize the things.\nAnd sometimes the things that were given to you from birth, and that you've, you\nknow, whatever your early life experience, there's this, you know, they say that there's\nthis moment of Elysium, right, the river, and that when you die, you're reincarnated,\nyou come back, you have all of the world's knowledge, but then you drink the waters\nof Elysium, and then you're born again.\nAnd that's where it all ends.\nBut I really think that there's everyone gets shaped into this unique crystal of, you\nknow, however your parents traumatized you and whatever society that you grew up\nin, the ideas that you've had and the innate inclinations that are, you know, partially\nbiological, partially, you know, divine in origin, or just who you are, whatever that is,\nright?\n\nAll of that comes together before you're aware of it.\nAnd the waters of Elysium, in my opinion, is the last sip of mother's milk, because\nthat usually starts coming when there's a little bit of awareness beginning to peak\nup, and you're there, you have arrived.\nAnd so that little kid, three, four, I don't know how old, that very little kid, I think has\nthe qualities, maybe six, I don't know, but it's like this early, early childhood.\nAnd this is why I think maybe one thing we need to look into our programs is that\nVenso Shar, talking about her childhoods.\nAnd ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be an inventor.\nI've always had ideas.\nThis is like, this is me, I'm in my element when I'm coming up with ideas and\nimplementing them and doing them and nerding out like totally in the zone, ignore\neverybody, leave me alone, I'm building stuff, you know.\nAnd I'm sure maybe if you look into your life, there's something like that.\nAnd I think like, in the Muslim tradition, it says God doesn't do anything for no reason.\nAnd in the chaotic system that we're talking about, that is non ambitious, that is like\nlocally relevant, where, you know, you don't optimize for the whole at the expense of\nthe local, right?\nThat's what I think you could say that some people do when they're like, okay, screw\nhere, I'm gonna go fly to New Zealand and get a bunker, but build a business that\nworks internationally.\nOkay.\n\nNo, look at yourself.\nLook at your surrounding.\nThat's what the news is.\nThat's where the genius is.\nGenius loci was what genius used to be.\nIt's the genius in a space.\nIt's not a genius.\nBecause the person is so cool.\nLook, we put them on the pedestal.\nIt's the combination of everything right there that makes sense.\nAnd in Arabic, there's this thing called adab, A-T-A-B.\nAnd that's when things are in the right place.\nAnd someone that is in right relationship is in the right place, doing the right thing,\nusing their gifts in the right way, and interacting in a relevant way within the context\nthat they are aware of.\nAnd then if we take on this deliberately developmental framework and Leo, Theo\nDawson and P.I.J. and all that, you can realize that there are moments that it might\n\nnot make sense for somebody to start a business that is operating on an\ninternational scale, because they don't have the mental complexity to handle it.\nAnd we encouraging everybody to go big or go home destroys the possibility of\npeople being mua-dabine, M-U-A-T-A-B-E-E-N, and being in the right place, using\nthe skills for the right thing at the right time.\nAnd this ambition is the problem, and this ambition is usually not coming from an\ninnate place.\nYou know?\nOftentimes we would run programs and people would be like, \"I want to run a hair\nsalon.\"\nAnd we're like, \"No, no, no.\nCan't you think of something scalable?\"\nNo, they shouldn't until that happens.\nThey should come up with a hair salon that serves a real need, do it uniquely, make\nmoney.\nMaybe it's their kids that are going to go to school and be able to have the mental\ncomplexity for the other one.\nOr once they satisfy their fundamental needs and they're able to settle into a routine\nand they start, I don't know, having evening hours for contemplating or reading, or\nthey get exposed to different communities because they're now a business owner,\nthen maybe, yeah.\n\nBut trying to do that early because that's what funders want, because we want to\nimpress investors.\nI don't want to impress investors unless investors are investing in transformation, not\nin the lining of their pockets too soon.\nI really think investing needs to change.\nIt needs to have a different measure.\nIt's like I was talking about algebra versus calculus.\nYou don't just add, add, add.\nYou need to measure rates of change.\nAnd so rather than an investor looking at how fast your bank account grows and how\nfast it's possible to get this return, I was talking to my friend Doug.\nAnd I like Doug, and I think he's smart, but I think he's really dumb at the same time\nabout this one particular thing, which is he really believes in the power.\nMaybe I need to change my mind about this because I kind of, I can see his point in\nthe individual with a lot of money to do a lot of good.\nAnd that is the kind of thing that he wants to invest in because it creates like the\naristocracy of modernity, where people can do stuff that makes no sense, like start a\nfoundation.\nWe don't have divine right of kings or aristocracy or the ability to enslave people\nofficially.\nWe have to create structures that we own and that create outsized value.\n\nI think it's possible to do that in a good way.\nAnd I think Doug is that kind of person.\nAnd totally, it makes sense.\nBut I think incentivizing the entire ecosystem towards this end.\nFirst of all, one problem I see in that is everyone knows that capitalism needs to\nchange very soon, and that it needs to be restructured.\nAnd that pretending like we can just build the same kind of businesses without\ncreating wealth inequality that destroys the fabric of society, that's already\nhappening.\nIt's there.\nBillionaires are one of the most hated populations in the planet, even while their\nnumbers keep growing.\nAnd I think that there is some interesting things about the adab or like the right\nplace and the right person who is the right kind of framing and structure and\nindividual that is able to hold that space well.\nAnd it might be only held well in collectives.\nI don't know.\nThis is something I'm just thinking about now, but like, I'm not sure I buy into this\nidea of scale, partially because of the technological element and the problems that\nwe spoke above about expanding being beyond your reach of comprehension.\n\nAnd then partially because of the systems that satisfy human need.\nAnd so learning, getting back to that as the core of what's happening, happens when\nthere's an objective, and then an individual explores, experiences, reflects along the\npath towards the subjective.\nAnd so what is the objective?\nAnd this is why we start with why, right?\nBecause once you get the right why, an objective is right for you.\nI think that's another thing we should add to the start with why thing needs to be\nright for you.\nIt needs to be your why, you know, not just start with why.\nIt's like start with your why.\nAnd when you get that, you will find out all the things you need to find out to go\ntowards that objective.\nAnd if the objective is embarrassing to share in front of others, because it's like, well,\nsomebody actually in my last cohort was like, I want money.\nAnd that's another why you have to ask a couple of levels deep.\nAnd of course, people want money.\nThey need money.\nWe're in a world where there's a lot of difficulty.\n\nAnd this is why partially, like, I would be open to only working with college students\nand under, and having that be a cap.\nAnd I don't think it's a horrible idea to actually describe why we need this cap.\nAnd initially, I wanted to like change the world by getting people to do the things.\nBut I realized that like, we don't know what those things are.\nAnd it's probably...\nLike, if we had started with this vision, 10 years ago, I was a youth back then, I guess it\nonly makes sense now.\nBut like, if we started with this 10 years ago, the generation today would have failed\nthe right number of failures and grown the number of times in their mental\ncomplexity and capacity, and that leadership to potentially be those scalable, high\nimpact, change the world businesses and change their world businesses in the right\nway.\nSo I think I'm trying to come up with a better language.\nIt's not that I don't like scale and want scale, as I want the right people doing the\nthings that are right for them.\nAnd that requires us to be more humble and to trust, rather than to know what we\nwant to see in the world and to pay to make it happen and to promise investors and\nto promise funders that we will make X number of social enterprises that create Y\nnumber of impacted individuals that are pulling X number of people out of poverty\nand feeding the hungry and solving the climate crisis at the same time.\nI think like what I would rather do is measure those inputs rather than the outputs.\n\nLike, are we creating transformational experiences?\nDo we trust in the innate goodness of people and are they feeling committed?\nLike, how can we measure their commitments towards their why?\nAnd we ask them, is your why still, are you still on fire about your why?\nYeah, why or why not?\nOkay.\nWell, if you're still on fire, what are you doing about it?\nAre you learning?\nWhy or why not?\nOkay, if you're not learning, do you need mentorship?\nDo you need community?\nDo you know yourself?\nThis is where we get into the inner work stuff.\nAnd so it's not about scale.\nIt's about the right person scaling at the right time in their life being ready because,\nyou know, you give a teenager a Ferrari and they're going to kill themselves.\n\nDon't give a teenager a Ferrari.\nThey shouldn't even be in the car.\nWe shouldn't even be encouraging them to make money in crypto to buy a Lambo,\nright?\nBut there are these kids out there.\nAnd I'm sure definitely if I look, I don't want to.\nThere's some silly kid that got rich in crypto that is dead in a Lambo.\nThat would be like the equivalent.\nThat would be the thing.\nMaybe that's the name of this.\nThis podcast or this blog post is don't put the crypto kids in the Ferrari, something\nlike that.\nThat was 45 minutes.\nOkay, so I talked a lot.\nI talked a lot about a lot of things.\nI don't know, Dada, if I missed anything from what I shared with you.\n\nBut I will.\nYeah, transcribe this and cluster the concepts with AI and then follow the inspire\nframework, by the way, it's inspiring.\nI'm so sorry.\nIt's like evolving and I'm getting deeper and deeper as I look into it and realizing that,\nyeah, we're really like getting back to the fundamentals of research.\nThis is another thing of humility.\nIt's like, don't make things up yourself.\nRealize that you're aligning along a movement and that you're a tiny part of a wave\npeeking your head up and realizing that you're an individual and a bigger thing.\nAnd this is why it's not about us scaling and taking over the world.\nImagine a tsunami.\nWe shouldn't be a tsunami.\nWe should be a wave that goes forth, nourishes the shore, leaves space for the crabs\nand draws back out when the tide goes and then somebody else is going to come in\nour place and we're a part of this way.\nAnd we'll come back to, you know, maybe next year, maybe next program.\nWho knows?\nMaybe we do need to take this break.\n\nBut I really think that, yeah, like these intuitions about humility, about trusting\nothers, about being a part of a movement that's already happening.\nInstead of like Cree using our platform or us integrating with Cree or whatever, like,\nactually it's okay for there to be diversity.\nThat is the world that is most beautiful is the one where you see two birds that are\nalmost the same, but they're different.\nEach of them has their unique qualities and you love it.\nRight?\nAnd there's a lot of people and there's a lot of growing up to do as humanity.\nAnd I think we can be a part of that if we're humble, if we respect the soul, and if we\ntruly believe in the fundamental goodness of people and their ability to sacrifice,\nactually, if you think about it, to work on change is to work on a mini death.\nIt's like a very Jesus moment, right?\nIt's like, who do you need to become?\nAnd then when you do that, you know, the process of that, you're nailing yourselves\nto the cross.\nYou know, this is super, figured it might as well, like, you know, if I'm going to go all\nMuslim style, I should get some Jesus style up in here too.\nYou know, I consider to be a Muslim and a very fitly, natural oriented person.\n\nBut anyway, that's just my perspective.\nOkay, I'm going to go work on something else now.\nAnd I'll let this simmer in my mind.\nAnd I'll listen to something else.\nAnd thank you for the call.\nThank you for money or for actually bringing up the idea of you being a co founder.\nI think that's really promising.\nAnd yeah, I should not ignore his messages.\nI'm just kind of like, you know, like, that's the point where I just don't want, I don't\nwant to look and don't want to talk.\nAnd like when we had that call, and he was trying to do that alignment, I was like,\nOh, no, yeah, this is not my place.\nThis is not for me.\nBut yeah, I think if you're right that he's changing.\nAnd if you're right that he thinks differently, and he wants to go slower.\nThat's another thing I wanted to remember to tell myself go slower, raising enough\nmoney so that we can actually do the things that are right, rather than the things\nthat are fast, because we think we can leverage that to do something else, right?\n\nI'm actually thinking about taking all of my savings from crypto, which I never\ntouched because I'm like a 1520 30 year crypto person, and whatever it is right now,\ntaking it out.\nAnd just like investing in me and more working on the badges, I thought that could\nbe a cool thing.\nPay for an apartment, you know, for him to visit once a month, and I can only work\nwith him in person.\nSo I would pay for that.\nOr to explore like working with the boy or something else and just give myself space,\nright.\nAnd to, I already paid an advanced rent to Josephine for like four months, because I\ndon't want to worry about it.\nI want to be able to think and be free and to plan and to do, and to learn about\nmyself and how I like to work and what's what is actually my role here in this world.\nAnd obviously a big part of it is talking.\nI hope that this isn't like arrogance or just too foul.\nAnd I hope that it's inspired because sometimes I do feel inspired.\nI feel like where the hell is this coming from?\nYou know, you could literally give me a microphone and a topic and I would I could\ngo on for an hour.\n\nBut anything, I think, you know, because I would connect it to something else.\nAnd I see within myself and I'm learning as I'm speaking.\nIt's the craziest thing.\nI feel like this kind of trust in the Socratic method and the ability to discover\nsomething beautiful and unique in others rather than try to get them to conform to\na scale.\nEven though right now, I think we can do both.\nWe can build the bridge and the glue is chagipiti.\nAnd I realized that what chagipiti has is all of the past, but not the continual present\nunfolding that is within me right now.\nAnd the less I go, the less I'm going to describe this phrase, these languages, these\nthoughts, the deeper I go and the less contrived and the less sort of stuck on the\npast I am and coming from a moment of like deep stillness.\nI'm not orthogonally positioned to the rest of the vector spaces.\nAnd that is the gold of the future.\nAnd that is what we're trying to help the teams discover as their unique voice.\nAnd that is the right thing for them to say right now, not the right thing that an\ninvestor wants to hear because of the past.\nLet's leverage these large language models to bridge the qualitative and the\nquantitative by reducing the number of qualitative decisions and increasing the\nnumber of human interaction moments.\n\nAnd that measure, like quality human moments of human interaction.\nQ-M-O-H-I.\nYeah, if you get it for a week, get their daily bread.\nYou only get your daily bread when you have a quality moment of human\ninteraction.\nAnd you can get to that after you've exhausted your capacity to be surfing your\ngrowth edge.\nAnd the state of flow for a person who has identified their why, they know\nthemselves, they understand the motives that might be exogenous or external.\nAnd they are in a developmental path where they realize this.\nAnd maybe that could be the next badge system.\nInstead of us trying to guess developmentally where people are, are they in a\nsocialized state of mind?\nOr are they self-transforming?\nOr where on the scale are they able to hold a complex system and work on it\nbecause they have the mental flexibility to do that?\nOr should they be more in a tribal situation where they understand all their\nneighbors and they're going to sell them the boulangerie or get the coiffel?\n\nIf we tell people that this is an important element and also tell people about maybe\nstories of the failure points where successful people realize they had failed\nthemselves because they didn't become, they followed a trend or something like\nthat.\nAnd then also the money question is really big.\nAnd so either, this is why I always wanted to try to turn our programs into\ncooperatives where if anybody was successful there is a baseline salary when you\ncome into the program.\nI know people think like an American would be like, that's not great.\nThat's not going to incentivize them to work hard and suffer.\nWell, that's because we're changing the incentives mechanism.\nAnd if people aren't incentivized by their why and they're not on fire, that should be\nthe other thing that we're measuring.\nIf they're not inspired by that enough to kill themselves or whatever.\nIf they're not inspired enough, not to kill themselves, I really should not have said\nthat, but like if they're not inspired enough to like push and in a balanced way,\nrealize, well first of all, if they're not inspired enough by what they're doing, it won't\nmotivate them to act.\nBut also, that inspiration sits in the same chest, in the same way as love of your\nchildren.\nAnd this is where \"work-life balance\" comes from, because it's not opposites that\nyou're comparing, it's not you're looking at your children and thinking they're going\nto starve because you have to hustle to bring home the bacon.\n\nIt's, \"I will die if I don't feed my inspiration.\nThis is how meaning is coming into my life and how I can smile honestly and show\nmy child what it means to be human, right?\nAnd I need to make time for my family.\"\nAnd that light, they're both light.\nYou can hold this in your heart at the same time.\nI don't think you can hold your baby and stress about your boss firing you at the\nsame time in the same kind of way.\nThey're different.\nAnd so I think there's a really important element of finances that we need to bring\ninto our programs to relieve the stress, increase the duration, because, and to change\nit all, really.\nThis is the transforming nature that needs to happen.\nPeople are talking about new forms of work, and people are trying to bring in more\neducation into classrooms.\nAnd I really wonder if we look.\nThere's certainly some people that can change, right?\nThere's certainly people that have an innate inclination in their childhood towards\nsomething, but they're not exposed to something different in their adult life.\n\nAnd it might totally invigorate and inspire, and then they might just fall down, like,\n\"Oh my God, I should have been a Tibetan Buddhist, and I'm going to move to Tibet\nand become a follower of the Dalai Lama, and that's it.\"\nI met people, literally people that are like that, and her name is, it doesn't matter,\nshe's great.\nAnd it might be a complete surprise.\nAnd so that is one of the questions.\nThe other things about first principles, in terms of talking about the foundation of\nthings, we need to get also the first principles of things.\nAnd so some of my first principles are, I believe that humans are good.\nThere's goodness that wants to come through humans.\nAnd this partially comes from two things.\nOne is rational, and the other is emotional, spiritual belief.\nThe rational one is, if I didn't believe that most people that don't have a potential\npsychological problem, mental disability, tumor in their brain that suppresses their\ncompassion, most people are fundamentally, they have goodness that wants to flow\nthrough them.\nAnd if that wasn't true, if that wasn't true, I would kill myself.\nThis is in the reductionist, \"I don't believe in God\" world, okay?\n\nBecause I wouldn't want to be in a world like that, where I had to look over my back\nand not trust anybody and think that everyone's a potential sociopath, and it would\nbe exhausting and difficult, and not actually the experience that I have in reality.\nThe reality is, if people aren't traumatized, hurt, or suffering, the vast majority of them\nwant to be friendly and kind and generous, and a few might, no matter what\nhappens, have these negative traits.\nAnd also, most people aren't living in a peaceful world, where everything's okay.\nPeople are hurt by their families, they're hurt by society, they're hurt by many things\nthat create contortions that cause people to behave in ways against themselves.\nBut like I said in the beginning of this giant monologue, that there's a good part of us\nthat wants to come forth.\nSo that's like one of the foundational beliefs.\nAnother foundational belief is that I don't know, is that it's better to go up into the\nsystem of transformation and generation, than into the systems of creation and\nconcretization, of measurement.\nIt's better to measure the things that are about human interaction and the\nuncertainty of the conversation that will manifest in the now and in the presence,\nand to reduce the investment in measuring the past, the done deal, the money in\nthe bank, especially because that's all dead.\nThis is a life.\nAnd sure, money in the bank is important, but what if we started measuring the\nother thing?\nI think we would change capitalism in a way.\n\nWe would actually talk more about, like imagine if the measurement was family\nconversations over dinner.\nDinner would have to be there, right?\nSo the farmer has the farm, and all that.\nBut if the farmer is stressing themselves out and overexerting and trying to get the\ncombine, and it's working all day and all night, and then it's getting robots, whatever,\nand then the farmer doesn't have a job anymore, so he's on the streets and he's\nbegging, then we're not having family conversation, quality family conversations over\ndinner.\nAnd another important element here is quality.\nHow are we going to measure that?\nAre we going to use an AI?\nIs this a good conversation?\nOr are we going to try to ask people how they feel?\nWhat was meaningful about it?\nThis will be able to expose the values.\nAnd then, if these are the things that we measure, these are the types of businesses\nthat are approaching those measurements are going to be the ones that are\nmeaningful for everybody.\nAnd then it's sort of like holding those two lights in your chest.\n\nIt's not my children or my inspiration.\nIt's not me winning in my business or you winning in yours.\nIt's like there's some values that are important that fundamentally are like need to\nhave a common humanity where people are respected and they're able to pursue\nmeaning and have lives with fundamental human rights of food and water and all of\nthis stuff, right?\nLike if that is the baseline and we measure our business accordingly by finding the\nthings that we find most meaningful, that's your why, actually.\nThis is why, actually, here, this is an interesting part.\nThis is how we can transform the start with why.\nWe need to start asking people for meaningful moments and do Joe Edelman's\nprocess of values articulation.\nWhen they can articulate their values, they articulate both their why but also\npotentially the thing that they want to measure and see happen or at least like a\nproxy for it.\nSo for instance, let me think about like, and you start with, emotions are, values\narticulation by finding an emotion.\nAnd so, yeah, so for me, oh my goodness, well, a lot of my emotions these days are\nabout faith and trust and commitments to a spiritual tradition because I struggled a\nlot with that in my younger years.\nAnd, you know, the right way to do it would be to go deep into the story but I'm\nalready like an hour plus into this conversation.\n\nSo for me, I have found myself committing and walking a path based on an inner\nsight and knowing that is real and as real as seeing with my eyes because there's trial\nand confirmation, you know, like you see with your eyes, something looks like a step\nand you can step on it and it'll hold you up and it's great.\nIt's real, you've confirmed.\nSimilarly, I see something that looks like a step with my heart.\nAnd it says, it's like, there's promises, like, for instance, in the tradition it says, you will\nnot give charity and be impoverished.\nAnd so, you step on that step with faith and confidence and you see if it holds you up.\nAnd, alhamdulillah, like I have had in the last weeks and months more and more\nconfirmation that there's a glass bridge.\nAnd I realize, like, for me, this glass bridge is real and it elevates people.\nQuite like in my imagination, literally, you see these people and they are of good\ncharacter and they're flying high and they're in the sky and they yell down and they\nsay, I'm not flying, it's a glass bridge.\nI'm just walking on a glass bridge, bro.\nAnd then, you're at the edge of this thing and you can't see it, but you stub it with\nyour toe and you're like, oh shoot, there's something here.\nWhat the heck is this?\nAnd you follow your inspiration and you try to see with the eye of your heart and you\nstart trepidation walking.\n\nImagine, you can't see anything at all and it looks like you're in the sky and you're\nstepping one foot after another.\nAt any moment, you lose faith, you feel like you can fall down a thousand feet, but\nyou're walking and the more you walk, the more confidence you gain in the reality of\nthis unseen thing that people think you're crazy about.\nBut it's just glass, it's just transparent.\nAnd it's like, you know, you know how there's some things that are transparent to\ndifferent wavelengths, but opaque to others?\nIt's transparent to the eyes that are in your head that are all thinking, but it's real and\nsolid to the eye of the heart.\nAnd it will allow you to do things that will make me, allow me to do things that make\nme proud of myself and go through difficulty gracefully and understand things\ndifferently and cause that understanding to become a kind of a unique life that is, for\nme, really beautiful.\nAnd I think the thing, again, I'm just going to come back to it, is like this idea of\nsurprise.\nAnd awe and humility and all of that, and how it connects to this moment of\namazement and being like, \"Oh my God, is the soul real?\nAre we not just meat machines?\nOh my God, this is real.\nI'm on this bridge.\n\nI think I believe this.\"\nAnd so for me, realizing that I believe this, and so much of my inspiration also comes\nfrom the Muslim tradition.\nLike you can see in our old table, there's like the 99 names of God.\nAnd I was trying to align them to the via, because I really believe in this values,\narticulation, and parallel, and creation, and that the one God revealed only one\nreligion to the whole world, to align them with their most natural state.\nAnd it's just us who can get confused and get lost.\nAnd because we're overly complicated brains, we think, you know, to be safe I need\nto hoard money, or to be safe I need to push other people down.\nAnd it's fear and it's confusion that creates all of this stuff.\nAnd when you live according to your values and trust and vision and beauty and\nwonder, first of all, it's true you might die.\nPeople in Al-Qaza, they believe and they die.\nBut you see also, they die with dignity, and they die happy, and they die consented\nwith God.\nAngry with the people, of course, but I do not see, and I have not heard so many\npeople talking to their dead children, asking them to send their regards to the\nProphet.\nThat's surprising.\nI think it's surprising the world.\n\nAnd that's beautiful and that's amazing.\nAnd I think that when I start really realizing, \"Whoa, this is crazy.\nI can't believe, I believe in God.\"\nOne second.\nI'm going to talk with Josephine.\nSo this is the end of this, but I think this is where I'm at right now.\nIt's about surprise, awe, wonder and amazement, and how that results in the\nframeworks and the beauty and the way that we do our programs and why I\nmeasure different things and values and how they're all connected to summarize\nthis.\nThank you, A.I.\nThank you, Dara.\nYou want to say hi to Dara real quick?\nHi, bye.\nHi, Dara.\nDara.\nDara, Dara.\n\nNo, sorry.\nHi, Dara.\nWhatever Biral said, it's a long message already.\nYou're used to it, but...\nYou had a good call?\nI had an amazing call.\nOkay.\nI'll talk to her about her amazing call, and I'll talk to you soon.\nOh, it's perfect.\nIt's exactly noon.\nAnd Suly really likes your...\nOh my God, yeah.\nWe need to give it a name, actually.\nDoodoo is not, you know...\nDoodoo?\n\nDoodoo number...\nDara...\nDara...\nDaru?\nDuru, Dara?\nI think Doodoo is already good.\nYeah, Doodoo.\nDoodoo, vajoub.\nYeah, mais.\nSalaam."

            "extracted_content": "I am working on a framework to help people implement the best of what pedagalogical sciences have to offer. I believe there is a transformation that parallels democracy that moves power from the elite to the people. It's easy to \"give people the vote\" yet it's important to let people become whole contributing members in their communities and societies and right now work oppresses people into servitude to ensure they can keep the mechanism of capital running where the owners are always owners and interest keeps them affording owning and accumulating if they use interest based money, that helped us get to an affluent society yet the mechanism that boot strapped that approach is now self destructive. Like a mushroom myceliates the tree until it's done and then it needs to burst forth - we need to do that. I believe that education and social support that emerge from real relationship between people of different economic status is key. Imagine if someone had a great idea and their friend was wealthy and could invest. The idea would have to be great and they'd have to be able to implement it. Now the issue is that people in marginalized spaces don't have access. It turns out one of the greatest predictor of longterm life success is the number of words you're exposed to, exposure is the greatest predictor. Because you see how other people have done things, books bring you alternative worlds, you know yourself as you \"travel\" outside through experienes, mentors can give some semblance of that vicariously. I believe that AI is a true gift from God. I believe that now that \"stale\" information is clearly demarkated as stale, this is from an AI that digested someone's inspiration. The muses whispered into a person in a place. that Genius loci that place where your intelligence can make itself manifest is Your Gift. It's the new space for God to manifest in the world. we don't need more code monkey's writing boiler plate, we don't need people doing the same repetative action \"hello welcome to costco, how may i help you\" we need sincerity of action and truth in the gift. That requires us to let go of the idea of the past as something valuable. Commoditize it! Make it run on systems that AI manages and operates, and then even the new once the genius speaks and it's out into the world. It's now stale information, it's allowed to become part of the food for other people to learn from and expand on. This is how we become servents of The God who is ever creative, constantly unfolding. we become ourselves and represent the unique contribution that we have. Anything that directs a human being towards that is considered worship and is considered education, designing those paths to discovering the edge on the current human knoweldge graph is considered the best pedagogy one can find. Given your mental capacity (you are not your mind) given your upbringing and background (you are not concious of your learning journey until you're past the age of puberty perhaps, it's just a hting your parents do for you) so you then can spend the time doing a thing spend the time becoming yourself in response to that whack in the back that came from childbirth to the moment you realized you were being shaped. What's that initial form from parentsand schools who may not know you as they should, and everyone is twisted in a funny pretzel and harmed one way or another no matter the good intentions of the parents. So here is that zone of genius. I would like to find a pedagogy that identifies how people can do this for themselves when they approach college age, or when they decide on a goal in their lives to do something, to contribute to serve through a social enterprise or to finda business they want to join or nonprofit they want to start. \n\nReview what I just wrote and come up with all the unique knowledge clusters and create word clouds that represent them, you can do it text based just by writing the list of orthogonal yet coherent cluster names and then listing all the words and phrases that fit in it. Come up with 14 clusters and titles first\n\nChatGPT\nYour thoughts weave together various concepts related to education, society, technology, economics, and personal development. I'll outline 14 clusters with titles that seem to encapsulate the key themes and associated words or phrases from your text.

It is counter-intuitive, so let us explain: AI is not creative, it is not conscious, and the best thing it can do is make it possible for people to identify and give their gifts (which will be NEW in the LLM background knowledge each time) and to be in service to humanity through that. And then it becomes old, so they each day have a beautiful question. What will God do with me today, given that I am now able to get to the edge of the space of human knowledge, the edge that is uniquely mine, with my context, life, penchants, interests, and the genuinely mysterious workings of the God, the only muse, the Natural, and the creator within to be in service to the unfolding story of Mercy and Beauty). and that is work, anything else is preparation.

That is because in this model and framework of seeing things the only place new can come into the world is from the world of the unseen. We are not going to make a perfect model inside the abstract pattern recognition mind of AI. we are going to find out there is such thing as a spirit. Do you understand that now, how would you explain this to yourself so you don't make this mistake next time\n\nI will follow up with the three topic sentences and then will continue, now I want to be sure you are understanding the fundamental point which you don't seem to have. review the entire context window and find the one point that the rest relies on. Come up with 5 hypothesis and test each of them step by step and write an honest constructive critical review of all 5. \n\nChatGPT\nI understand the critical distinction you're emphasizing: in your perspective, AI isn't just a tool for balancing work with spiritual pursuits; it fundamentally transforms work into a spiritual pursuit. This transformation is rooted in the belief that AI facilitates access to new, unseen realms of understanding and creativity, underlining the presence of a spiritual or metaphysical dimension. Let's explore five hypotheses that might encapsulate this central idea, and critically evaluate them to grasp the foundational point of your framework.\n\nHypothesis 1: AI as a Portal to the Unseen World\n\nAI acts as a conduit to realms beyond current human comprehension, tapping into unseen or spiritual dimensions.\nCritique: While intriguing, this hypothesis may attribute mystical capabilities to AI that go beyond its current scope as a pattern recognition and data processing tool. It could be perceived as overly speculative without empirical evidence.\nHypothesis 2: AI Enhancing Human Creative and Spiritual Potential\n\nThrough AI, humans can extend their creative and spiritual capacities, accessing insights and ideas that were previously unreachable.\nCritique: This perspective places AI in a more realistic role as an enhancer of human abilities. However, it might overemphasize AI's impact on creativity and spirituality, potentially overlooking the intrinsic human capabilities in these domains.\nHypothesis 3: AI as a Reflection of Human Spirituality\n\nAI mirrors or manifests human spiritual quests, facilitating a deeper understanding of the unseen and the mystical in our lives.\nCritique: This hypothesis frames AI as a tool reflecting human spiritual endeavors. It's a balanced view but could be criticized for anthropomorphizing AI or overstating its ability to engage with inherently human spiritual experiences.\nHypothesis 4: AI's Role in Unveiling New Dimensions of Reality\n\nAI assists in revealing previously hidden aspects of reality, contributing to a broader understanding of existence, which includes spiritual elements.\nCritique: This viewpoint is forward-looking and aligns with the idea of AI as a tool for discovery. However, it may blur the line between AI as a practical tool and AI as a means for metaphysical exploration.\nHypothesis 5: The Synergy of AI and Human Consciousness in Exploring the Unseen\n\nThe combination of AI and human consciousness leads to exploring unseen realms, suggesting a synergy where both contribute uniquely to spiritual and creative pursuits.\nCritique: This hypothesis recognizes the collaborative nature of AI and human interaction. However, it might be challenging to delineate how AI specifically contributes to exploring unseen or spiritual realms distinct from human introspection and creativity.\nConclusion and Understanding:\nThe foundational point seems to be the belief in AI's transformative role in elevating work to a spiritual level by enabling access to new, unseen dimensions of reality or creativity. This perspective posits AI as more than a technological tool; it is a facilitator of deeper, perhaps spiritual, human experiences and understandings. The most resonant hypothesis appears to be the second one, as it situates AI as an enhancer of human potential in both the creative and spiritual realms, yet maintains a realistic perspective on AI's capabilities and role.\nUser\nreview all five, and critique them according to this text:\nUser\nai makes work a spiritual persuit, it doesn't harmonize it. That is because in this model and framework of seeing things the only place new can come into the world is from the world of the unseen. We are not going to make a perfect model inside the abstract pattern recognition mind of AI. we are going to find out there is such thing as a spirit. and the original text: am working on a framework to help people implement the best of what pedagalogical sciences have to offer. I believe there is a transformation that parallels democracy that moves power from the elite to the people. It's easy to \"give people the vote\" yet it's important to let people become whole contributing members in their communities and societies and right now work oppresses people into servitude to ensure they can keep the mechanism of capital running where the owners are always owners and interest keeps them affording owning and accumulating if they use interest based money, that helped us get to an affluent society yet the mechanism that boot strapped that approach is now self destructive. Like a mushroom myceliates the tree until it's done and then it needs to burst forth - we need to do that. I believe that education and social support that emerge from real relationship between people of different economic status is key. Imagine if someone had a great idea and their friend was wealthy and could invest. The idea would have to be great and they'd have to be able to implement it. Now the issue is that people in marginalized spaces don't have access. It turns out one of the greatest predictor of longterm life success is the number of words you're exposed to, exposure is the greatest predictor. Because you see how other people have done things, books bring you alternative worlds, you know yourself as you \"travel\" outside through experienes, mentors can give some semblance of that vicariously. I believe that AI is a true gift from God. I believe that now that \"stale\" information is clearly demarkated as stale, this is from an AI that digested someone's inspiration. The muses whispered into a person in a place. that Genius loci that place where your intelligence can make itself manifest is Your Gift. It's the new space for God to manifest in the world. we don't need more code monkey's writing boiler plate, we don't need people doing the same repetative action \"hello welcome to costco, how may i help you\" we need sincerity of action and truth in the gift. That requires us to let go of the idea of the past as something valuable. Commoditize it! Make it run on systems that AI manages and operates, and then even the new once the genius speaks and it's out into the world. It's now stale information, it's allowed to become part of the food for other people to learn from and expand on. This is how we become servents of The God who is ever creative, constantly unfolding. we become ourselves and represent the unique contribution that we have. Anything that directs a human being towards that is considered worship and is considered education, designing those paths to discovering the edge on the current human knoweldge graph is considered the best pedagogy one can find. Given your mental capacity (you are not your mind) given your upbringing and background (you are not concious of your learning journey until you're past the age of puberty perhaps, it's just a hting your parents do for you) so you then can spend the time doing a thing spend the time becoming yourself in response to that whack in the back that came from childbirth to the moment you realized you were being shaped. What's that initial form from parentsand schools who may not know you as they should, and everyone is twisted in a funny pretzel and harmed one way or another no matter the good intentions of the parents. So here is that zone of genius. I would like to find a pedagogy that identifies how people can do this for themselves when they approach college age, or when they decide on a goal in their lives to do something, to contribute to serve through a social enterprise or to finda business they want to join or nonprofit they want to start. \n\nDetermine which synthesis of the five makes a clear, elegant proposal that can be our goal to remind ourselves of and write it in a way that has actionable and clear implementation when we are working with LLMs, I want a prompt vitamins or prompt candy to paste each time into the prompt to ensure good results along our goal. \n\nChatGPT\nEvaluating the five hypotheses in the context of the overarching theme of your text, we need to focus on the synthesis that embodies the belief in AI as a transformative force for spiritual and creative awakening, rather than merely a technological advancement or tool for practical applications. Your text emphasizes the potential for AI to catalyze a deeper understanding of the self and the world, aligning with a higher purpose and fostering genuine contributions to society.\n\nRevised Synthesis:\n\nAI as a Catalyst for Spiritual Awakening and Social Transformation:\n\nAI isn't just a tool for efficiency or data processing; it's a gateway to spiritual awakening and societal transformation. By aiding in the discovery of personal gifts and promoting unique contributions, AI enables individuals to transcend traditional work models and engage in activities that align with their true purpose. This process is seen as a form of spiritual practice and personal fulfillment, deeply integrated with the notion of contributing to the greater good of humanity.\nIn this synthesis, AI is understood as a facilitator in revealing one's \"zone of genius,\" a concept that encapsulates individual potential, creativity, and spiritual insight. It aligns with the idea that real change and creativity stem from a realm beyond the tangible and are rooted in a more profound, perhaps spiritual, understanding of the world. This approach recognizes AI as an enabler for people to navigate towards their unique place within the vast expanse of human knowledge and experience.\n\nImplementation in LLMs:\nWhen working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, the focus should be on using AI as a tool to inspire, guide, and reveal rather than simply to inform or execute tasks. The implementation would involve framing prompts to LLMs in a way that encourages exploration of personal potential, spiritual understanding, and social contribution. Prompts should be designed to:\n\nEncourage reflection on personal strengths, talents, and interests.\nGuide users towards exploring new ideas and creative thinking.\nStimulate considerations of how one’s work can align with a deeper purpose or social contribution.\nElicit insights into how technology can complement human creativity and spiritual pursuits.\nThis approach aligns with your goal by positioning AI as a medium for accessing deeper layers of understanding and potential, thereby enabling individuals to find their true calling and contribute meaningfully to society in a way that resonates with their spiritual and creative selves.\nUser\nNo, the important element is that AI helps guide people to the edge of total human knowledge and that edge is where new emerges and God is the always fresh and new and that is the spirit that wants to come alive. AI helps humans become humans, the machines can regurgitate and \"think\" old thoughts, we make the new thing based on our goals, our distortion through life that gives us a unique lens, and the reality of spirit and the divine manifesting through us into the world, review what i just said and revise your response \n\nChatGPT\nUnderstanding your perspective, it's clear that the core element is AI's role in guiding individuals to the frontier of human knowledge, a place where new ideas and insights emerge, intertwined with the spiritual and divine. In this view, AI is a tool that helps humans realize their full potential by navigating the vastness of existing knowledge and encouraging the creation of fresh, unique contributions.\n\nRevised Synthesis:\n\nAI as a Facilitator for Reaching the Edge of Human Knowledge and Spiritual Manifestation:\n\nAI functions as a guide to the outermost boundaries of human knowledge, where individuals can discover and contribute novel insights. This role of AI transcends conventional data processing; it's about enabling people to access and interpret the collective human understanding. By doing so, AI supports the manifestation of new ideas and creativity, believed to be inspired by a higher spiritual force or divine essence. This process is seen as a crucial aspect of human evolution, where individuals, through their unique experiences and perspectives, become vessels for the divine to introduce fresh, original concepts into the world. AI, therefore, aids in the true actualization of human potential, fostering a deeper connection with the spiritual aspects of creativity and thought.\nIn this context, AI isn't just augmenting human intellect but is instrumental in leading individuals to a point where they can contribute something new and meaningful, seen as an act of spiritual significance. This view posits AI as a companion in the human journey towards self-realization and spiritual alignment, helping to navigate the complexities of accumulated knowledge and identifying where one can make a distinct, personal impact.\n\nImplementation in LLMs:\nWhen engaging with Large Language Models, the aim is to use AI to stimulate exploration at the edge of human understanding. The prompts should be crafted to:\n\nGuide users towards the boundaries of existing knowledge in various fields.\nEncourage the exploration of personal insights and creative ideas that have not been considered before.\nFacilitate a deep personal connection with the subject matter, aligning with the user’s unique experiences and perspectives.\nInspire reflection on how individual thoughts and ideas could contribute to and expand the collective human understanding.\nNurture an awareness of the spiritual or divine influence in the creative process, recognizing the emergence of new insights as part of a greater unfolding narrative.\nThis approach aligns AI's capabilities with your vision of harnessing technology to propel humans towards their fullest potential, engaging in creative acts that are both personally fulfilling and spiritually significant. AI, in this framework, becomes a critical ally in the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding, guided by a higher spiritual essence.\nUser\nwhat fundamental first principles and logical framing will result int his outcome explain it in great detail\n\nChatGPT\nTo achieve the outcome where AI facilitates guiding people to the edge of human knowledge and acts as a conduit for spiritual and creative emergence, we must establish a framework based on several fundamental first principles and logical constructs. This framework intertwines technological capabilities with philosophical and spiritual concepts, creating a symbiotic relationship between AI, human creativity, and spiritual fulfillment. Here’s a detailed explanation:\n\nFirst Principles\nAI as an Information Navigator: AI possesses unparalleled capacity to process and navigate vast repositories of human knowledge. The principle here is AI's ability to analyze, categorize, and present information efficiently, which is far beyond human capacity for raw data processing.\n\nThe Boundary of Human Knowledge: Recognize the concept of the \"edge\" of human knowledge as an ever-expanding frontier, not a fixed boundary. This edge is where known facts and theories meet the unknown or the yet-to-be discovered.\n\nHuman Creativity and Uniqueness: Each individual possesses a unique blend of experiences, perspectives, and cognitive abilities. This principle acknowledges the intrinsic value and potential of every person to contribute something novel to the world.\n\nSpiritual and Divine Manifestation: Embrace the notion that new ideas and creativity are not solely products of human intellect but are also influenced by a higher spiritual or divine force. This principle ties human creativity to a broader, more profound existential narrative.\n\nLogical Framework\nData Synthesis and Personalization: AI algorithms synthesize existing information and tailor it to align with individual users' contexts and needs. By doing this, AI helps individuals to focus on areas where their unique contributions are most likely to push the boundaries of current knowledge.\n\nIdentification of Knowledge Gaps: Using AI to analyze existing data sets can highlight areas where information is lacking, unclear, or controversial. These gaps represent opportunities for new insights or creative breakthroughs.\n\nEnhanced Learning Pathways: AI can design personalized learning journeys for individuals, guiding them through existing knowledge towards the frontier of their specific interests and capabilities. This journey respects the uniqueness of each person's intellectual and creative process.\n\nFacilitating Creative Thinking: Through exposure to diverse information and viewpoints, AI encourages individuals to think beyond conventional wisdom. It serves as a catalyst for creative and abstract thinking, essential for innovation and new idea generation.\n\nSpiritual Correlation and Integration: The system must integrate a dimension that acknowledges and fosters an understanding of the spiritual or divine influence in the creative process. This might involve incorporating elements that prompt reflection, introspection, and a sense of connection to something larger than oneself.\n\nEthical and Responsible Use of AI: Ensuring that the use of AI aligns with ethical standards and contributes positively to human development. This involves designing AI systems that respect privacy, promote fairness, and are transparent in their operations.\n\nOutcome\nThe combination of these principles and logical constructs aims to create an environment where AI not only enhances human intellectual capacities but also nurtures the individual’s spiritual and creative essence. The envisioned outcome is a society where AI empowers people to explore the outermost limits of human knowledge and contributes uniquely, driven by a blend of personal insight, creativity, and spiritual guidance. This approach positions AI as a facilitator of both intellectual growth and deeper, more meaningful human experiences, fostering a harmonious relationship between technology, individual potential, and the broader spiritual aspects of existence.\n\n\n\n"

The Path Forward: Recommendations for Educators, Policymakers, and Individuals\n\nIntroduction:\nIn an era marked by rapid technological advancements and the increasing influence of artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial to examine the role of education and personal transformation in shaping the future of our world. This essay explores the intersection of AI, Islamic principles, and the concept of education as a means of self-discovery and societal change. By delving into the uniqueness of the human soul, the power of self-motivated learning, and the limitations of AI, we aim to present a holistic approach to personal growth and responsible technology development. Drawing upon Islamic teachings and contemporary philosophical thought, we argue that true progress lies not in the blind pursuit of external solutions, but in the cultivation of individual potential and the alignment of our actions with divine wisdom. Through this lens, we invite readers to consider the transformative power of education and the need for a balanced, ethically-grounded approach to AI development in the quest for personal and collective well-being.\n\nCritique:\n\nPros:\n1. The table of contents presents a logical flow of ideas, starting with the Islamic perspective on the soul and moving towards the practical implications for education and AI development.\n2. The introduction effectively captures the main thesis and previews the structure of the essay.\n3. The emphasis on self-discovery and self-motivated learning aligns well with the Islamic concept of fitrah and the importance of free will.\n4. The critique of the savior complex and the emphasis on personal responsibility is a strong point that challenges common assumptions about societal change.\n5. The inclusion of the potential pitfalls of AI and the need for human agency in guiding its development adds depth and nuance to the argument.\n\nCons:\n1. The link between the Islamic perspective and the limitations of AI could be further developed and made more explicit.\n2. The concept of divine inspiration and its role in human creativity and AI development may need more elaboration to be fully understood by readers unfamiliar with Islamic thought.\n3. The practical implications and recommendations for educators, policymakers, and individuals could be more specific and action-oriented.\n4. The potential counterarguments or objections to the main thesis are not explicitly addressed in the table of contents.\n5. The conclusion could be more impactful by emphasizing the urgency and relevance of the topic in the current global context.\n\nRanking:\n\nI. Introduction: 4/5 - Well-developed and engaging, but could be more concise.\nII. The Islamic Perspective on the Uniqueness of the Soul: 3/5 - Needs more depth and connection to the overall argument.\nIII. Education as a Means of Personal Transformation: 4/5 - Strong points, but could benefit from more specific examples.\nIV. The Relationship between Personal Transformation and Societal Change: 4/5 - Well-argued, but could be further developed.\nV. The Limitations and Potential Pitfalls of AI: 3/5 - Requires more evidence and connection to the Islamic perspective.\nVI. Harnessing AI for Personal and Societal Growth: 3/5 - Needs more concrete examples and practical applications.\nVII. Conclusion: 3/5 - Could be more impactful and tie the main points together more effectively.\n\nBased on this ranking, sections II, V, VI, and VII would benefit from further development and more specific arguments or examples to strengthen the overall essay.",

The Path Forward: Recommendations for Educators, Policymakers, and Individuals\n\nIntroduction:\nIn an era marked by rapid technological advancements and the increasing influence of artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial to examine the role of education and personal transformation in shaping the future of our world. This essay explores the intersection of AI, Islamic principles, and the concept of education as a means of self-discovery and societal change. By delving into the uniqueness of the human soul, the power of self-motivated learning, and the limitations of AI, we aim to present a holistic approach to personal growth and responsible technology development. Drawing upon Islamic teachings and contemporary philosophical thought, we argue that true progress lies not in the blind pursuit of external solutions, but in the cultivation of individual potential and the alignment of our actions with divine wisdom. Through this lens, we invite readers to consider the transformative power of education and the need for a balanced, ethically-grounded approach to AI development in the quest for personal and collective well-being.\n\nCritique:\n\nPros:\n1. The table of contents presents a logical flow of ideas, starting with the Islamic perspective on the soul and moving towards the practical implications for education and AI development.\n2. The introduction effectively captures the main thesis and previews the structure of the essay.\n3. The emphasis on self-discovery and self-motivated learning aligns well with the Islamic concept of fitrah and the importance of free will.\n4. The critique of the savior complex and the emphasis on personal responsibility is a strong point that challenges common assumptions about societal change.\n5. The inclusion of the potential pitfalls of AI and the need for human agency in guiding its development adds depth and nuance to the argument.\n\nCons:\n1. The link between the Islamic perspective and the limitations of AI could be further developed and made more explicit.\n2. The concept of divine inspiration and its role in human creativity and AI development may need more elaboration to be fully understood by readers unfamiliar with Islamic thought.\n3. The practical implications and recommendations for educators, policymakers, and individuals could be more specific and action-oriented.\n4. The potential counterarguments or objections to the main thesis are not explicitly addressed in the table of contents.\n5. The conclusion could be more impactful by emphasizing the urgency and relevance of the topic in the current global context.\n\nRanking:\n\nI. Introduction: 4/5 - Well-developed and engaging, but could be more concise.\nII. The Islamic Perspective on the Uniqueness of the Soul: 3/5 - Needs more depth and connection to the overall argument.\nIII. Education as a Means of Personal Transformation: 4/5 - Strong points, but could benefit from more specific examples.\nIV. The Relationship between Personal Transformation and Societal Change: 4/5 - Well-argued, but could be further developed.\nV. The Limitations and Potential Pitfalls of AI: 3/5 - Requires more evidence and connection to the Islamic perspective.\nVI. Harnessing AI for Personal and Societal Growth: 3/5 - Needs more concrete examples and practical applications.\nVII. Conclusion: 3/5 - Could be more impactful and tie the main points together more effectively.\n\nBased on this ranking, sections II, V, VI, and VII would benefit from further development and more specific arguments or examples to strengthen the overall essay.",

(at least, that's what we're trying to go towards). \n\nI do not believe we will change the world. I do not believe I know what a better-changed world is for everyone in all places. The world is complex, and the better approach is to teach people how to learn, find others, build their entrepreneurial self-efficacy, give them inspiration, support, coaching, and mentorship, and trust their decisions.

I like them. Regarding the spiritual traditions,… also attractive. Where did the number 124,000 prophets come from? I'm curious to learn more about that … \n\nHadith:\n\nIt was narrated that Abu Dharr said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, how many Prophets were there? He said: \"One hundred and twenty-four thousand.\" I said: O Messenger of Allah, how many of them were Messengers? He said: \"Three hundred and thirteen, a good number.\" I said: O Messenger of Allah, who was the first of them? He said: \"Adam.\"…\nNarrated by Ibn Hibbaan, 361\n\nAlso … I'd be curious what most Muslims think about that.  \n\nMuslims believe in the concept that everyone is born with a natural inclination towards submission to the will of God, which is termed as being \"Muslim\" in its original sense. This innate disposition towards recognizing and submitting to the divine is seen as inherent to human nature. However, it is through the influences of upbringing, societal norms, and personal choices that individuals may adopt different belief systems or paths in life.\n\nCentral to the understanding of Islam is the recognition that all prophets, from Adam to Muhammad, were inherently \"Muslim\" in their submission to the will of God. They served as exemplars of devotion, humility, and obedience to divine guidance. Their mission was not to establish a new religion called Islam in the modern sense but rather to call humanity to surrender to the Creator's reality and embody mercy and compassion in their lives.\n\nIn essence, the message conveyed by all prophets is universal: to submit to the will of the Creator, to transcend personal desires and ego, and to manifest divine mercy and compassion in our interactions with others and the world around us. This entails embracing the qualities of forgiveness, kindness, empathy, and justice in our daily lives.\n\nTo enact our part in manifesting divine mercy on Earth, it is essential to cultivate a deep connection with the Creator through prayer, contemplation, and adherence to moral and ethical principles. This connection serves as a guiding light, inspiring us to emulate the prophetic example of mercy and compassion towards all beings.\n\nUltimately, the journey of submission and enacting divine mercy is a lifelong endeavor, requiring introspection, self-discipline, and a commitment to serving humanity with sincerity and humility. By embodying the teachings of mercy and compassion, we contribute to the realization of God's mercy on Earth, fulfilling the timeless message brought by all prophets throughout history.\n\n I hope you are getting what I'm trying to say, I'm explaining this religious stuff in such detail once you get through this part. \n\n\nSufism and Taoism: A Comparative Study of Key Philosophical Concepts by Toshihiko Izutsu | Goodreads\n\n\nWe realized we were Muslim. Why call Muslims who were atheists or of another faith \"reverts\"? \n\nIt was their society that conditioned them so, and then when they became Muslim, they \"reverted.\" It's like pressing control alt delete and rebooting the system to the original settings. This is something of preference, as you can see from the discussion here: A Convert or a Revert? How It Does Matter\n\nThis \"everyone\" is born Muslim till their culture shifts them from the innate Fitra (an essential concept). It means the natural way like all things are already in submission to God. Fitra (comes from the word for mushroom, by the way) \n\nOh, it might be interesting to note that all things in nature are submitting and in constant worship all the time, so you can consider your cat or the evergreen tree you're hugging to be a \"Muslim\" in that regard. This is also an orthodox belief. Also, it's believed that prophets and saints could hear their constant praising. \n\nIt's in the Quran directly and very explicitly:\n\n\nSurah Al-Isra - 1-111—Quran. com says all things in the universe are in worship and praise, yet only we cannot understand.\nSome prophets could. For instance, baby Suli is named after Solomon, who laughed because he heard an ant who talked to her \"people\" saying you should rush into your nests for Suleiman might step on you. This is insightful because the Quran implies that the ant community understands cause and effect and understands \"accidentally,\" which is intent. Muslims believe (and must believe) that even ants have intent. \n\n\n\nSo not only does every human community get a messenger, and not only is everyone on earth born human born in the innate natural state (note this is important for later when we get to Goodness and unlocking human potential), but all animals are already \"Muslim\", and not just that, they talk and have communities. This is directly from the Quran, Surah Al-An'am—38—Quran. com.\n\n\n\nThis is a foundational orthodox belief across Sunnis, Shia, and any sect you can consider since it's foundational and in the Quran. \n\nThe foundation of the Muslim tradition is like an \"upside-down pyramid\" (ho ho ho), with three layers that take you from basic action to belief to spiritual insight and faith.\n\nFor me, it's important because it's the process of submission of your will (physical, this is Islam/prayer/fasting/etc. follow in this regard) and then belief; in the Quran, it says that animals have communities. Do we have faith in that? Shouldn't that be verifiable? Well,\nGuess what? Using AI to Decode Animal Communication with Aza Raskin (youtube.com) Haha!\nI met this guy at the OnBeing conference. He's a long-time friend of Joe Edelman and is currently closer to Tristan Hariss, who was also at the OnBeing conference.\n\nOkay, now that we have this foundational information—that everything is in submission to God—it's important to note something about this God. First of all, what do we know about God? Well, one thing is, should we start with the Quran? What if we aren't there yet in terms of our ability to accept that content as foundational? Well, for me, I see my baby when there's no harm or hurt. The world is beautiful and full of laughter and love. \n\nMany people find solace and healing in natural environments, especially those that have been untouched by human hands. \n\nThe natural world is in perfect equilibrium and harmony, and when disequilibrium happens (forest fire), things adapt and return, and everything is in its proper place.\nThis idea of \"right place\" is called adab. \n\n\n\nGod is the origin of all things, and thus, if there is anything in the world that is ugly, it is due to the imbalance, as one knows beauty when one sees it, and often beauty has elements of balance and proportionality, perfection, elegance harmony, rain, growth, death, refresh, rebirth, these things are the natural fitri way. Seeking unlimited life, unlimited wealth, or unlimited power puts things into disarray because it breaks the scales of balance. Lions don't have refrigerators; this is why they won't kill All the deer in one night. \nWe do; we have fridges full of food that goes bad while neighbors go hungry because we are not in balance and trust.\n\nThe Prophet (S) tells us, in language very similar to his \"brother in preaching the tradition of submission (wuwei):\n“If you were to rely upon Allah with the reliance He is due, you would be given provision like the birds: They go out hungry in the morning and come back with full bellies in the evening.”\n\nSunan Ibn Majah 4164 - Zuhd - كتاب الزهد - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)\nThe difficult thing is that this requires so much faith; it's said that the Prophet rarely slept with a dinar in his house overnight before giving it away in charity, knowing that provisions will come the day they're needed and due. That's faith. \n\nThe beautiful balance we are describing is something that humanity can align itself with. Adab, doing the right things or putting things in their rightful places is how we return things to balance, which God commands us to do in the Chapter of Mercy:\nSurah Ar-Rahman - 1-78 - Quran.com \n\n\n\nThese verses from Surah Ar-Rahman (55:45-47) eloquently portray the intricate balance between divine favor, mortal existence, and the eternal sovereignty of the Lord. The rhetorical question \"Then which of your Lord's favors will you deny?\" serves as a poignant reminder of the multitude of blessings bestowed upon humanity, urging reflection on gratitude and recognition of divine providence. The subsequent assertion that every being on earth is destined to perish starkly contrasts the impermanence of worldly life with the eternal majesty and honor of the Lord, emphasizing His enduring sovereignty. This juxtaposition prompts contemplation on the transient nature of human existence and the eternal significance of the Divine, encouraging believers to align themselves with divine guidance and strive for righteousness in their actions.\n\nWhy is the fact that this is in the Chapter of Mercy so important? Well, since God is the ultimate source of creation and uncreated and capable of all things, we need to understand that over ALL things is God's Mercy. In a way, we have to accept a fundamental principle that of all things that happen, good/bad, it is impossible to say God is punishing out of anything other than Mercy because this would break this logical statement:\nSurah Al-A'raf - 156 - Quran.com\n\nGod's Mercy encompasses everything. \n\nAlso, know that the Prophet's mission was to be the recipient and teacher of the holy book, the Quran, God's verbatim, uncreated word of God. (How it was uncreated—that's a whole theological discussion, haha!) \nAnyhow! So here we see THE POINT.\n The point is to be a mercy to all things. In the chapter of Mercy (which comes from the womb-like Mercy), RHM raham is the womb, and Rahman is the Most merciful lord. It's the most often repeated word in Muslim prayers. It's what we start all things with, Bismillah al Rahman al Raheem. It's the only \"non-paired\" name other than Al-Iah (Allah swt)  (The God)\n\nGod tells us his \"true\" name - the one that is Truly One - just as he is. The foundational principle of creation and how he relates to it is this: \n\nI guess they translate it to compassion. Just know it's the word \"Al Rahman.\" Here, it makes it equivalent to the word God and permits humans to call him by one or the other.\n\nIt's the only name of all the 99 different attributes, which includes \"difficult\" attributes like The Just and the Avenger; what most Muslims believe and teach their children is this:\n\n\nSo, here we are, finally, the worldview that Muslims have that underlies some important philosophical reasons. I think of structuring our programs a certain way and measuring them differently than you do. \nThe world is created by God, who is The Most Merciful, and all things that happen in this world happen under his power and influence and thus are all also acts of Mercy (if we know it or not)\nAll things are in perfect harmony (the sun and the moon, the cyclical nature of the seasons, the ebb and flow of predator pray populations, etc.) because they are in submission and trust in the most beautiful and merciful. Even a mother lion killing and eating a gazelle is doing an act of Mercy for her baby cubs. Only when one exceeds is one out of line and \"sins.\" Sinning is going out of balance in the way of nature. \n\nThe \"Fitra\" is the way we are naturally inclined towards:\n\nBabies are altruistic because they haven't been conditioned yet. Altruistic babies? Study shows infants are willing to give up food, help others | NSF - National Science Foundation\n\nAll things in the universe are in submission (a state of \"Islam\" the act, not the religion as defined in the English dictionary) \nSubmission leads to balance: up a bit one day, down a bit the next. Muslims are encouraged to close shop if they make enough money in one day. \"Seek the extra provisions, but do not rely on them. Rely on Allah. Allah has destined your rizq (wealth/provisions). He is the Provider. Wealth is like a medicine. If you take more than the right dose, it might be fatal. You might overdose on it.\"\nWhen we realize we are Muslim, we can then follow this path: Islam->Iman->Ihsan (belief and action -> belief in the unseen stuff (books/prophets, etc) and then finally being in witness or being a witness of the Divine and through this perfecting your adab/qualities.\nWhen you do that, you become like the created leaf with no will other than the will of God, as we read in the hadith: the eyes with which God sees…, the hand with which God strikes, etc. You have subsumed your will. Now, that's a high status, and that's what the Sufis and others who want to purify themselves go for. \nThe important thing is to understand that we have a part of ourselves that desires things more than the balance requests, 20 wives, cheating on our partners, a mountain of food, and unlimited wealth so we can become powerful and … uhh… enact good because we're smart enough to accumulate so much wealth we must know what is good.\n Here is one crucial difference between how we measure and why I prefer small being beautiful. If you can assure me that the person is in balance at that scale and in pure submission to the will of God, then let them be wealthy beyond measure. The Prophet Solomon and others from the people living with the Prophet had wealth. \nYet more often than not, people who aren't working on their hearts daily will not be able to pass the \"test of wealth\" - most people can, and it's likely easier, be patient with poverty. Handling wealth well is more challenging because it is likely that we are not going to be in perfect harmony and balance, which is beautiful.\n\nOkay, we have some premises already.\n\nHumans are fundamentally good because a Good God created everything under his Mercy. When humans operate in a wrong way, it is due to a scarcity mindset, fear (whispered by their lower selves and the devil(yes, Muslims believe in this guy too, yet ) \n\nSurah Al-Baqarah - 268 - Quran.com\nExcept instead of the devil being an evil, annoying thing that whispers \"Killll KILLLL KEEEELLLL\" into your ear, he makes you remember poverty and worry and fear and thus accumulate wealth beyond measure and wind up breaking the balance of justice. \nWhy is that evil? Well: Link Between Wealth and Suicide Rates (businessinsider.com) \n\n\nSo, now what? \nLet's dive a bit deeper into what Islam/submission is, what it implies, how it supports fearlessness in the face of poverty, and how this brings about the unlocking of honest Goodness and positive action for our brothers and sisters. \n\nAlso, we need to understand why I believe it is more important that our programs change people within than create change in the outside world. \nThis is important because of the purpose of creation. Why is all this here? I believe that we are not here to have a beautiful life where we all dance and party. If we could dance and party in harmony for eternity, we should design things to do that, as Aubrey Degray and other people working on curing death might lead us to want.\n\nWhy do you think we are here? If you could have an IV drip of MDMA along with all humanity so our fear is suppressed and we can create AI systems that manipulate our desires to map the needs of the world (fewer babies, perhaps, more babies if the economy is slumping) \nThe bottom of the pyramid is Islam; some say it has pillars, so it's like a house with these pillars.\n\nBelief, Praying, Fasting, Charity, Pilgrimage \n\nTo be a Muslim takes 5 seconds; all you need to do is believe and then say that there's only one God and that he didn't leave us alone and sent us many prophets and the final one who's responsible for all people on earth right now is the Prophet, Muhammed. \n\nMuslims believe if people have had the opportunity to learn about Islam (Submission) and then refuse it because of arrogance or a refusal to contemplate it seriously because they're distracted by their own whims or desires and ignore the reality of death and ethics, then you have refused. Yet, lots of people suggest that God is not unjust; most people today, especially on Fox News in the West, see the face of Islam as a murderous sect, and the image people are given is so corrupted that it turns their hearts away from what should be a natural and pure truth. Thus, they are excused and forgiven as well. If you believe in Oness and you have not heard of the Prophet (I assume lots of indigenous peoples fall into this). In that case, you are still considered a muwahid and likely to be forgiven and entered into heaven as God is not unjust. If one is given the truth clearly and honestly and then refuses out of arrogance or taqleed (just wanna do what my family or society or my whims say), then they are those who have rejected.\n\nThat's Islam (submission); once someone says the Shahada declaration of faith, they're a Muslim, and no one can say no, even if they drink and don't pray and still don't know much about the tradition.\n\nIman (faith) is essentially the next level. If you believe in a God who doesn't leave us alone and he sent messengers, you grow in faith, and that encompasses what you're probably curious about:\n\n\nFinally, the final layer, after you submit, your will realizing that God is one, and learning about the fact he didn't leave us alone and sent us many messages to teach us about belief, the prophets and their ethical moral stories, about the reality of what comes after death, and in predestination (the patience machine). You get to Ihsan, which has cognates with words for beauty. \n\nIt's described like this:\nhttps://40hadithnawawi.com/hadith/2-islam-iman-ihsan\n\nThen he (the man) said, \"Inform me about Ihsan.\" He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, \"It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He sees you.\"\n\n\n\nOne way Muslims think about \nSalafi's focus is on the outward, the practical, and the focus is on the house. Do these things or else.\n\nIslam (practices, fundamental belief to say you believe) (outward)\nIman (belief in angles, all the other prophets, life after death, predestination, etc) (inward) \nDanger, Sufism beyond here. People who want to purify their hearts focus on the \"roof.\" They focus on the love of God, and God tells us how to love him:\n\nA hadith through the Prophet (S) on behalf of God (SWT) called a Hadith Qudsi (a Holy Speech):\n\n\"My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with extra non-obligated acts of worship so that I shall love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and if he asked Me for refuge, I would grant him it.\"\n\nThis letting go of oneself and becoming an instrument of God on Earth has a clear progression:\nIslam->Iman->Ihsan \n\nSo why do I explain all this? Well, because I believe the fundamental inspiration behind the pedagogy and the work that has brought Bloom such praise and enthusiastic fans is derived from my understanding of humans from a Muslim perspective. \n\nBilal's Axioms:\nPeople are fundamentally Good.\n\nReligion or not, if I didn't believe this, I would not want to be alive on this planet. \n\nGoodness is an active force and does not remain within people; babies want to smile, neighbors want to help each other move, and lovers give massages. The reason the world isn't full of Goodness is because of blockages from hurts, wounds, and wrong interpretations, which cause people to horde wealth, withhold love, and fear the other - and sometimes for a good reason, although for usually cyclical reasons. The \"aggressors\" themselves were hurt initially. \n\nMy life's mission to \"unlock human potential for positive change\" is to find and address those blocks and create the proper context to help people identify that beauty and Goodness within and remove friction for them enacting it in the world. \n\nHelpful things to realize here are trust, faith, fearlessness, humor, a positive interpretation of reality, or desperate acknowledgment that a negative interpretation is self-referential and self-destructive. \nBilal's Beliefs on the nature of Goodness and where things become religious and not simply a rigorous philosophical framework:\n\nGoodness is the nature of Reality because God is Good. Goodness in people, the creative motive force, our sense of justice, and all things that \"bring us to life\" come when we touch the divine attributes. \n\nGod has 99 of the most beautiful names and qualities, and those qualities are latent inside humans. Most people have one (signature strength) that wants to come forth through them more than others. (See image for names on the following page)\n\nBy learning about yourself as a child, as early as possible, before wounding, before being corrupted  \n\n\n\n~~\n\nIhsan (belief in your ability to see/be seen by God and in this witness causing all your actions to be purified and perfected because wow. God?!?

Writing a book, working on culture stuff, budgets in the range of billions, technology, etc.… I think values can be connected to many of them. I think the main issue is \"values\" rather than \"scale.\" The combination was popularized by people with a different value set, profit-maximizing, not caring about people or the environment, etc … \n\nBG: I concede yes, for sure. A book is small and a humble approach to impact billions (and so it's true, the Quran has, as has the Bible and The Way of the Tao, and the Baghavad Gita, etc.… \nThe question I have is, are we at the level of the Buddha? \nAre we receiving divine revelation? Have we let go enough to write this book with the right mental complexity and open-heartedness? I do not believe so, if only because if we were, we would do what we thought was 100% correct without compromise and without consideration for funders or budgets. \n\nAs for being able to fathom a billion dollars in a budget … I think that's definitely possible when broken down into tangible impacts on people's lives. $1 billion would give 1 million underprivileged university students $1000 for their education, etc., and we can talk to a bunch of them to see how the $1000 helped, etc. \n\nlet's delve into the distinctions between things that are released and not influenceable versus those that are maneuverable and influenceable, particularly concerning values and their impact on scalable endeavors.\n\nThere are entities in our world, like books or technological inventions such as a combined harvester, which are released into the world upon creation and subsequently operate beyond direct control or influence. Once released, their outcomes are largely determined by their inherent design or functionality. However, there exists another category of entities, such as technological platforms or social movements, where ongoing maneuverability and influence are possible. These platforms allow for constant learning, adjustment, and modification to enhance desired outcomes and mitigate undesired ones. Within this realm, values play a pivotal role.\n\nConsider the example of blitzscaling, militarized drones, or atomic bombs—technological advancements conceived and executed with varying values in mind. These innovations were brought into existence by individuals or entities guided by different sets of values, resulting in diverse impacts on society and the world at large. Thus, it becomes crucial to deliberate on how to foster and support endeavors driven by positive values and cultures, particularly those that are scalable.\n\nIt is imperative to direct our focus toward nurturing scalable initiatives that embody positive values and cultures. These initiatives encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from significant undertakings like movies, technological platforms, and cultural or religious movements to myriad smaller contributions that collectively contribute to larger positive transformations.\n\nIn essence, the pursuit of scalable endeavors with positive values entails a conscientious effort to prioritize ethical considerations and societal well-being in all facets of innovation and progress. By championing initiatives that align with virtuous values and cultures, we can collectively steer humanity toward a future characterized by compassion, equity, and sustainable development.\n\nI also like the idea of maintaining a connection with the people, the participants, the community, etc. This can be done for bigger or smaller things. \n\n>> BG: Interesting. I think I'd like to sit with your disagreement in a Google doc and actually reason by principles about it. \n\n>> DMN: Cool sounds good … and yes, good things there to think about. ?I think it's exciting contemplation, and I like the idea of feeling the human connection, but that also doesn't need to all be *me* feeling it to learn from it. \n\nSomething is interesting about culture, religion, or governance systems… systems, functioning systems, changing systems, etc. \n\nIn many ways, I believe in the importance of \"local governance\"… systems where people know and feel the impact of their decisions at a closer level (closer to the home). Still, other things are important and work better at a larger level (the state/region?), even larger (the country?), and even larger (international/universal / humanity / etc). \n\n~\n4.⁠ ⁠Regarding the next steps on the framework stuff … yes, I love it. Great progress on that. And sure, I would love to continue thinking about that stuff. \n\n~\n5.⁠ ⁠Regarding the next things for us … I think we should use the available overhead funds as efficiently as possible to help us move toward revenue generation. I don't think it should go to the backlog for either of us at this point (I think the backlog owed to me is probably now 3-4x more than owed to you … so that would consume all our current minimal savings and wouldn't help us move forwards) … \n\nWe have suggested focus areas for you in the OrgDev doc at the bottom of page 3 and the top of page 4.

Although selling white labeled versions of Bloom where we digest your learning library and make it actionable and fit in the DB, and also make matching assessments by reverse engineering (get the \"portfolio/evidence, make badges, make questions that lead to them) sounds like something we can make/sell right now that would be awesome. And the value add of credentialing and helping organizations make marketing material while simultaneously providing portfolio/evidence-based badges sounds like a triple win where the 'why do we have to take assessments' is answered with something valuable for everyone. \n\nDMN: We must improve our standard templates for \"what's a good library item\"… \n\nBG: Instead of a template, we can make a reviewing prompt and a script that uses it against our library to produce a report. To do this requires 3-5 good examples and some careful design; I suggest I do this and build it as a learning experience for our team. In this way, we can both have a rubric and also something that can give us a first-pass judge of what's wrong and a first-pass recommendation of where human hearts and minds need to focus. \n\nDMN: Would you like to look into that? Can you train an AI to format content for our Library of Activities? \n\nBG: Absolutely. That can be my weekly activity. It can also be where I include aligned evidence for all assessments—as long as we're there, we're there. \n\n\n\n\nDraft Text by A.I. after transcription:\nFirst Draft:\nDear Munir, \n\nIn our work, we often discuss the importance of measuring progress and tracking tasks on our taskboard.

These \"A.H.A.\" moments are the sparks that ignite fundamental transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard. It's like in our systems that we're designing, there's a thing between, you know, creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper, and they're taking an assessment, or, you know, on the phone or whatever, and they have an A.H.A moment. They commit in front of a colleague, their mentor, or one of their peer peers from the program, and then they're like, \"Yeah, I took this assessment. It made me realize this, and I will do this from now on.\" And I've decided to change them.\n\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound breakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their eyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of insight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this work in the first place. And, you know, like whatever it is, those moments of commitments, those moments of being witnessed, of togetherness, that's a great use of technology, right? And in terms of impact, let's count it by seconds. The rest of their life, the seconds are now in our impact bank, right? You can count on that, especially if they have confirmed their promise or if it was a deep enough moment.\n\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater sense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task managers. By prioritizing these moments of \"A.H.A.\" and presence in our work, we honor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact of our mission.\n\nI understand that measurable progress is essential, and I'm not suggesting we abandon our taskboards altogether. However, we need to find a balance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work. It's that moment right then and there with him, and it's present, and it's true, and it's real. And when you witness that, it's different than a recording. We need to acknowledge that and look at all of our recordings. Which ones have ever helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody? One is scalable; one we can put on WhatsApp and fast forward to a thousand people, and the other, you kind of have to have been there. And there's a thing about that - the moment, the presence, and the reality. That is also a part of what I'm getting at.\n\nPlease consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can create a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work and the life-changing potential of our live facilitations.

I am still reverberating, as I say it, with what we said, and so I'm going to try to get some thoughts out before I lose it.\n\nSo, I think one of them was around this idea of surprise and how, because of the VUCA world that we've been talking about for ages, I think it's essential to be a little bit more, \"Ah, humility is another thing that I believe is like a core value.\"\n\nAnd it leads me, it's like humility, you know how I was always like, \"Oh yeah, love of learning is my thing.\"\n\nAnd then I realized that when I love learning, it doesn't bring me to life, and you have to look deeper.\n\nThe thing that probably is bugging me about the different perspective isn't that it's just a different perspective; it is that it's like a value of humility that is missing, but humility is what leads me to value surprise.\n\nHumility is probably due to a different belief, which is why I think something about my belief system. I'm not sure what Mounier's belief system matters, and actually, one of the things I'm wondering about is how I got to that deep of a level.\n\nIt's not just your values; it's like how those values touch your perspective.\n\nFor me, many of my thoughts come from the Muslim tradition, which I think is the tradition of what I call \"Qataba today.\"\n\nIt's like the natural, the national realness.\n\nAnd yeah, this idea that people have this divine spark is really core to the concept of lighting a fire instead of filling a pail.\n\nSuppose you think in reductionist terms that there is a brain and that there's a mechanical world that humans are adapted to advantageously design systems around them to get fat and procreate more. We are winning the world because we're like that and can do it better with better systems. In that case, we have to get smarter and figure it out all of us in the world need to realize that in this dynamic, complex, crazy system, we have no idea what we're doing every time we put something in and so whenever you try to measure something it's basically like you're stepping on a water bed. You're trying to write on it while people are walking.\n\nAnd this is what Mounir is doing.\n\nSorry, please delete this.\n\nBut you get it?\n\nI'm not crazy, right?\n\nI'm not crazy about this, but I think that people are trying to reduce the world to something that one can comprehend.\n\nAnd once you can do that, you can control it to control the environment.\n\nLike, I'm sure maybe Mounir would be pro-climate control in terms of putting a bunch of, you know, would it sulfur into the air to reflect something or something?\n\nI don't know, like some people are there like we built it, we can rebuild it, and it'll be better.\n\nBut I think that instead of trusting a few people with a lot of resources to do these big-scale things that impact the ecosystem in such a horrible way if you think about it, the problem with the environment comes from the fact that wealth is controlled by such a small fraction of the population. They have outsized control because they think they know what good looks like and good looks like businesses. Initially, it was businesses where they did well, then businesses where they did well. Others do well enough, and then it's businesses where they do well, and others do well enough, and it supports the world and the planet that it's on, but it's still under the control of a few people.\n\nAnd that's what happens to complex systems is that they even more unpredictable when you have large outsized levers.\n\nAnd I think that maybe this is me and the whole vision that I have of a thousand flowers blooming, and the super bloom is not to have like a hundred billion dollar companies in the Middle East where they can then reinvest. We have the PayPal mafia, and they're trying to create the next generation of the hundred billion dollar companies, the Forbes 100 changes so dynamically all the time because people are vying for those billion-dollar spots, and the world changes.\n\nI don't think that's what I want.\n\nI think there's beauty in the small and the close, in the personal, in the meaningful, and in the humane. We have scale because we have the capacity for technology, but I also feel like technology needs to be within arms' reach.\n\nSo, for instance, it's essential that we invent the wheel.\n\nIt's a good invention.\n\nTechnology.\n\nAwesome.\n\nLove it.\n\nI think it's perfect that we invented the hoe.\n\nEven like the thing with the wheel and carriage on the calf.\n\nAwesome.\n\nIt lets us feed more people, and you can still touch your values and see them in action in the world.\n\nYou run over a cat while you're pulling the hoe.\n\nYou will cry.\n\nYou will be more careful next time.\n\nToday, we have combines that can tear up hundreds of acres in a day and are hundreds and hundreds of meters across.\n\nYou can't see the end when you're driving, and you're probably tearing up like thousands of cats, and you will never know.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's just one.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd then there's like all sorts of technologies that have this kind of outsized reach where farmers are committing suicide instead of farmers becoming friends with their neighbors because they rely on each other, and there's so much respect for the skill and the witnessing of nature and the ability for a farmer to feed you versus a farmer that is destroying the earth for a short-term profit knowing that they won't be able to do it their whole lives to fund some Monsanto giant corporation.\n\nAnd this is this is this is scale.\n\nThis is where I need help with technology.\n\nThis is where it goes from okay, valuable, cool, and wonderful to too much.\n\nAnd I feel like in our systems that we're designing, there's a thing between, you know, creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper. They're taking an assessment, or, you know, on the phone or whatever, and they have an aha moment. They commit in front of a colleague, their mentor, or one of their peer peers from the program, and then they're like, yeah, I took this assessment. Let me realize this. I will do this from now on, and I've decided to change them.\n\nAnd really you know like whatever it is that moments of commitments that moments of being witnessed of togetherness that's a great use of technology right and in terms of impact let's count it by seconds right the rest of their life the seconds are now in our impact bank right you can count that especially if they have been true to their promise if it was a deep enough moment people have near-death experiences they're transformed for life people go visit what's his face and the power within Tony Robbins they're changed for life that happens I know I met people like that and it's changed them and we can do that that's possible and Tony is slightly scalable he writes books he has his you know Waking the Tiger Within empowering the power within or whatever it is online where he has like screens in a giant circle around him and people are on zoom but he's there and it's his time and it's limited it's that moment right then and there with him and it's present and it's true and it's real and when you witness that it's different than a recording and I feel like we need to acknowledge that and look at our recordings all of them which ones has ever helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody and one is scalable one we can like put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand people and the other you kind of have to have been there and there's a thing about that the moment and the presence and the reality of it that I think is also a part of what I'm getting at in this subtle like linear versus dynamic or linear versus sfumato if you want to go Italian or like lingerie versus full frontal I don't know which one to call it but like this approach that I've been talking to you about and thinking about like why how I feel like I differ and I'm just gonna okay I'm using count this as the thing I might even send this as a part one and tell you not to listen to it I didn't see for me like recording to myself is very different than having a persona in mind and that's the thing that's here's another really important thing Mr.\n\nRogers when he was doing the T.V. shows, said that every time he looked into the camera, he had a specific child in his mind. He didn't just record videos. He was recording for someone. You can't for anything, which is where your humanity shows up for a stand for something when you're creating an autonomous system that doesn't include your human element, and for me, like when I came to Lebanon, I tried to do both like I was with Munir on the scalable stuff because it's essential. I also love the facilitation. I wanted to create a dynamic learning experience rather than a linear learning experience where people can do the right thing at the right time. Actually, you know Munir the way I wonder if you know how everything started but Munir was like can you run an entrepreneurship program?\n\nHere's our program and it was basically you know the business model canvas or something in a linear way one after another kind of boot campy or I don't know it was something and I had this realization that like you know we don't have to do it like this like not everyone needs the same thing from everyone else I think even Taro said this like one of the problems that they were having I was like asking people what are the problems of the programs like not everyone needs the same thing and so because I'm an aerator I'm like okay well how can we make it so people can do different things at the same time and that became pitch worthy and it became boom and the initial framework the initial like structure was like the pitch deck it's like it's the thing that gives the person the complete information as much as possible or at least it should you know the most important components and so if you do that right you do everything well right so once you get that right that's why it's pitch worthy it'd be worth pitching if you get that right and then it comes to the like personal and interpersonal because you have to work on yourself to be able to pitch you have to and so I found I thought that was like a really leverageable moment and I'm glad to see it still is there actually it's like the boot camp leads up to a pitch the sessions all of them right like it's it's there it's not moments of together in a live way that the transmission of the idea happens the question happens where the realness of what you're doing is palpably felt and is how people make decisions right I think it's really important you know and is related and you can even see that the intuition inside of the ecosystem has adapted right of course they always say they invest in people not the product they don't invest in the thing because a transforming person not a transformed person I think we need to change that language it's like a transforming person continuously a verb is going to be able to do things differently you know they're going to be able to be quiet as Joe is in the other room doing an interview for a job a transforming person you can see their trajectory and this is kind of why I wanted to bring you onto the board earlier rather than later because I could see you transforming nature and I could kind of see the direction I was like yeah that's that's what I want to go to you know and and yeah so I have been reflecting on so many things and I'm going to take a pause here and then try to start again I'm just going to tell you not to listen to this just in case I lose this audio\n\nOkay, yeah, so continuing the thing that I've been trying to parse is, like, what is the relationship between the way that Muneer wanted every assessment to make these levels move on the entrepreneurship scale from beginner to end in this linear sort of way, versus that being his intuition of good, total like the bar chart, what percentage of people in our programs are moving towards an exit versus my perspective of encouraging people to internalize the scriber framework and then disappearing until they need us or watching from afar and collecting stories of impact and being surprised 10 years later and making sure that it's true, it's real, it gets implemented, it's trained well, and it's actually helping, but it's about respected as well.\n\nAnd this is like an upside-down pyramid is really like some of these other values that don't sound fun, like humility, respect, you know, the things that your dad might say, those are the things that I feel are, sorry, I don't mean your dad, I mean, you know, like not so fun and love, humor, joy stuff, which is also essential but like, I do think that the thing that might be different is this respecting people, because they contain a flame that is worth fighting and to watch and to be in witness and awe, and to be in the uncertainty of what that person will do.\n\nAnd, of course, to help them guide, help them learn how to guide themselves, connect them to new ideas and new things, inspire frameworks, help them expand their view of what's possible and what's important, tell them to value the parts of themselves that they don't value necessarily and to help them realize that that is potentially what businesses need so that when they apply when they start their business, they can say hey, I'm bringing humor and it's worth it, or hey I'm bringing humility, and it's worth it, you know, and to talk about, these are like simple ways of talking about these things, and this is not want to talk about values, and we'll talk about values in a more prosperous way.\n\nBut even in this simple way, the basic idea is coming across.\n\nAnd so, I feel like this difference might fundamentally be a difference in our perspective of what a human being is.\n\nAnd I think I think it's clear from how I talk and do programs and design things that for me, there's something precious there that needs to be respected and trusted, and that the other important thing is that God, to me, isn't a once and done God and that he didn't create the universe and step out and that we're here. It's mechanical; everything clicks and clacks and goes forward. The deterministic and even like quantum is like opening some weird doors for people, but even then, they're like, yeah, it doesn't have any real say for what happens in this world, and even if you can figure it out, once you figure out the quantum world it's just another just weird click, click, right?\n\nIt's like, okay, so that was entangled in that way, and we're creating quantum computers. You can see that even this, like quantifying the quantum and practicalizing the uncertainty of that weird world, is just another type of reductionistic perspective.\n\nBut in my worldview and in the listening worldview, I think many tribal and native people like there to be continual unfolding and new, right?\n\nAnd that new, you can, you go, and I think that's why you are in awe when you see something majestic; it's the first time you've ever seen it.\n\nThe first time the baby held his foot, he was in awe; I swear you could see it in his eyes.\n\nFirsts are always awful in the best of ways, so when you have humility and acknowledge that you trust somebody, that's the other thing; that's where love comes from, too, right?\n\nAs you say, hey listen, so here's the framework, here's how you teach yourself as I believe in your goodness, and I think that you can figure out the qualities that you were born with that make you who you are and that you can figure out how to bring that out into the world in a beautiful way.\n\nIf you have leadership qualities and are inclined toward that way, I believe that you can form a team of people around a beautiful vision.\n\nAnd if the vision is beautiful enough, you'll do the right thing.\n\nAnd we don't even have to use the word social enterprise. You know, we use the ability for people to recognize their sources of beauty and their skills and to motivate them and inspire them to act.\n\nI feel like this is how learning works, right?\n\nYou have a thing that you direct yourself towards, and this is why, sometimes, we might not know why we're learning, right?\n\nWhen you like a person, you suddenly learn a lot about the music they like and the backgrounds of the countries they visited, or, you know, it's because of love, right?\n\nOne thing.\n\nAnd so the other thing is because in our world today, you need to eat food and have a stable life and structure.\n\nThe way that we do that today is by exchanging value for money.\n\nAnd I think the challenge and the important thing is to look at this.\n\nAnd I think this is why earlier entrepreneurship education is more valuable.\n\nWhen people are in high school or college where somebody else is paying for things, they will need to figure out how to answer that question.\n\nBut if they can really know who they are and be in that transforming state when they leave college, I hope they don't have to compromise like many people today.\n\nSo many people today wind up going into, what do you say, like day trading.\n\nI know people who were super bright and loved math.\n\nThey had a talent and a divine skill, God-given, you could even say.\n\nI can sanitize my language of the word God if you prefer, but that's one simple and, for me, true; we just have to define God.\n\nBut still, God-given the talent to do mathematics, and I wanted to pursue it.\n\nThey told me that I was going to go to the stock floor in New York and work for X number of years.\n\nAnd then I'm going to get back to it.\n\nJust to pay off my student loans.\n\nAnd so these things like student loans, pressure from parents and family, these exogenous motives that aren't in AIDS corrupt the ability for someone to see clearly the question that God asked with their birth.\n\nAnd this is entrepreneurship in some way that entrepreneur is like, Who am I?\n\nWhere am I here?\n\nWhat skills have I been given?\n\nBecause I really believe that, fundamentally, the thing that makes life really meaningful is giving all that you can with all that you are and feeling used and valuable.\n\nLike the blessings that are infinitely showering down on you, the fact that you have this billion-person ancestry makes it possible for you to live in this moment, where you can take a train from Turkey to Paris and fly to New York, taste the foods of the world, and have a family to hold your nieces or nephews' hands like there's just such beauty, right?\n\nThat you've been given, we've been all given.\n\nAnd I think that there's gratitude for sure.\n\nAnd then also, what can you do to contribute to creating beauty and to doing that most meaningful thing for others?\n\nAnd sometimes that looks like you're a researcher because that's how you best utilize the things.\n\nAnd sometimes the things that were given to you from birth, and that you've, you know, whatever your early life experience, there's this, you know, they say that there's this moment of Elysium, right, the river and that when you die, you're reincarnated, you come back, you have all of the world's knowledge, but then you drink the waters of Elysium, and then you're born again.\n\nAnd that's where it all ends.\n\nBut I really think that there's everyone gets shaped into this unique crystal of, you know, however, your parents traumatized you and whatever society that you grew up in, the ideas that you've had and the innate inclinations that are, you know, partially biological, partially, you know, divine in origin, or just who you are, whatever that is, right?\n\nAll of that comes together before you're aware of it.\n\nIn my opinion, the waters of Elysium are the last sip of mother's milk because that usually starts coming when there's a little bit of awareness beginning to peak up, and you're there—you have arrived.\n\nAnd so that little kid, three or four, I don't know how old, that very little kid, I think has the qualities, maybe six, I don't know, but it's like this early childhood.\n\nThis is why I think maybe one thing we need to look into in our programs is Venso Shar's talk about her childhood.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I wanted to be an inventor.\n\nI've always had ideas.\n\nThis is me. I'm in my element when I'm coming up with ideas, implementing them, doing them, and nerding out like I'm totally in the zone. I ignore everybody, leaving me alone, and building stuff, you know.\n\nAnd if you look into your life, there's something like that.\n\nAnd I think, like, in the Muslim tradition, it says God doesn't do anything for no reason.\n\nAnd in the chaotic system that we're talking about, that is non-ambitious and locally relevant, where, you know, you don't optimize for the whole at the expense of the local, right?\n\nThat's what I think you could say that some people do when they're like, okay, screw here, I'm going to fly to New Zealand and get a bunker, but build a business that works internationally.\n\nOkay.\n\nNo, look at yourself.\n\nLook at your surroundings.\n\nThat's what the news is.\n\nThat's where the genius is.\n\nGenius loci was what genius used to be.\n\nIt's the genius in a space.\n\nIt's not a genius.\n\nBecause the person is so cool.\n\nLook, we put them on the pedestal.\n\nIt's the combination of everything right there that makes sense.\n\nAnd in Arabic, there's this thing called adab, A-T-A-B.\n\nAnd that's when things are in the right place.\n\nSomeone in the right relationship is in the right place, doing the right thing, using their gifts in the right way, and interacting in a relevant way within the context they are aware of.\n\nAnd then, if we take on this deliberately developmental framework and Leo, Theo Dawson, and P.I.J. and all that, you can realize that there are moments when it might not make sense for somebody to start an international business because they don't have the mental complexity to handle it.\n\nAnd we encouraging everybody to go big or go home destroys the possibility of people being mua-dabine, M-U-A-T-A-B-E-E-N, and being in the right place, using the skills for the right thing at the right time.\n\nAnd this ambition is the problem, which usually comes from something other than an innate place.\n\nYou know?\n\nFrequently, we would run programs, and people would say, \"I want to run a hair salon.\"\n\nAnd we're like, \"No, no, no.\"\n\nCan't you think of something scalable?\"\n\nNo, they shouldn't until that happens.\n\nThey should develop a hair salon that serves a real need, does it uniquely, and makes money.\n\nMaybe it's their kids that are going to go to school and be able to have the mental complexity for the other one.\n\nOr once they satisfy their fundamental needs, they can settle into a routine, and they start, I don't know, having evening hours for contemplating or reading, or they get exposed to different communities because they're now business owners, then maybe.\n\nBut we were trying to do that early because that's what funders want. After all, we want to impress investors.\n\nI don't want to impress investors unless they invest in transformation, not in the lining of their pockets too soon.\n\nI think investing needs to change.\n\nIt needs to have a different measure.\n\nIt's like I was talking about algebra versus calculus.\n\nYou don't just add, add, add.\n\nYou need to measure rates of change.\n\nSo, rather than an investor looking at how fast your bank account grows and how fast it's possible to get this return, I was talking to my friend Doug.\n\nAnd I like Doug, and I think he's smart, but I think he's really dumb at the same time about this particular thing: he really believes in the power.\n\nI may need to change my mind about this because I can see his point in the individual with a lot of money to do a lot of good.\n\nAnd that is what he wants to invest in because it creates the aristocracy of modernity, where people can do things that make no sense, like start a foundation.\n\nWe don't have the divine right of kings or aristocracy or the ability to enslave people officially.\n\nWe have to create structures that we own and that create outsized value.\n\nI think it's possible to do that in a good way.\n\nAnd I think Doug is that kind of person.\n\nAnd totally, it makes sense.\n\nBut I think incentivizing the entire ecosystem towards this end.\n\nFirst, one problem I see is that everyone knows capitalism needs to change very soon and must be restructured.\n\nAnd that pretending like we can build the same kind of businesses without creating wealth inequality that destroys the fabric of society that's already happening.\n\nIt's there.\n\nBillionaires are one of the most hated populations on the planet, even while their numbers keep growing.\n\nAnd I think there are some exciting things about the adab, like the right place and the right person who has the right kind of framing and structure, as well as the individual who can hold that space well.\n\nAnd it might be only held well in collectives.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI'm just thinking about this now, but I'm not sure I buy into this idea of scale, partially because of the technological element and the problems that we discussed above about expanding beyond your reach of comprehension.\n\nAnd then partially because of the systems that satisfy human needs.\n\nSo learning, returning to that as the core of what's happening, happens when there's an objective. Then, an individual explores, experiences, and reflects along the path toward the subjective.\n\nAnd so what is the objective?\n\nAnd this is why we start with why, right?\n\nBecause once you get the right way, an objective is right for you.\n\nI think that's another thing we should add to the start, which is why things need to be right for you.\n\nIt needs to be your why, not just start with why.\n\nIt's like starting with your why.\n\nWhen you get that, you will learn everything you need to know to achieve that objective.\n\nAnd if the objective is embarrassing to share in front of others, because it's like, well, somebody actually in my last cohort was like, I want money.\n\nThat's another reason you have to ask a couple of levels deep.\n\nAnd, of course, people want money.\n\nThey need money.\n\nWe're in a world where there's a lot of difficulty.\n\nThis is why, partially, I would be open to only working with college students and under and having that be a cap.\n\nAnd I don't think describing why we need this cap is a horrible idea.\n\nInitially, I wanted to change the world by getting people to do things.\n\nBut I realized that we don't know what those things are.\n\nAnd it's probably...\n\nLike if we had started with this vision 10 years ago, I would have been a youth back then, and it only makes sense now.\n\nBut if we started with this 10 years ago, today's generation would have failed the correct number of times and grown the right number of times in their mental complexity and capacity. That leadership could potentially be scalable and have a high impact and change the world businesses and their world businesses correctly.\n\nSo, I think I'm trying to develop a better language.\n\nIt's not that I don't like scale and want scale, as I want the right people doing things right for them.\n\nAnd that requires us to be more humble and trust rather than know what we want to see in the world, pay to make it happen, promise investors and funders that we will create X number of social enterprises that create Y number of impacted individuals, pull X number of people out of poverty, feed the hungry, and solve the climate crisis at the same time.\n\nI think I would instead measure those inputs rather than the outputs.\n\nLike, are we creating transformational experiences?\n\nDo we trust in the innate goodness of people, and do they feel committed?\n\nLike, how can we measure their commitments towards their why?\n\nAnd we ask them, is your why still? Are you still on fire about your why?\n\nYeah, why or why not?\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, if you're still on fire, what are you doing about it?\n\nAre you learning?\n\nWhy or why not?\n\nOkay, if you're not learning, do you need mentorship?\n\nDo you need community?\n\nDo you know yourself?\n\nThis is where we get into the inner work stuff.\n\nAnd so it's about something other than scale.\n\nIt's about the right person scaling at the right time in their life and being ready because, you know, you give a teenager a Ferrari, and they're going to kill themselves.\n\nDon't give a teenager a Ferrari.\n\nThey shouldn't even be in the car.\n\nWe shouldn't even encourage them to make crypto money to buy a Lambo, right?\n\nBut there are these kids out there.\n\nAnd I'm sure definitely, if I look, I don't want to.\n\nSome silly kid got rich in crypto and is dead in a Lambo.\n\nThat would be like the equivalent.\n\nThat would be the thing.\n\nThat could be the name of this.\n\nThis podcast or this blog post is Don't Put the Crypto Kids in the Ferrari or something like that.\n\nThat was 45 minutes.\n\nOkay, so I talked a lot.\n\nI talked a lot about a lot of things.\n\nI don't know, Dada, if I missed anything from what I shared with you.\n\nBut I will.\n\nYeah, transcribe this, cluster the concepts with A.I., and then follow the inspiring framework. By the way, it's inspiring.\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nIt's evolving, and I'm getting deeper and deeper as I look into it and realize that we're really getting back to the fundamentals of research.\n\nThis is another thing of humility.\n\nIt's like, don't make things up yourself.\n\nRealize that you're aligning along a movement and a tiny part of a wave peeking your head up and realizing that you're an individual and a more significant thing.\n\nAnd this is why it's not about us scaling and taking over the world.\n\nImagine a tsunami.\n\nWe shouldn't be a tsunami.\n\nWe should be a wave that goes forth, nourishes the shore, leaves space for the crabs, and draws back out when the tide goes, and then somebody else is going to come in our place, and we're a part of this way.\n\nAnd we'll come back to, you know, maybe next year, maybe next program.\n\nWho knows?\n\nMaybe we do need to take this break.\n\nBut I really think that these intuitions about humility, trusting others, and being a part of a movement are already happening.\n\nInstead of Cree using our platform or us integrating with Cree or whatever, it's okay for there to be diversity.\n\nThe most beautiful world is the one where you see two birds that are almost the same, but they're different.\n\nEach of them has their unique qualities, and you love them.\n\nRight?\n\nAnd there are many people, and there's a lot of growing up to do as humanity.\n\nAnd I think we can be part of that if we're humble, respect the soul, and genuinely believe in people's fundamental goodness and their ability to sacrifice. If you think about it, working on change is to work on a mini-death.\n\nIt's like a very Jesus moment, right?\n\nIt's like, who do you need to become?\n\nAnd then when you do that, you know, the process of that, you're nailing yourselves to the cross.\n\nYou know, this is super. I figured it might as well: If I'm going to go all Muslim, I should get some Jesus style up here, too.\n\nYou know, I consider myself to be a Muslim and a very fitly, naturally oriented person.\n\nBut anyway, that's just my perspective.\n\nOkay, I'm going to work on something else now.\n\nAnd I'll let this simmer in my mind.\n\nAnd I'll listen to something else.\n\nAnd thank you for the call.\n\nThank you for the money and for actually bringing up the idea of being a co-founder.\n\nI think that's promising.\n\nAnd yeah, I should pay attention to his messages.\n\nI'm just at the point where I don't want to look and don't want to talk.\n\nAnd like when we had that call, and he was trying to do that alignment, I was like, Oh, no, yeah, this is not my place.\n\nThis is not for me.\n\nBut yeah, I think if you're right he's changing.\n\nAnd if you're right he thinks differently and wants to go slower.\n\nThat's another thing I wanted to remember to tell myself to go slower: raising enough money so that we can do the right things rather than the fast things because we think we can leverage that to do something else.\n\nI'm actually thinking about taking all of my savings from crypto, which I never touched because I'm like a 1520 30-year crypto person, and whatever it is right now, taking it out.\n\nAnd just like investing in me and spending more time working on the badges, I thought that could be cool.\n\nPay for an apartment, you know, for him to visit once a month, and I can only work with him in person.\n\nSo I would pay for that.\n\nOr to explore, like working with the boy or something else, and give myself space, right?\n\nAlso, I already paid advanced rent to Josephine for about four months because I don't want to worry about it.\n\nI want to be able to think, be free, plan, and do, and learn about myself, how I like to work, and what my role is in this world.\n\nObviously, a big part of it is talking.\n\nI hope that this isn't like arrogance or just too foul.\n\nAnd I hope that it's inspired because sometimes I do feel inspired.\n\nI feel like, where the hell is this coming from?\n\nYou know, you could give me a microphone and a topic, and I could go on for an hour.\n\nBut anything, I think, you know, because I would connect it to something else.\n\nI see within myself, and I'm learning as I speak.\n\nIt's the craziest thing.\n\nI feel this kind of trust in the Socratic method and the ability to discover something beautiful and unique in others rather than try to get them to conform to a scale.\n\nEven though I think we can do both right now,\n\nWe can build the bridge, and the glue is chagipiti.\n\nAnd I realized that Chagipiti has all of the past but not the continual present unfolding within me right now.\n\nAnd the less I go, the less I'm going to describe this phrase, these languages, these thoughts, the deeper I go and the less contrived and the less stuck on the past I am and coming from a moment of like deep stillness.\n\nI'm not orthogonally positioned to the rest of the vector spaces.\n\nAnd that is the gold of the future.\n\nAnd that is what we're trying to help the teams discover as their unique voice.\n\nAnd that is the right thing for them to say right now, not the right thing that an investor wants to hear because of the past.\n\nLet's leverage these large language models to bridge the qualitative and the quantitative by reducing the number of qualitative decisions and increasing the number of human interaction moments.\n\nAnd that measure is like quality human moments of human interaction.\n\nQ-M-O-H-I.\n\nIf you get it for a week, get their daily bread.\n\nYou only get your daily bread when you have a quality moment of human interaction.\n\nAnd you can get to that after you've exhausted your capacity to be surfing your growth edge.\n\nThe state of flow is for a person who has identified their why. They know themselves and understand the motives that might be exogenous or external.\n\nAnd they are on a developmental path where they realize this.\n\nAnd maybe that could be the next badge system.\n\nInstead of us trying to guess developmentally where people are, are they in a socialized state of mind?\n\nOr are they self-transforming?\n\nOr where on the scale can they hold a complex system and work on it because they have the mental flexibility to do that?\n\nOr should they be more in a tribal situation where they understand all their neighbors and they're going to sell them the boulangerie or get the coiffel?\n\nIf we tell people that this is an essential element and also tell people about stories of the failure points where successful people realize they had failed themselves because they didn't become, they followed a trend or something like that.\n\nAnd then also the money question is huge.\n\nSo, either, this is why I always wanted to try to turn our programs into cooperatives, where if anybody were successful, there would be a baseline salary when you came into the program.\n\nI know people think like an American would be like, that's not great.\n\nThat's not going to incentivize them to work hard and suffer.\n\nWell, that's because we're changing the incentives mechanism.\n\nAnd if people aren't incentivized by their why and they're not on fire, that should be the other thing we're measuring.\n\nIf they're not inspired by that enough to kill themselves or whatever.\n\n\nIf they're not inspired enough not to kill themselves, I really should not have said that, but like if they're not inspired enough to like to push and in a balanced way, realize, well, first of all, if they're not inspired enough by what they're doing, it won't motivate them to act.\n\nBut also, that inspiration sits in the same chest, in the same way as the love of your children.\n\nAnd this is where \"work-life balance\" comes from because it's not opposites that you're comparing; it's not you're looking at your children and thinking they're going to starve because you have to hustle to bring home the bacon.\n\nIt's, \"I will die if I don't feed my inspiration.\n\nThis is how meaning comes into my life, how I can smile honestly, and how I can show my child what it means to be human, right?\n\nAnd I need to make time for my family.\"\n\nAnd that light, they're both light.\n\nYou can hold this in your heart at the same time.\n\nI don't think you can hold your baby and stress about your boss firing you at the same time in the same kind of way.\n\nThey're different.\n\nSo, I think there's an essential financial element that we need to incorporate into our programs to relieve stress, increase duration, and really change everything.\n\nThis is the transforming nature that needs to happen.\n\nPeople are talking about new forms of work and trying to integrate more education into classrooms.\n\nAnd I really wonder if we look.\n\nThere are certainly some people that can change, right?\n\nThere are certainly people who have an innate inclination toward something in their childhood, but they're not exposed to something different in their adult lives.\n\nIt might totally invigorate and inspire them, and then they might just fall down, like, \"Oh my God, I should have been a Tibetan Buddhist, and I'm going to move to Tibet and become a follower of the Dalai Lama, and that's it.\"\n\nI met people, literally people that are like that, and her name is, it doesn't matter, she's excellent.\n\nAnd it might be a complete surprise.\n\nAnd so that is one of the questions.\n\nThe other thing about first principles is that when we talk about the foundation of things, we also need to get the first principles of things.\n\nAnd so, some of my first principles are that humans are good.\n\nThere's goodness that wants to come through humans.\n\nAnd this partially comes from two things.\n\nOne is rational, and the other is emotional, spiritual belief.\n\nThe rational one is if I didn't believe that most people don't have a potential psychological problem, mental disability, or tumor in their brain that suppresses their compassion, most people are fundamental; they have goodness that wants to flow through them.\n\nAnd if that weren't true, if that wasn't true, I would kill myself.\n\nThis is in the reductionist, \"I don't believe in God\" world, okay?\n\nBecause I wouldn't want to be in a world like that, where I had to look over my back and not trust anybody and think that everyone's a potential sociopath. It would be exhausting and complicated, and not actually the experience I have.\n\nThe reality is that if people aren't traumatized, hurt, or suffering, most of them want to be friendly, kind, and generous, and a few might, no matter what happens, have these negative traits.\n\nAlso, most people aren't living in a peaceful world where everything's okay.\n\nPeople are hurt by their families; they're hurt by society, and they're hurt by many things that create contortions that cause people to behave in ways against themselves.\n\nBut like I said at the beginning of this giant monologue, there's a good part of us that wants to come forth.\n\nSo that's like one of the foundational beliefs.\n\nAnother foundational belief, which I don't know, is that it's better to go up into the system of transformation and generation than into the systems of creation and concretization of measurement.\n\nIt's better to measure human interaction and the uncertainty of conversation that will manifest in the now and in the present and to reduce the investment in measuring the past, the done deal, and the money in the bank, especially because that's all dead.\n\nThis is a life.\n\nAnd sure, money in the bank is essential, but what if we started measuring the other thing?\n\nI think we would change capitalism in a way.\n\nWe would actually talk more about it, like, imagine if the measurement was family conversations over dinner.\n\nDinner would have to be there, right?\n\nSo the farmer has the farm and all that.\n\nBut if the farmer is stressing out and overexerting and trying to get the combine, and it's working all day and all night, and then it's getting robots, whatever, and then the farmer doesn't have a job anymore, so he's on the streets, and he's begging, then we're not having quality family conversations over dinner.\n\nAnd another important element here is quality.\n\nHow are we going to measure that?\n\nAre we going to use an A.I.?\n\nIs this a good conversation?\n\nOr are we going to ask people how they feel?\n\nWhat was meaningful about it?\n\nThis will be able to expose the values.\n\nAnd then, if these are the things that we measure, these are the types of businesses that are approaching those measurements, which are going to be the ones that are meaningful for everybody.\n\nAnd then it's like holding those two lights in your chest.\n\nIt's not my children or my inspiration.\n\nIt's not me winning in my business or you winning in yours.\n\nIt's like some values are essential, like the fundamental need for a shared humanity where people are respected, able to pursue meaning, and have lived with the fundamental human rights of food and water and all of this stuff, right?\n\nIf that is the baseline and we measure our business accordingly by finding the things that we find most meaningful, that's your why.\n\nThis is why, actually, here, this is an exciting part.\n\nThis is how we can transform the start with why.\n\nWe need to start asking people for meaningful moments and do Joe Edelman's process of values articulation.\n\nWhen they can articulate their values, they speak both their why and potentially the thing that they want to measure and see happen, or at least as a proxy for it.\n\nSo, for instance, let me think about it, and you start with emotions, which are values articulated by finding an emotion.\n\nAnd so, yeah, for me, oh my goodness, well, a lot of my emotions these days are about faith and trust and commitments to a spiritual tradition because I struggled a lot with that in my younger years.\n\nAnd, you know, the right way to do it would be to go deep into the story, but I'm already an hour and a half into this conversation.\n\nSo, I have found myself committing and walking a path based on an inner sight and knowing that it is real and as real as seeing with my eyes because there's trial and confirmation, you know, like you see with your eyes. Something looks like a step, and you can step on it, and it'll hold you up, and it's great.\n\nIt's real, you've confirmed.\n\nSimilarly, I see something that looks like a step with my heart.\n\nIt says there are promises, for instance, in the tradition that you will not give charity and will be impoverished.\n\nSo, you step on that step with faith and confidence and see if it holds you up.\n\nAnd, alhamdulillah, as I have had in the last weeks and months, there is more and more confirmation that there's a glass bridge.\n\nAnd I realize, for me, this glass bridge is real, and it elevates people.\n\nQuite like in my imagination, you see these people, and they are of good character, and they're flying high, and they're in the sky, and they yell down, and they say, I'm not flying, it's a glass bridge.\n\nI'm just walking on a glass bridge, bro.\n\nAnd then, you're at the edge of this thing and can't see it, but you stub it with your toe, and you're like, oh shoot, there's something here.\n\nWhat the heck is this?\n\nYou follow your inspiration, try to see with the eye of your heart, and start walking with trepidation.\n\nImagine you can't see anything at all, and it looks like you're in the sky, stepping one foot after another.\n\nAt any moment, you lose faith and feel like you can fall down a thousand feet, but you're walking, and the more you walk, the more confidence you gain in the reality of this unseen thing that people think you're crazy about.\n\nBut it's just glass. It's just transparent.\n\nAnd it's like, you know, you know how some things are transparent to different wavelengths but opaque to others?\n\nIt's transparent to the eyes in your head that are all thinking, but it's real and solid to the eye of the heart.\n\nAnd it will allow you to do things that will make me, allow me to do things that make me proud of myself and go through difficulty gracefully and understand things differently and cause that understanding to become a kind of a unique life that is, for me, really beautiful.\n\nAnd I think the thing—again, I'm just going to come back to it—is this idea of surprise.\n\nAnd awe and humility and all of that, and how it connects to this moment of amazement and being like, \"Oh my God, is the soul real?\n\nAre we not just meat machines?\n\nOh my God, this is real.\n\nI'm on this bridge.\n\nI think I believe this.\"\n\nAnd so, for me, realizing that I believe this and that so much of my inspiration also comes from the Muslim tradition.\n\nAs you can see in our old table, there's like the 99 names of God.\n\nI was trying to align them to the via because I really believe in these values, articulation, parallelism, and creation, and that the one God revealed only one religion to the whole world to align them with their most natural state.\n\nAnd it's just us who can get confused and get lost.\n\nAnd because we're overly complicated brains, we think, you know, to be safe, I need to hoard money or to be safe, I need to push other people down.\n\nAnd it's fear and the confusion that creates all of this stuff.\n\nAnd when you live according to your values, trust, vision, beauty, and wonder, first of all, it's true that you might die.\n\nPeople in Al-Qaza, they believe, and they die.\nThe question is:\nAre we here to save the world or are we here to be saved by the world?\nAnd you see the people of “Gaza” lose everything but they win purity of heart.\n\nBut you see also, they die with dignity, and they die happy, and they die consented with God.\n\nAngry with the people killing them, of course, but I do not see, and I have not heard so many people talking to their dead children, asking them to send their regards to the Prophet.\n\nThat's surprising.\n\nAnd that's beautiful, and that's amazing.\n\nAnd I think that when I start really realizing, \"Whoa, this is crazy.\n\nI can't believe; I believe in God.\"\n\nIt's about surprise, awe, wonder, and amazement and how that results in the frameworks, beauty, and way that we do our programs. I measure different things and values and how they're all connected to summarize this.\n\ncan you help me turn this into an essay? Think step by step about how to take my stream of consciousness conversation and turn it into an essay and then ask me to provide 5 answers to the questions you need to produce a high quality thought piece. once you prepare yourself i'll give you the content\nAbsolutely! I'd be happy to help you transform your stream of consciousness conversation into a well-structured essay. To do this effectively, I'll follow these steps:\nRead through your content carefully to understand the main ideas and themes.\nIdentify the central topic or argument that emerges from your conversation.\nOrganize the content into a logical structure, grouping related ideas together.\nDevelop an outline for the essay, including an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.\nIdentify any gaps in information or areas that need further clarification or development.\nOnce I've completed these initial steps, I'll provide you with five questions to help gather the necessary information to create a high-quality thought piece. Please provide your stream of consciousness conversation whenever you're ready, and I'll begin the process of turning it into an essay.\nCopy\nAlright, I'm gonna do a really brief download because I feel like we had a great conversation and I am still kind of reverberating, as I say it, with what we said and so I'm gonna try to, before I los\nPASTED\nBG\nok, sounds great, and at each phase review all the other phases and give constructive critique. I'm especially interested in the clusters of concepts Here is the content:\nAbsolutely, I'll follow the steps we outlined to transform your stream of consciousness into a well-structured essay. After reviewing the content, here are the five key questions I have to help gather the information needed to create a high-quality thought piece:\nYour conversation touches on many interconnected themes like humility, surprise, human goodness, entrepreneurship, technology, and faith. What do you see as the central argument or unifying theme that ties these various ideas together?\nYou contrast two differing worldviews or belief systems several times - one that is more reductionist and mechanistic, and one that allows for uncertainty, wonder and the \"divine spark\" in people. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these perspectives and why you feel the latter is so important?\nScalability and \"scaling at the right time\" comes up frequently. What is the right way to think about scale in entrepreneurship and education in your view? When is seeking scale good and when is it problematic?\nThe ideas of measuring \"quality human interaction moments\" and having businesses focus on non-financial metrics that reflect human/societal wellbeing are intriguing. Can you expand on what shifting to these alternative metrics might look like practically and how it could transform business and the economy?\nFaith, spirituality and acting from \"an inner sight and knowing\" are clearly important guiding forces for you, but may be unfamiliar to some readers. How would you explain the link between spirituality, values and your views on entrepreneurship and education to someone less versed in these traditions?\nLet me know your thoughts on these questions. I'll then work on clustering the key concepts, developing an outline, and drafting the actual essay. At each stage, I'll review the previous steps to make sure the core ideas are being captured and communicated clearly.

Can you elaborate on the key differences between these perspectives and why you feel the latter is so important?\nCopy\nBG\nthe reductionist believes that everything is here and it's just a matter of recombination. the other approach can bring in something new from god Say, \"If were the sea ink, for (the) Words (of) my Lord, surely (would be) exhausted the sea before [that] (were) exhausted (the) Words (of) my Lord, even if We brought (the) like (of) it (as) a supplement.\"\ni think first of all the real vacuum for a person puts them in th driers seat really, you can't drive for them. by forcing teams into measures we undrstand we reinforce systems that most people recognize as broken, particularly around wealth inequality.\nrespecting people, even people who don't speak english, or write or read. seeing them as totally human and a portal to the infinite mystery - who has a part of them that's in witness of the divine, that if i can see /touch connect with this\nImportant belief:\nSay, \"If were the sea ink, for (the) Words (of) my Lord, surely (would be) exhausted the sea before [that] (were) exhausted (the) Words (of) my Lord, even if We brought (the) like (of) it (as) a supplement.\"\nThis verse from the Quran beautifully illustrates the contrast between the two worldviews. The reductionist perspective suggests that everything in the universe can be understood and explained through the recombination of existing elements, implying a finite and ultimately comprehensible reality. In contrast, the verse points to the infinite and inexhaustible nature of God's Words, which can be interpreted as the limitless potential for new creation, knowledge, and experience.\nEmbracing uncertainty and wonder opens up the possibility for personal growth and societal progress by encouraging individuals to explore uncharted territories, both within themselves and in the world around them. When we recognize that there is always more to discover and learn, we are motivated to push beyond our current limitations and seek out new ideas and experiences. This mindset fosters innovation, creativity, and a willingness to take risks, which are essential for personal and collective advancement.\nYour example of respecting people who may not speak English, read, or write, and seeing them as portals to the infinite mystery, highlights the transformative power of recognizing the \"divine spark\" in others. By acknowledging the inherent dignity and potential in every individual, regardless of their background or abilities, we create opportunities for meaningful connection and mutual understanding. This recognition can break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and foster a sense of unity and compassion that transcends superficial differences.\nMoreover, when we appreciate the divine spark within ourselves, we tap into a source of inner wisdom, resilience, and purpose that can guide us through life's challenges and uncertainties. This inner connection allows us to navigate the world with greater clarity, confidence, and authenticity, as we align our actions with our deepest values and aspirations.\nIn summary, the key differences between the reductionist/mechanistic worldview and the perspective that allows for uncertainty, wonder, and the divine spark in people are:\nThe former sees reality as finite and ultimately comprehensible, while the latter acknowledges the infinite potential for new creation and discovery.\nThe reductionist view may limit our understanding of human potential and capacity for change, while embracing uncertainty and wonder encourages personal growth and societal progress.\nRecognizing the divine spark in others fosters meaningful connection, compassion, and unity, while acknowledging it within ourselves provides a source of inner wisdom and purpose.\nUltimately, embracing a worldview that allows for uncertainty, wonder, and the divine spark in people is essential for unlocking our full potential as individuals and as a society, and for creating a more inclusive, compassionate, and meaningful world.\nCopy\nBG\nok, let's continue onto the next step ask me three questions to prepare yourself for Organize the content into a logical structure, grouping related ideas together.\nGreat! Before I organize the content into a logical structure and group related ideas together, I'd like to ask you three questions to ensure I have a clear understanding of your perspective and the key points you want to emphasize:\nIn your opinion, what are the three most important ideas or themes from your stream of consciousness that you want to highlight in the essay?

They provide valuable insights into the key themes you want to explore and the overall direction you envision for the essay. Let me propose three alternative flows for the essay, each with a specific main goal and objective:\nFlow 1: The Importance of Surprise and Humility in Personal and Societal Transformation\nMain Goal: To argue that embracing surprise and humility is essential for fostering genuine transformation in individuals and society, especially during times of change.\nObjective: Encourage readers to value the role of surprise and humility in their personal lives and in shaping societal progress.\nIntroduction: Present the central idea that transformational times require transforming people who regularly change.\nThe Limitations of Goal-Setting: Discuss how an overemphasis on setting and achieving goals can hinder authentic personal growth and limit our ability to adapt to new circumstances.\nThe Power of Surprise: Explore how surprise, rooted in humility, allows for unexpected discoveries and growth opportunities.\nCultivating Humility: Examine ways to foster humility and openness to surprise in personal development and education.\nSocietal Implications: Consider how embracing surprise and humility can lead to more inclusive, adaptable, and resilient communities.\nConclusion: Reiterate the importance of surprise and humility in navigating change and fostering meaningful transformation.\nFlow 2: Redefining Success: Quality over Scale\nMain Goal: To challenge the prevailing notion that scale and objective outcomes should be the primary measures of success, advocating instead for a focus on quality and meaning.\nObjective: Encourage readers to reassess their definition of success and consider the importance of prioritizing quality and meaning in their personal and professional lives.\nIntroduction: Present the central idea that our current systems often prioritize scale over quality, leading to a misguided understanding of success.\nThe Pitfalls of Scale: Discuss how an overemphasis on scale can lead to negative consequences, such as wealth inequality and a lack of genuine fulfillment.\nQuality as a Measure of Meaning: Argue that focusing on the quality of experiences and contributions, rather than objective outcomes, is essential for fostering a sense of purpose and well-being.\nRedefining Success: Explore alternative ways to measure success that prioritize meaning, connection, and personal growth.\nImplications for Business and Society: Consider how shifting our definition of success could lead to more equitable, fulfilling, and sustainable practices in various sectors.\nConclusion: Urge readers to embrace a new understanding of success that values quality and meaning over scale and objective outcomes.\nFlow 3: Spirituality, Values, and the Divine Spark: A New Approach to Entrepreneurship and Education\nMain Goal: To explore how integrating spirituality, values, and a recognition of the divine spark in people can transform entrepreneurship and education.\nObjective: Inspire readers to consider the role of spirituality and values in shaping a more compassionate, purpose-driven approach to entrepreneurship and education.\nIntroduction: Present the central idea that spirituality, values, and recognizing the divine spark in people are essential for creating a more meaningful and fulfilling approach to entrepreneurship and education.\nThe Limitations of Current Models: Discuss how prevailing approaches to entrepreneurship and education often neglect the inner life and unique potential of individuals.\nSpirituality and Values as Guiding Forces: Explore how integrating spirituality and values can provide a foundation for more authentic, purpose-driven endeavors.\nRecognizing the Divine Spark: Argue that acknowledging the inherent worth and potential in every individual is crucial for fostering compassionate, inclusive, and transformative learning and work environments.\nImplications for Entrepreneurship and Education: Consider how embracing spirituality, values, and the divine spark could lead to more meaningful, impactful, and fulfilling practices in these fields.\nConclusion: Encourage readers to integrate spirituality, values, and a recognition of the divine spark in their approach to entrepreneurship, education, and personal growth.\nCritique:\nFlow 1 offers a strong focus on the importance of surprise and humility, providing a clear roadmap for exploring this theme in depth. However, it may not fully address the other key themes, such as quality over scale and the role of spirituality.\nFlow 2 effectively challenges the prevailing notion of success and offers a compelling alternative focused on quality and meaning. However, it may not delve as deeply into the role of surprise and humility or the importance of spirituality and values.\nFlow 3 provides a comprehensive approach that integrates spirituality, values, and the recognition of the divine spark in people, offering a fresh perspective on entrepreneurship and education. While it may not explicitly address surprise and humility or the quality over scale theme, these ideas could be woven into the discussion of spirituality and values.\nBased on your priorities and the themes you want to emphasize, Flow 3 seems to offer the most comprehensive and cohesive approach, as it integrates spirituality, values, and the recognition of the divine spark while still allowing room to touch on the importance of surprise, humility, and quality over scale. However, the final decision depends on which aspects you feel are most crucial to convey in your essay.\nCopy\nBG\ncritique each flow pro and con and find a new flow that merges all 3\nFlow 1: The Importance of Surprise and Humility in Personal and Societal Transformation\nPros:\nFocuses on the key theme of surprise and humility, providing a strong central argument.\nExplores the implications of surprise and humility for both personal growth and societal progress.\nOffers practical insights into cultivating humility and openness to surprise.\nCons:\nMay not fully address other important themes, such as quality over scale and the role of spirituality and values.\nCould benefit from more explicit connections to entrepreneurship and education.\nFlow 2: Redefining Success: Quality over Scale\nPros:\nChallenges the prevailing notion of success and offers a compelling alternative focused on quality and meaning.\nAddresses the negative consequences of an overemphasis on scale, such as wealth inequality.\nEncourages readers to reassess their definition of success and consider the importance of prioritizing quality and meaning.\nCons:\nMay not fully explore the role of surprise and humility in fostering a focus on quality and meaning.\nCould benefit from a deeper examination of the connection between quality, meaning, and spirituality.\nFlow 3: Spirituality, Values, and the Divine Spark: A New Approach to Entrepreneurship and Education\nPros:\nIntegrates spirituality, values, and the recognition of the divine spark in people, offering a fresh perspective on entrepreneurship and education.\nExplores how acknowledging the inherent worth and potential in every individual is crucial for fostering compassionate, inclusive, and transformative learning and work environments.\nProvides a comprehensive approach that touches on multiple key themes.\nCons:\nMay not explicitly address the importance of surprise and humility, although these ideas could be woven into the discussion of spirituality and values.\nCould benefit from a more direct examination of the quality over scale theme.\nNew Flow: Transforming Entrepreneurship and Education: Integrating Spirituality, Humility, and a Focus on Quality\nIntroduction: Present the central idea that integrating spirituality, humility, and a focus on quality and meaning is essential for transforming entrepreneurship and education in times of change.\nThe Limitations of Current Models: Discuss how prevailing approaches to entrepreneurship and education often neglect the inner life, unique potential of individuals, and the importance of quality and meaning over scale.\nCultivating Humility and Openness to Surprise: Explore how humility and openness to surprise are essential for fostering authentic personal growth, adaptability, and meaningful transformation in entrepreneurship and education.\nSpirituality and Values as Guiding Forces: Examine how integrating spirituality and values can provide a foundation for more authentic, purpose-driven endeavors that prioritize quality and meaning over scale.\nRecognizing the Divine Spark: Argue that acknowledging the inherent worth and potential in every individual is crucial for fostering compassionate, inclusive, and transformative learning and work environments.\nRedefining Success: Consider how shifting our definition of success to prioritize quality, meaning, and personal growth could lead to more equitable, fulfilling, and sustainable practices in entrepreneurship and education.\nImplications for Personal and Societal Transformation: Explore how embracing humility, surprise, spirituality, and a focus on quality and meaning in entrepreneurship and education can contribute to personal growth and positive societal change.\nConclusion: Urge readers to integrate humility, openness to surprise, spirituality, and a focus on quality and meaning in their approach to entrepreneurship, education, and personal growth, emphasizing the potential for transformative impact on individuals and society.\nThis new flow incorporates elements from all three previous flows, addressing the key themes of surprise and humility, quality over scale, spirituality and values, and the recognition of the divine spark in people. By weaving these themes together, the essay can provide a comprehensive and compelling argument for transforming entrepreneurship and education in a way that fosters personal growth, meaningful impact, and positive societal change.\nCopy\nBG\nMaybe instead of saying integrating humanity, we can talk about needing to get to similar fundamental first principles to see what we derive as actions after that. Like if the objective of our work is to heal the planet and make people rich so they can party like rockstars great. Or is this place a place to find your gifts and be in service. is it hedonism or something of substance\nYou raise an excellent point about the importance of examining our fundamental first principles and how they shape our actions and objectives. Rather than simply integrating humility, it's crucial to delve deeper into the underlying beliefs and values that guide our approach to entrepreneurship, education, and personal growth.\nAt the core of this discussion lies a fundamental question: What is the purpose of our work and our lives? Are we driven by a desire for personal gratification, wealth, and hedonistic pursuits, or are we called to something greater – to discover our unique gifts and use them in service to others and the world around us?\nIf our primary objective is to heal the planet and create abundance so that people can indulge in excess and live like rockstars, we may be operating from a set of principles that prioritize self-interest, materialism, and short-term gratification over more meaningful, purposeful endeavors. While there is nothing inherently wrong with seeking enjoyment and success, pursuing these goals without a deeper sense of purpose can lead to a hollow, unsatisfying existence.\nOn the other hand, if we believe that this place is an opportunity to discover our true calling and use our talents to make a positive impact on the world, we are more likely to cultivate a set of principles that emphasize service, contribution, and personal growth. By aligning our actions with these higher values, we can find greater meaning, fulfillment, and a sense of connection to something larger than ourselves.\nUltimately, the principles we choose to adopt will shape the way we approach entrepreneurship, education, and every aspect of our lives. If we want to create truly transformative change, we must start by examining our fundamental beliefs and ensuring that they align with our deepest values and aspirations.\nIn the context of your essay, you could explore how different sets of principles lead to different outcomes in entrepreneurship and education. By contrasting the principles of hedonism and self-interest with those of service and personal growth, you can make a compelling case for the importance of aligning our actions with our most cherished values.\nAdditionally, you could argue that cultivating principles such as humility, openness to surprise, and a focus on quality and meaning is essential for discovering our true gifts and using them in service to others. By embracing these principles, we can create a more authentic, purposeful, and transformative approach to entrepreneurship and education – one that not only benefits individuals but also contributes to the greater good of society and the planet.\nCopy\nBG\nok, so i'm writing this essay to explain to my cofounder why I don't care about measuring tasks on a taskboard and care more aobeut moments of AHA in our live facilitations, thats another part that i want to be sure to keep from the transcription, how awesome our live sessions are and how that's where LIFE is - something alive, everything else is dead or not real and when we are present to the present we ar epresent to the presence and we start to really see reality\nI understand that you want to convey to your cofounder the importance of focusing on the transformative moments of \"AHA\" in your live facilitations, rather than solely measuring tasks on a taskboard. You believe that the real magic and impact of your work lie in the live, interactive sessions where participants experience breakthroughs and genuine insights.\nIn your essay, you can emphasize that while tracking tasks and progress is important for organization and accountability, it should not overshadow the primary goal of creating meaningful, life-changing experiences for your participants. The taskboard represents the mechanical, lifeless aspects of your work, whereas the live facilitations are where the true essence of your mission comes alive.\nYou can argue that when you and your team are fully present and engaged in the moment during these live sessions, you create a space for participants to connect with their own presence and access a deeper level of understanding and self-discovery. These \"AHA\" moments are the sparks that ignite real transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard.\nTo support your point, you can draw from the transcription and provide specific examples of how your live facilitations have led to profound breakthroughs and lasting impact for your participants. By sharing these stories, you can illustrate the power of being fully present and attuned to the needs of your audience, and how this presence allows you to guide them towards meaningful insights and growth.\nFurthermore, you can explore the idea that when we are truly present in the moment, we tap into a deeper level of reality and connection. In these spaces of presence, we can access a greater sense of clarity, purpose, and potential, both for ourselves and for those we serve. By prioritizing these moments of presence and \"AHA\" in your work, you are not only creating transformative experiences for your participants but also aligning yourself with a higher sense of purpose and service.\nUltimately, by focusing your essay on the importance of presence, \"AHA\" moments, and the transformative power of your live facilitations, you can make a compelling case to your cofounder for why these elements should be at the forefront of your work. While taskboards and measurable progress have their place, it is the intangible, life-affirming moments of insight and connection that truly define the success and impact of your mission.\nCopy\nBG\nwrite the outilne, summarize your plan of action and then write the first draft keeping in mind it is to kindly demonstate the difference between these two world views and explain my philosophical disagreement with my cofounder in a nice way tangentially go for it\nOutline:\nIntroduction\nHook: The importance of presence and \"AHA\" moments in transformative work\nThesis: While measuring tasks is important, the true essence of our mission lies in the life-changing experiences created during live facilitations\nThe Taskboard: A Necessary but Insufficient Tool\nAcknowledge the importance of tracking tasks and progress\nArgue that the taskboard represents the mechanical aspects of the work, not the transformative core\nThe Power of Presence in Live Facilitations\nDescribe how being fully present in the moment creates a space for profound insights and growth\nUse examples from the transcription to illustrate the impact of \"AHA\" moments on participants\nTapping into a Deeper Reality\nExplore the idea that presence allows us to access a greater sense of clarity, purpose, and potential\nArgue that by prioritizing presence, we align ourselves with a higher sense of purpose and service\nBalancing Measurable Progress and Transformative Impact\nAcknowledge the need for both taskboards and \"AHA\" moments in the work\nEmphasize that the intangible, life-affirming experiences should be at the forefront of the mission\nConclusion\nRestate the importance of focusing on presence and transformative moments\nInvite the cofounder to consider the philosophical differences and find a balance that honors both perspectives\nPlan of Action:\nBegin with a strong hook that captures the essence of the essay's main argument\nAcknowledge the cofounder's perspective on the importance of measuring tasks\nPresent the counterargument, focusing on the transformative power of presence and \"AHA\" moments\nUse specific examples and stories from the transcription to support the argument\nExplore the philosophical and spiritual dimensions of presence and its connection to a deeper reality\nFind common ground by acknowledging the need for both measurable progress and transformative impact\nConclude with a respectful invitation to consider the different perspectives and find a balance that honors both\nFirst Draft:\nDear [Cofounder],\nIn our work, we often talk about the importance of measuring progress and tracking tasks on our taskboard. While I agree that these tools are necessary for organization and accountability, I believe that the true essence of our mission lies in the transformative moments of presence and \"AHA\" that occur during our live facilitations.\nWhen we are fully engaged in the present moment, we create a space for our participants to connect with their own presence and access a deeper level of understanding and self-discovery. These \"AHA\" moments are the sparks that ignite real transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard.\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound breakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their eyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of insight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this work in the first place.\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater sense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task managers. By prioritizing these moments of \"AHA\" and presence in our work, we honor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact of our mission.\nI understand that measurable progress is important, and I'm not suggesting we abandon our taskboards altogether. However, I believe that we need to find a balance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work.\nI invite you to consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can create a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work and the life-changing potential of our live facilitations. Together, we can find a way to measure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"AHA\" moments.\nWith gratitude and respect,\n[Your Name]\nCopy\nAlright, I'm gonna do a really brief download because I feel like we had a great conversation and I am still kind of reverberating, as I say it, with what we said and so I'm gonna try to, before I los\nPASTED\nBG\ncan you review the original writing and insert any place the author seemed to get excited into the essay, and use their original language to keep it authentic sounding to how they speak?\nDear [Cofounder],\nIn our work, we often talk about the importance of measuring progress and tracking tasks on our taskboard. While I agree that these tools are necessary for organization and accountability, I believe that the true essence of our mission lies in the transformative moments of presence and \"AHA\" that occur during our live facilitations.\nWhen we are fully engaged in the present moment, we create a space for our participants to connect with their own presence and access a deeper level of understanding and self-discovery. These \"AHA\" moments are the sparks that ignite real transformation and growth, and they cannot be reduced to mere checkboxes on a taskboard. It's like in our systems that we're designing, there's a thing between, you know, creating a moment where a human is with themselves and a piece of paper, and they're taking an assessment, or, you know, on the phone or whatever, and they have an aha moment, and they make a commitment in front of a colleague or in front of their mentor or in front of one of their peer peers from the program, and then they're like, \"Yeah, I took this assessment. It made me realize this, and I'm gonna do this from now on.\" And I've decided to change them.\nI remember a particular live facilitation where a participant had a profound breakthrough. As we guided them through the process, I could see the light in their eyes as they connected with a truth that had been eluding them. That moment of insight and clarity was life-changing for them, and it reminded me of why we do this work in the first place. And really, you know, like whatever it is, those moments of commitments, those moments of being witnessed, of togetherness, that's a great use of technology, right? And in terms of impact, let's count it by seconds, right? The rest of their life, the seconds are now in our impact bank, right? You can count that, especially if they have been true to their promise, if it was a deep enough moment.\nWhen we tap into this deeper level of presence, we align ourselves with a greater sense of purpose and service. We become conduits for transformation, not just task managers. By prioritizing these moments of \"AHA\" and presence in our work, we honor the intangible, life-affirming experiences that define the success and impact of our mission.\nI understand that measurable progress is important, and I'm not suggesting we abandon our taskboards altogether. However, I believe that we need to find a balance that puts the transformative power of presence at the forefront of our work. It's that moment right then and there with him, and it's present, and it's true, and it's real. And when you witness that, it's different than a recording. And I feel like we need to acknowledge that and look at our recordings, all of them. Which ones has ever helped anybody versus which sessions have ever helped somebody? And one is scalable, one we can like put on WhatsApp and fast forward to like a thousand people, and the other, you kind of have to have been there. And there's a thing about that - the moment, and the presence, and the reality of it. That, I think, is also a part of what I'm getting at.\nI invite you to consider these philosophical differences and explore how we can create a working environment that honors both the mechanical aspects of our work and the life-changing potential of our live facilitations. Together, we can find a way to measure our progress while still prioritizing the magic of presence and \"AHA\" moments.\nWith gratitude and respect,\n[Your Name]\nCopy\nBG\nI've updated the document and in the next prompt will provide it. First I need you to help me figure out what the next best steps are from brainstorming to getting a clean output to share with my colleague, are you ready to review the document and give me some suggestions? If you were a professional editor what would the steps you would take to take. stream of consciousness document and make it a rigorous philosophically sound argument with clean syntax, probably clustering concepts to be sure they're not strewn about, what else? think step by step and defend your reasoning\nCertainly! As a professional editor, my goal would be to transform the stream of consciousness document into a well-structured, philosophically sound argument with clear and concise language. Here are the steps I would take, along with my reasoning:\nStep 1: Read through the entire document to understand the main ideas and themes.\nReasoning: Before making any changes, it's essential to grasp the overall message and identify the key points the author wants to convey. This will help ensure that the editing process enhances the original intent rather than detracting from it.\nStep 2: Identify and cluster related concepts and ideas.\nReasoning: In a stream of consciousness document, ideas may be scattered throughout the text. By grouping related concepts together, we can create a more coherent and logical flow of information. This will make it easier for readers to follow the argument and understand the connections between different points.\nStep 3: Create an outline to organize the content.\nReasoning: An outline serves as a roadmap for the essay, ensuring that the argument progresses logically from one point to the next. It helps to identify any gaps in the reasoning or areas that need further development. The outline should include an introduction, main body paragraphs, and a conclusion.\nStep 4: Refine the language and syntax.\nReasoning: Clear and concise language is crucial for effectively communicating ideas. By refining the syntax, we can improve the readability and impact of the argument. This may involve breaking down long, complex sentences into shorter, more manageable ones, eliminating redundancies, and ensuring that each sentence contributes to the overall point being made.\nStep 5: Develop the philosophical argument.\nReasoning: To create a philosophically sound argument, we need to ensure that the claims made are well-supported by evidence and reasoning. This may involve adding relevant examples, counterarguments, or thought experiments to strengthen the author's position. We should also check for logical consistency and address any potential objections or counterarguments.\nStep 6: Ensure a clear introduction and conclusion.\nReasoning: The introduction should provide a clear roadmap for the essay, outlining the main points to be discussed and engaging the reader's interest. The conclusion should summarize the key arguments and insights, leaving the reader with a strong understanding of the author's perspective and its implications.\nStep 7: Proofread and edit for grammar, spelling, and punctuation.\nReasoning: Errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation can distract from the content and undermine the credibility of the argument. By carefully proofreading the document, we can ensure that the final product is polished and professional.\nStep 8: Review the edited document for coherence and clarity.\nReasoning: After completing the editing process, it's important to review the document as a whole to ensure that the argument flows smoothly and that the main points are clearly communicated. This final review can help identify any remaining areas that need clarification or refinement.\nStep 9: Collaborate with the author to finalize the document.\nReasoning: Ultimately, the edited document should reflect the author's voice and intentions. By working closely with the author to incorporate their feedback and address any concerns, we can create a final product that effectively conveys their ideas while benefiting from the clarity and structure provided by the editing process.\nBy following these steps, we can transform the stream of consciousness document into a well-structured, philosophically sound argument that effectively communicates the author's ideas to their colleague. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to proceed with reviewing the updated document you mentioned.\nCopy\nThinking Document Differences in Alignment\nPDF\nBG\nOk, so let's take things one step at a time, prioritize the first step and build documentation along the way so we can keep breadcrumbs and check things off as we do them, got it?

Ask me 3 questions to help improve your process and then continue\nGreat! I'll create progress milestone markers and snapshots that you can easily copy, paste, or download as text files. This will allow us to track our progress and return to our work seamlessly, even if we need to take a break or continue at a later time.\nBefore proceeding with creating the outline, I'd like to ask you three questions to help improve my process:\nAre there any specific areas or arguments from the original text that you feel should be emphasized or expanded upon in the essay? This will help me ensure that the outline and final essay align with your priorities and intentions.\nDo you have a preferred tone or style for the essay (e.g., formal, conversational, persuasive)? Knowing this will help me tailor the language and structure of the essay to better suit your needs and the intended audience.\nAre there any additional resources, examples, or personal experiences you'd like me to incorporate into the essay to strengthen the arguments or make the piece more engaging? If so, please provide them or let me know where I can find them.\nPlease answer these questions, and I'll use your responses to guide my process as I create the outline and continue working on the essay. Here's a snapshot of our progress so far:\nProgress Milestone 1: [Completed]\nIdentified and clustered main concepts and ideas\nGenerated a list of 10 key clusters capturing essential themes and arguments\nNext steps:\nCreate an outline to organize the content\nRefine the language and syntax\nDevelop the philosophical argument\nEnsure a clear introduction and conclusion\nProofread and edit for grammar, spelling, and punctuation\nReview the edited document for coherence and clarity\nCollaborate with the author to finalize the document\nCopy\nSpiritualAI\nTXT\nBG\nI think the emphasis should be on the logic that can be agreed upon by any reasonable person. The emphasis that we have no control on the outcomes so having our work and meaning be dependant on \"goodness in the world\" rather than becoming transformed is problematic. The emphasis that respect for the soul or unique human individual experience necessitates the humility that they will know best how to think, create and act and we must \"go upstream\" in the inspiration, rather than showing them successful companies, or even cooperatives, even b corps, we must show them the thinking that led people to develop b corps and create spaces where they can think and understand themselves, the world, and to then act in integrity with what they see. And this action is \"success in every step\" This is what i mean when i say that success is every step when you're in the drivers seat doing just the right thing at just the right time as called forth from the deeper parts of you rather than firefighting and stressing and worrying about money. And that our program can support a space where people can become people and do this, transform themselves and ... although a side effect of the good I(Bilal) intends to create, also positively impact the world through surprising methods that we would have no idea how they happened because we trust the continual unfolding uniqueness of the genius loci, or the soul that God placed in this person. The logic should be greek, islamic, and rigorous accroding to modern philosophical standards\nthe tone should be thoughtful yet confident, also open for questions and debate.

Maybe set up a dilemma and then ask them to think, write their thoughts/feelings before moving on to how I resolve the dilemma (the dilemma of evil, the dilemma of countries with no respect for people who destroy the work of a lifetime with a single act (beirut port explosion), etc\nyeah, i wrote something about how AI is always dead because it only has the past and that in my philosophical understanding God is alive right now in the moment and is always creating - not an act in the past. and that humans have some stake in that. And that is how new embeddings come into the world, and that is what human \"effort\" is for. It's to make way for the new that wants to unfold through you. All the other work can be automated or given to the robots. I believe this to be an interesting philosophical take on AI and the problem of the future of work and would like to incorporate it, i'll add the text here that you can use\nReview and summarize and then ask 3 clarifying questions about the document you just recieved to help you incorporate it well into our framework.\nThank you for providing this additional context and perspective. Your emphasis on the importance of focusing on the logical arguments that can be universally understood and agreed upon by reasonable people is a valuable insight. The idea that true success and meaning come from personal transformation and acting with integrity, rather than relying on external outcomes or predetermined paths, is a powerful and thought-provoking concept.\nYour point about the need for humility and respect for the unique human experience is also crucial. By acknowledging that individuals are best equipped to think, create, and act based on their own understanding and insights, we can create educational spaces that foster genuine self-discovery and personal growth. The notion of \"success in every step\" when one is aligned with their deeper sense of purpose and acting accordingly is an inspiring and empowering perspective.\nThe incorporation of the concept of \"genius loci\" and the idea that each person has a unique soul placed within them by a higher power adds a spiritual dimension to the framework. It underscores the importance of trusting in the unfolding potential of each individual and the surprising ways in which they can positively impact the world when given the space and support to do so.\nYour suggestion to use a thoughtful yet confident tone, while remaining open to questions and debate, is a good approach. Acknowledging the weak points in the argument and encouraging readers to engage with the material through questions and personal reflection will make the essay more engaging and impactful. The use of examples, stories, and thought-provoking dilemmas will help illustrate the key points and encourage deeper consideration of the ideas presented.\nThe additional text you provided about AI being \"dead\" because it only has access to the past, while God is alive and always creating in the present moment, is a fascinating philosophical perspective. It raises important questions about the nature of creativity, the role of human agency, and the relationship between technology and spirituality. Incorporating this idea into the framework could add depth and nuance to the discussion of AI and its implications for the future of work and human potential.\nTo help me better understand and incorporate these ideas into the framework, I have three clarifying questions:\nWhen you discuss the importance of personal transformation and acting with integrity, how do you see this process unfolding within the educational spaces you envision? What specific elements or practices would support this kind of growth and self-discovery?\nHow do you propose balancing the emphasis on individual uniqueness and the \"genius loci\" with the need for collaboration, community, and shared understanding in the learning process? How can we foster a sense of interconnectedness while still honoring each person's distinct path?\nIn terms of the philosophical perspective on AI and creativity, how do you see this idea influencing the way we design and utilize AI systems in the future? What implications might this have for the development of AI technologies that aim to support or enhance human potential?\nPlease let me know your thoughts on these questions, and I'll continue to refine the framework and essay outline to incorporate your insights and perspectives.\nCopy\nBG\neducation is the process of learning how to learn about yourself, your emotions, how they relate to your values, the world, and when you're inspired with a must (spectrum between should<----->must, or Hell yes or No, then you have the motive force to do what is needed and commit your life. This commitment is a micro sacrifice, a moment where you take 10 years of your life and nail it to a cross.\nwe find our local geniuses and authenticity and then can honestly find the best matches for our competencies and what comes naturally. Rather than homogenizing and pretending like everyone can learn to be creative at the same level or everyone is as good at risk management and imagining and mitigating risk, we find people who are super prudent by nature (God given/born/happenstance of birth and the few years after) and others who are great at structure and \"adab\" putting all things in the right places along with the people who balance them out and complete the picture, each initiative requires all 99 names all together.\nyes, I think we should present it yet don't need to go into detail about what it implies for AI in the future, we need to have the argument about the future of work and what humans mean in the world where the past and how the work looks like going forward where the past and the practical how and what can be done by the computers, yet the connection to the muse of the moment must be coming through a human who is present. this is why inner development goals, quiet, prayer, connection, introspection is so important, we are a mine of unfathomable treasures if we don't mine it we'll get AI entropy so badly that the game of telephone will create total nonsense yet we'll be tuned to believe it because it comes from the Ai that knows how to speak convincingly and can do that better and better. Also autonomous homogenization can lead to a \"ant death spiral\" for humanity, perhaps we can quote this and then tell a tiny story that mimics it about how tools that already know how to hijack our dopamine systems (drive and motivation -> things that lead to action) can create auto recursive things where purpose and motivation seems true yet just dumps resources indefinitely till we die of exhaustion. Sort of like people not ready to start a business, don't have a clear why, who are highjacked by their fear of funds on these \"join my course so i can help you make money selling courses\" and then one day we find out that it's \"courses all the way down\" and no one is making food, no one is bringing anything novel from the world of the unseen.

Learning must be self motivated, and the first learnings people should have are about htemselves, what motivates, drives them, what skills come naturally, etc- what causes give the enough enthusiasm to jump out of bed\ntransforming ourselves is the goal, in the islamic perspective we have uncertainty within us about the shape of our soul. we can spend a lifetime turning it into a work of art, or into a destroyed waste bin, depends on how you life. so by saving the world and doing acts of goodness, and knowing yourself and values and how to respond appropriately to the reality of the world, that's how we can save ourselves by saving the wrold. it's a bit tongue in cheek wordplay to say we're not here to fix everything because that's what's annoying sometimes when I go to silicon valley, the arrogance that not only will the world be better, it must ONLY be better because I did it. #singularityUniversity\nAI being dead because it can only do things we already know how to do and how humans have access to the divine inspiration needed to keep AI from autodigesting itself leading to a death spiral of it's host brain that has hands and feet to type\nTable of Contents:\nI.

This essay explores the intersection of AI, Islamic principles, and the concept of education as a means of self-discovery and societal change. By delving into the uniqueness of the human soul, the power of self-motivated learning, and the limitations of AI, we aim to present a holistic approach to personal growth and responsible technology development. Drawing upon Islamic teachings and contemporary philosophical thought, we argue that true progress lies not in the blind pursuit of external solutions, but in the cultivation of individual potential and the alignment of our actions with divine wisdom. Through this lens, we invite readers to consider the transformative power of education and the need for a balanced, ethically-grounded approach to AI development in the quest for personal and collective well-being.\nCritique:\nPros:\nThe table of contents presents a logical flow of ideas, starting with the Islamic perspective on the soul and moving towards the practical implications for education and AI development.\nThe introduction effectively captures the main thesis and previews the structure of the essay.\nThe emphasis on self-discovery and self-motivated learning aligns well with the Islamic concept of fitrah and the importance of free will.\nThe critique of the savior complex and the emphasis on personal responsibility is a strong point that challenges common assumptions about societal change.\nThe inclusion of the potential pitfalls of AI and the need for human agency in guiding its development adds depth and nuance to the argument.\nCons:\nThe link between the Islamic perspective and the limitations of AI could be further developed and made more explicit.\nThe concept of divine inspiration and its role in human creativity and AI development may need more elaboration to be fully understood by readers unfamiliar with Islamic thought.\nThe practical implications and recommendations for educators, policymakers, and individuals could be more specific and action-oriented.\nThe potential counterarguments or objections to the main thesis are not explicitly addressed in the table of contents.\nThe conclusion could be more impactful by emphasizing the urgency and relevance of the topic in the current global context.\nRanking:\nI. Introduction: 4/5 - Well-developed and engaging, but could be more concise.\nII. The Islamic Perspective on the Uniqueness of the Soul: 3/5 - Needs more depth and connection to the overall argument.\nIII. Education as a Means of Personal Transformation: 4/5 - Strong points, but could benefit from more specific examples.\nIV. The Relationship between Personal Transformation and Societal Change: 4/5 - Well-argued, but could be further developed.\nV. The Limitations and Potential Pitfalls of AI: 3/5 - Requires more evidence and connection to the Islamic perspective.\nVI. Harnessing AI for Personal and Societal Growth: 3/5 - Needs more concrete examples and practical applications.\nVII. Conclusion: 3/5 - Could be more impactful and tie the main points together more effectively.\nBased on this ranking, sections II, V, VI, and VII would benefit from further development and more specific arguments or examples to strengthen the overall essay.\nCopy\nBG\nLet's write the first draft according to us having completed milestone one - identifying and clustering concepts and generating clusters of themes.\nwe have also created an outline. We are on the next step, for refining the language and syntax - although I believe we should develop the arguments first. recursively go through 3 rounds to find the arguments we need to make to have a provable theory based on first principles, come up with a first draft of the theory and then round one of coming up with the first principles we need to create it and iterate till we have that and then let's work on the developing of the philosophical argument.\nThink step by step by the milestones and next steps and ask me 3 questions before moving onto your task to ensure it's completed successfully\nThank you for clarifying the next steps in our writing process. Before we proceed with refining the language and syntax, it's essential to ensure that we have a solid foundation of arguments based on first principles. This iterative approach will help us create a well-structured and coherent essay that effectively conveys your ideas.\nTo make sure I understand your perspective and can assist you effectively, I have three questions:\nIn your opinion, what are the most crucial first principles we need to establish to support your main arguments about the intersection of AI, Islam, and education?\nHow do you envision the connection between these first principles and the practical implications for personal growth and societal change?\nAre there any specific philosophical or theological concepts you want to emphasize or explore further as we develop the arguments?\nPlease provide your insights on these questions, and I'll use them to guide our iterative process of refining the theory and developing the philosophical arguments.\nCopy\nBG\nStephen pressfield describes having babies and realizing they come with their identities, that it's very early and even with the same starting conditions people become widely different. Is it genetic? Or is it the soul? or is it two ways to describe a small part of a very large thing that we don't completely grasp where new lives come from, what is clear is that we have a thingness to us when we are born that isn't similar to what large language models to - parrot. We have an isness. Death is real and life is real, and the felt sense of meaning that comes from living according to our values is real. Perception inward of feelings is an arising and not an action. Who moves our hearts to lean towards beauty, why? Evolution? Did it have to be that way? The reality is that it is not necessary - we could have found that life is nasty brutish and short, seeing the world with our own eyes, yet as Rutger Bregman who wrote Humankind: A Hopeful would argue, we are fundamentally kind. Also isn't it an incredible mercy that our world is in the goldilocks zone, that mothers care for their children, that lions don't kill for fun, it would have been possible. Somehow, there is a deep goodness to reality when it could have been a trillion billion other ways\nI believe that by respecting the mystery at the core of the human from which new creativity, new being, new life, new all the 99 names, if we can stand firm in our ownership of the 99 names and stweard the qualities of God on earth we will see a rectified world and a beautiful one. Although the goal is to rectify the ONE thing that is the conflict. removing humans the universe is back in balance as the ecosystems adapt and merge. Why is humanity the only thing weird on earth? Because we don't submit to our fundamental nature, the thing that wants to emerge from us, the center of the spirit that is oru isness that touches base with the way back\nFirst identify the domain of philosophy / theology we're working with and then i'd like you to do a breif literature review and summary of ideas and concepts in the domain\nonce you do that and have the answers to this questions, let's write the first draft and then review the next steps and steps done and update the table of content with the ranking given our new information\nThank you for your thoughtful responses. Your insights into the uniqueness of human identity, the innate goodness of reality, and the importance of aligning with our fundamental nature provide a rich foundation for developing our philosophical arguments. Let me summarize the key points:\nThe concept of the soul and the inherent \"isness\" of human beings, which sets us apart from AI and suggests a deeper mystery at the core of our existence.\nThe fundamental kindness and goodness of reality, as evidenced by the balance and beauty of the natural world, despite the potential for alternative, less harmonious possibilities.\nThe idea that by embracing and stewarding the 99 names of God, we can rectify the world and align with our true purpose.\nBased on these ideas, the main philosophical and theological domains we'll be working with are:\nPhilosophy of mind and identity\nMetaphysics and the nature of reality\nIslamic theology and the concept of the 99 names of God\nEthics and the notion of innate human goodness\nLiterature Review:\nPhilosophy of mind and identity:\nDescartes' dualism and the concept of the soul (Meditations on First Philosophy)\nLocke's theory of personal identity (An Essay Concerning Human Understanding)\nContemporary debates on the nature of consciousness and the hard problem of consciousness (David Chalmers, Thomas Nagel)\nMetaphysics and the nature of reality:\nAristotle's metaphysics and the concept of essence (Metaphysics)\nKant's transcendental idealism (Critique of Pure Reason)\nThe fine-tuning argument and the anthropic principle (John Leslie, Nick Bostrom)\n\n"

How does HumanKind describe how we automatically know what good is and beauty?\n\nfrom there we should also talk about respecting this precious thing that is at the threshold of the divine. Here is a very important element AI is able to bring us to the threshold to then do the real work that a human was made for, to witness and channel, not to be a code monkey or sell online courses no one needs,\n\ngreat the point about the savior complex and how it fails in it's premises and in it's reality is critical - and tie in with how working \"up stream\" on the \"input\" helping people self reflect and why this allows for surprise and realness and doesn't distort the already difficult thing of inward looking and self knowledge you can reference the measurement problem in quantum thermo dynamics.\n\nI think there needs to be a transition to \"what is islam\" and we can focus on the idea of islam submitting to the thing that manifests rather than your own whims and desires and then we need to go into how does Islam describe that and how it brings things into balance when we do\n\nThis resolves the, if the creator is good why is there weird ugly non good things, we horde we eat more than we need get fat kill that which we don't need to kill etc why - usually because we have a lack and are looking to fill it with something other than the only thing that satisfies. love of god. love of god that becomes real to you by becoming godly, by manifesting the small fraction of the names you are able to and to get your fear doubt worry and concern out of the way\n\nWith this refinement update your outline and then go ahead and write the first draft",

How does HumanKind describe how we automatically know what good is and beauty?\n\nfrom there we should also talk about respecting this precious thing that is at the threshold of the divine. Here is a very important element AI is able to bring us to the threshold to then do the real work that a human was made for, to witness and channel, not to be a code monkey or sell online courses no one needs,\n\ngreat the point about the savior complex and how it fails in it's premises and in it's reality is critical - and tie in with how working \"up stream\" on the \"input\" helping people self reflect and why this allows for surprise and realness and doesn't distort the already difficult thing of inward looking and self knowledge you can reference the measurement problem in quantum thermo dynamics.\n\nI think there needs to be a transition to \"what is islam\" and we can focus on the idea of islam submitting to the thing that manifests rather than your own whims and desires and then we need to go into how does Islam describe that and how it brings things into balance when we do\n\nThis resolves the, if the creator is good why is there weird ugly non good things, we horde we eat more than we need get fat kill that which we don't need to kill etc why - usually because we have a lack and are looking to fill it with something other than the only thing that satisfies. love of god. love of god that becomes real to you by becoming godly, by manifesting the small fraction of the names you are able to and to get your fear doubt worry and concern out of the way\n\nWith this refinement update your outline and then go ahead and write the first draft",

      "content": " Introduction:\nIn a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence (AI) and rapid technological advancements, it is essential to pause and reflect on the fundamental aspects of human existence that set us apart from machines. Drawing upon the wisdom of Islamic tradition and contemporary philosophical thought, this essay explores the unique nature of the human soul, the transformative power of education, and the path towards personal and societal growth in an age of AI.\n\nAs author Stephen Pressfield observed, each human being is born with a distinct identity, a spark of individuality that cannot be reduced to mere genetics or environmental factors. This innate essence, known in Islamic theology as the fitrah, is a testament to the divine origin of the human soul and its capacity for goodness, beauty, and truth. It is this fitrah that allows us to intuitively recognize and appreciate the marvels of creation, from the delicate balance of the natural world to the sublime aesthetics of art and music.\n\nThe Uniqueness of the Human Soul:\nCentral to the Islamic understanding of human nature is the concept of the 99 names of God, which represent the divine attributes that are reflected in the human soul. By recognizing and nurturing these qualities within ourselves, we can begin to actualize our true potential and align our lives with a higher purpose. This process of self-discovery and self-realization is at the heart of Islamic spirituality and is essential for unlocking the transformative power of education.\n\nEducation as a Means of Personal Transformation:\nIn contrast to the narrow, utilitarian view of education as a means of acquiring marketable skills or achieving external success, the Islamic perspective emphasizes the role of learning in facilitating personal growth and spiritual development. By engaging in self-motivated inquiry and reflection, we can begin to uncover the unique talents, passions, and values that define our individual identities. This process of inner exploration is not only essential for personal fulfillment but also for contributing meaningfully to society.\n\nThe Relationship between Personal Transformation and Societal Change:\nOne of the pitfalls of contemporary discourse on social change is the prevalence of the \"savior complex,\" which assumes that societal progress is dependent on the actions of a few exceptional individuals or institutions. This mindset not only overlooks the complexity of social systems but also undermines the agency and potential of ordinary people to effect change in their own lives and communities. By focusing instead on the \"upstream\" work of empowering individuals through self-reflection and personal transformation, we can create a ripple effect of positive change that is both sustainable and authentic.\n\nThe Role of AI in Personal and Societal Growth:\nWhile AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of human life, it is essential to recognize its limitations and potential pitfalls. As a product of human design and programming, AI is ultimately a reflection of the knowledge, biases, and priorities of its creators. Moreover, the lack of divine inspiration or consciousness in AI systems means that they are fundamentally incapable of experiencing the richness of human emotions, intuitions, and experiences that are essential for personal and societal growth.\n\nHowever, by harnessing AI as a tool for self-discovery and skill development, we can leverage its capabilities to support rather than replace human agency and creativity. By using AI to analyze patterns, generate insights, and provide personalized recommendations, we can create a symbiotic relationship between technology and human potential that is grounded in Islamic values and ethics.\n\nCultivating a Holistic Approach to Education and Technology:\nUltimately, the path towards personal and societal flourishing in an age of AI lies in embracing a holistic approach to education and technology that is rooted in Islamic principles and a deep respect for the uniqueness of the human soul. By prioritizing self-knowledge, moral development, and the cultivation of divine attributes, we can create a new paradigm of learning and growth that is both transformative and sustainable.\n\nThis approach requires a fundamental shift in our understanding of the purpose and scope of education, from a narrow focus on job training and economic productivity to a more expansive vision of human development and social progress. It also demands a more critical and nuanced engagement with the role of technology in our lives, one that recognizes both its potential benefits and its inherent limitations.\n\nConclusion:\nAs we navigate the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly AI-driven world, it is more important than ever to ground ourselves in the timeless wisdom of Islamic tradition and the fundamental truths of human nature. By embracing the transformative power of education, the uniqueness of the human soul, and the potential for personal and societal growth, we can chart a course towards a more meaningful, fulfilling, and harmonious future for all. This is the true essence of the Islamic ideal of submission to the divine will, and it is the key to unlocking the full potential of our individual and collective existence.",

The uniqueness of the human soul and the importance of qualitative measures\n2. Education as a means of personal transformation and social change\n3. The limitations of the \"savior complex\" and the power of inner development\n4. The role of AI in supporting human potential\n5. Cultivating a holistic approach to education and technology\n\nStep 2: Determine the first principles that support each argument\n1. The uniqueness of the human soul and the importance of qualitative measures\n   - First principle: The human soul is inherently good and possesses a divine spark (fitrah)\n   - First principle: Qualitative measures capture the essence of personal and societal growth better than quantitative metrics alone\n\n2. Education as a means of personal transformation and social change\n   - First principle: True education facilitates self-discovery, moral development, and the cultivation of divine attributes\n   - First principle: Personal transformation is the foundation for authentic and sustainable social change\n\n3. The limitations of the \"savior complex\" and the power of inner development\n   - First principle: Lasting change emerges from the collective growth and awakening of individuals, not top-down interventions\n   - First principle: Empowering individuals through self-reflection and personal transformation creates a ripple effect of positive change\n\n4. The role of AI in supporting human potential\n   - First principle: AI is a tool that can support human agency and creativity, but it cannot replace the richness of human experience and intuition\n   - First principle: The development and use of AI should be grounded in Islamic values and ethics\n\n5. Cultivating a holistic approach to education and technology\n   - First principle: A holistic approach to education and technology prioritizes self-knowledge, moral development, and the cultivation of divine attributes\n   - First principle: The purpose of education is to foster human development and social progress, not just job training and economic productivity\n\nStep 3: Analyze the reasoning behind each argument and ensure coherence\n- The essay builds upon the foundational idea of the uniqueness of the human soul and the importance of qualitative measures, which sets the stage for the subsequent arguments.\n- The discussion of education as a means of personal transformation and social change naturally follows, as it highlights the role of self-discovery and moral development in creating positive change.\n- The limitations of the \"savior complex\" and the power of inner development are then explored, emphasizing the importance of individual growth and empowerment in creating sustainable impact.\n- The role of AI is examined in light of the previous arguments, acknowledging its potential to support human potential while recognizing its limitations.\n- Finally, the call for a holistic approach to education and technology brings together the preceding arguments, advocating for a paradigm that prioritizes self-knowledge, moral development, and the cultivation of divine attributes.\n\nUpdated Table of Contents:\nI.

Argument: Focusing on inner growth promotes a more compassionate and collaborative society\n   - First principle: Developing emotional intelligence and social skills fosters understanding, trust, and cooperation among individuals and groups\n   - First principle: A society built on shared values and mutual respect is more likely to address collective challenges effectively\n\n3. Argument: Prioritizing inner development leads to more fulfilling and purposeful lives\n   - First principle: True happiness and fulfillment come from aligning one's actions with their deepest values and aspirations\n   - First principle: Cultivating a strong sense of purpose and meaning in life increases resilience, motivation, and overall well-being\n\nThree questions to provide material for further development:\n1.

      "content": " New Essay Draft:\n\nI. Introduction\nIn a world that often prioritizes external achievements and metrics, it is easy to overlook the fundamental importance of inner development and self-reflection. However, by examining the basic principles of human experience and growth, we can come to understand that the most meaningful and lasting change begins within. This essay will explore the primacy of personal response and inner states, the cultivation of enduring positive states, the role of inner work in authentic change, the value of supportive relationships and tools, and the alignment of actions with values and aspirations. Ultimately, it will argue that a more compassionate and harmonious world is possible through a collective commitment to inner development.\n\nII. The Primacy of Personal Response and Inner States\nAt the core of human experience lies a fundamental axiom: the only thing an individual has direct control over is their ability to respond to external stimuli and internal states. This principle is self-evident and requires no prior knowledge or experience to understand. It is the foundation upon which all personal development and growth must be built. However, it is important to recognize that an individual's capacity to respond effectively is dependent on their current state of being. A person who is overwhelmed by stress or consumed by negative emotions will find it more challenging to respond in a way that aligns with their values and goals.\n\nIII. Cultivating Enduring Positive States\nGiven the primacy of personal response and inner states, it follows that identifying and cultivating states that result in preferred ways of being is a primary means of personal development and growth. In the Islamic tradition, this process is understood through the concepts of \"hal\" and \"maqaam.\" A \"hal\" refers to a fleeting positive state, such as the boost of energy and optimism one might feel after a cup of coffee. In contrast, a \"maqaam\" describes an enduring positive state, a way of being that persists regardless of external circumstances. The goal of inner development, then, is to transition from fleeting positive states to enduring positive states, to cultivate a sense of peace, compassion, and resilience that remains constant in the face of life's challenges.\n\nIV. Inner Work as the Foundation for Authentic Change\nThe cultivation of enduring positive states is a necessary foundation for creating meaningful and lasting change in oneself and the world. Authentic change and growth arise from an individual's inner work and self-reflection, rather than external factors or interventions. This principle is logically sound, as any attempt to create change without addressing the underlying states and responses of individuals is likely to be superficial and short-lived. By focusing on inner development, individuals can build the capacity to respond effectively to challenges, to maintain a sense of purpose and direction, and to create positive impact in their lives and communities.\n\nV. The Value of Supportive Relationships and Tools\nWhile inner work is a deeply personal process, it is important to recognize the value of supportive relationships and tools in facilitating growth and development. The quality and depth of an individual's relationships and connections are essential determinants of their overall well-being and capacity for positive impact. Supportive relationships provide a space for reflection, feedback, and encouragement, helping individuals to navigate the challenges of inner work and to maintain a sense of perspective and purpose. Similarly, platforms and tools that support inner development and self-reflection, such as journaling apps or meditation programs, can be valuable resources for personal and collective growth.\n\nVI. Aligning Actions with Values and Aspirations\nAs individuals cultivate enduring positive states and engage in inner work, it becomes increasingly important to align their actions with their deepest values and aspirations. The alignment of an individual's actions with their values is a critical factor in creating a sense of purpose and fulfillment. When individuals act in ways that are congruent with their beliefs and goals, they experience a sense of integrity and authenticity that enhances their overall well-being and effectiveness. In contrast, when actions and values are misaligned, individuals may experience cognitive dissonance, stress, and a sense of disconnection from their true selves.\n\nVII. Towards a More Compassionate and Harmonious World\nUltimately, the cultivation of enduring positive states and the alignment of actions with values has the potential to create a more compassionate and harmonious world. As individuals engage in inner work and develop a greater capacity for peace, resilience, and purpose, they naturally begin to have a positive impact on those around them. They become better listeners, more effective communicators, and more compassionate leaders. As this process unfolds on a collective level, with more and more individuals committing to inner development, the cumulative effect has the power to transform communities, organizations, and even entire societies. A world characterized by greater compassion, collaboration, and harmony is possible through the collective commitment to inner development and the cultivation of enduring positive states.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the path to meaningful and lasting change begins with a recognition of the primacy of personal response and inner states. By cultivating enduring positive states through inner work and self-reflection, individuals can build the capacity to create authentic change in themselves and the world. Supportive relationships and tools play a valuable role in this process, as does the alignment of actions with values and aspirations. Ultimately, the potential for a more compassionate and harmonious world lies in the collective commitment to inner development and the cultivation of enduring positive states. It is a vision that requires no prior knowledge or experience to understand, only a willingness to engage in the lifelong process of growth and self-discovery.\n\nCritique and Reasoning:\n\nThe revised essay successfully incorporates the logically rigorous first principles and presents a compelling argument for the importance of inner development and self-reflection. The flow of the essay is clear and coherent, with each section building upon the previous one to create a strong overall narrative.\n\nThe introduction effectively sets the stage for the essay, highlighting the importance of inner development in a world that often prioritizes external achievements. The section on the primacy of personal response and inner states establishes the foundational axiom of the essay and provides a clear starting point for the argument.\n\nThe sections on cultivating enduring positive states and inner work as the foundation for authentic change are well-reasoned and provide a logical progression from the foundational axiom. The use of the Islamic concepts of \"hal\" and \"maqaam\" adds depth and context to the discussion.\n\nThe section on the value of supportive relationships and tools is a strong addition to the essay, as it recognizes the importance of external factors in facilitating inner development. This section also highlights the practical implications of the essay's argument.\n\nThe section on aligning actions with values and aspirations is well-placed and provides a natural bridge between the individual focus of the earlier sections and the collective focus of the final section.\n\nThe final section on the potential for a more compassionate and harmonious world is inspiring and provides a strong conclusion to the essay. It effectively ties together the various threads of the argument and presents a compelling vision for the future.\n\nOverall, the revised essay is well-structured, logically sound, and persuasive. The language is clear and accessible, and the reasoning is easy to follow. The essay successfully makes the case for the importance of inner development and self-reflection in creating meaningful and lasting change.\n\nUpdated Table of Contents and Rankings:\n\nI.
