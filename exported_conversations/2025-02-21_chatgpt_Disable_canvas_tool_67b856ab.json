This will be an opportunity to clarify any questions you still have and give you some insights on what is in store ahead through a design sprint!\nGroup Lunch: At 12:00 we will take a break and get lunch together. \nThis afternoon we will come back and get into user research. This is the first major session we will have. Here we will define our research plan for the next few weeks! Tell us a little bit about your idea, what problem does it solve? Finally, we will wrap up around 4:30!\n\n3\n\nYES, AND….\n15 minutes: Icebreaker \n\n2 minutes: Explain the activity\nTrainers should conduct the “YES, AND…” Icebreaker\nMake teams of about 3-5\nState a problem or ask the group for a problem \nFor example:\nIt’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nIt is so hot outside, how can I get to and from work without sweating or ever feeling the heat?\n \n5 minutes: “No” technique:\nYou have 2 minutes to generate different crazy ideas to solve that problem. Generate as many as possible. But there is a rule! When one member in the team says an idea another one must say “no!” and come up with a completely different idea. This goes on and on until the 2 minutes are up. You have to do this quickly, let's see how many crazy ideas we will get.\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nUse an umbrella!\nNo! Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”: \nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint! We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources. But first, we will give you a little introduction to the Design curriculum and an overview of the design thinking methodology.\n5\n\n\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      Introduction to Design Thinking\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      User Research\nFeb. 16, 2020:\t      Define the Problem\nFeb. 20, 2020:\t\tCreativity and Ideation\n \n \n\nDESIGN THINKING SCHEDULE\nApril 1\nIntro to design thinking\nApril 1\nApril 7\nApril 8\nUser research\nDefine the problem\nCreativity and ideation\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nQuickly give an overview of the 4 Design sessions they will have over the next two weeks. \nIntroduction to Design Thinking: We will focus on giving you a good understanding of design thinking and the human centered design process today through a design sprint. Starting this afternoon, we will talk about applying the Design Thinking methodology to your business.\nUser Research: We will go into creating a research plan for you to deeply understand your customers and their needs.\nReframe: Define the Problem: We will take all of our research, and clearly define the problem for your different customer types.\nCreativity and Ideation: Finally, we will generate solutions to your customers problems. Some of them might be your current ideas, but we hope to generate a wide variety of ideas that could all be potential solutions. \n6\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is design thinking? Why is it useful?\nPotential answers:\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people \nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential \nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n7\n\nincreased creativity\nstronger solutions\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe trainer should recap points brought up on the previous slide answering “What is design thinking? Why is it useful?”\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people \nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential \nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n8\n\nCC, BY-NC-ND, ⓒ Joe Thorn\nDiscussion: 5 minutes \n\nAsk: Take a look at this photo – who can tell me what this girl needs? (gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\n Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\n Send the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\n How might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life? \n Improve and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each) \nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural? \nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype? \n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?]]]",

Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\n Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\n Send the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\n How might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life? \n Improve and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each) \nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural? \nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype? \n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?]]]",

      "content": "Here's your **Initial Module Assessment** for integrating climate resilience into the **Design Thinking** module.  \n\n---\n\n### **Task 1: Module Summary**  \n- **Main Learning Objectives:**  \n  This module introduces participants to **design thinking** as a **human-centered, iterative problem-solving methodology**. Participants learn to define customer problems, brainstorm creative solutions, and prototype ideas quickly.  \n\n- **Key Activities or Components:**  \n  Activities include **icebreakers**, **brainstorming**, **rapid prototyping**, **user interviews**, and **feedback loops**. The **\"Yes, And\"** and **\"No\"** brainstorming methods encourage divergent and convergent thinking. The **design sprint** allows participants to apply design thinking in a condensed format.  \n\n- **Expected Outcomes:**  \n  By the end of the module, participants should be able to **understand user needs**, **define key challenges**, **generate creative solutions**, and **develop rapid prototypes**. The module fosters **collaboration, empathy, and problem-solving skills** that can be applied to entrepreneurship.  \n\n---\n\n### **Task 2: Existing Elements Analysis**  \n\n| **Section/Slide** | **Current Reference** | **Type of Reference** | **Potential Enhancement** |\n|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Design Sprint Intro** (Slide 5) | \"We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources.\" | Resource Efficiency | Expand this to explicitly mention **sustainable design** and **low-impact solutions**. Example: \"Mindful of resources, including energy efficiency, material reuse, and climate impact.\" |\n| **Brainstorming** (Slide 15) | \"What if it had to be made from recycled materials?\" | Sustainability | Strengthen this by incorporating **local renewable resources** and **circular economy principles**. Example: \"What if it had to be made from materials that minimize environmental impact in Iraq/KRI?\" |\n| **Prototyping** (Slide 16) | \"Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\" | Sustainability, Local Context | Add a section on **biodegradable materials**, **low-carbon-footprint designs**, or **water-efficient solutions** relevant to Iraq’s **climate challenges**. |\n| **Feedback & Debrief** (Slide 17) | \"Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\" | Resource Efficiency | Incorporate **climate resilience** by asking: *\"Would this solution still work in extreme heat, water scarcity, or unreliable electricity?\"* |\n| **Non-Linear Process** (Slide 18) | \"Reframing customer problems for better solutions\" | Risk Management, Long-Term Planning | Introduce **climate adaptation scenarios**: *\"How might climate change affect customer needs over the next 10 years?\"* |\n\n---\n\n### **Task 3: Integration Opportunities**  \n\n| **Section/Slide** | **Current Content** | **Integration Opportunity** | **Reasoning** |\n|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| **\"Yes, And\" Icebreaker** (Slide 4) | Problem-solving activity (rain, heat, transportation issues) | Introduce **climate resilience challenges** (e.g., *How do we reduce extreme heat in public spaces?*) | Helps normalize climate considerations from the start of the program. |\n| **User Research** (Slide 13) | Interviewing users about their morning routine | Include questions about **climate impacts on daily life** (e.g., *How does heat or power outages affect your work?*) | Encourages entrepreneurs to consider real-world climate-related challenges. |\n| **Define the Problem** (Slide 14) | Reframing customer needs using verbs instead of nouns | Reframe needs related to **climate adaptation** (e.g., *\"We need to stay cool in summer\" → \"We need to regulate temperature efficiently\"*) | Leads to more **sustainable, long-term solutions**. |\n| **Prototyping** (Slide 16) | Using recycled/local materials | Emphasize **climate-smart solutions** (e.g., passive cooling, rainwater harvesting, energy-efficient designs) | Ensures solutions align with **sustainable infrastructure**. |\n| **Feedback & Debrief** (Slide 17) | Testing ideas with a partner | Introduce a **climate-resilience checklist**: *\"Does your solution consider energy use, waste reduction, or climate adaptability?\"* | Embeds **sustainability thinking** into product development. |\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**  \nTo integrate climate resilience effectively, consider:  \n1. **Framing climate resilience as an entrepreneurial opportunity**—help participants see the business potential in solving climate-related challenges.  \n2. **Adding climate-specific brainstorming prompts**—e.g., “How can this product work in high temperatures or without reliable electricity?”  \n3. **Embedding climate awareness into prototyping and feedback**—encourage solutions that are sustainable, resilient, and **relevant to Iraq/KRI’s context**.  \n\nWould you like a **revision guide** for trainers to implement these changes?",

      "content": "Great questions! Let's break it down:  \n\n1. **Difference Between Integration Opportunity and Potential Enhancement**  \n   - **Potential Enhancement** (in Task 2) refers to **improving existing content** by tweaking, expanding, or clarifying elements already present. Example: If the module already mentions \"recycled materials,\" the enhancement would be *“Include biodegradable materials and circular economy principles.”*\n   - **Integration Opportunity** (in Task 3) is about **adding new elements** where climate resilience naturally fits but isn’t currently addressed. Example: If a section on user research doesn’t yet mention climate factors, an integration opportunity might be *“Add climate-related questions to user interviews.”*\n\n2. **Purpose of \"Type of Reference\" and \"Current Content\"**  \n   - \"Type of Reference\" in Task 2 is intended to **categorize** existing content—does it already touch on **resource efficiency, risk management, sustainability, long-term planning, or local context**? This helps us track how well climate resilience is embedded and where there are gaps.  \n   - \"Current Content\" in Task 3 is more about **locating the content** and seeing how it currently fits within the module structure before adding something new.  \n\n3. **What the Columns Should Be Instead**  \nTo improve clarity, we might structure it like this:\n\n### **Task 2: Existing Elements Analysis (Improve Existing Content)**\n| **Section/Slide** | **Current Content** (Quote/Description) | **Relevance to Climate Resilience** (e.g., Resource Efficiency, Risk Management) | **How to Improve** |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Slide 5: Design Sprint Intro** | \"We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources.\" | **Resource Efficiency** | Expand to mention **sustainable design** and **low-impact solutions.** |\n| **Slide 15: Brainstorming** | \"What if it had to be made from recycled materials?\" | **Sustainability** | Include **circular economy principles** and **climate-smart materials.** |\n\n---\n\n### **Task 3: Integration Opportunities (Add New Content)**\n| **Section/Slide** | **Existing Content** | **New Climate Resilience Addition** | **Why It Fits** |\n|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| **Slide 4: Icebreaker** | \"How do we avoid getting wet on a rainy day?\" | Introduce **extreme heat and water scarcity challenges.** | Encourages climate thinking early in the session. |\n| **Slide 13: User Research** | Interviewing users about daily routines | Add questions on **climate impact on work & life.** | Helps participants identify real-world resilience challenges. |\n\n### **Summary of Updates for the Prompt**\n1. **Clarify Task 2 vs. Task 3** → Make Task 2 about **improving existing content** and Task 3 about **adding new content.**\n2. **Rename Columns for Clarity** → \"Potential Enhancement\" becomes \"How to Improve,\" and \"Integration Opportunity\" becomes \"New Climate Resilience Addition.\"\n3. **Remove \"Type of Reference\"** if it's not needed; instead, just **describe the relevance to climate resilience** in Task 2.\n\nWould you like me to rewrite the prompt with these updates?",
