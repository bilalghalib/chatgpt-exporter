If such a child acquired U.S. citizenship at birth, the child may be issued a Consular Report of \r\nBirth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America (CRBA) if the application is filed before the child's 18th birthday.\r\nThis form is used to collect information necessary to determine whether a child born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent or \r\nparents acquired U.S. citizenship at birth and therefore is eligible for a CRBA. For more information about birth abroad \r\nand acquisition of U.S. citizenship at birth, please visit the birth abroad page and the U.S. citizenship page on \r\ntravel.state.gov. Only the child's parent(s), legal guardian(s), person(s) acting in loco parentis, or the child may apply \r\nfor a CRBA on the child's behalf. The application generally must be submitted in the consular district where the applicant \r\nwas born and signed before a U.S. consular officer, a consular agent, or in the case of children born in U.S. military \r\nhospitals, a designated military official. A CRBA is proof of U.S. citizenship; however, it does not prove biological or legal \r\nrelationship to the parents, and it is not a travel document and does not take the place of a passport for travel purposes. \r\nIMPORTANT: You must provide the required evidence listed below before we can process the application. Please follow \r\nthe instructions below.\r\nSTEP 1: Read the instructions before completing and submitting this application. The instructions contain important \r\ninformation about completing the application and list what documents can be submitted as evidence to \r\nsupport the application.\r\nSTEP 2: Complete Section A of the application and assemble the required documentary evidence. Note: Do not sign\r\nthe application or complete Sections B or C until you are in front of a designated U.S. consular\r\nofficial or military acceptance agent.\r\nSTEP 3: Make an appointment with the U.S. embassy or consulate online or contact the U.S. consular agency or \r\ndesignated U.S. military official.\r\nSTEP 4: Take the unsigned application and supporting documents with you to your appointment at the U.S. embassy, \r\nconsulate, consular agency, or with a military acceptance agent.\r\nSTEP 5: Once the citizenship claim has been approved, the CRBA will be printed in the United States and sent to the \r\naddress you designate in the United States or the address you designate abroad in countries where the \r\nmailing of U.S. citizenship documents is permitted unless you indicate that you will pick it up at the U.S. \r\nembassy, consulate, or consular agency. Applicants are responsible for any mailing costs related to the \r\nmailing of the CRBA.\r\nWHAT TO SUBMIT WITH THIS APPLICATION\r\n1. Child's birth certificate.\r\n2.

Parents' marriage certificate, if applicable.\r\n5. Evidence of the termination of any previous marriages of the parents (divorce decree, annulment decree, or\r\ndeath certificate).\r\n6.

      "content": "Yes, **you can and should use Form DS-2029** to apply for a **Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA)** for your child who was born in France, **as long as you (or the other parent)** are a **U.S. citizen** and meet the residency/physical presence requirements before the child’s birth.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Based on what you shared:\n- Your child was born in **Tourcoing, France** on **September 29, 2023**\n- You are **currently in the U.S.**\n- You are a **U.S. citizen**\n- Your wife is **French**\n- The child was born **outside the U.S.**, so a CRBA is how you document **U.S. citizenship at birth**\n\n---\n\n### 🚨 Important Points:\n1. **You must submit the DS-2029 in person at a U.S. embassy or consulate** in the country where the child was born (France).\n   - Even though you are in the U.S. now, **the form must be submitted in the consular district** where the child was born.\n   - That means **you or your wife** (if she has power of attorney or Form DS-5507 from you) must **make an appointment at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in France** (likely Paris or a regional consulate).\n\n2. If **you can't go back to France**, you may contact the U.S. Embassy in Paris to see if **exceptions** can be made or if they can **accept documentation via mail or by another relative**, though this is rare.\n\n3. Alternatively, you can **apply for a U.S. passport directly**, but most embassies **require a CRBA before issuing a passport** for a child born abroad.\n\n---\n\n### 📋 What You'll Need:\n- **Form DS-2029 (unsigned)**\n- Your **U.S. citizenship evidence** (passport, naturalization cert, etc.)\n- Your **proof of physical presence** in the U.S. before the child was born (e.g. school, tax, work, utility records)\n- Child’s **original French birth certificate**\n- Marriage certificate\n- Both parents’ IDs/passports\n- If only one parent is attending, **Form DS-5507** may be needed for the absent U.S. citizen parent\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Next Step:\n- **Book an appointment with the U.S. Embassy in Paris or a U.S. Consulate in France**\n  - [Embassy Paris – CRBA Information](https://fr.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-family-matters/birth/)\n- Prepare your documents and fill out **DS-2029 but don’t sign it** until you're in front of a consular officer\n\n---\n\nIf you want help checking whether you meet the U.S. **physical presence requirement**, I can help you calculate that too—just let me know when and where you lived in the U.S. before your child’s birth.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a checklist or help filling the form too.",

      "content": "Applying for a U.S. passport for your child born in France without traveling back to France is possible, but it requires careful coordination. Here are your options:\n\n**1. Apply for a U.S. Passport Without a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA):**\n\nWhile a CRBA is the standard document to prove U.S. citizenship for children born abroad, you can apply directly for a U.S. passport by providing alternative evidence of citizenship. This process is more complex and requires thorough documentation.\n\n**Required Documentation:**\n\n- **Child’s Foreign Birth Certificate:** An original or certified copy of the birth certificate issued by French authorities, listing both parents.\n\n- **Evidence of U.S. Citizenship of the Parent(s):** Your U.S. passport, birth certificate, or naturalization certificate.\n\n- **Proof of Physical Presence in the U.S.:** Documents demonstrating that you were physically present in the United States before your child's birth, such as school records, employment records, tax returns, or utility bills.\n\n- **Marriage Certificate:** If applicable, provide your marriage certificate to establish the relationship between the parents.\n\n- **Form DS-11:** Complete the [Application for a U.S. Passport (Form DS-11)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/forms.html).\n\n**Application Process:**\n\n- **In-Person Submission:** Both parents and the child must appear in person at a [passport acceptance facility](https://iafdb.travel.state.gov/) in the United States. If one parent cannot be present, they must provide a notarized [Form DS-3053: Statement of Consent](https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds3053.pdf).\n\n- **Additional Evidence:** Be prepared to provide any additional documentation requested by the passport agency to establish the child’s U.S. citizenship.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- This process can be more time-consuming and may require additional scrutiny since the CRBA is the preferred evidence of citizenship for children born abroad.\n\n- Ensure all documents are original or certified copies; photocopies are generally not accepted.\n\n**2. Contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in France:**\n\nGiven that the CRBA application is typically processed in the country of the child's birth, you might consider contacting the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in France to inquire about alternative arrangements. They may offer solutions such as:\n\n- **Third-Party Submission:** Authorizing a trusted individual in France to submit the application on your behalf. This would require a notarized authorization and coordination with the embassy or consulate.\n\n- **Remote Processing:** In exceptional cases, the embassy or consulate may provide guidance on remote processing options, though this is rare and handled on a case-by-case basis.\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n\n1. **Contact the U.S. Embassy in Paris:**\n\n   - **Email:** [ParisACS@state.gov](mailto:ParisACS@state.gov)\n\n   - **Phone:** +33 1 43 12 22 22\n\n2. **Explain Your Situation:** Clearly outline that you are a U.S. citizen parent seeking to document your child's U.S. citizenship and are currently unable to travel to France.\n\n3. **Follow Their Guidance:** The embassy staff can provide specific instructions based on your circumstances.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- Processing times may vary, and additional documentation may be required.\n\n- Ensure all communications with the embassy or consulate are well-documented.\n\n- Be prepared for possible delays and plan accordingly, especially if you have upcoming travel plans requiring your child’s U.S. passport.\n\nBy carefully following these steps and maintaining clear communication with the appropriate authorities, you can navigate the process of obtaining your child's U.S. passport without the need to travel to France. ",
