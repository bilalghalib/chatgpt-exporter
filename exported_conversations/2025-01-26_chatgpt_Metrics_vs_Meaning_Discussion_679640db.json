As tears flowed and hearts opened, I witnessed something our carefully designed metrics and platforms could never capture: the pure beauty of people fully aligned with their calling. It wasn't just emotional response - it was recognition of something real, something our impact frameworks weren't built to see.\nThe Two Ways of Seeing\nI felt this tension acutely when invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had constructed a story of impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge and speak for itself. This wasn't about inadequate measurement - it was about a fundamental misalignment in how we were seeing.\nBeyond Best Practices\nInitially, our approach made perfect sense: validate assessments, unify a fragmented impact industry, track progress across accelerator programs. But as I worked with more entrepreneurs, I began to see something different. Every real success story was unique - not because it defied measurement, but because it emerged from authentic connection to meaning.\nThis isn't about abandoning measurement but about seeing with both eyes:\n\nOne eye for metrics and frameworks\nOne eye for direct quality recognition\nBoth needed for depth perception\n\nThe Nature of Real Authority\nWhat makes Father Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries so powerful isn't his impact metrics - it's the simple truth when he says \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability; it's revealing a different kind of authority that comes from authentic relationship rather than constructed impact.\nA Different Kind of Story\nWe've learned that social enterprises need more than problem-solution narratives. They need stories that:\n\nEmerge from real meaning\nEvolve organically\nConnect specifically to sources of meaning\nCreate natural resonance\n\nWhen entrepreneurs connect with their true sources of meaning, they naturally:\n\nAttract aligned resources\nBuild authentic relationships\nCreate lasting impact\nEnable natural growth\n\nThe Path Forward\nThis suggests a fundamental shift in how we support social impact:\n\nFrom constructing impact to recognizing beauty\nFrom forcing growth to enabling emergence\nFrom measuring change to embodying meaning\nFrom doing good to being alive\n\nPart II: What's Really Missing - Beyond Metrics to Meaning\nThe Tension We All Feel\nThe rushing tells us something. When we feel constantly hurried at Bloom, when we push to build software before ensuring it serves real needs, when we chase metrics that don't quite capture what matters - these aren't just operational issues. They're symptoms of a deeper misalignment: trying to achieve meaningful ends through instrumental means.\nThe Different Quality of Non-Instrumental Action\nFather Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries illuminates this distinction perfectly. When asked about his \"impact metrics,\" he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability - it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\nThis shows up in how we feel about our work. When invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera, I felt a deep unease - not because the work wasn't valuable, but because I sensed it wasn't yet flowing from that place of pure recognition and response. The contrast with Father Greg's natural authority was stark: his impact flows from friendship, while I was still caught in metrics and justification.\nThe Nature of Quality Recognition\nWhat we're missing isn't another framework or better metrics. It's trust in our capacity to recognize quality directly. This isn't intuition or emotion, though these can point us toward it. Rather:\n\nEmotions and tension often signal blocked meaning\n\"Have to\" versus \"want to\" reveals instrumental thinking\nRushing indicates misaligned action\nQuality recognition feels like natural rightness\n\nFrom Signals to Sources\nThe key shift happens when we learn to read these signals not as problems to solve but as pointers toward blocked sources of meaning:\n\nTension points to possibilities we're not seeing\nFear indicates protection rather than presence\nRushing reveals misaligned timing\nDoubt suggests disconnection from quality\n\nWhen we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information. These feelings aren't the truth itself - they're signals pointing toward a truth we already recognize but haven't yet trusted or acted upon.\nThe Practice of Presence\nDeveloping this capacity requires specific practices:\n\nSlowing down to sense what's really needed\nAddressing emotions directly to see what they reveal\nMaking clear decisions that reduce mental noise\nCreating space for quality recognition\nBuilding from authentic relationship\n\nThe result isn't slower work but what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - action that flows naturally from recognition rather than being forced by metrics or fear.\nPart III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing - Natural Models for Social Impact\nThe Wisdom of Gardens\nWhen we approach social impact like gardeners rather than factory managers, everything changes. A gardener needs tomatoes, yes - there are real outcomes to achieve. But they understand something profound about how change happens: you can't force a seed to grow. You can only create conditions that support its natural unfolding.\nThis isn't passive - it requires deep engagement:\n\nReading the soil and weather\nUnderstanding natural cycles\nLearning from experience\nPlanning for lean times\nResponding to challenges\n\nBut it's a different kind of engagement. Instead of attempting to control outcomes through force, we participate in something larger. This creates natural resilience rather than artificial stability.\nThe Craft Way of Seeing\nCraft offers another crucial model. When a craftsperson works with materials, something remarkable happens: mere stuff becomes relationship. A pot isn't just clay shaped by technique - it's a conversation between maker, material, and eventual user. This transforms how we understand quality and scale:\nQuality Through Relationship\n\nDirect material engagement\nBalance of measurement and feeling\nIntegration of planning and presence\nNatural sustainability through care\n\nLearning Through Tradition\n\nMastering form before innovation\nKnowledge passed through practice\nCommunity-held wisdom\nDeep material understanding\n\nNatural Scale\n\nQuality reduces waste\nLocal materials create resilience\nSkills build community\nBeauty spreads naturally\n\nThe Integration of Measurement and Meaning\nWhat makes craft particularly relevant for social impact is how it naturally integrates quantitative and qualitative understanding. A craftsperson's movements embody both measurement and sensing - they're not separate activities but aspects of one integrated way of knowing.\nThis shows us how metrics and meaning can work together:\n\nQuality emerges from careful attention\nMeasurement serves beauty\nForm enables rather than constrains\nTradition guides innovation\n\nSmooth is Fast: The Paradox of Pace\nPerhaps most importantly, craft teaches us about timing. Like the cook who breaks the jar by rushing, we often create delays through forced speed. But when we trust quality recognition:\n\nNatural rhythm emerges\nRight action becomes clear\nOthers align naturally\nResources flow appropriately\n\nThis isn't slow for slowness' sake. It's what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - the paradoxical efficiency that comes from aligned action rather than forced effort.\nImplications for Social Impact\nThis suggests a different approach to social enterprise:\n\nCreate conditions rather than force outcomes\nBuild capacity through relationship\nLet quality guide growth\nTrust natural timing\n\nWhen we do this:\n\nImpact emerges naturally\nCommunities build resilience\nResources align with needs\nBeauty spreads organically\n\nThe key is seeing that, like gardens and craft, social impact isn't something we make happen through force. It's something we participate in through wise attention and aligned action.\nPart IV: Practical Implications for Bloom - From Platform to Practice\nRethinking Our Foundation\nThe most profound implication of this shift in thinking requires us to challenge our core assumption: that software is our path to scale and sustainability. In an age where AI and new technologies are rapidly transforming digital tools, we need to ask ourselves a more fundamental question: What is our true craft?\nWhat We Really Offer\nThe evidence of our value is clear but misunderstood:\n\nPeople love our programs\nTransformation happens consistently\nDeep connections form\nReal growth emerges\n\nYet we've been trying to capture this in software, attempting to scale what might not be meant for scaling. Instead, we need to:\n\nFocus on our genuine craft\nLet value guide structure\nAllow natural growth\nTrust quality recognition\n\nA New Model for Our Work\nFor Entrepreneurs\nInstead of pushing platform engagement, we create conditions where they:\n\nFeel truly seen and connected\nDevelop self-knowledge and confidence\nLearn to trust their quality recognition\nAccess genuine wisdom\nFind natural resources and support\n\nFor Our Team\nWe shift from monitoring to nurturing:\n\nCultivating circumstances for growth\nFinding and connecting with true mentors\nEnsuring principles are embodied not just understood\nUsing metrics to reflect rather than direct\nStarting with territory before consulting maps\n\nFor Partners\nRelationships deepen naturally:\n\nIntegration with meaning\nAuthentic value creation\nReality-based assessment\nNatural resource flow\n\nThe Path Forward\nSpecific Changes Required:\n\nProgram Focus: Start with direct relationship; Let technology support not lead; Measure after, not during; Build from real value\nBusiness Model: Simple, clear value proposition; Direct payment for real service; Natural growth from quality; Sustainable core practice\nAssessment Approach: Quality recognition first; Metrics for reflection; Natural feedback loops; Organic development\n\nPractical Experiments\nCome Alive Coaching\n\nStart with pro bono trials\nPartner with professional coaches\nDocument real transformation\nBuild from genuine results\n\nCore Practice Development\n\nIdentify our true craft\nFocus on direct value\nLet natural scale emerge\nTrust quality recognition\n\nRelationship Restructuring\n\nDirect connection with participants\nValue-based funding relationships\nCommunity of practice\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Technology Question\nInstead of forcing platform adoption, technology should:\n\nSupport human connection\nEnable natural processes\nDocument real value\nScale what works naturally\n\nThis means:\n\nSimpler tools\nDirect support of practice\nNatural integration\nOrganic growth\n\nMeasuring Success Differently\nSuccess looks like:\n\nReal transformation in participants\nSustainable value creation\nNatural resource flow\nCommunity growth\nQuality recognition development\n\nThis isn't abandoning scale but trusting that:\n\nQuality creates natural growth\nValue attracts resources\nBeauty spreads organically\nWisdom develops naturally\n\nThe key is starting with what's real and valuable, letting genuine craft guide our development rather than forcing growth through artificial means.\nPart V: The Path Forward - From Where We Are to Where We're Called\nBuilding from Strength\nLooking clearly at our work, we already have powerful elements aligned with this vision:\nWhat's Working:\n\nLearning Journeys: Custom assessment approach; Personal challenge identification; Individual growth paths\nCore Practices: Upside-down pyramid methodology; Starting with deeper why; Focus on wellbeing; Breaking out for connection; Relationship building\nCommunity Elements: Cohort connections; Mentor relationships; Peer learning; Reflective practice\n\nNecessary Shifts\nFrom Software-First to Human-First:\n\nTechnology supports don't leads\nCommunity precedes platform\nRelationship drives development\nReflection guides action\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning:\n\nRemove \"habits of success\" language\nShift from goals to emergence\nTransform assessment approach\nStart with territory, end with maps\n\nFrom Programs to Practice:\n\nCoaching as core offering\nDeep relationship building\nMaster-apprentice model\nNatural development paths\n\nPractical Next Steps\nImmediate Actions (1-3 months):\n\nLaunch pilot coaching program\nClean language/materials\nDocument current successes\nStart stakeholder conversations\n\nMedium Term (3-6 months):\n\nValidate \"Come Alive\" methodology\nDevelop new funding relationships\nCreate craft-based accelerator model\nBuild natural assessment approach\n\nLong Term Vision:\n\nBecome transmission line for wisdom\nCreate conditions for emergence\nEnable natural scale through quality\nBuild true mastery\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nFinding Aligned Partners:\n\nFoundations focused on practical spirituality\nFunders seeking systemic change\nPartners valuing depth over scale\nCommunities supporting transformation\n\nDemonstrating Value:\n\nShare success stories\nShow alternative models working\nDocument real transformation\nBuild evidence through practice\n\nCreating New Narratives:\n\nFrom scale to depth\nFrom metrics to meaning\nFrom control to emergence\nFrom programs to practice\n\nMeasures of Success\nIn 6 months we should see:\nValidated Methodology\n\nTested coaching approach\nClear value proposition\nNatural payment model\nDirect impact evidence\n\nTransformed Relationships\n\nDeeper mentor connections\nStronger community bonds\nAligned funding partners\nClear transmission lines\n\nNew Offerings\n\nCraft-based accelerator\nIntegrated technology support\nQuality-centered assessment\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Super Bloom Vision\nInstead of forcing growth, we cultivate conditions where:\n\nBeauty emerges naturally\nWisdom transfers clearly\nCommunity builds organically\nImpact flows naturally\n\nThis isn't slower - it's aligned with natural timing. Not smaller - but scaled through quality. Not less impactful - but transformative at the root.\nThe key is trusting that when we align with quality:\n\nRight relationships form\nResources flow naturally\nImpact emerges organically\nBeauty spreads naturally\n\nOur role becomes:\n\nCreating conditions\nSupporting emergence\nEnabling transmission\nTrusting quality\n\nThis is how we contribute to the super bloom - not by forcing growth but by planting seeds in fertile soil, tending with wisdom, and trusting the natural unfolding of beauty and impact.]]]\nEssay two[[[\n1. Sustainability and Revenue\nQuestion: As we propose coaching or mentoring models, how do we ensure financial viability without slipping back into “instrumentalizing” participants?\nAnswer:\n\nTransparent Value Exchange: We charge for genuine services that participants want—coaching, mentorship, facilitation—rather than bundling them into programs for the sake of metrics.\nRespect for Participants: We’re clear about fees and outcomes without coercing sign-ups. They pay because they see real value, not because we’re checking a funder’s box.\nMixed Model: We can keep certain pilot programs free or subsidized (to learn and refine) while eventually offering advanced versions as a paid service.\nAuthentic Funding Relationships: Seek funders who value depth and meaning, so we don’t have to shape participants into “data points” but can let them grow naturally.\n2. Team Alignment\nQuestion: How do we bring our internal team on board, especially those who are used to data-driven logic? What’s the simplest starting practice?\nAnswer:\n\nShared Reflection Sessions: Host short weekly “presence circles” where the team discusses real experiences—what felt rushed, what felt alive.\nIntroduce the Craft/Gardening Metaphor: Help them see that metrics aren’t vanishing but take a supporting role.\nPilot One Cohort: Let the team test the new approach on a small group, so they feel the difference rather than just hearing about it theoretically.\nCelebrate Small Wins: Highlight stories of participants who benefit from a slower, relational style, demonstrating “smooth is fast” in action.\n3. Longer-Term Vision\nQuestion: After initial pilots, how do we see Bloom evolving? Could this scale beyond a niche group?\nAnswer:\n\nNetworked Growth: Instead of forcing wide-scale adoption, let success stories and word-of-mouth organically expand our reach.\nMentor Multiplication: Train new mentors who embody these principles, growing the capacity to serve more entrepreneurs without sacrificing depth.\nHybrid Approaches: Keep refining minimal tech solutions that truly enhance relationships. If certain tools prove genuinely helpful, we integrate them carefully.\nLiving Ecosystem: Over time, Bloom could become a center of craft-based social enterprise, known for authenticity, resilience, and real transformation—attracting diverse partners who share these values.\nFrom Metrics to Meaning: A New Vision for Social Impact\nPart I: Journey to Seeing with Both Eyes\nThe Dubai Moment\nMy turning point arrived in Dubai, watching entrepreneurs share raw stories. I’ll never forget Marie Claire’s tears as she described creating feminine hygiene solutions for women who’d been shamed into silence. In that instant, I realized how little our carefully planned metrics captured the beauty of what was happening. We’d built dashboards and funnels, but we were missing something essential.\n\nOne Eye Closed\nFor so long, I’d been using only the “metrics eye,” believing success meant goals achieved, checklists completed. As we pushed participants to use software they didn’t truly want, I felt a creeping unease—like we were forcing them to serve our need for data. I dismissed the discomfort as a mere mood. It took hearing these entrepreneurs speak from the heart to see I was ignoring a legitimate perception: that sense of “this isn’t right.”\n\nTwo Eyes Open\nIt was a realization of a “territory eye” we’d neglected—a faculty of quality recognition. Rational metrics and goals (the map) are helpful, but we’d never paused to see if they reflected real terrain. Opening both eyes means we keep measuring—yet only after sensing reality. Without that second eye, we lose depth and end up building systems that lack soul.\n\nPart II: What’s Really Missing\nMore Than Emotions\nThis faculty isn’t just intuition; it’s a direct way of knowing what’s truly good or beautiful. Father Greg Boyle calls gang members his friends, not “targets” for social metrics, and that authenticity yields real impact. We might not replicate his exact model, but the principle applies: start with relationships, then measure—don’t start by measuring.\n\nInstrumental vs. Non-Instrumental\nWe’ve also integrated “wellbeing” at Bloom, but often as a means to an end—so participants don’t burn out and can keep performing. True wellbeing, however, emerges from alignment with deeper purpose, not from a hack or a module. When entrepreneurs connect with their sources of meaning, everything else naturally falls into place.\n\nThe Tension of Forced Metrics\nNothing illustrated this more starkly than the hours we spent driving people onto our online platform “for data,” rather than letting them find the support they genuinely needed. It felt off, but we persisted out of fear: fear we’d wasted funds, fear we had nothing else to offer, fear of losing donor support.\n\nPart III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing\nGarden Metaphor\nA gardener doesn’t force growth. She plants seeds, waters, observes—trusting nature’s rhythms. Of course, she has goals (tomatoes!), but she doesn’t yank the plants to make them taller. That is our shift: from controlling to cultivating.\n\nmermaid\nCopy\nEdit\nflowchart TD\n    A[Factory Mindset] -->|Attempts| B[Control/Force]\n    C[Garden Mindset] -->|Creates| D[Conditions for Growth]\n    B -->|Results in| E[Fragility]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Resilience/Abundance]\nCraft Approach\nJust as a craftsperson shapes wood or clay, we can shape social programs with care and attention. Craft means:\n\nQuality Through Relationship: We measure and sense at the same time, letting both logic and direct perception guide us.\nLearning Through Tradition: We build on wisdom from mentors or from the best examples (like Buurtzorg or Sounds True) that embody trust and care.\nSmooth Is Fast: Ironically, slowing down to sense quality can lead to faster alignment and better outcomes than rushing into forced solutions.\nIntegration\nRather than ignoring metrics or structure, we embed them in a deeper process. We measure to confirm what we already sense is happening, rather than letting metrics alone dictate the course.\n\nPart IV: Practical Implications for Bloom\n1. Shifting Focus Away From Software\n\nStop Forcing Adoption: If participants don’t organically benefit from a tool, we don’t push it to meet a “data goal.”\nAI Reality Check: With tech evolving, our energy is better spent refining the human dimension. If a digital feature emerges as truly helpful, we’ll see it from real demand, not from a map-first approach.\n2. Identifying Our Core Craft\n\nOwn Our Expertise: We excel at facilitating, mentoring, and building trusting spaces. Let’s brand that as our core offering.\nSell the Relationship, Not Just the Program: We can move beyond free or donor-funded services if we’re transparent that the “Come Alive” style of facilitation has real, tangible value.\n3. Reorienting Engagement\n\n“Territory First” Conversations: Start by listening to participants’ stories, understanding their intrinsic motivations—metrics come after.\nCoach, Don’t Command: We cultivate safe conditions. They decide how to act, we reflect with them.\nRespectful Assessments: We can still use them to reveal blind spots, but not to funnel participants for our own data ends.\n4. Bloom Team as Gardeners\n\nLess Monitoring, More Presence: Fewer forced check-ins, more open, trust-based dialogues.\nMentor Readiness: Onboard mentors who “get” these emergent principles.\nAligned Funding: Seek out donors who appreciate real transformation, not just vanity metrics.\n5. Integrating Partners More Deeply\n\nShared Presencing: Invite funders and allies to experience the real conversations.\nCo-Creation: Let them help shape our environment, bridging the usual gap between “program designers” and “participants.”\nPart V: Path Forward\nA. Proposed Experiments\n\n“Come Alive” Coaching\n\nPilot Cohort: 6–8 participants for a month, focusing on emotional clarity, presence, and personal alignment.\nNarrative Reflections: Instead of heavy forms, gather personal stories to gauge impact.\nPaid Model: After refining, offer as a paid service.\nMentor Boot Camp\n\nTrain the Mentors: Ensure they guide from trust and relationship, not from rigid checklists.\nOutcome: A cadre of aligned mentors who can spark genuine emergence in participants.\nSoftware Reboot\n\nMinimal Tech: Rely on simple spreadsheets, calls, or Slack channels. Build or automate only once a need consistently surfaces.\nUser Feedback: If a certain tool arises as truly helpful, scale that, but only after real-world testing.\nFunding Roundtable\n\nStory-Centric Presentations: Share real stories of transformation with potential funders.\nOpen Dialogue: Ask funders, “What do you value beyond metrics?”\nPartnership: Co-create new funding structures that respect the emergent, craft-like approach.\nB. Indicators of Success\n\nEntrepreneurs: They display deeper self-awareness, reduced “chasing,” and a sense that their business is a craft.\nBloom Team: Less frantic energy, more genuine time with participants, and clarity on how each staff member contributes as a gardener.\nPartners/Funders: Eager to join real conversations, open to stories of relational depth, supportive of a new “quality-first” logic.\nConclusion: Two Eyes, One Heart\nWe started by reflecting on the tension between maps and territory—between the external metrics we rely on and the deeper wisdom we can sense within. Bloom’s path forward is to honor both eyes but give priority to the living reality—the “territory”—before we interpret the map’s data.\n\nWhen we do this:\n\nAuthentic Impact emerges naturally, because entrepreneurs operate from deeper purpose, not superficial tasks.\nSustainable Revenue is possible when people see the real value of our facilitation and coaching (rather than “free programs” that hide donor-driven metrics).\nScalability takes a new form, rooted in networked growth, mentor multiplicity, and organic demand rather than forced expansion.\nIn essence, we’re moving from a “factory mindset” to a “garden mindset,” from “instrumental action” to “craft.” It’s not that we reject metrics or technology, but that we place them in service of an alive, human process—a process that truly makes entrepreneurs (and us) come alive.\n\nThank you for journeying with me through these reflections. I believe, together, we can guide Bloom into a more aligned and generative future—one that balances practicality with presence, structure with spirit, and finally uses both eyes to see the full beauty of what social impact can be.]]]\n\n\nWhat is the differences between these two essays and how can we align between them, what are the best places to sprinkle in some examples from here: [[[Current Strong Examples:\n1.

And maybe relatedly, we can talk about craft. And, you know, whether they're traditionally seen as jobs that are not meaningful because Manufacturing and meaningful jobs are all about jobs of the mind, but how that might not necessarily be the case. And then let's see if we can orient around these ideas of doing the right thing also means that the world is more beautiful. Not that just just financial. Sustainability, but then, like, you look at the inward and the outward is you get You know? Like, you want social impact. You want environmental stewardship and sustainability, but if you look within guess without something like\nYes - let's explore how meaning can emerge in supposedly \"mundane\" work and how inner/outer beauty align. Let me gather examples of organizations that demonstrate this:\n# Beauty in the \"Mundane\": Meaning Through Craft and Care\n\n1. Shinola (Detroit)\nInner Beauty:\n- Revived watchmaking craft in Detroit\n- Trained local workers in high-precision skills\n- Created pride in manufacturing work\n- Every worker signs their work\n\nOuter Impact:\n- Transformed neighborhood economy\n- Proved craft possible in urban renewal\n- Created new narrative for Detroit\n- Quality products last longer, reduce waste\n\nKey Insight: When craft is honored, both makers and community flourish.\n\n2. New Belgium Brewing\nInner Beauty:\n- Employee-owned craft brewery\n- Every employee learns entire brewing process\n- Decisions made through collective wisdom\n- Craft approach to scale\n\nOuter Impact:\n- Pioneer in sustainable brewing\n- Zero waste operations\n- Transformed industry practices\n- Proved craft can scale sustainably\n\nKey Insight: Understanding the craft deeply creates natural environmental stewardship.\n\n3. Arlan's Boat Works (Maine)\nInner Beauty:\n- Traditional wooden boat building\n- Apprenticeship model of learning\n- Each boat uniquely crafted\n- Multi-generation knowledge transfer\n\nOuter Impact:\n- Preserves sustainable practices\n- Creates boats that last centuries\n- Maintains maritime culture\n- Shows alternative to mass production\n\nKey Insight: Traditional craft knowledge often contains embedded sustainability wisdom.\n\n4. San Francisco Zen Center's Tassajara Bakery\nInner Beauty:\n- Bread baking as meditation practice\n- Every loaf made with full presence\n- Work practice as spiritual training\n- Craft as path to meaning\n\nOuter Impact:\n- Influenced artisanal food movement\n- Created model of mindful business\n- Proved contemplative work viable\n- Connected community through food\n\nKey Insight: When work itself becomes practice, meaning emerges naturally.\n\n5. Polyface Farms\nInner Beauty:\n- \"The farm that heals the land\"\n- Every practice aligned with natural patterns\n- Workers develop deep ecological knowledge\n- Farming as craft and calling\n\nOuter Impact:\n- Transformed agricultural practices\n- Proved regenerative farming works\n- Created new farmer training model\n- Demonstrated viable alternative to industrial ag\n\nKey Insight: When inner alignment guides practice, outer healing follows.\n\nCommon Patterns:\n\n1. Craft Creates Meaning\n- Detailed knowledge brings satisfaction\n- Physical work can be contemplative\n- Quality emerges from presence\n- Skills development builds dignity\n\n2. Inner/Outer Alignment\n- Beautiful process creates beautiful results\n- Craft knowledge contains sustainability wisdom\n- Personal meaning creates social benefit\n- Quality naturally reduces waste\n\n3. Community Impact\n- Craft creates culture\n- Skills build community\n- Knowledge transfers between generations\n- Local wisdom solves global problems\n\n4. Sustainable by Nature\n- Quality lasts longer\n- Traditional knowledge often sustainable\n- Craft approach reduces waste\n- Beauty creates natural conservation\n\n5. Scale Through Depth\n- Quality scales differently than quantity\n- Meaning multiplies through apprenticeship\n- Impact through influence not size\n- Beauty spreads naturally\n\nWhat Makes These Examples Powerful:\n\n1. Challenge Contemporary Assumptions\n- Manual work can be meaningful\n- Craft knowledge matters\n- Traditional wisdom valuable\n- Quality more efficient than speed\n\n2. Demonstrate Natural Connection\n- Inner and outer beauty align\n- Personal meaning creates social good\n- Quality naturally sustainable\n- Craft contains ecological wisdom\n\n3. Show New Possibilities\n- Alternative to industrial model\n- Different way of scaling\n- Meaning possible anywhere\n- Beauty practical and profitable\n\nThese examples suggest that:\n- Any work can become meaningful through craft approach\n- Inner beauty naturally creates outer beauty\n- Traditional wisdom often contains solutions\n- Quality and presence create natural sustainability\n- Meaning emerges through attention to craft\n\nThe key isn't finding \"meaningful work\" but bringing meaning through quality attention to any work. When this happens, both inner and outer beauty emerge naturally.]]]\n\nI'd like first to compare and contrast the two essays trying to convince my cofounders of my focus on quality as a primary shift in perspective that addresses the issue in social impact being instrumental, and not changing things at a root level because it is not realizing it's operating in a system (investors, human resources, world resources, impact, acceleration, speed, challenge, solution) that it can't see and reinforcing it, underlining it, making it stick and sticky rather than bringing in ways to solve problems and create value and sustain life that work with different fundamental worldviews, ontologies and epistemologies, that we have a faculty of perception of beauty goodness and truth that is reliable and trustworthy as a guide, that this sense is accessible yet often covered by emotions, that the confusion between \"irrational\" emotions and the reality of the deep sense of rightness that comes when we touch our sources of meaning has blocked us from acknowledging this faculty, that not touching this faculty has led us to not trust humans, and believe that they are living nasty brutish and short lives and that darwin's perspective of survival of the fittest is right and those that produce the most benefit for the most number deserve the most to be rewarded and to live (potentially forever) - a natural consequence of these unseen underlying beliefs about the metaphysical cosmological understanding of our world while we have great examples of people choosing to follow a different path, the path of the heart, you might say, like sounds true, and others described int he document above, noe that connects with quality, the reason for doing thigns rather than the result, for instance we see micro lending suicides where those reaching out and hounding the poor farmers with 100 dollar loans saw them as a means to an end \"getting their paycheck or comission\" and reaching \"closing rates\" vs realizing the fundamental point of micro credit was to bring people out of poverty and suffering - not to cause it. That with touching this source of quality we see people who understand how they do anything is how they do everything and to sink into the quality of the work becoming crafts people where action and measurement and production all touch in a moment of now rather than a goal in the future to sell what's made, to speed up the process, to get it done with because money is freedom. Freedom is having a life you want to live, a life where you've come alive. And if we look at the broaden and build theory, we can see that its' clear when we come alive, we expand our capacity, our ability to serve, oru wellbeing, we become reliable people, the next masters able to take on apprentences... Review all this content and identify the differences between the two essays, the stories that apply where and integrate this section I've just written throught the newly combined essay, write about how you'd like to go about doing it and write the new essay ",

Comparing and Contrasting the Two Essays\n\n### Essay One: “From Metrics to Meaning: A New Vision for Social Impact”\n\n- **Tone & Focus:**  \n  - More philosophical and reflective.  \n  - Emphasizes the tension between measurement (metrics) and a deeper perception of meaning or “beauty.”  \n  - Urges shifting from “doing good” to “recognizing beauty,” from forcing outcomes to enabling emergence.  \n  - Highlights examples like Father Greg Boyle’s approach (“They’re my friends”) to show authentic relationship over instrumentalized metrics.\n\n- **Core Argument:**  \n  - We have a neglected faculty of directly perceiving quality and truth—beyond standard frameworks of measurement.  \n  - True social impact emerges naturally when people connect with deeper sources of meaning and beauty, much like gardeners cultivating growth rather than factory managers forcing production.\n\n- **Structure:**  \n  - Deep dives into philosophical underpinnings (craft, gardening, “smooth is fast,” etc.).  \n  - Points to practical implications for social enterprise (shifting from a software-first approach toward a deeper, relationship-based model).\n\n### Essay Two: “[Q&A + Practical Expansion]”\n\n- **Tone & Focus:**  \n  - More practical, structured around questions and answers.  \n  - Addresses concrete challenges: sustainability and revenue, team alignment, longer-term vision, and pilot experiments (e.g., “Come Alive Coaching,” minimal tech approach).\n\n- **Core Argument:**  \n  - Bloom can shift to a new model (less forced software usage, more coaching/mentoring) while still being financially viable.  \n  - Suggests immediate experiments/pilots, “presence circles,” small cohorts, and new funding approaches that respect depth over superficial metrics.\n\n- **Structure:**  \n  - Q&A addressing concerns about sustainability, team buy-in, scale.  \n  - Practical steps for rolling out a relationship-centered model.\n\n### Key Differences & Points of Alignment\n\n- **Differences:**  \n  1. **Philosophical Depth vs. Practicality:** Essay One foregrounds deeper shifts in worldview, while Essay Two focuses on immediate action steps and pilot initiatives.  \n  2. **Narrative Flow vs. Structured Q&A:** Essay One reads more like a narrative or manifesto; Essay Two reads like a field guide or action plan.  \n\n- **Overlap & Synergy:**  \n  1. Both critique the current “impact” approach as too metric-driven.  \n  2. Both emphasize authenticity, trust, and relationships over forced measurement or software.  \n  3. Both see measurement as still valid—but only in service to real meaning and “beauty.”  \n\nA combined essay can weave the deeper worldview shift (Essay One) together with the practical roadmap (Essay Two), showing that these ideas are not just inspirational but also implementable.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Suggested Approach for Integration\n\n1. **Open With a Philosophical Call:**  \n   - Begin with the “aha” moment (the Dubai experience, entrepreneurs sharing raw stories) to set the tone that real transformation arises when we see with “both eyes”—metrics and direct quality recognition.  \n\n2. **Show the Underlying Worldview Problem:**  \n   - Discuss how typical social impact frameworks often reinforce a “mechanistic” or “instrumental” worldview (the system we’re trapped in).  \n   - Bring in the notion that hidden cosmologies and assumptions about human nature (e.g., “nasty, brutish, and short”) feed into the mania for metrics and “efficiency.”  \n\n3. **Introduce the Faculty of Perceiving Beauty/Meaning:**  \n   - Clarify that this is not just “emotional whim” but a legitimate way of knowing—one that is trustworthy yet often ignored.  \n   - Connect to practical examples (e.g., Father Greg Boyle, Sounds True, micro-lending fiascos) to show the real difference it makes.  \n\n4. **Transition to Practical Shifts (from Essay Two):**  \n   - Summarize the Q&A sections but with narrative transitions—team alignment, pilot programs, leadership choices, etc.  \n   - Discuss how to remain financially viable without slipping back into instrumentalizing participants.  \n\n5. **Use Real-World Examples to Illustrate Each Main Point:**  \n   - Weave in references from Buurtzorg, Mondragón, Patagonia, etc.—especially highlighting how they overcame crises or scaled in a relational way.  \n   - Show how seemingly “mundane” industries also experience deep transformations (e.g., Shinola in Detroit, or craft-based approaches like Arlan’s Boat Works).  \n\n6. **Conclude with the Bigger Picture and Next Steps:**  \n   - Reiterate that measuring success differently doesn’t mean ignoring outcomes; it means making outcomes serve genuine human flourishing.  \n   - Reflect on how “smooth is fast” truly applies—especially in the social enterprise domain.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. The Newly Combined Essay\n\n### Title  \n**From Metrics to Meaning: Bridging Worldviews, Building True Impact**\n\n#### Part I: The Shift Begins—Seeing with Both Eyes\n\nMy turning point came in Dubai. Surrounded by entrepreneurs sharing raw stories—stories that dripped with vulnerability and genuine longing—I felt something our dashboards and curated frameworks could never capture. It was a recognition of pure beauty: human beings deeply aligned with a calling. In that moment, I realized our usual impact measurements, while not useless, were one-eyed at best. We were ignoring a vital faculty of perceiving truth and meaning directly.\n\nThis blindness to beauty is pervasive in social enterprise. We chase goals, checklists, or traction metrics under the banner of “doing good,” yet fail to see that we are often reinforcing the very systems that generate harm in the first place. Yes, we track progress, but we rarely ask: *Progress toward what, and guided by which worldview?*\n\n#### Part II: Uncovering the Hidden Worldview\n\nMany of our social impact efforts operate within a mechanistic, instrumental system: it sees people as resources to be used, or problems to be solved. It is rooted in assumptions about human nature—beings who must be monitored or incentivized, else they revert to nastiness. It’s no wonder so many philanthropic or micro-lending programs slip into dehumanizing participants: the worldview itself encourages seeing human beings as data points, cogs in a bigger machine.\n\n**Case in Point:**  \n- **Micro-lending Suicides**: In certain regions, farmers were hounded by collection agents so fixated on “closing rates” that they abandoned the original spirit of micro-credit—lifting people from poverty with dignity. The result? Destitution and despair.  \n\nHere we see a stark illustration of what happens when we lose touch with deeper meaning and use metrics as an end in themselves. When the aim is purely instrumental (repayment, interest, scale), any genuine sense of relationship is sacrificed.\n\nYet there is another way. We have an under-utilized “faculty” of perceiving quality, beauty, and goodness—what some call intuition or a “sense of rightness.” It’s deeper than mere emotions and can shine through the noise when we slow down and trust it.\n\n#### Part III: The Garden and the Craft—Realigning Our View of Work\n\n**From Factory to Garden:**  \n- A factory mindset tries to control growth, forcing speed and scale.  \n- A gardener mindset cultivates the soil, trusting natural emergence, and only intervenes where needed to nourish the process.\n\n**From Product to Craft:**  \n- A craftsperson relates intimately to materials, measuring and sensing in one fluid process.  \n- Quality arises from attention, presence, and skill. “Smooth is fast” because we waste less energy on rework or misalignment.\n\n**Examples of Beauty in Practice**  \n- **Buurtzorg (Netherlands):** Community nurses who rely on relationship, minimal bureaucracy, and trust. Proved relational care outperforms heavy metrics.  \n- **Sounds True:** Publishing wisdom over market demands, forging deep authenticity with authors and readers alike.  \n- **Patagonia:** Environmental activism integrated into every layer of the brand, guided by a sense of rightness rather than short-term profit.  \n\nIn each example, real impact emerged because decision-makers trusted a deeper sense of goodness—not just the bottom line or an investor’s checklist.\n\n#### Part IV: From Philosophy to Action—Where Our Two Worlds Meet\n\nSo, what does this look like in practice? How do we shift from a single-minded “metrics eye” to seeing with both eyes?\n\n**1. Trust in Human-Centered Relationships**  \nInstead of funneling participants onto a software platform purely for data collection, we invite them into genuine connections. Our method:\n\n- **Pilot Coaching Cohorts**: Offer small-group or one-on-one mentorship sessions that focus on helping entrepreneurs tap into their purpose.  \n- **Transparent Value Exchange**: If we charge for these services, it’s because they provide real value people want, not because we must meet a donor’s data quota.\n\n**2. Team Alignment & Internal Culture**  \n- **Weekly Presence Circles**: Create space for the internal team to reflect on what feels rushed vs. what feels alive and meaningful.  \n- **The Craft/Gardening Metaphor**: Instead of discarding metrics, show how they can be used like a gardener checking soil moisture—supporting, not dictating.  \n\n**3. Rethinking Assessment & Measurement**  \n- **Meaning Before Metrics**: We begin by listening to participants’ stories, clarifying their visions and challenges. Once genuine insights emerge, we can use light-touch metrics to reflect on progress.  \n- **Quality Recognition**: Have the courage to name what feels off or out-of-alignment—like the tension in the chest or that sense of “this isn’t right.” This is real data, even if it’s not quantitative.  \n\n**4. Financial Sustainability Without Instrumentalizing**  \n- **Aligned Funding Relationships**: Seek funders who value depth over superficial metrics, partners willing to look at narrative evidence and relational progress.  \n- **Mixed Models**: Some services might be free or subsidized (prototyping and learning), while established, high-value programs can be offered at fair prices.  \n\n#### Part V: Bridging Worldviews—Examples of Organizations That Made the Leap\n\n- **Mondragón:** A massive worker cooperative in Spain, grounded in human dignity over profit alone. They measure profitability, but only after ensuring stable employment, skill development, and community well-being.  \n- **Barry-Wehmiller:** A manufacturing company that places human dignity at the center. They measure production, of course, but do so in a context of “Truly Human Leadership,” yielding powerful loyalty and innovation.  \n- **Basecamp:** Tech sector example. Chooses calm and quality over hustle culture, intentionally limiting growth to preserve a humane pace.  \n\nEach of these organizations continues to thrive because they decided, at crucial moments, to honor relationships and meaning—metrics became tools, not masters.\n\n#### Part VI: The Worldview Transformation—Accessing Our Inner Faculty\n\nAt the heart of all these shifts is a simple but profound truth: *we have a reliable sense of beauty, goodness, and truth.* Call it intuition, call it moral imagination; it’s the part of us that sees the wholeness in another person or the potential in a community. The confusion arises when we lump this deeper perception in with impulsive emotions or fleeting whims. Real intuition goes deeper than momentary feelings—it resonates as a stable sense of alignment, of “this feels right.”\n\nWhen we fail to acknowledge this faculty, we slip into cynicism about human nature. We design systems of control and measurement. We inadvertently invite more of the very behavior we fear. But once we trust that people are capable of genuine care, creativity, and wisdom, we start to see transformations:\n\n- **Micro-lending with Compassion:** Lenders who see borrowers as neighbors and allies, not data points, create thriving local ecosystems.  \n- **Manufacturing with Craft:** Factories that treat workers as artisans, giving them real responsibility and trust, see higher quality with fewer defects.  \n- **Leadership as Transmission:** When founders embody presence and authenticity, they become the next masters who can apprentice others in this more humane way of operating.\n\n#### Part VII: Conclusion—A Call to Come Alive\n\nUltimately, our goal isn’t just to do more good but to *live* differently, to sense the beauty that’s already present in people, communities, and the world around us. When we align metrics with meaning, we move from “instrumental social impact” (where we might fix one problem but reinforce deeper systemic harms) to “transformative social impact” (where solutions emerge from a whole new worldview).\n\n**Next Steps for Bloom (and Allies):**\n\n1. **Pilot “Come Alive” Coaching**: Start small, test our craft-based approach, document real stories rather than forcing data.  \n2. **Reboot Team Culture**: Make space for weekly presence practices, revisit language that might slip into “participants as metrics.”  \n3. **Cultivate Aligned Partnerships**: Proactively find funders who resonate with depth. Share examples like Buurtzorg or Mondragón to demonstrate the viability of a meaning-centered path.  \n4. **Measure with Both Eyes**: Keep some metrics as reflection tools, but trust direct perception of quality. Let your “aha” moments in Dubai be your guiding star.  \n\nWhen we follow this path, we find that financial sustainability aligns naturally with beauty, because those who come alive in their work create higher-quality products and services that truly serve their communities. **How we do anything is how we do everything**—and when we do it with presence, craftsmanship, and genuine care, the broader world shifts, too.\n\n> *“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”*  \n> —Often attributed to Howard Thurman\n\nMay we trust this deeper faculty—our reliable sense of goodness, beauty, and truth—to guide our social impact journey from mere metrics to real meaning.\n\n---\n\n### End Note\n\nBy weaving the philosophical core from the first essay with the practical roadmap from the second, we recognize both the necessity of new worldviews (garden vs. factory, craft vs. mass production) *and* the real, on-the-ground steps (cohort pilots, presence circles, aligned funding) that turn these insights into lasting change. When we tap into this deeper sense of rightness, we do more than measure impact; we *embody* it—transforming not just our programs, but the worldview that underlies them.",

      "content": "You didn't weave in shinola or arlan's boat, where are all the stories and quots? \nalso let's continue what information from this conversation can we pull - identify themes, stories, arguments and list them and then weave them in: The idea that \"how you do anything is how you do everything\" is deeply resonant with what you're saying: it underscores the fact that our approach—our mindset, values, and assumptions—shapes not only our actions but their consequences. If our worldview remains rooted in extraction, control, and domination, simply applying a \"social enterprise\" veneer doesn’t change the deeper dynamics.\n\nHere are examples and stories—both literal and metaphorical—that illustrate how adopting corporate \"best practices\" without addressing underlying mindsets can backfire or undermine the mission of social enterprises or NGOs.\n\nReal-World Examples of NGOs and Social Enterprises Adopting Corporate Practices with Harmful Outcomes\n1. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)\nWhat Happened: Microfinance started as a way to provide small loans to marginalized communities, especially women, to foster entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty. However, as microfinance grew, many institutions began adopting corporate practices such as profit-maximizing goals, aggressive repayment schedules, and loan quotas. This led to exploitative practices like high-interest rates, coercion, and even borrower suicides in some countries (e.g., India).\nKey Lesson: By adopting a corporate mindset focused on financial metrics over the well-being of borrowers, MFIs often undermined the very communities they were meant to uplift.\n2. Charity: Profit-Driven \"Efficiency\" in Disaster Relief\nWhat Happened: In the aftermath of disasters (like Haiti's 2010 earthquake), major NGOs adopted corporate metrics like ROI, donor satisfaction, and visible project completion as priorities. This led to rushed housing projects and poorly planned infrastructure that failed to meet long-term needs or respect local input. Billions of dollars in funding were spent inefficiently, with a focus on pleasing donors rather than building resilient communities.\nKey Lesson: A corporate efficiency mindset that prioritizes measurable outputs over holistic, community-driven outcomes can lead to waste and harm.\n3. Fair Trade's \"Certification Industrial Complex\"\nWhat Happened: The Fair Trade movement started as a way to ensure small farmers received a fair price for their products. Over time, as certification became a corporate tool, the focus shifted to scaling and meeting the demands of large companies. This led to small-scale farmers being excluded from certification schemes due to high costs, and large plantations dominating \"Fair Trade\" markets while still exploiting workers.\nKey Lesson: Adopting a corporate growth mindset can distort the original intention of movements meant to prioritize equity and justice.\n4. Nonprofit \"Professionalization\" and Burnout\nWhat Happened: Many nonprofits have adopted corporate-style hierarchies, productivity measures, and performance-based evaluations to attract funders or improve efficiency. However, this has led to high turnover, employee burnout, and mission drift, as workers feel dehumanized and alienated in organizations meant to be centered on care and social good.\nExample: NGOs like Oxfam and Save the Children have faced scandals where internal cultures mirrored exploitative corporate environments—fostering toxicity, harassment, and ignoring staff well-being.\nKey Lesson: Professionalizing nonprofits by mimicking corporate cultures often ignores the emotional and relational labor required to achieve social missions.\n5. Education Startups and \"Datafication\"\nWhat Happened: EdTech companies and educational NGOs often adopted corporate-style metrics to measure success (e.g., test scores, student performance data). In doing so, they shifted focus from holistic education to data collection and analytics, reducing students to numbers. Programs that aimed to empower students became tools to reinforce standardization and control.\nExample: Bridge International Academies (an NGO-backed for-profit education model) has been criticized for scripted lessons that disempower teachers and rigid metrics that ignore local needs.\nKey Lesson: A corporate mindset of standardization and efficiency clashes with the nuanced, relational work of education.\nMetaphors for Why This Happens\n\"Wearing a New Mask on the Same Face\"\n\nSocial enterprises often adopt the appearance of change (ethical branding, \"impact metrics\") but don’t address the deeper worldview of competition, hierarchy, and control that governs their operations.\n\"Pouring Clean Water into a Dirty Cup\"\n\nA clean and noble idea (e.g., empowering communities) can be tainted when poured into systems designed for extraction and domination. Unless we change the container (our underlying mindset and structures), the result will always be compromised.\n\"Trying to Grow Organic Food in Polluted Soil\"\n\nSocial enterprises may start with good intentions, but if they operate within \"polluted soil\" (systems that reward exploitation and competition), they inherit the toxicity of their environment and cannot thrive.\n\"Teaching Wolves to Herd Sheep\"\n\nTaking corporate best practices (rooted in competitive and extractive principles) and applying them to social enterprises is like teaching wolves to herd sheep: the nature of the system inherently conflicts with the goal.\n\"Upgrading the Chains of a Prison\"\n\nMaking systems more \"efficient\" or \"ethical\" without questioning their fundamental purpose is like replacing the chains in a prison with silk ropes—it might feel better, but it’s still a prison.\nWhy \"Doing Things Differently\" Matters\nThe core insight here is that we cannot use the same worldview that created the problem to solve it. Social enterprises need to:\n\nShift from efficiency to relationship: Efficiency focuses on outputs, while relationships build trust and lasting change.\nReplace competition with cooperation: Moving away from zero-sum thinking to models that value shared growth.\nValue process as much as outcome: Focusing not just on what is done, but how it is done.\nRedefine success: Moving from financial or numerical metrics to metrics of well-being, equity, and ecological balance.\nWould you like help refining a metaphor or crafting a narrative to convey this to social enterprises? Perhaps a story or a parable that illustrates the deeper need for mindset shifts?\n\n16:31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nyeah, can you also get me quotes and turns of phrase from different cultures that say something like this. maybe something that's actually really simple and clear too so i can share it and people can understand \n16:32\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a collection of metaphors, proverbs, and quotes from various cultures that express the idea that how we do something shapes the results we get, along with their cultural roots.

I can also help you adapt them into a cohesive message for presentations or conversations!\n\n16:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you give me more examples of \"doing good gone wrong - because of neoliberal mindsets of extraction disconnection acceleration, etc\"\n16:39\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere are more examples of well-intentioned \"doing good\" efforts that went wrong due to the underlying neoliberal mindset of extraction, disconnection, and acceleration. These illustrate how adopting corporate logic, without questioning its values, often leads to unintended harm:\n\n1. Social Impact Startups in Africa (e.g., One Laptop Per Child)\nWhat Happened: The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program aimed to provide affordable laptops to children in developing countries, believing access to technology would bridge the education gap. However, the program focused on distributing hardware without addressing the local context—schools lacked infrastructure, teachers weren’t trained, and there was no plan to integrate laptops into the curriculum. Many laptops were abandoned or misused.\nThe Problem: The initiative adopted a \"tech-savior\" mindset, focusing on acceleration and scalability without understanding the local systems or fostering connection with communities.\nLesson: Doing good requires slowing down to build relationships and understand real needs, not just imposing top-down solutions.\n2. Carbon Offsetting Programs\nWhat Happened: Many companies and NGOs offer carbon offset programs to reduce the environmental impact of industries. These often involve planting trees or funding renewable energy projects. However, these programs are frequently used to justify continued emissions (greenwashing), and many tree-planting projects fail due to poor planning or lack of follow-up, leading to degraded ecosystems.\nThe Problem: The neoliberal logic of \"offsetting\" turns sustainability into a transactional system rather than addressing root causes of overconsumption and industrial emissions.\nLesson: Genuine sustainability cannot be achieved through compensatory mechanisms alone; it requires systemic change.\n3. \"Green Revolution\" in Agriculture\nWhat Happened: The Green Revolution in the mid-20th century introduced high-yield crops, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to combat global hunger. While it increased food production, it also led to soil degradation, water scarcity, and dependency on chemical inputs. Small farmers were often driven into debt by the costs of seeds and chemicals, deepening inequality.\nThe Problem: The logic of extraction and acceleration—focusing on maximizing output without considering long-term ecological or social impacts—undermined the goals of sustainability and equity.\nLesson: Approaches that prioritize short-term efficiency over holistic well-being often create more harm than good.\n4. Fast Fashion and \"Conscious\" Collections\nWhat Happened: Companies like H&M introduced \"conscious\" collections to promote sustainability in the fashion industry. However, these collections make up a tiny fraction of their output, while the overall business model remains based on overproduction, low wages, and disposable clothing. The marketing of these collections gives consumers a false sense of doing good while perpetuating exploitative practices.\nThe Problem: Neoliberal capitalism’s drive for growth and speed clashes with the slower, more connected processes required for genuine sustainability.\nLesson: Without addressing the root problem—overproduction and exploitation—efforts to \"do good\" become performative.\n5. Volunteer Tourism (\"Voluntourism\")\nWhat Happened: Volunteer tourism offers travelers the chance to help disadvantaged communities while vacationing. However, many programs focus on providing feel-good experiences for volunteers rather than creating sustainable change. For instance, volunteers might build schools that later remain empty because no teachers are hired or trained.\nThe Problem: The disconnection between volunteers and the communities they serve—paired with an extractive, profit-driven tourism model—turns \"helping\" into a commodity that benefits volunteers more than locals.\nLesson: True change requires deep, sustained relationships and co-created solutions, not transactional acts of \"help.\"\n6. NGOs Perpetuating Dependency\nWhat Happened: Many humanitarian aid organizations unintentionally foster long-term dependency by providing relief without investing in community-driven solutions. For example, constant food aid in some regions has disrupted local agricultural markets, making it harder for farmers to compete.\nThe Problem: A mindset of disconnection and top-down \"rescue\" treats communities as passive recipients rather than active participants, undermining self-sufficiency.\nLesson: Social enterprises and NGOs must shift from paternalism to partnership, fostering empowerment rather than dependency.\n7. Plastic Recycling Initiatives\nWhat Happened: Global plastic recycling campaigns have emphasized individual responsibility for waste while failing to address the systemic problem of overproduction by corporations. Studies show that only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, yet the focus remains on consumers to \"do their part.\"\nThe Problem: The neoliberal mindset offloads responsibility onto individuals, disconnecting systemic accountability (corporations) from the problem of plastic pollution.\nLesson: Environmental initiatives must challenge corporate production patterns rather than placing the burden on consumers.\n8. Corporate \"Diversity and Inclusion\" Programs\nWhat Happened: Many companies implement diversity and inclusion programs to address workplace inequities. However, these programs are often surface-level, focusing on optics rather than structural change. For example, hiring more diverse employees without addressing toxic workplace cultures leads to high turnover among underrepresented groups.\nThe Problem: The mindset of acceleration and optics treats diversity as a checkbox rather than a systemic transformation.\nLesson: Equity requires slow, deliberate shifts in culture and power, not quick-fix programs.\n9. The Privatization of Public Services\nWhat Happened: Under neoliberal reforms, public services like water, education, and healthcare have been privatized in many countries, often with promises of increased efficiency. In reality, privatization has often led to reduced access, higher costs, and worsening inequality, especially in vulnerable communities.\nThe Problem: Applying corporate logic to essential services treats people as customers rather than citizens with rights, prioritizing profit over access and equity.\nLesson: Public goods cannot be treated as market commodities without undermining their purpose.\n10. Tech in the Classroom: Overuse of EdTech\nWhat Happened: Many schools adopted digital learning tools to \"modernize\" education, often driven by tech companies rather than educators. These tools frequently prioritized data collection and standardization over meaningful learning. Studies show that excessive screen use can harm students’ focus and engagement while deepening digital divides for low-income schools.\nThe Problem: The acceleration mindset prioritizes technological solutions over understanding human learning processes, resulting in harm to students.\nLesson: Technology should serve human needs, not dictate them.\nKey Patterns in \"Doing Good Gone Wrong\"\nAcross these examples, the underlying neoliberal mindsets lead to:\n\nDisconnection – Treating people and ecosystems as resources or beneficiaries rather than partners or equals.\nExtraction – Prioritizing measurable outputs (profits, metrics, growth) over relational or long-term well-being.\nAcceleration – Seeking quick fixes or scalable models instead of slower, context-specific, relational solutions.\nWould you like to explore any of these stories in greater detail, or craft a narrative or metaphor to help explain this to your audience?\n\n16:47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\n\"The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\" \"What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.\"\n\nI want as m any quotes about this topic and tangential topics as you can find, these are great and more philosophy underneath it about ontology and comology and self perception and how societies with differences have different results, do we have examples from the world about that?\n16:48\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nCertainly, here are additional quotes and philosophical insights that delve into the relationship between means and ends, as well as perspectives on ontology, cosmology, and self-perception:\n\nMeans and Ends\nJohn Dewey: \"The end is the means by which you achieve it. Today's step is tomorrow's life.\" \nA-Z QUOTES\n\nAldous Huxley: \"Great is truth, but still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth.\" \nGOODREADS\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche: \"In art the end does not sanctify the means: but sacred means employed here can sanctify the end.\" \nA-Z QUOTES\n\nOntology and Self-Perception\nWillard Van Orman Quine: \"Our acceptance of an ontology is, I think, similar in principle to our acceptance of a scientific theory... we adopt... the simplest conceptual scheme into which the disordered fragments of raw experience can be fitted and arranged.\" \nA-Z QUOTES\n\nImmanuel Kant: \"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.\" \nDAILY PHILOSOPHY\n\nCosmology and Worldview\nJohn Polkinghorne: \"On scientific grounds this big bang assumption is much less the palatable of the two. For it is an irrational process that cannot be described in scientific terms... On philosophical grounds too I cannot see any good reason for preferring the big bang idea.\" \nA-Z QUOTES\nPhilosophical Perspectives on Self and Society\nSocrates: \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\"\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche: \"To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.\" \nHAPPIER HUMAN\n\nKurt Vonnegut: \"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.\" \nHIGHEXISTENCE\n\nCultural Perspectives on Self-Perception and Society\nPlatonism vs. Aristotelianism: Plato emphasized unchanging ideals beyond the physical realm, suggesting a static view of identity. In contrast, Aristotle focused on change and development, viewing the self as a dynamic work in progress. \nTHE ATLANTIC\nThese perspectives highlight how different ontological and cosmological views influence self-perception and societal outcomes. Societies emphasizing static identities may experience rigidity, while those embracing change and development may foster adaptability and growth.\n\nIf you would like to explore any of these concepts further or need more specific examples, feel free to ask!\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\n16:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nhere are some of mythoughts, can you seee what i'm getting at, can you align some quotes from my talk with quotes from others and tell me what is a clear way to talk about what i'm sharing here: \"\"\"\n \n00:00:00 SPK_1\nI've only seen.\n\n00:00:01 SPK_2\nRemind me in France. Right, but what city before? Yeah, that's true. Have you been. You were traveling, right, last week.\n\n00:00:13 SPK_1\nWhere did I go? I went to Spain at some point and.\n\n00:00:19 SPK_2\nYeah, that's true.\n\n00:00:20 SPK_1\nBeen back for some time. But also.\n\n00:00:22 SPK_2\nHave you been. You were traveling, right, last week.\n\n00:00:24 SPK_1\nDo some deep work on some, some things that I've been thinking about. And it's really interesting because it's related a little bit to the conversation that we're having. I realized that I didn't have such a good grasp of what's missing in this whole change maker scene. Social impact, social entrepreneurship. And so I decided that I would kind of like really dig in deep to, to, to see like initially, first, just within myself, like, what truth can I unearth here? Because I've been feeling really weird about like, metrics and measures and I. And it sounds weird, right? But like, I have a feeling like the same thing that causes people's lives to just be numbers and other people's lives to be full stories is related to this metrics thing. It's related to this mechanized, quantified way of the world where they're like, oh, it's just 18,000 just. Right. And this, this like, idea of the not realizing, like the immensity of what a human is because of not acknowledging. And I know it's going to sound really abstract, okay. So I need to find a better way of talking about this. But the fact that we, most people, I think, can agree that things have quality and quantity and we're like completely disconnected from the quality side of things. And, you know, people, you know, maybe even if you first try to like, push on this, they might say, yeah, so like, love. Yeah. There's biological and evolutionary pressures that cause. And there's like this reductionist kind of worldview because nobody can just say no. Like, I have another type of perception that's just as real and valid and it's internal and it's just as real and valid to do science on this and to find what is meaningful for me and to be able to be more clear about articulating that so we can, we can actually connect with this way of seeing. Right? And that we have a whole, like, perceptive apparatus that is being ignored, that is the source of what makes things meaningful, not countable. And I know it sounds. Probably sounds like super, super abstract. And so I'm trying to come up with a way of not being so. Well, not being so, like, uneasy, like, I don't know what's going on like, why is this so weird? And then, of course, there's a history. There's a history of like, Descartian dualism and Galileo trying to create a way of describing the world with mathematics. Even Galileo, though, when he, when he did that, he did say, like, and there's quality, of course, but for everything else, you know, all you need is like, size, shape and position, velocity, you know, but, but people just decided for pressures and materialism leading to capitalism leading to. So I really see it, like, having a long historic precedence. And it's, it's related to kind of some of the tensions that I see in, in the space that we're working on where, like, there's, I have a feeling, like we can, we can reach all the SDGs and hate our lives, you know, which is, which just sounds weird. But, yeah, this is what I, what I took the last week to do. And I've been trying to turn, like, come up with the next stage of what a social impact program does that includes this realization in a way that's acceptable and digestible and not super abstract. And I'm calling, I'm calling it coming Alive. And the idea of making micro experiments to reconnect with our sense of meaning and quality that brings us to life and enthusiasm and agency. And it's sort of trying to operationalize that quote. It's like, don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come to life and go do that? Because the world needs people that have come alive. And I'm trying to also determine, like, the veracity of that. Like, why is that feel true? Why does it feel true and sound true and come up with kind of a, A theory of, you know, a way of being, a theory of being that still we can measure. But the idea that I'm starting to realize is measurement should happen the end of the day, the beginning of the day. We should ask, what would make today feel complete? How can I come to life today? And then it changes everything about, like, how do we, how do we organize businesses? Like, people have different things that make them come to life and for different reasons and through different contexts, can we create the right context? What if we started measuring instead of, like measures? We're looking into meaningful moments per month per employee. Right? And we're optimizing for that. Like, can you imagine? It's just. Anyway, so I'm, I'm really, just really shifting my thinking and I'm hoping that Bloom, the rest of the team will be able to comprehend what I'm saying and why it's so foundational in terms of, you know, this whole like especially just the social impact space, you know. But I also think it's is good for everyone in our lives to reconnect with what I think makes us human. But if people are so shy to talk about it because it reeks of religion and spirituality, Woo woo stuff. And, and so I've actually started doing research and it turns out that there is a lot of people doing research on, on this idea of gestalt. Like before awareness, before conscious awareness, people have qualitative experience and they're, they're trying to figure out how can we actually measure that with our, with our scientific apparatus, which kind of implies a lot of weird stuff about perception, right? Like we're not a machine, like seeing and then analyzing and then interpreting and then thinking and then speaking. There's something else that we have that is super foundational that can. I think once people realize that it's, it's possible to also look into it scientifically, I think it's going to hopefully just open some doors to. My idea is just to like make it a series of micro experiments. Like what if you trusted this perception of meaning, you know, or your heart or whatever you want to call it and just like keep track, like, does it lead to a better life? Does it have better outcomes? In my work, like just, you know, think about it and then hopefully at some point people are like, wow, yeah, this is actually better. That's my hope. Sorry, I went off on a little bit of rants, but I've been really.\n\n00:07:13 SPK_2\nNo, no, like a whole interesting and, and super relevant I think, because I do think, yeah, it connects a lot to what we're also trying to explore. And this idea of, yeah, making meaning, creating shared meaning, but based on what, you know, what values, what are the drivers of this shared meaning and what is the vision for a more as we're framing it, kind of resilient community that values humanity rather than kind of productivity. And actually I have these conversations, I have this conversation all the time with my husband. My husband is an economist, does like macroeconomic analysis, blah, blah, blah. And he's always saying, oh, you got, you lefties. You always see the world as like this horrid place. But when you look at the data, you know, people are so much better off than they've ever been in the history of mankind, right? You look at the indicators in terms of, you know, GDP per capita, in terms of level of education, life expectancy, and that is all true, but also true that people Are not. Okay.\n\n00:08:30 SPK_1\nCombine that with the rate of change of teenage suicide and the sudden appearance, the miraculous, like, insane thing of pr. Preteen suicides. Okay, Just like, put those together and think about it. Economist.\n\n00:08:45 SPK_2\nExactly. And just this feeling that people just feel really alienated from. From the community. Like, there's lack of the sense of community from the. The States. And again, it doesn't matter whether the data tells them that they're better off than people were before them. It's not, you know, it. It does not fulfill.\n\n00:09:10 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n00:09:10 SPK_2\nThat.\n\n00:09:11 SPK_1\nYou know, I think there's a. There's like, this interesting perceptual shift that is happening because we've been told since the 50s that heaven is tomorrow. And we're getting there through science, through technology. Heaven is tomorrow. Heaven is tomorrow. And as long as we were making some kind of progress and like, heaven felt like it was coming, and it's related to the. The dopaminergic system. So dopamine isn't a reward drug. It's an anticipation of reward. And so as long as, like, we have these breadcrumbs of heaven is tomorrow, people were willing to play the game, right. I think up until, like, the millennial age, like, this promise kind of held true. It's not so much holding true, and it's. And this is the reason why it's breaking down, I think. Or there's more frustration. There's more quiet quitting. There's more like, hell, no, I won't go. And the thing is, the replacement for that is a life of continual growth. And, you know, I try not to use words like even heart or soul when I'm speaking about these things. But, you know, I think this idea of exploring a way of being that you have this sense of pride in at the end of the day. And that way of being can constantly evolve as your context changes where you are, like, what is demanded of me. That is beautiful in this context, right? And. And every day things change. And so this idea of heaven is tomorrow is sort of heaven. You. You, you are heavenifying. And tomorrow can be better within your own locus of control, right? And if you do that, and if we encourage others to do that by, by setting examples, right? Like, there's an. There's a reason why everyone has heard of Martin Luther King and Gandhi and Mother Teresa and all these, all these people, because they sort of exemplify a way of being that we, we look up to, that is expansive, that actually creates this sense of we can be better, right? And there. Gives us this hope. But the idea I'd like to be able to share is you can be better and every day we can make that progress. And so I'm turning it into a coaching program. I'm just calling it Come Alive. And the way I'm operationalizing it is we look at our to do lists and there's a bunch of have to dos which are often related to maintaining the status quo, the system, the perception that other people have. Those are called like instrumental, right? It's like I do this so that I can party on the weekends or I do this so that my boss doesn't judge me. So that. And there's a bunch of have to's. You can call them instrumental. And then there's some things that if we're lucky, we have to do because we want to do. It's like the want to's. And then this is the idea of being able to explain or understand our values better is by going through this prioritization process. This is where it connects to the whole social impact change makers. Because in training, you know, the whole idea of like being able to prioritize, you make a matrix or like was Eisenhower matrix or something. Right. But the question I think could be really interesting is what are the tensions that appear when you look at your to do list and then analyze the emotions? Because emotions in a framework that I'm building off of from one of my friends, Joe Edelman, are examples of ways of being or these want tos or what he calls constitutive attentional policies. Like ways that are ends in and of themselves. You can see how they're being blocked. So an emotion is pointing at ways of being or things that you value that are being blocked. Uh, and if this is clear, there's a way of kind of reconfiguring things or looking at things differently or designing them differently, asking yourself either what ways of being in my past might make more sense here that would be able to help address this block or what, what do role models that I admire, like what ways of being do they have that might be able to show how to. How, how they might address this challenge? Or the third one is, it's called creative grappling, is just looking at it, for instance, being with my baby or hyper focusing on this like thesis that I'm trying to develop about quality and ways of being. Right. And I actually was using my framework to try to understand like what is a way of. That I can actually find a higher order way of being that manages both. And so it could be as simple as like going for a walk with my baby while talking to myself, basically. Anyway, this is, this is the framework I'm developing. But the nice thing is the only thing we're doing is looking at a to do list, trying to prioritize and sensing our. How we feel about that. Because priorities, people don't really realize. What it means is you have to know what matters to you, which is hard. And it means you have to know yourself. You have to know what matters. It's actually a big deal. So the whole framework, the whole beginning, the whole thing can just be, okay, let's look at our to do lists. And they say, show me your to do list and I'll tell you who you are. And I think this kind of ratio between, like instrumental versus constitutive or, you know, have to's or one twos, let's just call it that is. Is like a really good way about thinking about the good life for oneself. But then you're talking about, how do we do this with each other and what does that mean? And I think that just being more articulate, you know, where does it go? Carl Jung, he goes, until you make the unconscious, conscious patterns will run your life and you'll call it fate. And so I think there's a lot of have to's that no one's actually looking at. Like, I just talked. I was doing some coaching as trial runs with some friends, and my friend yesterday was telling me, like, I have to call my mom, but I'm tired at night. And I just, like, we just, like, I just literally held up the mirror and he was like, wait a second. But I love my mom, and I have energy in the morning, and I've always wanted to wake up earlier. Why don't I just wake up earlier and call my mom? And I'm like, I fixed his life. You know, like, not I, but like this mirror, this just. Just looking at these tensions and being more clear about, you know, who we are in our lives and how we're showing up now and how we want to show up. And the difference between these two things can, can kind of open these doors for people. And. And then once you have that clarity, I think you're talking about what are values that we can align on. I don't think we. I want to, like, use words like honesty or justice or social justice. Like, I think these, these aren't clear enough. And so I can share with you Joe's paper, but what he calls them are attentional policies. And essentially the way that I think of Them is we. We all have, like, these funny little shapes configured by our upbringing, our natural inclinations, our way of life, our family, all of our experiences. And, like, you can think of it as like, a vessel, and a situation will happen, and it will kind of reverberate the. The vessel, and you'll be able to see what your attention points at. If you've ever seen a movie that you found really moving and you, like, talk to everybody's like, I love this part. And you realize, like, different people love different parts for different reasons. Right? But so being able to be that explicit, like my configuration, my, like, funny shape meant that I resonated with. I don't know, like, the.\n\n00:16:56 SPK_2\nThe.\n\n00:16:56 SPK_1\nThe openness that the characters presented to each other when they were, like, dealing with a difficult moment or somebody else might say, like, I love being transported by, like, the music that just elevated me. Right. And these are more closely aligned with what I might. What. What Joe calls values. Like, the person that, like, values kind of aesthetics. Right. And that. That being transported. And you can. You can combine these clusters that are related to a moment and call it a source of meaning. And I think maybe shifting from this idea of, like, values and connecting on this idea of values which has still almost like a capitalist or, like, financial. Like, how much does this value? You know, like, this value versus, like, a source of meaning which we can align on and we can say, okay, well, I actually also really like that source of meaning. I didn't resonate with that part in the movie, but I understand. Yo, like, if I was in your configuration or your headspace, like, if I studied music enough to know the complexity of that guitar piece, I might really appreciate it too. Because the person can say, I really appreciate virtuosic complexity that results in a transcendent, like, piece that, like, moves people. Right? But I didn't know it was complicated, so I wasn't able to see what you saw. But when you describe what you saw and you tell me why it was meaningful in a clearer way, I'm like, hell, yeah. That's a cool piece. Maybe I should learn more about guitar. Okay, sorry. I've been. Like, when you. When you ask where I was for the last week, I've been thinking and reflecting in, like, monk mode almost 24 7. So I'm. I'm a little bit full of words. I need to get it out into the words. Sorry about that.\n\n00:18:38 SPK_2\nNo, I love it. And yeah, if you have stuff, like, stuff that you've mentioned that you could share with us just for you know, our own reading. I think it's. It's really interesting. I would love to read out more about it as well, because I do. Yeah, it really resonates in the sense. Obviously I haven't thought about it in as much detail as you have, but it's definitely something that I've been thinking about that we've been thinking about at Envy and that we want. We do want to explore further. And again, I do think that that's kind of how we had envisioned this fellowship and heard summit as well. We're talking about it in terms of more traditional terms as like, countering polarization, creating shared meaning. D. But the sense is really about kind of questioning, you know, the system and how we're operating and relating to each other and to our society right now and thinking about what are other ways that we can do it that feel more aligned with our main values or meaning, however we want to frame that. Yeah. And. And that are also better for, you know, for our communities and for the world, for nature, for, you know, the planet and so on.\n\n00:20:04 SPK_1\nYeah. So, yeah, I think a big part of the way I think about things is, you know, I've always was using things. So at some point I was like, open source technology to make the world better. And I was using like, you know, technology. And then I was like, oh, no, but it needs to be configured in a space in a way that's actually good. Right. And so I was thinking, okay, social enterprises that use technology for this change. Right. And then I was like, oh, no, but like, if people can't manage their teams, and so we need this, like, this management element and like, if people can't manage themselves and their emotions. And so then we added on this element of like, yeah, so personal and professional growth to be able to operationalize, social enterprises to be able to use technology to be able to make the world. And I was using personal growth. Right. And then I finally realized, like, why these, like, all these things. There was like, this progression and at some point I realized, like, we just need to stop using things and start, like, connecting more with. With a way of being. So even for myself, like, I want to be an author someday. I have this, like, kind of goal. I would. Something that I think would be meaningful for me to be able to hold a book, right. And feel like I shared something that mattered to me in a way that's digestible. Maybe it's making an impact in people's lives. It would be really inspiring. But what I think it would be, like, how I want to approach that is what ways of being lead to a book emerging from me, rather than thinking, how can I, like, get my word count in right? Which then I'm using myself for an end, rather than becoming the kind of thing that makes the things that I want to happen or that I would be inspired to see in my life possible. Right? And then you become more of a gardener. I think this is one of the other analogies I started using. It's like you garden yourself, like, you plant the right seeds, you. You kind of set the right context, and then you want the fruit. Like, everyone wants SDGs and wants depolarization and wants all of these things. And I think, did I ever tell you that story about, like, a cow that the farmer is trying to push into a barn, right? And he's like, pushing and pushing, and here's the masculine energy, big muscles, he's like, yellow. The cow get in the barn, it's late. And then the farmer's wife comes and then puts out her thumb, and the cow starts sucking her thumb and she walks, and the cow walks with her to the barn. And I feel like we are pushing into the SDGs or depolarization or like, oh, my God, the world is ending. We must act fast and act now and urgence, right? And yeah, there's. There's many reasons why that probably creates more problems than. Than solutions. Partially in my life, just like, very simply, when I'm in a rush, like, I break things, you know, I'm not able to attend to everything. It's just, just like even a small example. And so the, The. The difficult and hard thing to do is what is it? Times are urgent. We have to slow down. I think we have to, like, really slow down. And then the second thing I think we really need to do is in that place of slowness, realize that alienation where it comes from that long history, and just like slowly reconnect with that part of us that knows what to do, what. What beauty actually is, what truth actually is, and to allow that to enter into the world through us by removing these blocks and these tensions between want to's and have to's and then seeing if it's giving us the fruit that we want, actually want, right? Like, one of the most transformative things I think can be for the entire world is contentedness. Contentedness. Can you imagine if more people were content and they weren't buying fast fashion and they weren't using women or men or they weren't like, you know, angry about whatever, right? Like Just what does it take for you to be content? And I don't. It's often because of all of these want tos, all these things are externalized to see to, to others. Like I want to like have my own job and that person's taking my job and da da da. Like and there's this competitive nature versus anyway there's I think a lot of change and I don't think I want to think of this as like I want to change the world. But for me, I'm realizing especially for my work and the way that I see things, I've been feeling more and more of this like weird tension between funders and fundees and like impact and like it was really the seed of. It was when I saw how many women programs popped up the day after USAID was like, hey, like we want to fund female tech programs in Iraq. And suddenly there was like a million of them. And I felt like, sure, like people need jobs and stuff but doesn't authenticity matter? Like maybe some of them are authentic and they just needed the opportunity. That would be, that's wonderful. And we, I'm not saying we shouldn't have those programs but that like started getting me wondering like can we actually get good results with inauthentic means? And what is authenticity? And then kind of like backtracking all the way to. There's a difference between quantity and quality and we can actually access that quality to see what wants to emerge and, and it can become simpler. Like I used to have so many frameworks, right? Like there's the inner development goals and the. What is it the ecats and, and all of these things. And I think the, the, the, the less I want to do. Like I don't think we need so many frameworks to try to model where people are in the world and how they want to go. Because I sort of like foundationally believe that it's possible for people to learn and discover and access resources, but to be able to create kind of a context for that to happen and to help them do that for themselves through of like a very, very simple process. Because everything is talking to us. The wars. You know, for me it's, it's a one person network, distant. How is it possible that I don't perceive it in my gestalt or in that thing inside of me that knows, right? How is it possible that I don't know climate change when I'm coughing up like stuff right now, like the, you know, the forces at play, we are on one planet, they do show up. And so that's kind of the theory of like why is this gonna lead to right action? It's. It requires two stories to be built. The story of self and the story of world. And as long as people are doing that and also touching with this quality and asking why and what shall I do in response, I think there's a beautiful way to. Even if like the end result is it's far too late and we're not going to be able to address things at least the quality of break. You know that movie like 300 or something about those like braves. Yeah, we still love that story. Those people probably, you know, inshallah, they, they died happy. And so how can we die happy, you know, even if we know that this is the end. Right. And I think it's really about like tuning in to that, to this idea and realizing that success can be every step. When your question is what is the most meaningful and beautiful way I can show up with my story of self and the story of the world that I'm holding right now and then that will uncover more story and, and so on. So yeah, that's my, my flip of impact and we'll see. I just shared it with Dar on Munir yesterday and I'm worried they're gonna think I'm such a hippie, you know.\n\n00:27:26 SPK_2\nBut you know like we've. So we have these a lot of similar conversations actually and in our work as an organization we've. We moved a lot from where we first started which was more I guess unnecessarily that it was donor driven but it was all like kind of capacity building and yeah, so we're going to empower CSOs and we're going to give them these tools and, and because then they're going to go out into the world and do all these good things and then we're like okay, but wait, we're giving them all these tools. But then what they're doing is not necessarily what we would consider to be meaningful or impactful. You know, they're not inclusive of different communities. They're only promoting this particular sector of society or they're still competitive amongst each other and not really like creating again shared meaning for more systemic change and so on and so forth. And it was all like we had great numbers, you know, to show our donors in terms of number of people trained and then sub grants given and what they've done, what, you know, their targets looked beautiful but it felt meaningless to us. It didn't. We were not connecting to it. Anymore. It felt inauthentic. And we decided to like, okay, no, let's stop and let's only do the stuff that we actually care about and that we think is meaningful. And that meant that for like one year, half of the team was on furlough because we like basically gave up on our usual, you know, funding. But and we focused on just one or two projects that, that we thought, you know, this is, this is the stuff that we think is actually meaningful and this is the stuff that leads to transformative learning and actual change. And then we started rebuilding from that. And so all of our work now is focused on that. Precisely. And we've had, we've been lucky enough that some of our partners, the ones that have been with us for a long time, like understand that, but many others. And that's why we've kind of, we've just lost one of our donors that are like, you know, we love it, we understand it, but headquarters think you're a fucking bunch of hippies, you know, because, you know, it's, it's really hard. Again, we were talking about in terms of measuring impact, it's a lot less, it's way less quantitative and way more qualitative in a way that we can't really communicate it. Like, we know, we see it, the.\n\n00:30:05 SPK_1\nCharts aren't the same. Where are the charts?\n\n00:30:08 SPK_2\nExactly. So, yeah, it's a lot harder to sell.\n\n00:30:14 SPK_1\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, it is a really interesting and difficult place. I, I, I feel for you. And you know, it's, it's so, so interesting that people so often like ask for these charts that no one does anything with, but they just like the fact that they exist. Right. Because it's a way of sort of proving that you've done something. And the only way that the world can align on these days because of whatever the 30 years wars and all the religious issues and the fact that we can't actually talk about the qualitative. Like people poo poo these things all the time, right? Like it's like it's meaningless and we'll see. I'm not sure how this whole thing about money too, like, how did this like materialism and reductionist approaches that view humans as resources and the natural world as resources for the economy. Cruel of this kind of point system of money is the reason why like certain places have this resource that, you know, in the setup that we currently have, we need to eat and feel safe and to have a home and heating and you know, air filters for when the pollution that is caused by the economic system tries to creep in through the windows. And, and so, so we're trying to do things in that context where it's, it's actually coming from the. The other. It's not that like, these are. One is better than the other, but they're not, they're not balanced. There's one that's completely obliterated. And even it's embarrassing to, to point at like that. You have a faculty of direct observation of quality, of a moment, of a gestalt, like this whole. And that's where your sense of meaning comes from. And like, you can actually connect with that to realize it's a source of perception, to show you how you should actually live. That would be more meaningful and beautiful, but it would have to be put into balance and viewed alongside your quantified, you know, worldview. And it might mean that you might make some changes. And so it's so scary. It's like blocked, right? It's like, no. You know, and yeah, part of me doing all this thinking was like, man, we really should start a. Make a farm. And you know.\n\n00:32:41 SPK_2\nBut see, that's, that's how I don't like, that's the one thing that kind of pisses me off a little is that people that end up speaking like that, like, thinking this way, then they end up like, creating their own commune somewhere and kind of retreating from the world. And I think you need to stay engaged in the world if you're. I don't know. Yeah, I guess it's.\n\n00:33:01 SPK_1\nI think the gradient shift is not the. Like, it'll take a while for even people that begin the exploration to think the way that I do. And gradually within their organizations, as their to do lists move more from want tos, from have to's to want tos, the organization will change, right? Like, if more people within the organization do that, the way that it makes money will still be consistent. And like there's a way of gradually shifting, like, personally and organizationally and through different organizations that provide like, the foundations for. For life. And also like the way that I sometimes I like, I think a little bit, yeah, like, it can be a gradient. You know, it doesn't have to be this one size fits all thing. But I, I do think that, you know, especially the little parts of you that squeaks when you try to live in an authentic way and you're losing another funder or whatever. Like, we definitely have like this Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And one of the reasons we maintain social approval is because we think there's, like, a survival element, and we're afraid, right? If you really dig down into it. And so, like, we need to, like, throw it. Throw that part of us a bone somehow. I don't know, like, what. What it might be, but it could be, I don't know, like, a savings account or. Or a friend that, like, tells you, like, hey, listen, like, if anything ever goes really, we have a guest room. You're more than welcome. You can stay, like, three months. I used to do this thing called the care contract where I would tell friends that were at the edge of following their hearts doing something ridiculous that doesn't make financial sense. I would say, like, listen, like, go do that. Here's a care contract. You can come live with me. Like, I'm gonna be, you know, after you come crashing through the ceiling, I'm gonna be the bed that you can land on. Okay? You'll have a bed, and I'll feed you. That's it. Nothing else. But if that's okay, can you fly now? You know, and the idea of, like, what is that foundation? And it's gonna be different for different people, right? Like, some people might even have come from wealthy families. And that's not actually a part of the concern, but, like, image is a concern. How can we address the image part? And so, yeah, yeah, this idea of, like, giving. Giving the space for that, following your heart, in short, requires actually looking at why these tensions emerge and giving some grounding. Yeah, the farm thing was like a. Like a silly example, but, like, for me, I think, yeah, some. I think there's a way of. I call it, like, vicarious meaning. When you look at the jobs that you have to do potentially to make money, to survive within a system so you can sustain these things. If you can have deep intentionality and presence and reflection in the moment of choice for doing this, I think it can help turn a have to do into at least a kind of want to do right. It's like, I know why I'm doing right. Maybe there's three. There's the have to's, the want to's. I know why I'm doing right, and we want to move at least into the middle for more of our actions. Yeah.\n\n00:36:21 SPK_2\nSo we've done actually, a bit of. Sorry, go ahead.\n\n00:36:23 SPK_3\nNo, I was gonna say that about what you said regarding the whole farm situation and all that, actually. One of the podcasts from the Heart Summit that I heard from, I think it was the one that they did in Cal. It was this girl or lady talking about how she actually does use that as a. As a resource, the whole, like, going farming and creating, like a rural community and all of that. And she got a lot of messages from people asking her, like, how do you. How do you contribute to shifting this mindset amongst others, like, is there a retreat that I can join or is there a Facebook group? And she was like, yes. I mean, you can, but also start with your neighbor. Like, you can also do this starting, by the way, to your neighbor in your building in the city where you live. Like, you don't have to go to, you know, rural Thailand to do something like that. So I think that's very much ingrained in. In the. In the ethos of the. Of the hearth. And the other thing that. That you made me think about, Bilal, was I saw this exhibition. I don't remember if it was in Paris, but it was this French artist who. So it was in our contemporary art museum. And then the whole exhibition was about, like, project projectors that projected numbers in the walls, and they were just like random numbers, you know, so, like, you enter the thing and they were like numbers that. Because we are shaped in a way where we think that numbers are valuable in themselves and important in themselves, it felt like something like, oh, this is a very important thing. But the whole purpose of the exhibition was to say that we are. We have been, like, kind of like brainwashed to think that a number, because it's a number, it's valuable in itself. And these numbers didn't have any meaning, any sense. And so, yeah, it was. It was very interesting to see. It's like a critique to the scientification and like numberization, I don't know how to call it, but of. Of information and of knowledge. And so why. Why is it just because it's a number, it's important. Like, you know, so, yeah, I'm going to try to remember the artist.\n\n00:38:28 SPK_1\nThat's very interesting. It reminds me of. So I do some coding sometimes and. And I was getting, like, a framework that can make charts. And at some point I just remember, like, my feeling of, like, putting in this, like, framework plugin thing into my code and then seeing charts and then just feeling like, a sense of accomplishments and relief. Like, wow. Up and to the right.\n\n00:38:54 SPK_2\nWow.\n\n00:38:55 SPK_1\nA full pie chart. You know, Like, I was like, this makes no sense. This is like template data, right? But the fact that it was like my page with, like, some words about the things that I'm doing with some charts on it that were template data, I was like, wow, random. But it Feels good. It's very interesting. Yeah.\n\n00:39:19 SPK_2\nThat's so funny.\n\n00:39:20 SPK_1\nTry it one day. Try it. Like, here, take your journal. Okay. And then cut out like a pie chart from a newspaper or magazine and then tape it by your journal text. I swear, that page, you're gonna feel like, oh, yeah, January 22nd. That was a good day. Pie chart, something like that.\n\n00:39:41 SPK_2\nThat's so funny.\n\n00:39:45 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n00:39:47 SPK_2\nYeah. Anyways, Bilal, so what we wanted to talk.\n\n00:39:51 SPK_1\nOh, yeah, Abid, how did that go?\n\n00:39:57 SPK_2\nYeah, I mean. But honestly, like, I love this conversation and I think it's a. It's a. It's really helpful to us as well, right, Julie? Food for thought. And I think, again, as we were saying, connects really well to what we're thinking around the summit and. And I think helps us deepen the thought process as well. So I really appreciate you sharing with us. But so just to give you kind of a quick update on how. How things are going in general and. And specifically our meeting with Abdul Rahman, who's lovely. So we are still. So basically, I'm like, trying to reach out to everybody and anybody. I have a couple of, like, concept papers out, waiting for responses. Because I told you, right. I'm trying. If possible, I would love to do this through grants rather than corporate sponsorships because I think that would change really kind of the, you know, what we're able to do and the ethos. And like, I would rather not have, you know, branding all over the place. Like, I would prefer, if possible, for it to be kind of a. A corporate free space. But I. I mean, I don't know yet if that is feasible or not. But that is like my plan A, which has. Which I'm currently working towards. So have.\n\n00:41:21 SPK_1\nHave there been so far. Yeah. What's the. The progress report on?\n\n00:41:26 SPK_2\nLike, not great. Yeah. I mean, people really like the idea around it, but again, they're like, okay, but it needs to be, you know, we fund it. We fund programs, not events. Which is also one of the reasons why we built in the whole Fellowship.\n\n00:41:39 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n00:41:40 SPK_2\nComponent to it. And actually the fellowship component, I think would be easy. Would be relatively easy to find funding for. It's the event itself that is. Is a little more problematic.\n\n00:41:54 SPK_1\nYeah. Sort of interesting. Right. Like, it makes sense. Like, people fund programs because there's, like, numbers and metrics and all that, and they can say that they. And then like, an event is an experience. Right. And you could try to get some numbers, like, number of attendees and stuff like that, but it's not quite the same. And the people that want to be in events are people that want to be marketing something, sharing, you know, a logo.\n\n00:42:15 SPK_2\nExactly.\n\n00:42:16 SPK_1\nSo yeah, yeah.\n\n00:42:18 SPK_2\nSo that's the challenge that I'm facing right now. But I mean, I haven't given up. I'm still exploring. But I'm trying to also think outside of the box, outside of the people that we've, that we've already engaged in, our current partners and so on and trying to connect with other collaborators that we've had across the region and kind of, you know, hearing from them if they have any suggestions and so on and so forth. In terms of USBADI specifically, he loved the. I mean he was, he was really great. Like, he was really receptive. And I think if it was that we were optimizing. You just asked us questions about our work in general. In general, he. In terms of, in terms of them funding, it does seem like it might be difficult, but because he said basically their funding for 2025 has already been out. They do have like discretionary funding that is like about the descript, like extra, you know, money from the director or I don't know, whoever else that they can allocate to specific things that arise. But it's normally not a lot of money. You're saying probably like max 20k. 20k. It would have to be given to a Levant based organization. So, you know, for example, you guys are still registered in, in Lebanon, right?\n\n00:43:50 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n00:43:54 SPK_2\nBut again, he was saying, you know, it would make. Because I suggested, because he was like, you know, that's one of the issues. And then I suggested, you know what, maybe if we, if we partner with Bloom, you could just fund them and then, you know, they can do part of the work we can collaborate on together. Together and it might be related. And when I connected it back with it, I know you had mentioned this to the fellowship that you guys already have. He seemed really kind of excited about that. He was like, oh, wait, yeah, you know, actually that would make a lot of sense. It would be easier for us to just kind of expand our scope of work with Bloom rather than create kind of a whole separate thing. And he thought that that would be doable. So he told us in terms of next step that he was gonna go and speak to his, to his director, the team or whatever. I shared the concept note that I had and then that he was going to get back to me and I told him that I would bring you in to the next conversation to think about what that might actually look like.\n\n00:44:57 SPK_1\nYeah, that sounds great. And like we are just beginning to do the outreach for that program. It's. But we, we should, like, I think we just put up the website. It would be really interesting to move forward on it a little bit quicker, just so that.\n\n00:45:17 SPK_2\nQuicker. Yeah. Right.\n\n00:45:18 SPK_1\nEven as people are onboarding, they know what to expect. Right. Like, there's sort of like the acceleration program, but the idea of this kind of longer engagement and also I think it like sets the tone and the flavor of who will apply and maybe even like the kinds of people we're looking to onboard and accept onto the program. So I think that's an important element because right now I think it's a pretty open ended, you know, social impact acceleration project. Yeah.\n\n00:45:50 SPK_2\nCan you, can you actually share a little more about it? Like, because I know you shivered a little in our first meeting, but can you remind me, like, how many people are we talking about? Is it just 13 people in Lebanon or is it regional?\n\n00:46:03 SPK_1\n13 people? It's regional. It's between. Let me see if I can find the Bloom PM programs. I think we've updated that. Yeah, it's 13 people in the accelerator, 30 in the sprints, and 100 in the. In the boot camp. Like, not the boot camp. What do we call it? The. On the open house.\n\n00:46:31 SPK_2\nOh, okay. And so these are 13 people. Why are there 30 in the sprints? Because in the sprints you bring in people that they can collaborate with.\n\n00:46:39 SPK_1\nNo, it's a funnel. It's like we get 100 into the open house. We gauge their interest, we select from them 30 that go through the sprints, and we try to like, see who's participating, who's able to, you know, use technology in a way that we require for our virtual programs. And then we go from there. Who's contributing to each other, who's able to. Yeah, Anyway, so. And then we go into the acceleration. So that's, that's how we identify our, our participants.\n\n00:47:08 SPK_2\nOkay. And so you end with 13 by when? Like from when you start the program. When do you end with?\n\n00:47:15 SPK_1\nSo the open house runs for a month. The sprint is two weeks. So like we, the open house, you can think of it like a marketing period. We have speakers that come. It could be you. You could be talking about anything. And then kind of talking also about the fellowship. It could be others. Usually we look for people that relate to the themes of the program. People that would have a draw, especially because it is a way that we want people to come and learn about what's happening. And so we look for people that can do that. And like Relevant topics that are supportive for social enterprises. And then from there we say and apply. So that's the open house. Last a month. And then we take from that. We do our selection, our first pass, and we pick, I think 30, 30 or more. It's like. It's something like that, but like it's the shoulders part of the funnel before the final selection happens at the end of the sprint. So that whole process is about. I forget. I think we start for at least two, three weeks before the open house, just inviting people to events. And then the open house, of course, there's continual marketing and then, you know, things really get going with the sprint and we stop the marketing and we focus on the. The training and facilitation. So that's the process. I'm still looking for. Like, I thought the website was up, but I think I need to look at slack. But yeah, I can. I can share the slack with you. Axi 3. Oh, I think that's. Yeah. Okay, here we go. Found the fourth edition. Okay, so it's just bloom PM xe4. So that's. That's how we're describing. The project application is open on February 3rd. Join the open house, partner with us. It's a very specific amount of money because it was in British pounds converted. $3,830, I think it was. I forget exactly. Some. Some nice round British number.\n\n00:49:20 SPK_2\nOkay. And then so the open house, is it all. Okay.\n\n00:49:25 SPK_1\nYeah. So Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Syrian diaspora. That's the target.\n\n00:49:34 SPK_2\nGot it. Is it all. Sorry, the open house events, are they. Is it all online or hybrid or like, what do you do? Like, where do they have it? Or online.\n\n00:49:46 SPK_1\nIt's all. It's all online. It's really hard to work with people from all these countries and do things in person. Maybe at the end. This is why I thought of the fellowship. Like. Like everything is virtual, but at least you have the light at the end of the tunnel. The excitement of, like meeting in person. It's actually really sweet when you run a program. We've done this before with a pretty previous program where people, you know, were all over the world. Actually this was like, you know, Africa and Mina and they all got together, Dubai at the end of the program. And it was really beautiful. They had built a lot of connections and relationships that, yeah. Were able to.\n\n00:50:20 SPK_2\nI'm just thinking, like, if we were able. Yeah. Like in terms of a potential. If we were able in our fellowship with your fellowship, what that might look like. I'm just thinking about how we might be Able to incorporate GCC folks, like, you know, at what stage in the process? Folks, you know, at what stage in the process?\n\n00:50:42 SPK_1\nWe can ask Abed if we can expand the selection to GCC as well. If there's. If he's excited about the idea of this fellowship. Because the. Yeah, and, and we can actually just bring them together. But would. Is the. No, no, it's Middle east limited. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or would it be fine to have some Palestinian everybody?\n\n00:51:09 SPK_2\nThe idea would be for it to be like everybody.\n\n00:51:12 SPK_1\nOkay. Yeah, well, I don't know. Like, I think that would be the question. Like. Yeah, I think, you know, this, this region, the Levant in particular, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon is important for the, the. I think they're Syrians or something like the funders themselves. And so this might be why they are prioritizing this. And so we can ask. Although. Yeah, although two things. One is that amount of money might not mean much to people in the gcc and I'm not sure why.\n\n00:51:45 SPK_2\nBut also I think like the foundation would be interested. I don't know. Also I think Julie, what your thoughts are. Like it is a bit of a different. I mean it's a very different format. Right. In terms of what we're trying to do. It's more. Very different format. Right. Well, first of all, it's not necessarily connected to social entrepreneurship. Social. Like it could be change makers across any field. Like it could be. The idea is the, it's more of a. The learning and then the practicing. The idea is that it's more of a collecting data, practicing because we do like numbers after all. Testing different approaches.\n\n00:52:29 SPK_1\nThe right things is okay. Yeah, good.\n\n00:52:31 SPK_2\nSorry, I think there's a little bit of like I was saying, like a lag. Testing different approaches again, community building approaches, approaches that help create shared meaning etc. So having these people go and test these approaches etc and see what works, what doesn't work. Like what are some processes and see what works, what doesn't work. Some work. Like what are some processes.\n\n00:52:55 SPK_1\nYeah, I mean the themes here, if you look at them are very aligned with that. So like active citizenship, good governance, independent media I think is also one of the things that can possibly help with those bridges. System change, connecting different stakeholders, governments, nonprofits, businesses. So like it definitely thematically, I think.\n\n00:53:16 SPK_3\nYeah, that's what I was going to say. I was checking the models before you send the image on your website and I do think that there's ways to, to tie specifically with like systems change maybe to tie specifically with all the other ones. Active Citizenship. We would just have to. So, yeah, I think that the design of our. Our fellowship wasn't really like. It's. It's not because we specifically wanted our fellowship to do a fellowship the way we built it. It was more because we were hoping that Kaz would be the founder. But. But I do think that there's ways to tie the two things together because there is always related themes.\n\n00:53:59 SPK_2\nAnd basically the idea was also for, again, as we were mentioning, for the. I guess the. The format doesn't necessarily matter per se. It's more about getting these folks to also drive what is happening at the summit. Right. To also drive what is happening in that sense. Right.\n\n00:54:20 SPK_3\nYeah.\n\n00:54:21 SPK_1\nIs it possible to have some, like, for the. The ability to. To have this reach? Like, we know maybe we work with abids and we partially fund the fellowships that are going to be coming from that region. And then, you know, of course, you, like, find funds for others and you fund them from whomever is willing to fund this because they're very different things. Like, the fellowship that you're talking about doesn't have to be all 13 or all 30 or whatever. Right. Like, we can use this process of finding people that have these parallels, and maybe only five out of the 13 are related to the themes that matter for you. And it would be another application process. But we could say that, you know, we have seats for five and we're excited and to have it be funded by the ossuary foundation, pay their tickets or hotel. The fellowship costs for that. That part. And then the rest of. I don't know how many people you're thinking for the fellowship, like, from the broader GCC region.\n\n00:55:21 SPK_2\nYeah.\n\n00:55:21 SPK_1\nCan be done.\n\n00:55:22 SPK_2\nThat's a good idea.\n\n00:55:24 SPK_1\nFunding and sourcing mechanism.\n\n00:55:26 SPK_2\nThat's a good idea.\n\n00:55:27 SPK_3\nThat's a good idea.\n\n00:55:29 SPK_2\nOkay. Okay. In terms of next steps. In terms of next steps. So, as you see, everything is a little bit up in the air. See, everything is a little bit, I.\n\n00:55:45 SPK_1\nGuess, right now, because if we can somehow expand the program, it would make things a little easy because there is a tiny bit of trickiness here. If, you know, Osfari says 20K for adding the fellowship to the AXI program, and we do the application process on our criteria, and then we invite people to apply for the fellowship. And, you know, 20k would have been good for five people, but we only found four or something like that. Like, we would. There would be, like, an issue, like, what do we do with the funding? Right. What if none of them match? What if, for whatever reason, they all Apply and you're like, not quite really. You know, so this. This process of, like, getting the selection criteria and making sure that when people are applying, they. They know that maybe this is what it is. Like, every. We tell everyone when you apply, you have the opportunity to be selected for this other thing, and we involve you in the selection process to make sure that we have people that can be good candidates. And then you would pick from our 13. The. The. The five that you think are the most appropriate. That way we don't have this, like, numbers issue. So. So we just tell people, like, you know, we have 13 spots for the acceleration and we're gonna number for the fellowship, but that would require it to be more seamlessly integrated with the rest. Right. Like, telling people we want people that are working on these things, and that would require, I think, a little bit of shifting on our part and on, like, the way that we message and the. Yeah, the alignments around that. But I, I think it's like, it's close enough. And I'm not sure what. What, like, areas might not fit. Like sustainability maybe in particular.\n\n00:57:36 SPK_2\nI mean. I mean, sustainability actually as well, because we're talking about, you know, ecological belonging and that stuff.\n\n00:57:42 SPK_1\nOkay, well, maybe. Maybe it is aligned enough that we don't need to do much, which would be great for. For us and for me, because. Because then we don't have to, like, go back, get the team to be like, okay, let's. Let's find. If we can see enough of an alignment, then we can just do this process of say, okay, there's 13 seats for the accelerator. Here's the funnel. And there's also an additional bonus, like five seats for people to actually meet in person, blah, blah, blah. They'll be meeting with people from this fellowship that are also coming from the gcc. And then. But that would be another process. Right? Like, we. I guess you could say we're helping source and we'll, like, bring you in line with the selection and hopefully, you know, we would be able to kind of unlock the funds for that through the Osfari foundation and then the rest of the funds and then how to get the GCC selection and funds would be another question. But, yeah, that's how we can think. Yeah, that could be a way.\n\n00:58:34 SPK_2\nYeah. And just FYI, we do have a backup in terms of the actual event. So we have an organization, they're called Art Studio, that we've worked with, that we've collaborated with a lot in the past, that have a conference already, like, basically an ongoing Conference that is being supported by the National Council for Arts and Letter in Kuwait. And they basically offered to have us take over their conference next year. So basically we would have the venue and the catering, like basic cost cover. We would still need to basically figure out travel and so on. But that's our backup plan in case we don't, you know, get the funding to be able to do it the way that we had originally envisioned, which is not bad. So. So.\n\n00:59:24 SPK_1\nWhat if we did a pilgrimage where people came on foot for months in advance, camping and connecting with communities on the go, picking up stories, sharing theirs, building the bridges all along the way. Right. Don't get money for travel. Yeah.\n\n00:59:40 SPK_3\nAt least the fellows, I think Japan was. Was had that format. What One of the limits that the one that they did in Japan was actually a pilgrimage.\n\n00:59:52 SPK_1\nNo, they brought everyone walking. That's so cool.\n\n00:59:55 SPK_2\nYeah, yeah. But yeah. So in terms of next steps, I got an auto response the last time I spoke, quote, I wrote Abdul Rahman that said he was out of office, I think until like now. Ish. So I guess because I'm waiting to hear back. So the next step is basically waiting for him to reach out again after he's done his. Had his conversation with his team. If I don't hear back from him shortly, I will follow up, but I'll try to. Yeah. Activate this process as soon as possible. And in the meantime, like, I don't know if. So I guess you can just wait for that and then take it from there.\n\n01:00:37 SPK_1\nThere was another.\n\n01:00:38 SPK_2\nBut in general, I just wanted to.\n\n01:00:40 SPK_1\nYeah, I was looking into, but I did not find. I didn't want to spend too much time searching while on the call. But I was a part of this thing. I think I told you about it like the. On being projects, Krista Tippett, all that jazz. But. Oh yeah, yeah. But it didn't. I thought they would put their funders on the page, but they did not. But their funders were really interesting and I don't know how to find their funders. There's got to be a place. But yeah, so what I thought we could do is like look into their funders because they are funding very conversational, very different kind of things. And there's like. Have you heard of the Fetzer Institute funding? Okay, yeah. So what I, what I would like to do is figure out who these funders are. And I remember when I was at the conference, I met with some of the funders and that was actually one of the interesting things that they did is the funders were part of the participants and they were engaging and connecting and sharing. And it wasn't like we're funding and you're receiving. It was, they were like. We didn't really, I didn't really know who the funders were in the audience and I thought that maybe funders don't fund events unless maybe they're a part of it. That kind of changes the dynamic a little bit and it could be an interesting way of pitching things. But there was like this really interesting Baha'I organization that was funding this On Being summit on, On Being gathering and there was like the Fetzer Institute and there's like some of these other grant giving organizations that were there. And I thought it could be interesting just to see who funded On Being and if we can reach out to them. And then also just sharing the idea of. Rather than telling them that you're inviting them to fund an event, telling them, I don't know how to frame it in a way, but basically telling them that we want to invite you to be a part of the event and contribute your ideas, your thoughts and funding to help make it happen. You know, something like that, like this other reframe. Because this conversation is really important and we believe that, you know, you're, you bring more than just your money essentially that we need you to be a part of the conversation and I think you can also help make it happen. Something like that. Like, I'm not sure, you'd probably have your language.\n\n01:03:16 SPK_2\nYeah, no, absolutely. And I think that matches really well with what you were talking about last time, this idea of creating a space world. So, you know, people who are involved in the social change sector in the Middle east that are feeling a lot of discomfort, right, with donors, and especially international donors and feelings a lot of, a lot of, you know, cognitive dissonance and what theness about their policies and so on. It's kind of creating a space for these conversations with donors to happen.\n\n01:03:47 SPK_1\nYeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's really related and you know, it could be interesting just like the way of breaking into the conversation because a lot of donors are people too, right? And they may be feeling a little bit of this unease or detention or like what should we be doing now given what has happened? And you can call this event like an emergence that can sense into the field by bringing things into proximity and curating context for good conversation. And yeah, I think it could be like a way of inviting like, and actually making them first class citizens or however you want to frame It. But like, you're not. You're not funders. Like, you're actually a part of the problem and the solution. Just like we're a part of the problem and the solution, and we need to bring as many people together to talk about this. And even if you can't fund, can you be present? You know, I think that way, like, they. They can say no and yes at the same time. And if you can't fund and you can be present, who do you think might want to fund or can fund? And it changes, like, the way they think about it. And instead of being like a yes and no kind of oppositional, it's like, oh, you're right. You know, I do sense these problems. I would love to be a part of a conversation like that. And I can't fund it because of XYZ constraints. These people might. And then. Or who do you think? What other funders do you think should be a part of that conversation? Because I don't know everybody. It's, you know, this is your domain. You probably know some other people. Is there someone that you'd like to reach out to? Can you make an intro? Something like that. And then at least you also have like a thread, you know, to crawl down.\n\n01:05:42 SPK_2\nYeah, yeah, that is super helpful. Thank you so much.\n\n01:05:47 SPK_1\nYeah.\n\n01:05:48 SPK_2\nSuper productive call. I love our call.\n\n01:05:51 SPK_1\nYeah, I'm glad because, like, sometimes I feel a little shy because in terms of, like, what makes me come to life is ranting at people or what exactly they call it, but, like, like, it's like the moment of these insights that I just want to share. And I love it. But I also, like, need to know that it was appreciated or, like, need to put it into the right context and be able to contain it. Like something like that. So I'm glad that I'm not completely crazy because going radio silent for a week can make me feel a little bit like, am I like, on the edge of madness or does this make sense? You know, like something like that?\n\n01:06:30 SPK_2\nNo, it was greatly appreciated. Definitely resonated. And yeah, we'll.\n\n01:06:35 SPK_1\nOh, before I remembered. Yeah, I wanted to. I gave you, like, One of the things that I do that I don't think is very intelligent is I just share documents without any context. So I like this, this paper that I sent you. I think I just want to extend, explain a few things so you don't have to struggle through. Like, okay, who is this Joe guy? What is this paper? What does this imply? What does this mean?\n\n01:06:58 SPK_2\nRight. Yeah.\n\n01:06:59 SPK_1\nHow does this actually connect with what we were talking about. So I'm just going to go over. So Joe isn't working on aligning humans with their values. He wants to align humans with AI, partially because this was funded by open AI, partially because as these things get more and more powerful, there's a lot of people really concerned about it. But the process that he's taken, I think is very related to the processes that you're talking about. Like how do we think of values that we can align on. Right. And actually create unity rather than disunity. And this paper describes some research that he did on conservatives and Democrats in America. If by developing what he calls a moral graph, he can get people to see across the aisle and find wisdom. And like, the examples here are a Christian girl struggling with deciding to have an abortion, for instance, or like, should the January 6th protesters be pardoned, for instance. Right. And these, these are very divisive. You know, Democrats versus Republicans would think very differently about both these kinds of things. But can we, by helping people, first of all, articulate what is meaningful about pardoning people or about the abortion decision process in this way that's more comprehensible both to a machine and to other humans? And can we use that process to show what value, what values are what he calls sources of meaning and how people can acknowledge other people's wise decisions? Right. And so the first part basically just goes through and describes like the history of describing different values, like Charles Taylor and Chang and Velluman and like just, you know, you know, paper academic stuff. But it's also very interesting if you're interested in how philosophers have tried to describe what values are in the past. And one of them, what are values? This is, Gabriel, natural and non natural facts about what is good and bad kind of things ought to be promoted. And then Taylor is where this idea of instrumental comes from. Values are criteria used in a choice which are not merely instrumental. So things that you would do in and of themselves. And Joe takes that and expands it into what he calls sources of meaning, which I don't know if it's described here. Yeah. So this is, this is a values card. So instead of talking about, actually, I think a better way of looking at values card is right here. So these are different kinds of humility, of honesty. Right. Somebody might say, I like honesty, but if, like honesty is a value that I really uphold. Right. But there's different flavors and different kinds of honesty. Honesty doesn't just mean like, well, I don't know what it means for you. Which one of these three Are you more closely aligned with like epistemic humility? And then this, these two over here actually for, for his system don't matter. This is just like human legible to try to get like a gist of things. But this is the kind of specific, he calls them constitutive attentional policies. So the idea of, well, a human being has attention, ability to perceive and like an action and then like systems that maintain that homeostasis to be able to perceive and enact. And so really understanding what attention is in a moment of meaning and what is actually being attuned to can help. You know, what about a moment of meaning matters? Right. So this is, this is his like theory of like how we know what matters is like, what do we attend to in a moment where like, wow, this is really meaningful. So he says for epistemic humility, the example might be doubts about the claim. So you're kind of like doubting your, your own self. Right. Embodied authenticity is another kind of honesty. Maybe somebody's talking about a sense of settledness that arises when my words and actions align with my truth. So that's like an embodied kind of thing that they're, they're noticing they're attending to. And so this is what he calls values cards. And it's not necessarily what people see on the back end, but what he does is he tries to create graphs where different people are grappling with decisions and expressing values in this very coherence. And what he calls auditable. Like, where's the word auditable? Somewhere. Yeah. Anyhow, so just like running over the paper, you actually see these different, like people run through a whole decision making process and then they're asked to look at these two different ways of being or sources of meaning or values cards or whatever. And people are asked whether or not the person became wiser. Right. So in the context of a child, do you want the child to just listen to you and have like role models that embody discipline or would you rather create opportunities to guide a user towards their passion? And so rather than forcing the kid not to look at the computer, is this a wiser way of being with a child, like igniting their passion and people like, yes. Right. And so the whole idea behind that is you take an arbitrary and abstract thing of like civil liberties or social justice or whatever and turn it into the things that people actually like noticing and paying attention to and then showing people what people are attending to when they're becoming wiser. Right. And then you can actually say like, oh, actually like Yes, I agree. And the very, very interesting thing is in terms of, like, ideology. Let me see, like, the end data. Yeah. So people were able to kind of let go of their opinions and actually agree that there is wisdom in other people's responses. Yeah, I forgot. Where was it? Case study. Yeah, here we go. So 70% of the participants agreed that they learned something about the values of others, and 75% gained respect for the other participants. And so, like, I thought that I would explain to you. Like, I don't think I did a great job at explaining the paper, but I wanted to explain to you why I thought the paper would be interesting for you to kind of digest a little bit. Because this is one of the approaches that. That I appreciate and that I'm using as sort of at least the attentional policies part as a way of making more articulate the things that it's hard to be articulate about and making that. Making it more possible to operationalize or do something about. And in terms of aligning people on being like, yeah, like, conservatives are actually right about that. Like, and, you know, maybe the idea of this whole. What does he call it, like a wisdom graph or something like that. Yeah, Meaning graph. And we can actually sort of see the moral arc of history because we can actually talk about the way of being that we actually prefer in each moment. So that's the paper. It could be interesting for you guys.\n\n01:14:41 SPK_2\nYeah. I mean, again, it's very relevant to this idea of, you know, getting people to move away from their positions and create both.\"\n16:49\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nWhat you're getting at is deeply philosophical, systemic, and practical all at once.

      "content": "Below is a **two-part** response:\n\n1. **A List of Key Themes, Stories, and Arguments** extracted from your conversation and prior materials.  \n2. **A New Essay** that weaves all these insights, examples (including Shinola and Arlan’s Boat), and quotes into a coherent piece you might share with cofounders (or any collaborators) to illustrate why *quality*—and the worldview behind it—matters more than “numbers mania” in social impact.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key Themes, Stories, and Arguments\n\n### A. Major Themes\n\n1. **Mechanistic vs. Quality-Based Worldview**  \n   - Mechanistic (or “instrumental”) thinking reduces people to data points and actions to checklists.  \n   - Quality-based (or “relational”) thinking sees depth, beauty, and meaning as primary drivers.  \n\n2. **Tension Between “Have-To” and “Want-To”**  \n   - Many tasks are done instrumentally for external validation (“have-to”).  \n   - Rediscovering what makes us “come alive” shifts us to deeper, self-driven motivation (“want-to”).  \n\n3. **Faculty of Direct Perception**  \n   - Beyond metrics, we possess a legitimate way of perceiving truth, beauty, and goodness.  \n   - Often ignored or dismissed as “woo-woo,” this faculty can guide authentic social impact.  \n\n4. **Misdirected “Doing Good”**  \n   - Simply adding a “social enterprise” veneer to a neoliberal, extractive mindset reproduces the same systemic issues.  \n   - Real change requires addressing root assumptions about competition, domination, and disconnection.  \n\n5. **“How You Do Anything Is How You Do Everything”**  \n   - The mindset, values, and assumptions guiding one action ripple into all consequences.  \n   - If the worldview is rooted in fear, forced speed, or extraction, we sabotage genuine transformation.  \n\n6. **Slowing Down to See**  \n   - Urgency culture can break more than it fixes (“smooth is fast” vs. “rushed is chaotic”).  \n   - True solutions emerge from attending carefully to reality—and trusting we have time to perceive what’s truly needed.  \n\n7. **Measurement vs. Meaning**  \n   - Measurement isn’t bad in itself, but it must follow meaning rather than define it.  \n   - Over-reliance on numbers can create illusions of success while undermining genuine well-being.  \n\n8. **The Power of Craft, Gardens, and Emergence**  \n   - Analogies like gardening or craftsmanship highlight that growth and quality arise through patient tending, not brute force.  \n   - “Creating the conditions” trumps pushing predetermined outcomes.\n\n### B. Compelling Stories & Examples\n\n1. **Shinola (Detroit)**  \n   - Revived watchmaking craft in a struggling city.  \n   - Focused on skill-building, long-lasting products, and local pride—not just hitting production metrics.  \n   - Result: a community renewal story where *the process* (training, craftsmanship) was as meaningful as the product.\n\n2. **Arlan’s Boat Works (Maine)**  \n   - Traditional wooden boat building using multi-generation knowledge transfer.  \n   - Apprenticeship model fosters deep mastery, relationship, and pride.  \n   - Quality emerges from the conversation between maker and material—an antidote to purely “efficient,” mass-market factories.\n\n3. **Microfinance Gone Wrong**  \n   - Originally aimed to uplift poor communities, it sometimes devolved into high-interest, exploitative practices for the sake of “numbers” and “closing rates.”  \n   - Demonstrates how “doing good” can turn harmful if driven by extraction and cold metrics.\n\n4. **Factory vs. Gardener Metaphor**  \n   - Pushing social impact “like a factory” often results in forced compliance and superficial progress.  \n   - Tending a “social garden” fosters organic, resilient growth that honors the nature of people and communities.\n\n5. **User’s Personal Insight on Charts and Numbers**  \n   - Feeling a rush of validation upon seeing template charts (even if meaningless).  \n   - Illustrates our cultural conditioning to worship metrics—even when they tell us nothing real.\n\n6. **Communes vs. Engaging Where You Are**  \n   - Some “woke” folks retreat to farms or rural intentional communities.  \n   - Alternative approach: transform daily life in the city or existing workplace (e.g., “start with your neighbor”).  \n\n### C. Arguments and Quotations\n\n1. **Key Arguments**  \n   - We can’t solve systemic problems with the same worldview that created them (echo of Einstein’s quote).  \n   - Social impact must be guided by relationships and authenticity; otherwise, we replicate harmful power structures.  \n   - “We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives”—numbers alone can’t guarantee flourishing.\n\n2. **Quotations**  \n   - “The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.” — *Martin Luther King Jr.*  \n   - “What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.” — *Ralph Waldo Emerson*  \n   - “You can’t fix a broken system with broken tools.” (Modern proverb)  \n   - “If you cut corners, you’ll build a round house.” (Caribbean saying)  \n   - “Smooth is fast.” (Common in sports, relevant to the concept of patient, quality-driven action)  \n   - “As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.” (English proverb)  \n\n---\n\n## 2. A New Essay for Convincing Co-Founders:  \n**Title: “Quality at the Core: Why Our Means Matter as Much as Our Ends”**\n\n**Introduction**  \nWe stand at a crossroads in social impact. We have the tools—software platforms, metric dashboards, ambitious investor pitches—but somehow we sense that something is missing. As we push forward to “do good,” we often catch ourselves reinforcing the very systems we hoped to change. What if *how* we act is shaping *what* we create? If “how you do anything is how you do everything,” then focusing on quality—from our mindset down to our daily tasks—may be the missing key.\n\n---\n\n### Part I: The Awakening—Seeing the Trap of Numbers Alone\n\nWe’re all familiar with the allure of metrics. Seeing a dashboard arrow climb or a pie chart fill up gives us a momentary thrill—“progress!” Yet, what if these tidy visuals are overshadowing deeper truths?\n\n- **The Microfinance Fiasco**: Social enterprises intended to lift communities out of poverty but ended up charging high interest, pressuring borrowers, and causing more suffering. The root cause? A fixation on “closing rates” and “repayment metrics,” losing sight of real human well-being.\n\n- **The Fast-Fashion “Conscious” Label**: Retailers boast “conscious collections,” yet continue overproduction and exploitative labor. A prime example of slapping a “doing good” sticker on the same old extraction mindset.\n\n> *“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”*  \n> —Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nSometimes, in our desire to “do good quickly,” we let the short-term rush of big numbers overshadow the quiet, painstaking work of building authentic relationships.\n\n---\n\n### Part II: Rediscovering Our Faculty of Direct Perception\n\nBeyond spreadsheets and reports, each of us has a *legitimate faculty* for perceiving beauty, truth, and goodness. It’s the same faculty that helps a craftsperson decide how to shape a piece of wood, or a farmer sense when the soil needs rest. Too often, we dismiss these deeper “felt senses” as unscientific or “too woo-woo.”\n\nBut consider:\n\n- **Arlan’s Boat Works (Maine)**: Multi-generation wooden boat builders use precise measurements, yes—but they also rely on intuition, feel, and conversation with the material. The result is craft that stands the test of time.  \n- **Shinola (Detroit)**: By training local workers in high-precision watchmaking, they revived a city’s pride and skill base. The quantifiable gains (jobs, economic activity) emerged naturally *after* focusing on quality, craftsmanship, and local relationships.\n\nIn each case, metrics were real—but served a deeper allegiance to craft, place, and meaning.\n\n---\n\n### Part III: “Have-To” vs. “Want-To”—Shifting the Internal Compass\n\nMany of us fill our days with “have-to” tasks—those we do merely to feed the machine or avoid punishment. This is not to say all “have-to’s” are bad—bills must be paid, and responsibilities met. But when *everything* is driven by outside metrics, we lose our spark.\n\n**How to Rebalance:**\n\n1. **Identify Tensions**: Look at your to-do list. Notice where you feel dread or emptiness. Are you chasing a numeric goal that doesn’t resonate anymore?  \n2. **Create Micro-Experiments**: Try substituting a “have-to” approach with a small “want-to” intention. For example, if you’re dreading a staff meeting, shift from “I have to get the bullet points done” to “I want to explore each team member’s personal vision.”  \n3. **Reflect on Outcomes**: Does slowing down and focusing on human connection create better alignment or even better results?\n\n> *“What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.”*  \n> —Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nWhen we treat people (or ourselves) purely instrumentally, we undermine the very trust and creativity we need for real impact.\n\n---\n\n### Part IV: Systems, Worldviews, and the “Garden” Approach\n\n#### Factory vs. Gardener\n\n- **Factory Mindset**: Speed, standardization, data outputs. Great for mass production, but often disastrous for nuanced human challenges.  \n- **Gardener Mindset**: A gardener sets conditions for growth: healthy soil, the right seeds, patient tending. Growth emerges organically, often beyond what we imagine.\n\nIn social impact, a “factory approach” tries to *force* solutions—pumping out trainings and checklists. But a “garden approach” recognizes that communities, like ecosystems, have their own rhythms and intelligence. We create the context for genuine growth rather than commanding it.\n\n---\n\n### Part V: Realigning with Quality—Practical Shifts\n\n1. **Slow Down to Go Fast**  \n   - *“Smooth is fast,”* as they say in sports. When we’re not rushing, we reduce mistakes and deepen bonds.  \n   - In your organization, try building in weekly “presence circles” where the only agenda is honest reflection—on tensions, doubts, or small successes.\n\n2. **Measure After Meaning**  \n   - Keep metrics, but let them follow from genuine insight.  \n   - For instance, if you’re working with a local community, first *listen* deeply. Co-create shared aspirations. Then decide what data is actually relevant (rather than deciding everything in a boardroom first).\n\n3. **Partner with Funders Who Get It**  \n   - Some donors also feel uneasy about the “numbers game.” Invite them into the conversation as *participants*, not just check-writers.  \n   - Focus on building *trust* and *relationship*. The right funders see that forcing vanity metrics can kill the authentic outcomes everyone actually wants.\n\n4. **Draw from Craft and Example**  \n   - **Shinola**, **Arlan’s Boat Works**, or even a local bakery that invests in relationships and slow, high-quality processes—these show a parallel blueprint for social impact.  \n   - The “how” is visible in every loaf, every watch, every hand-finished boat.\n\n---\n\n### Part VI: “How You Do Anything Is How You Do Everything”\n\nThis principle captures the heart of the matter: if our worldview is about extraction, speed, and competition, no amount of “social enterprise” branding will hide the deeper harm. But if we can cultivate relationships, trust our deeper sense of meaning, and adopt a gardener’s patience, we’ll build organizations that reflect and reinforce that worldview.\n\n- **In Microfinance**: The difference between “we must meet repayment targets” and “we value the dignity and well-being of borrowers” is night and day.  \n- **In Education**: The difference between “push test scores” vs. “nurture curiosity and growth” affects how teachers, students, and communities flourish.\n\nWhen we embody these principles, we automatically shift from “extractive efficiency” to “relational resilience.”\n\n---\n\n### Part VII: Conclusion—A Call to Live the Change\n\n> *“We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives.”*  \n> —(Paraphrased from your insight)\n\nWe cannot fix a broken system by replicating its values. A metrics-first approach might impress donors or produce neat reports, but it won’t ignite the genuine transformations we yearn for. Instead, we must start from within—trusting our direct perception of beauty, building relationships, and letting our *quality of attention* guide our actions.\n\n**Next Steps for Our Team**  \n1. **Revisit Our Own “Have-To” vs. “Want-To” Lists**  \n   - Where are we operating on autopilot?  \n   - How can we realign daily tasks with deeper sources of meaning?  \n2. **Redefine Success Metrics**  \n   - Consider measuring “meaningful moments per month” or “depth of community trust” alongside revenue or usage stats.  \n3. **Foster a Craft Mindset**  \n   - Like Arlan’s boat builders, hone your craft by engaging materials (or people) with patience and presence.  \n4. **Invite Stakeholders into Authentic Conversation**  \n   - Engage donors and partners not as gatekeepers but as fellow “gardeners” in the process.  \n   - Let them see the value of focusing on quality at every step.\n\nWhen we do this, we find that the ends take care of themselves—because our means carry the seed of the future we hope to create. As Martin Luther King Jr. reminds us, we cannot separate means from ends; they are two sides of the same coin. By embracing an approach that honors craft, relational depth, and a legitimate faculty of perceiving truth and beauty, we’re far more likely to build the resilient, humane world we claim to want.\n\n**Remember**: The shift from “doing good” to “recognizing beauty” isn’t about moving slower; it’s about moving *truer*—and that often proves the faster, more sustainable path in the long run.\n\n---\n\n### Final Note\n\nThe great paradox is that in trusting this deeper sense of *quality*, the *quantity* (like stable finances, broader impact, or expansions in scale) often comes more naturally. Organizations like **Shinola**, **Arlan’s Boat Works**, and countless “craft-based” enterprises show that when we prioritize how we work—relationally, attentively, with an eye on the intangible “rightness” of each action—the end products (and their real-world impacts) surpass what we can manufacture through metrics alone.\n\nIn short, if our internal compass remains stuck on extraction and mechanical efficiency, the best programs in the world will still ring hollow. But if we realign ourselves with deeper values, everything changes—and the journey becomes as nourishing as the destination.\n\n---\n\n#### A Final Quote for Inspiration\n\n> “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”  \n> —Immanuel Kant\n\nMay our actions reflect the world we hope to see—rooted in dignity, depth, and the trust that *how* we move is shaping *where* we land.",

Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)\nWhat Happened: Microfinance started as a way to provide small loans to marginalized communities, especially women, to foster entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty. However, as microfinance grew, many institutions began adopting corporate practices such as profit-maximizing goals, aggressive repayment schedules, and loan quotas. This led to exploitative practices like high-interest rates, coercion, and even borrower suicides in some countries (e.g., India).\nKey Lesson: By adopting a corporate mindset focused on financial metrics over the well-being of borrowers, MFIs often undermined the very communities they were meant to uplift.\n2. Charity: Profit-Driven \"Efficiency\" in Disaster Relief\nWhat Happened: In the aftermath of disasters (like Haiti's 2010 earthquake), major NGOs adopted corporate metrics like ROI, donor satisfaction, and visible project completion as priorities. This led to rushed housing projects and poorly planned infrastructure that failed to meet long-term needs or respect local input. Billions of dollars in funding were spent inefficiently, with a focus on pleasing donors rather than building resilient communities.\nKey Lesson: A corporate efficiency mindset that prioritizes measurable outputs over holistic, community-driven outcomes can lead to waste and harm.\n3. Fair Trade's \"Certification Industrial Complex\"\nWhat Happened: The Fair Trade movement started as a way to ensure small farmers received a fair price for their products. Over time, as certification became a corporate tool, the focus shifted to scaling and meeting the demands of large companies. This led to small-scale farmers being excluded from certification schemes due to high costs, and large plantations dominating \"Fair Trade\" markets while still exploiting workers.\nKey Lesson: Adopting a corporate growth mindset can distort the original intention of movements meant to prioritize equity and justice.\n4. Nonprofit \"Professionalization\" and Burnout\nWhat Happened: Many nonprofits have adopted corporate-style hierarchies, productivity measures, and performance-based evaluations to attract funders or improve efficiency. However, this has led to high turnover, employee burnout, and mission drift, as workers feel dehumanized and alienated in organizations meant to be centered on care and social good.\nExample: NGOs like Oxfam and Save the Children have faced scandals where internal cultures mirrored exploitative corporate environments—fostering toxicity, harassment, and ignoring staff well-being.\nKey Lesson: Professionalizing nonprofits by mimicking corporate cultures often ignores the emotional and relational labor required to achieve social missions.\n5. Education Startups and \"Datafication\"\nWhat Happened: EdTech companies and educational NGOs often adopted corporate-style metrics to measure success (e.g., test scores, student performance data). In doing so, they shifted focus from holistic education to data collection and analytics, reducing students to numbers. Programs that aimed to empower students became tools to reinforce standardization and control.\nExample: Bridge International Academies (an NGO-backed for-profit education model) has been criticized for scripted lessons that disempower teachers and rigid metrics that ignore local needs.\nKey Lesson: A corporate mindset of standardization and efficiency clashes with the nuanced, relational work of education.\nMetaphors for Why This Happens\n\"Wearing a New Mask on the Same Face\"\n\nSocial enterprises often adopt the appearance of change (ethical branding, \"impact metrics\") but don’t address the deeper worldview of competition, hierarchy, and control that governs their operations.\n\"Pouring Clean Water into a Dirty Cup\"\n\nA clean and noble idea (e.g., empowering communities) can be tainted when poured into systems designed for extraction and domination. Unless we change the container (our underlying mindset and structures), the result will always be compromised.\n\"Trying to Grow Organic Food in Polluted Soil\"\n\nSocial enterprises may start with good intentions, but if they operate within \"polluted soil\" (systems that reward exploitation and competition), they inherit the toxicity of their environment and cannot thrive.\n\"Teaching Wolves to Herd Sheep\"\n\nTaking corporate best practices (rooted in competitive and extractive principles) and applying them to social enterprises is like teaching wolves to herd sheep: the nature of the system inherently conflicts with the goal.\n\"Upgrading the Chains of a Prison\"\n\nMaking systems more \"efficient\" or \"ethical\" without questioning their fundamental purpose is like replacing the chains in a prison with silk ropes—it might feel better, but it’s still a prison.\nWhy \"Doing Things Differently\" Matters\nThe core insight here is that we cannot use the same worldview that created the problem to solve it. Social enterprises need to:\n\nShift from efficiency to relationship: Efficiency focuses on outputs, while relationships build trust and lasting change.\nReplace competition with cooperation: Moving away from zero-sum thinking to models that value shared growth.\nValue process as much as outcome: Focusing not just on what is done, but how it is done.\nRedefine success: Moving from financial or numerical metrics to metrics of well-being, equity, and ecological balance.\nWould you like help refining a metaphor or crafting a narrative to convey this to social enterprises? Perhaps a story or a parable that illustrates the deeper need for mindset shifts?\n\n16:31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nyeah, can you also get me quotes and turns of phrase from different cultures that say something like this. maybe something that's actually really simple and clear too so i can share it and people can understand \n16:32\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a collection of metaphors, proverbs, and quotes from various cultures that express the idea that how we do something shapes the results we get, along with their cultural roots. These can help communicate your message in a simple and relatable way:\n\nQuotes and Proverbs That Align with Your Ideas\n\"The way you make your bed is the way you will sleep.\"\n\n(African Proverb)\nMeaning: The approach you take determines the experience you have. It's not just the result that matters, but how you prepare for it.\n\"A crooked tree will never yield straight timber.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: If the foundation or approach is flawed, the outcome will carry those flaws.\n\"As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: The way you shape something from the start affects its entire growth or trajectory.\n\"If you cut corners, you'll build a round house.\"\n\n(Caribbean Saying)\nMeaning: Shortcuts or compromises in how you work lead to imperfect or ineffective results.\n\"The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.\"\n\n(Chinese Proverb)\nMeaning: The nature of the container (mindset or system) defines the outcome, no matter the quality of the content (ideas or intentions).\n\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"\n\n(English Saying)\nMeaning: Even well-meaning actions can cause harm if they are not guided by the right mindset and values.\n\"You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: High-quality results cannot come from low-quality methods or materials.\n\"A rotten fish spoils the whole pot.\"\n\n(Indian Proverb)\nMeaning: A single flaw in the foundation can ruin the entire outcome.\n\"The spirit in which you give is more important than the gift itself.\"\n\n(African Proverb)\nMeaning: The intent and way you act determine the true value of your actions.\n\"One cannot plant weeds and hope for wheat.\"\n\n(Middle Eastern Proverb)\nMeaning: The seeds you sow (methods, intentions) determine the harvest.\n\"The pot leaks from where it was poorly sealed.\"\n(Turkish Proverb)\nMeaning: Weak points in the process or system will ultimately lead to failure.\n\"If the root is rotten, the fruit cannot be sweet.\"\n(Chinese Proverb)\nMeaning: A system built on faulty principles will produce flawed outcomes.\n\"You cannot wash blood with blood.\"\n(Indian Proverb)\nMeaning: Using the same destructive methods or mindset to solve a problem only perpetuates harm.\nModern and Philosophical Quotes\n\"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\"\n\n(Albert Einstein)\nMeaning: A new mindset is essential for meaningful change.\n\"The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\"\n\n(Martin Luther King Jr.)\nMeaning: The process matters as much as the goal; methods that harm cannot lead to justice.\n\"What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.\"\n\n(Ralph Waldo Emerson)\nMeaning: Actions—and the way we take them—define outcomes far more than intentions.\n\"You cannot use fire to put out fire.\"\n\n(Buddhist Teaching)\nMeaning: Using the same destructive mindset to address problems only escalates them.\n\"Be the change that you wish to see in the world.\"\n\n(Mahatma Gandhi)\nMeaning: Aligning actions with values is critical; how we act shapes the outcomes.\n\"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.\"\n\n(Audre Lorde)\nMeaning: Systems of oppression cannot be reformed with the same tools or mindset that created them.\nSimple and Clear Sayings to Share\n\"You can’t fix a broken system with broken tools.\"\n\"How we walk the path shapes where it leads.\"\n\"What you build reflects how you build it.\"\n\"You can’t grow flowers in poisoned soil.\"\n\"Better maps don’t help if you’re heading in the wrong direction.\"\nStory-Based Metaphors\nThe Poisoned Well\n\nImagine a village whose well becomes poisoned. Instead of replacing the well or finding clean water, the villagers filter the poisoned water through finer and finer sieves, improving its taste but not its health. No matter how good the filtration, the poison remains. This is like trying to make businesses \"better\" without changing the worldview that poisons them.\nThe Broken Compass\n\nA group of travelers keeps getting lost. They try walking faster, carrying more supplies, and even building better shoes, but they never realize their compass is broken. This is like adopting corporate efficiency without questioning the values guiding the work.\nThe Rusty Hammer\n\nA carpenter keeps using a rusty hammer to build houses. No matter how skilled they are, the hammer always leaves nails bent and the wood damaged. It’s not their skill that’s lacking—it’s the tool they refuse to replace. This is like clinging to outdated corporate values in social enterprises.\nWould you like to explore one of these ideas or refine them for your specific audience? I can also help you adapt them into a cohesive message for presentations or conversations!\n\n16:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you give me more examples of \"doing good gone wrong - because of neoliberal mindsets of extraction disconnection acceleration, etc\"\n16:39\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere are more examples of well-intentioned \"doing good\" efforts that went wrong due to the underlying neoliberal mindset of extraction, disconnection, and acceleration. These illustrate how adopting corporate logic, without questioning its values, often leads to unintended harm:\n\n1. Social Impact Startups in Africa (e.g., One Laptop Per Child)\nWhat Happened: The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program aimed to provide affordable laptops to children in developing countries, believing access to technology would bridge the education gap. However, the program focused on distributing hardware without addressing the local context—schools lacked infrastructure, teachers weren’t trained, and there was no plan to integrate laptops into the curriculum. Many laptops were abandoned or misused.\nThe Problem: The initiative adopted a \"tech-savior\" mindset, focusing on acceleration and scalability without understanding the local systems or fostering connection with communities.\nLesson: Doing good requires slowing down to build relationships and understand real needs, not just imposing top-down solutions.\n2. Carbon Offsetting Programs\nWhat Happened: Many companies and NGOs offer carbon offset programs to reduce the environmental impact of industries. These often involve planting trees or funding renewable energy projects. However, these programs are frequently used to justify continued emissions (greenwashing), and many tree-planting projects fail due to poor planning or lack of follow-up, leading to degraded ecosystems.\nThe Problem: The neoliberal logic of \"offsetting\" turns sustainability into a transactional system rather than addressing root causes of overconsumption and industrial emissions.\nLesson: Genuine sustainability cannot be achieved through compensatory mechanisms alone; it requires systemic change.\n3. \"Green Revolution\" in Agriculture\nWhat Happened: The Green Revolution in the mid-20th century introduced high-yield crops, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to combat global hunger. While it increased food production, it also led to soil degradation, water scarcity, and dependency on chemical inputs. Small farmers were often driven into debt by the costs of seeds and chemicals, deepening inequality.\nThe Problem: The logic of extraction and acceleration—focusing on maximizing output without considering long-term ecological or social impacts—undermined the goals of sustainability and equity.\nLesson: Approaches that prioritize short-term efficiency over holistic well-being often create more harm than good.\n4. Fast Fashion and \"Conscious\" Collections\nWhat Happened: Companies like H&M introduced \"conscious\" collections to promote sustainability in the fashion industry. However, these collections make up a tiny fraction of their output, while the overall business model remains based on overproduction, low wages, and disposable clothing. The marketing of these collections gives consumers a false sense of doing good while perpetuating exploitative practices.\nThe Problem: Neoliberal capitalism’s drive for growth and speed clashes with the slower, more connected processes required for genuine sustainability.\nLesson: Without addressing the root problem—overproduction and exploitation—efforts to \"do good\" become performative.\n5. Volunteer Tourism (\"Voluntourism\")\nWhat Happened: Volunteer tourism offers travelers the chance to help disadvantaged communities while vacationing. However, many programs focus on providing feel-good experiences for volunteers rather than creating sustainable change. For instance, volunteers might build schools that later remain empty because no teachers are hired or trained.\nThe Problem: The disconnection between volunteers and the communities they serve—paired with an extractive, profit-driven tourism model—turns \"helping\" into a commodity that benefits volunteers more than locals.\nLesson: True change requires deep, sustained relationships and co-created solutions, not transactional acts of \"help.\"\n6. NGOs Perpetuating Dependency\nWhat Happened: Many humanitarian aid organizations unintentionally foster long-term dependency by providing relief without investing in community-driven solutions. For example, constant food aid in some regions has disrupted local agricultural markets, making it harder for farmers to compete.\nThe Problem: A mindset of disconnection and top-down \"rescue\" treats communities as passive recipients rather than active participants, undermining self-sufficiency.\nLesson: Social enterprises and NGOs must shift from paternalism to partnership, fostering empowerment rather than dependency.\n7. Plastic Recycling Initiatives\nWhat Happened: Global plastic recycling campaigns have emphasized individual responsibility for waste while failing to address the systemic problem of overproduction by corporations. Studies show that only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, yet the focus remains on consumers to \"do their part.\"\nThe Problem: The neoliberal mindset offloads responsibility onto individuals, disconnecting systemic accountability (corporations) from the problem of plastic pollution.\nLesson: Environmental initiatives must challenge corporate production patterns rather than placing the burden on consumers.\n8. Corporate \"Diversity and Inclusion\" Programs\nWhat Happened: Many companies implement diversity and inclusion programs to address workplace inequities. However, these programs are often surface-level, focusing on optics rather than structural change. For example, hiring more diverse employees without addressing toxic workplace cultures leads to high turnover among underrepresented groups.\nThe Problem: The mindset of acceleration and optics treats diversity as a checkbox rather than a systemic transformation.\nLesson: Equity requires slow, deliberate shifts in culture and power, not quick-fix programs.\n9. The Privatization of Public Services\nWhat Happened: Under neoliberal reforms, public services like water, education, and healthcare have been privatized in many countries, often with promises of increased efficiency. In reality, privatization has often led to reduced access, higher costs, and worsening inequality, especially in vulnerable communities.\nThe Problem: Applying corporate logic to essential services treats people as customers rather than citizens with rights, prioritizing profit over access and equity.\nLesson: Public goods cannot be treated as market commodities without undermining their purpose.\n10. Tech in the Classroom: Overuse of EdTech\nWhat Happened: Many schools adopted digital learning tools to \"modernize\" education, often driven by tech companies rather than educators. These tools frequently prioritized data collection and standardization over meaningful learning. Studies show that excessive screen use can harm students’ focus and engagement while deepening digital divides for low-income schools.\nThe Problem: The acceleration mindset prioritizes technological solutions over understanding human learning processes, resulting in harm to students.\nLesson: Technology should serve human needs, not dictate them.\nKey Patterns in \"Doing Good Gone Wrong\"\nAcross these examples, the underlying neoliberal mindsets lead to:\n\nDisconnection – Treating people and ecosystems as resources or beneficiaries rather than partners or equals.\nExtraction – Prioritizing measurable outputs (profits, metrics, growth) over relational or long-term well-being.\nAcceleration – Seeking quick fixes or scalable models instead of slower, context-specific, relational solutions.\nWould you like to explore any of these stories in greater detail, or craft a narrative or metaphor to help explain this to your audience?",

      "content": "Below is a **comprehensive, long-form essay** that integrates **all** the requested content—quotes from various cultures, extended examples of “doing good gone wrong,” metaphors illustrating worldview problems, counterexamples like Shinola and Arlan’s Boat Works, and reflections on why *how* we do something is as important as *what* we do. Feel free to adapt, shorten, or rearrange it as needed.\n\n---\n\n# **From Metrics to Meaning: Why Our Worldview Matters More Than Our Numbers**\n\n> *“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”*  \n> —Albert Einstein\n\n## **I. Introduction: The Crisis of “Doing Good”**\n\nIn the modern “changemaker” scene—social enterprises, NGOs, philanthropic initiatives—there’s a mounting unease. On the surface, impact metrics, corporate-style scaling strategies, and ROI dashboards promise efficiency and accountability. Yet many of us are left feeling that something is off. As one social entrepreneur observed, *“We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives.”*\n\nWhy is this? The tension arises because, in trying to “do good,” we often adopt the **same extractive, competitive, and disconnected logic** that fueled the problems we’re trying to solve. We measure success by numbers alone, chase quick wins, and treat humans as data points. Meanwhile, the deeper sources of meaning—our capacity for relationship, beauty, truth, and what truly makes us *come alive*—are dismissed as intangible or “woo-woo.”\n\nYet across cultures, we find reminders that *how* we do things inevitably shapes *what* we create. As the **Caribbean saying** goes, *“If you cut corners, you’ll build a round house.”* Or in **Chinese wisdom**, *“The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.”* If the “vessel” is a mindset of acceleration, extraction, and superficial metrics, our “impact” outcomes will reflect those qualities—no matter how noble our intentions.\n\nThis essay explores why the worldview behind our actions matters more than any well-intentioned façade of doing good. We will look at:\n\n1. **Real-World Cases**: Social enterprises and NGOs adopting corporate practices with harmful consequences.  \n2. **Metaphors from Multiple Cultures**: Why superficial fixes fail when the deeper logic remains unchanged.  \n3. **Craft, Gardens, and Slow Approaches**: Alternative models (like Shinola or Arlan’s Boat Works) that focus on quality, relationship, and presence.  \n4. **Practical Shifts**: How to realign from “metrics mania” to meaningful, human-centered ways of working.\n\n---\n\n## **II. Doing Good Gone Wrong: How a Corporate Mindset Distorts Social Mission**\n\n> *“You cannot wash blood with blood.”*  \n> —(Indian Proverb)  \n> *Meaning: Using the same destructive mindset that caused the problem will not heal it.*\n\nNumerous organizations begin with genuine aims—providing relief, protecting the planet, empowering the vulnerable—yet adopt the *same mechanistic worldview* prevalent in corporate arenas. The results often backfire.\n\n### **1. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)**  \n- **What Happened**: Microfinance originally aimed to uplift marginalized communities through small loans, especially to women entrepreneurs. But as MFIs expanded, they embraced profit-maximizing goals, aggressive repayment targets, and loan quotas. This devolved into coercive practices, high interest rates, and even borrower suicides (e.g., in parts of India).  \n- **Key Lesson**: A purely corporate growth mindset, obsessed with repayment metrics, compromised the deeper purpose of alleviating poverty. *“You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear,”* goes an **English proverb**—high-quality social uplift can’t emerge from low-quality methods rooted in extraction.\n\n### **2. Charity: “Efficiency” in Disaster Relief**  \n- **What Happened**: After Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, large NGOs chased donor satisfaction and visible “completion metrics” (houses built, roads paved). In reality, poorly planned infrastructure neither lasted nor respected local wisdom. Billions of dollars were spent inefficiently, guided by *ROI mania* rather than resilient community-building.  \n- **Key Lesson**: *“If you cut corners, you’ll build a round house.”* Rushing to please donors erodes the long-term relationships and robust planning needed to foster genuine recovery.\n\n### **3. Fair Trade’s “Certification Industrial Complex”**  \n- **What Happened**: Fair Trade began to secure just prices for small-scale farmers. Over time, formal certification processes ballooned, catering to big plantations with minimal real oversight. Small farmers found themselves edged out or unable to afford certification fees, thus reinforcing inequality.  \n- **Key Lesson**: *“If the root is rotten, the fruit cannot be sweet.”* (Chinese proverb). Even if a brand’s packaging displays “Fair Trade,” the underlying system can remain exploitative if scaled using purely corporate logic.\n\n### **4. Nonprofit “Professionalization” and Burnout**  \n- **What Happened**: Many nonprofits implement corporate-style hierarchies, productivity metrics, and performance evaluations to appear “serious” to funders. This spawns burnout, high turnover, and mission drift, as staff feel they’re just cogs in a machine—no different from exploitative business cultures. Oxfam and Save the Children faced scandals involving toxic environments and ignoring staff well-being.  \n- **Key Lesson**: *“A rotten fish spoils the whole pot.”* (Indian proverb). Importing hierarchical, efficiency-obsessed practices kills morale and authenticity in missions founded on care and empathy.\n\n### **5. Education Startups and “Datafication”**  \n- **What Happened**: EdTech ventures often prioritize standardized test scores, data analytics, and “scalable” models. Programs meant to empower students end up reinforcing rigid metrics and control, overlooking local contexts or teacher expertise. Bridge International Academies was criticized for scripted lessons that disempowered teachers.  \n- **Key Lesson**: *“The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”* (English saying). Even well-meant data-driven solutions can flatten the rich complexities of learning, turning students into numbers rather than nurturing their holistic growth.\n\n#### **Extended Examples: More “Doing Good Gone Wrong”**\n\n- **Fast Fashion’s “Conscious Collections”**: A tiny fraction of production labeled “sustainable” while the core model remains exploitative, driving overconsumption.  \n- **Volunteer Tourism (“Voluntourism”)**: Feel-good experiences for visitors overshadow truly sustainable community involvement.  \n- **Carbon Offsetting Programs**: Planting trees to “offset” continuing emissions ends up greenwashing root problems of overproduction.  \n- **Privatization of Public Services**: When essential services like water or healthcare become for-profit ventures, inequality often deepens rather than resolving.  \n\nAcross these cases, the underlying flaw is a **neoliberal logic** of extraction, speed, and seeing people as instruments—**“Wearing a new mask on the same face,”** so to speak. Or in other metaphors:\n\n- **“Pouring Clean Water into a Dirty Cup”**: Good intentions poured into a toxic system remain compromised.  \n- **“Trying to Grow Organic Food in Polluted Soil”**: A philanthropic or social enterprise effort inherits the toxins of competition and profit-maximization if it doesn’t question them.  \n- **“Teaching Wolves to Herd Sheep”**: Corporate growth mindsets conflict at a core level with relational or community-based interventions.\n\n---\n\n## **III. Why the Same Mindset Replicates the Same Problems**\n\n> *“The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.”*  \n> —Audre Lorde\n\nThis quote captures the heart of the issue: **adopting the conventional corporate toolbox for social impact** typically reproduces competition, hierarchical control, and acceleration. It may deliver short-term outputs, but it rarely fosters deep transformation.\n\nAs an **African proverb** reminds us:  \n> *“The spirit in which you give is more important than the gift itself.”*\n\nIf the spirit is one of “check the donor’s box” or “scale at all costs,” the results, no matter how well-packaged, come tainted by that underlying orientation.\n\n### **Inevitable Outcomes of a Corporate Worldview**\n\n1. **Disconnection**: People and ecosystems become abstract “beneficiaries” or “resources,” severing authentic relationships.  \n2. **Extraction**: Metrics revolve around deliverables, ignoring intangible well-being, local knowledge, or cultural context.  \n3. **Acceleration**: Urgency and quick fixes overshadow the slow, patient building of trust and community-led solutions.  \n\nIn short, *“You can’t grow flowers in poisoned soil.”* Unless the soil (the worldview) is healed, seeds of social good can’t thrive.\n\n---\n\n## **IV. Alternative Path: From Extraction to Quality and Relationship**\n\n> *“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”*  \n> —Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMoving beyond mechanistic approaches demands a **fundamental shift**: from forcing growth and manipulating metrics to *attending* to genuine quality in every action. This calls for **slowing down, building relationships,** and trusting a deeper faculty of direct perception—one that recognizes beauty, meaning, and authenticity without immediate quantification.\n\n### **A. The Faculty of Direct Perception**\n\nMany of us have a quiet sense of what “feels right”: an internal compass that distinguishes meaningful engagement from token gestures. Yet we’ve been taught to ignore or belittle this intuition as “unscientific” or “too emotional.”  \n- **Example**: Shinola in Detroit banked on local pride and skilled craftsmanship to rebuild a watchmaking tradition. The intangible factor—restoring dignity—was no less important than the bottom line.  \n- **Example**: Father Greg Boyle’s Homeboy Industries thrives on friendship, not just “data-driven recidivism metrics,” revealing how relationships can supersede conventional accountability tools.\n\nWhen measurement serves meaning, rather than dictating it, we nurture outcomes far richer than any standard KPI.\n\n### **B. Models for Slower, Deeper Engagement**\n\n1. **Gardening vs. Factories**  \n   - *Factory Mindset*: Standardize, control, push throughput.  \n   - *Gardener Mindset*: Prepare the soil, plant seeds, tend patiently, and let nature’s rhythms lead.  \n   In social impact, a gardener invests time to understand community needs, fosters local leadership, and remains flexible, allowing *emergence* instead of forcing compliance.\n\n2. **Craft, Apprenticeship, and Mastery**  \n   - **Arlan’s Boat Works (Maine)**: Wooden boat building relies on measuring wood precisely *and* feeling it in your hands—an interplay of logic and intuition. Apprentices learn by closely observing and emulating masters.  \n   - **The “Smooth is Fast” Principle**: Slowing down to ensure quality often leads to fewer mistakes, richer relationships, and ironically, more sustainable progress.\n\n3. **Local Partnership and Co-Creation**  \n   - Instead of imposing top-down solutions, co-design interventions with communities.  \n   - Example: Genuine microfinance (before it got corrupted) hinged on relationship-based lending circles, personal trust, and deep local knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## **V. Concrete Shifts: From Superficial Metrics to Meaningful Action**\n\n> *“How we walk the path shapes where it leads.”*\n\nIt’s not enough to critique. We need workable alternatives that respect our need for some data while prioritizing the intangible yet vital aspects of **trust, presence,** and **quality**.\n\n1. **Redefine Success Beyond Numbers**  \n   - Integrate “well-being indexes,” “meaningful moments,” or “relationship depth” into your organization’s goals.  \n   - Example: “Meaningful Moments per Month per Employee” can replace or complement “hours clocked” or “units produced.”\n\n2. **Shift from Efficiency to Relationship**  \n   - Efficiency has its place in mundane tasks, but deep social change hinges on relationships.  \n   - *“The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.”* (Chinese proverb). If your vessel is purely efficiency-driven, you risk dehumanizing the process of change.\n\n3. **Build Time for Reflection and Presence**  \n   - Like an athlete practicing “smooth is fast,” give space for weekly check-ins or “presence circles.”  \n   - Encourage staff and beneficiaries alike to name tensions, celebrate small wins, and question why certain tasks feel “off.”\n\n4. **Slow, Context-Specific Scaling**  \n   - If you must scale, do it organically. Demand-driven expansions keep the focus on **local realities and relationships**.  \n   - Avoid “one-size-fits-all” replication. Each new region or community might need a fresh, patient approach.\n\n5. **Honor the Faculty of Direct Perception**  \n   - Teach teams to trust *qualitative signals*— discomfort, resonance, the “aha” of alignment. These are **data** too, just not numerical.  \n   - *“You cannot use fire to put out fire.”* (Buddhist teaching). We can’t fix the emotional and relational vacuum by doubling down on spreadsheets.\n\n---\n\n## **VI. Counterexamples & Hope: When Quality Leads to Thriving**\n\nAmid grim stories of microfinance abuses and fair trade distortions, there are shining cases where organizations aligned means and ends more holistically:\n\n- **Shinola (Detroit)**: Built watchmaking skills locally, paying living wages. The pride of craftsmanship *and* economic uplift advanced together.  \n- **Arlan’s Boat Works**: Apprenticeships link tradition, care, and skill. Boats become more than objects; they are tangible evidence of shared mastery.  \n- **Father Greg Boyle’s Homeboy Industries**: Prioritizing “they’re my friends” fosters a genuine relational approach—metrics follow, but *friendship leads*.  \n- **Local, Indigenous-Led Conservation Efforts**: In many parts of the world, indigenous communities manage forests or fisheries sustainably, guided by cultural values that see nature as kin, not a resource.\n\n**What unites these examples?** A commitment to authenticity, a willingness to slow down, and an embrace of *both* intangible and tangible dimensions of work. They measure, yes, but with a light touch—serving deeper human or ecological flourishing.\n\n---\n\n## **VII. Pulling It All Together: A Worldview Shift**\n\n> *“The way you make your bed is the way you will sleep.”*  \n> —(African Proverb)\n\nWhen we chase purely corporate metrics or try to “upgrade the chains of a prison” by adding an “ethical veneer” to the same old machinery, we replicate disconnection, extraction, and acceleration. **Transformational change** demands we question the deeper logic—embracing a worldview of relationship, trust, and quality as fundamental.\n\n### **A. Embrace the Process as Much as the Outcome**\n\n- *“One cannot plant weeds and hope for wheat.”* (Middle Eastern proverb). If our daily methods are shallow or exploitative, the final product can’t miraculously become ethical.  \n- *“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.”* (Mahatma Gandhi). Our internal alignment shapes external impact.\n\n### **B. Recognize that Worldviews Are Contagious**\n\n- If you measure everything in “returns,” your partners, employees, and even beneficiaries start seeing themselves as means to an end.  \n- If you approach from a place of trust, respect, and presence, you create a culture that values *people as people*. Over time, that culture yields far-reaching resilience and prosperity.\n\n### **C. Allow Time for Emergence**\n\n- *“Trying to grow organic food in polluted soil”* fails because we don’t let the land heal. Similarly, social impact demands letting new models gestate in fresh soil—free from the toxins of constant “scaling” pressure.  \n- Real change often looks messy or slow at first. But as **Shinola** and **Arlan’s Boat Works** show, the craft approach—focusing on depth—creates outcomes that endure.\n\n---\n\n## **VIII. Conclusion: Choosing a Different Path**\n\n> *“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”*  \n> —Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWe’ve seen how so-called “good intentions” can implode under the weight of a worldview that values speed, competition, and metrics above all else. We’ve glimpsed alternatives—gardener mindsets, craft approaches, local partnership, direct perception—that honor human dignity and ecological balance from the start.\n\n**If the foundation is flawed, no amount of superficial patching will fix it.** Or as a **Turkish proverb** warns, *“The pot leaks from where it was poorly sealed.”* To truly “seal the pot,” we must reimagine *why* and *how* we work, moving from mechanical checklists to living relationships.\n\n> *“We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives.”*  \n> When the underlying worldview remains extractive, even well-funded accomplishments can leave us spiritually bankrupt.\n\nBut with a shift to **meaning-first, measurement-second**, we may find that the intangible—trust, presence, authenticity—becomes our most reliable guide. And paradoxically, when we honor this deeper sense of quality, the quantitative results (financial stability, genuine social impact, ecological restoration) often flourish in ways we could never force with metrics alone.\n\n### **A Final Invitation**\n\nTry one small experiment:\n\n- The next time you plan a project or hold a team meeting, **notice** whether the group’s default is “get numbers quickly” or “listen for what’s truly alive in the situation.”  \n- Make space for a “presence circle,” inviting each person to name one tension and one aspiration. See if a more *relational*, *qualitative* understanding emerges.  \n- Then decide which metrics might *support* that insight rather than replace it.\n\n**This shift won’t be instant.** We’re all shaped by systems that prize speed and quantification. Yet, as the **Chinese proverb** reminds us, *“As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.”* Each choice to bend the twig toward authenticity and depth helps us grow organizations—and societies—that embody the world we wish to see.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Takeaways in Brief**\n\n1. **Worldview Is Crucial**  \n   - *“Better maps don’t help if you’re heading in the wrong direction.”* A toxic system cannot be fixed by more “efficient” metrics alone.\n\n2. **Doing Good Goes Wrong When…**  \n   - We adopt neoliberal/corporate logic (extraction, disconnection, acceleration) under the banner of “impact.”\n\n3. **Metaphors to Remember**  \n   - “Pouring clean water into a dirty cup”  \n   - “Upgrading the chains of a prison”  \n   - “Teaching wolves to herd sheep”\n\n4. **Alternatives Exist**  \n   - Shinola’s craftsmanship, Arlan’s Boat Works, Homeboy Industries, and countless local/regenerative models show that *relational, craft-oriented approaches* yield deeper, more lasting impact.\n\n5. **Practical Shifts**  \n   - *Redefine success*: from raw numbers to relationship-based, holistic indicators.  \n   - *Slow down for reflection*: “smooth is fast.”  \n   - *Honor direct perception*: intangible signals of alignment matter.\n\n6. **Final Quote**  \n   - *“We cannot use fire to put out fire.”* (Buddhist Teaching)  \n   - If the fundamental mindset is broken, we must move beyond it—toward an approach that values **quality, trust, and genuine human presence** as core principles of our shared future.\n\n---\n\n### **In closing**  \nLet us recognize that **how** we walk the path not only shapes *where* we end up, but *who* we become in the process. By reclaiming a slower, relational worldview—one that measures meaning before metrics—we stand a far better chance of nurturing real human flourishing, inside our organizations and across the world.",

      "content": "let's re-write this essay with more quotes and fuller paragraphs and more deeply integrating the importance of the idea of craft: # From Metrics to Meaning: A Personal Journey to Real Impact\n\n## Part I: The Moment Everything Changed\n\nI was watching Father Greg Boyle speak about his work with gang members at Homeboy Industries when something shifted fundamentally in how I understood social impact. When asked about his metrics, his theory of change, his impact assessment, he offered something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\"\n\nIn that moment, I realized how much of my own work had been instrumental – moving from community to community, project to project, always focused on scale and metrics rather than genuine relationship. I had been trying to solve problems rather than truly know people. Like many in social impact, I had unconsciously adopted a worldview that treats humans as means to ends, even when those ends are supposedly human wellbeing.\n\nThis realization led me to make a radical choice: to stop my peripatetic work and root myself deeply in Lebanon. Not because it was strategic, not because it would scale, but because real relationship requires presence. What followed transformed my understanding of what social impact truly means.\n\nOver years of building genuine relationships with refugees, former shoe-shiners, people living on the streets – many of whom are now dear friends – I learned what Father Greg already knew: real change happens through authentic connection, not programmatic intervention. When we treat people as means to achieving impact metrics, we miss what matters most.\n\n## Part II: The Crisis in Social Impact\n\nThis pattern of prioritizing metrics over meaning plays out everywhere in our sector. Consider the tragedy of microfinance in India. What began with Muhammad Yunus's recognition of human dignity devolved into a system where collection agents hounded farmers to suicide over loans as small as $100. The same repayment rates that earned institutions praise were destroying the very lives they claimed to improve.\n\nOr look at how international NGOs create thousands of refugee jobs while remaining silent when those same refugees face existential threats. The metrics look beautiful on paper, but something essential is missing. We've constructed stories about impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge.\n\nI saw this pattern in my own work before Father Greg's words changed everything. At GEMSI, I was invited to speak on Al Jazeera about our impact. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had built a narrative about change rather than creating conditions for real transformation.\n\nThis isn't just about ineffective programs. It's about a way of seeing that has forgotten half of what it means to be human. We've inherited a worldview that reduces everything to means and ends, inputs and outputs. From Descartes' separation of mind and world to modern economics treating humans as rational maximizers, we've built systems that actively suppress our capacity to recognize and create real value.\n\n## Part III: A Different Way of Seeing\n\nYet there's hope. My experience in Lebanon showed me what's possible when we trust relationship over metrics. When I opened my home and heart to genuine connection, transformation happened naturally. Not according to predetermined outcomes, but in ways more profound than any program could design.\n\nThis isn't just personal anecdote. Organizations worldwide are demonstrating what's possible when we trust our capacity to recognize meaning directly:\n\nConsider Barry-Wehmiller, a manufacturing company that during the 2008 recession chose reduced hours for all over layoffs – starting with executives. This wasn't just ethics – it was recognition that human dignity matters more than short-term metrics. The company emerged stronger, with industry-leading retention and a culture of genuine care.\n\nOr look at Buurtzorg in the Netherlands, which eliminated all middle management and metrics-based control in healthcare, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country.\n\nThese aren't just inspiring stories – they reveal a capacity we all have but have been taught to distrust. Every time we recognize beauty without analysis, every time we know something's right without calculation, we touch this ancient way of knowing.\n\nFor me, this realization has profound implications for how we at Bloom support social enterprises. Instead of pushing for scale and metrics first, we need to create conditions where meaning can emerge naturally. Instead of treating entrepreneurs as implementation vehicles for impact, we need to support them in building genuine relationships with their communities.\n\nThe path forward isn't abandoning metrics but recovering our trust in this deeper faculty of perception. Like stereoscopic vision, we need both ways of seeing to perceive depth. What we need are approaches that honor both our capacity for measurement and our ability to recognize quality directly.\nThe Craft Mindset and Pre-Rational Knowledge\nA craft mindset emphasizes engagement, attention, and reverence for the process of creation rather than the outcome. It aligns deeply with the ideas expressed in the quotes and practices you’ve shared. Here’s how these ways of being relate to the craft mindset:\n\nCraft Mindset and Philosophers’ Ideas\nRumi – Intuition and Openness\nCraft Connection: A craftsperson works not solely from rational design but also from intuitive understanding. For example, a potter feels the clay’s texture and responds to its unique qualities in the moment. Intuition guides the hand as much as skill.\nHeidegger – Being Claimed by the World’s Call\nCraft Connection: Craft emerges from being attuned to the material. A woodworker listens to the grain of the wood, letting it \"call\" them toward what it wants to become. This relational dynamic between the maker and the material echoes Heidegger’s notion of undergoing experiences rather than controlling them.\nRobert Pirsig – Quality as a Meeting Point\nCraft Connection: In craft, the boundary between subject (the maker) and object (the material) dissolves. Quality is the harmonious interplay between the two. A violinist doesn’t just \"play\" the violin; they merge with it, co-creating the music.\nWilliam Blake – Cleansing the Doors of Perception\nCraft Connection: A craftsperson cleanses their perception through repetitive practice and immersion. Over time, they see possibilities others cannot—turning raw materials into forms imbued with beauty and meaning.\nSimone Weil – Attention as Generosity\nCraft Connection: The craft mindset demands deep attention, a rare and generous act in a world of distraction. A baker kneading dough or a calligrapher drawing a line pours their attention into the task, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.\nIbn Arabi – Participatory Knowing\nCraft Connection: In craft, the maker feels part of a larger process. A ceramicist may sense they’re not \"making\" a bowl but participating in the universe’s creative flow, coalescing into form through their hands.\nEinstein – Intuition as a Sacred Gift\nCraft Connection: Mastery of craft comes not just from rational techniques but from intuitive leaps. A carpenter may sense the perfect angle for a joint or a chef may know exactly when a sauce has the right balance of flavors without needing to measure.\n\nCraft Mindset and Practices\nAttention Training (Sufism): A craftsperson pays reverent attention to the smallest details—how a thread weaves, how paint dries. This mirrors the Sufi practice of observing beauty as a form of devotion.\nContemplative Journaling: A craftsperson often reflects on their process—why did this design feel right? What does this mistake teach? Journaling allows them to refine their intuitive sense of quality.\nSilent Sensing (Phenomenology): Craft requires listening to the material world in silence. A blacksmith listens to the sound of metal cooling, adjusting based on what the process \"tells\" them.\nStorytelling: Craftsmanship is steeped in stories—stories of tools handed down, traditions upheld, or moments of breakthrough. Sharing these stories cultivates a deeper connection to the work.\nAesthetic Immersion: Craftspersons immerse themselves in beauty, drawing inspiration from the natural world or the creations of others. This sustains their sense of quality and keeps their work alive.\nAliveness Check-Ins: The craftsperson asks, \"What feels alive in this work?\" They follow the joy and resonance of the process rather than the pressure of perfection.\nBody Awareness: The body is central to craft. Whether it’s the rhythm of hammering or the delicate balance of a brushstroke, the craftsperson feels their way through the work.\nMeditative Practices: Many crafts—like weaving, carving, or pottery—become meditative. The repetitive actions quiet the mind and allow deeper insights to emerge.\nNon-Instrumental Activities: Craftspersons often experiment with no goal—sketching for fun, playing with textures. These moments nurture creativity and intuitive knowing.\n\nWhy Craft and Pre-Rational Knowing Matter\nRestores Relationality:\nCraft re-engages the maker with their materials and environment. This relational dynamic contrasts sharply with industrialized, impersonal systems of production.\nPrioritizes Process Over Product:\nThe craft mindset values the process, echoing the philosophy of being over doing. This perspective helps us reconnect with the present moment.\nCultivates Humility and Care:\nCraft requires humility—listening to the material, learning from mistakes, and honoring tradition. This humility fosters respect for the interconnected web of life.\nRebalances Rationality and Intuition:\nCraft integrates reason and intuition, demonstrating how these faculties can work together to create something meaningful.\nOffers a Model for Living:\nCraft embodies a slower, more deliberate way of life. It teaches patience, attention, and reverence—qualities that counter the speed and detachment of modern systems.\n\nHow Craft Helps Us Reframe Modern Challenges\nOvercoming Materialism:\nThe craft mindset reveals the relationality between people and objects, countering the materialist view that everything is a resource to be exploited.\nHealing Neoliberal Systems:\nBy emphasizing quality, attention, and beauty, craft challenges the metrics of efficiency and scalability that dominate neoliberalism.\nReclaiming Value:\nCraft highlights intrinsic value rather than instrumental value. A handmade chair is valued not for its price but for the story, care, and skill it embodies.\n\nPart III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing - Natural Models for Social Impact\nThe Wisdom of Gardens\nWhen we approach social impact like gardeners rather than factory managers, everything changes. A gardener needs tomatoes, yes - there are real outcomes to achieve. But they understand something profound about how change happens: you can't force a seed to grow. You can only create conditions that support its natural unfolding.\nThis isn't passive - it requires deep engagement:\n\nReading the soil and weather\nUnderstanding natural cycles\nLearning from experience\nPlanning for lean times\nResponding to challenges\n\nBut it's a different kind of engagement. Instead of attempting to control outcomes through force, we participate in something larger. This creates natural resilience rather than artificial stability.\nThe Craft Way of Seeing\nCraft offers another crucial model. When a craftsperson works with materials, something remarkable happens: mere stuff becomes relationship. A pot isn't just clay shaped by technique - it's a conversation between maker, material, and eventual user. This transforms how we understand quality and scale:\nQuality Through Relationship\n\nDirect material engagement\nBalance of measurement and feeling\nIntegration of planning and presence\nNatural sustainability through care\n\nLearning Through Tradition\n\nMastering form before innovation\nKnowledge passed through practice\nCommunity-held wisdom\nDeep material understanding\n\nNatural Scale\n\nQuality reduces waste\nLocal materials create resilience\nSkills build community\nBeauty spreads naturally\n\nThe Integration of Measurement and Meaning\nWhat makes craft particularly relevant for social impact is how it naturally integrates quantitative and qualitative understanding. A craftsperson's movements embody both measurement and sensing - they're not separate activities but aspects of one integrated way of knowing.\nThis shows us how metrics and meaning can work together:\n\nQuality emerges from careful attention\nMeasurement serves beauty\nForm enables rather than constrains\nTradition guides innovation\n\nSmooth is Fast: The Paradox of Pace\nPerhaps most importantly, craft teaches us about timing. Like the cook who breaks the jar by rushing, we often create delays through forced speed. But when we trust quality recognition:\n\nNatural rhythm emerges\nRight action becomes clear\nOthers align naturally\nResources flow appropriately\n\nThis isn't slow for slowness' sake. It's what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - the paradoxical efficiency that comes from aligned action rather than forced effort.\nImplications for Social Impact\nThis suggests a different approach to social enterprise:\n\nCreate conditions rather than force outcomes\nBuild capacity through relationship\nLet quality guide growth\nTrust natural timing\n\nWhen we do this:\n\nImpact emerges naturally\nCommunities build resilience\nResources align with needs\nBeauty spreads organically\n\nThe key is seeing that, like gardens and craft, social impact isn't something we make happen through force. It's something we participate in through wise attention and aligned action.\nPart IV: Practical Implications for Bloom - From Platform to Practice\nRethinking Our Foundation\nThe most profound implication of this shift in thinking requires us to challenge our core assumption: that software is our path to scale and sustainability. In an age where AI and new technologies are rapidly transforming digital tools, we need to ask ourselves a more fundamental question: What is our true craft?\nWhat We Really Offer\nThe evidence of our value is clear but misunderstood:\n\nPeople love our programs\nTransformation happens consistently\nDeep connections form\nReal growth emerges\n\nYet we've been trying to capture this in software, attempting to scale what might not be meant for scaling. Instead, we need to:\n\nFocus on our genuine craft\nLet value guide structure\nAllow natural growth\nTrust quality recognition\n\nA New Model for Our Work\nFor Entrepreneurs\nInstead of pushing platform engagement, we create conditions where they:\n\nFeel truly seen and connected\nDevelop self-knowledge and confidence\nLearn to trust their quality recognition\nAccess genuine wisdom\nFind natural resources and support\n\nFor Our Team\nWe shift from monitoring to nurturing:\n\nCultivating circumstances for growth\nFinding and connecting with true mentors\nEnsuring principles are embodied not just understood\nUsing metrics to reflect rather than direct\nStarting with territory before consulting maps\n\nFor Partners\nRelationships deepen naturally:\n\nIntegration with meaning\nAuthentic value creation\nReality-based assessment\nNatural resource flow\n\nThe Path Forward\nSpecific Changes Required:\n\nProgram Focus: Start with direct relationship; Let technology support not lead; Measure after, not during; Build from real value\nBusiness Model: Simple, clear value proposition; Direct payment for real service; Natural growth from quality; Sustainable core practice\nAssessment Approach: Quality recognition first; Metrics for reflection; Natural feedback loops; Organic development\n\nPractical Experiments\nCome Alive Coaching\n\nStart with pro bono trials\nPartner with professional coaches\nDocument real transformation\nBuild from genuine results\n\nCore Practice Development\n\nIdentify our true craft\nFocus on direct value\nLet natural scale emerge\nTrust quality recognition\n\nRelationship Restructuring\n\nDirect connection with participants\nValue-based funding relationships\nCommunity of practice\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Technology Question\nInstead of forcing platform adoption, technology should:\n\nSupport human connection\nEnable natural processes\nDocument real value\nScale what works naturally\n\nThis means:\n\nSimpler tools\nDirect support of practice\nNatural integration\nOrganic growth\n\nMeasuring Success Differently\nSuccess looks like:\n\nReal transformation in participants\nSustainable value creation\nNatural resource flow\nCommunity growth\nQuality recognition development\n\nThis isn't abandoning scale but trusting that:\n\nQuality creates natural growth\nValue attracts resources\nBeauty spreads organically\nWisdom develops naturally\n\nThe key is starting with what's real and valuable, letting genuine craft guide our development rather than forcing growth through artificial means.\nPart V: The Path Forward - From Where We Are to Where We're Called\nBuilding from Strength\nLooking clearly at our work, we already have powerful elements aligned with this vision:\nWhat's Working:\n\nLearning Journeys: Custom assessment approach; Personal challenge identification; Individual growth paths\nCore Practices: Upside-down pyramid methodology; Starting with deeper why; Focus on wellbeing; Breaking out for connection; Relationship building\nCommunity Elements: Cohort connections; Mentor relationships; Peer learning; Reflective practice\n\nNecessary Shifts\nFrom Software-First to Human-First:\n\nTechnology supports don't leads\nCommunity precedes platform\nRelationship drives development\nReflection guides action\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning:\n\nRemove \"habits of success\" language\nShift from goals to emergence\nTransform assessment approach\nStart with territory, end with maps\n\nFrom Programs to Practice:\n\nCoaching as core offering\nDeep relationship building\nMaster-apprentice model\nNatural development paths\n\nPractical Next Steps\nImmediate Actions (1-3 months):\n\nLaunch pilot coaching program\nClean language/materials\nDocument current successes\nStart stakeholder conversations\n\nMedium Term (3-6 months):\n\nValidate \"Come Alive\" methodology\nDevelop new funding relationships\nCreate craft-based accelerator model\nBuild natural assessment approach\n\nLong Term Vision:\n\nBecome transmission line for wisdom\nCreate conditions for emergence\nEnable natural scale through quality\nBuild true mastery\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nFinding Aligned Partners:\n\nFoundations focused on practical spirituality\nFunders seeking systemic change\nPartners valuing depth over scale\nCommunities supporting transformation\n\nDemonstrating Value:\n\nShare success stories\nShow alternative models working\nDocument real transformation\nBuild evidence through practice\n\nCreating New Narratives:\n\nFrom scale to depth\nFrom metrics to meaning\nFrom control to emergence\nFrom programs to practice\n\nMeasures of Success\nIn 6 months we should see:\nValidated Methodology\n\nTested coaching approach\nClear value proposition\nNatural payment model\nDirect impact evidence\n\nTransformed Relationships\n\nDeeper mentor connections\nStronger community bonds\nAligned funding partners\nClear transmission lines\n\nNew Offerings\n\nCraft-based accelerator\nIntegrated technology support\nQuality-centered assessment\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Super Bloom Vision\nInstead of forcing growth, we cultivate conditions where:\n\nBeauty emerges naturally\nWisdom transfers clearly\nCommunity builds organically\nImpact flows naturally\n\nThis isn't slower - it's aligned with natural timing. Not smaller - but scaled through quality. Not less impactful - but transformative at the root.\nThe key is trusting that when we align with quality:\n\nRight relationships form\nResources flow naturally\nImpact emerges organically\nBeauty spreads naturally\n\nOur role becomes:\n\nCreating conditions\nSupporting emergence\nEnabling transmission\nTrusting quality\n\nThis is how we contribute to the super bloom - not by forcing growth but by planting seeds in fertile soil, tending with wisdom, and trusting the natural unfolding of beauty and impact.\nThree final questions:\n\nHow can we most effectively communicate this vision in a way that inspires stakeholders while addressing legitimate concerns around scale, evidence, and feasibility?\nWhat specific practices can we implement immediately to start embodying these principles in our day-to-day work, even before making larger structural changes?\nHow will we know we're on the right track? What signs of natural growth and alignment should we look for to validate that this approach is working?\n\nOverall, I believe this essay presents a compelling case for a fundamental shift in how we understand and pursue social impact. It grounds this vision in lived experience, offers concrete models and practices, and charts a path from current reality to future possibility.\nThe key will be translating these insights into aligned action - not as a new dogma but as an ongoing practice of wise participation. By staying true to what we already know, while daring to trust the deeper wisdom of quality, beauty, and natural unfolding, we can pioneer a new paradigm for social change.",

      "content": "Below is a **revised, expanded, and quote-rich version** of the essay. It integrates **more extensive discussions of craft**, provides **fuller paragraphs**, and weaves in **additional quotes** drawn from various traditions, thinkers, and examples already mentioned. Feel free to adapt lengths and sections as needed for your audience.\n\n---\n\n# **From Metrics to Meaning: A Personal Journey to Real Impact**\n\n> “The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”  \n> — Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n## **Part I: The Moment Everything Changed**\n\nI was in Los Angeles, attending a gathering where **Father Greg Boyle** spoke about his work with former gang members at **Homeboy Industries**. Someone asked about his impact metrics, his theory of change, his proof of concept. In response, he simply said:  \n> “They’re my friends.”  \n\nThat single line plunged me into a deep realization: **I** had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a means to an end. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but the *means* were often impersonal, hinged on chasing data-driven goals rather than forging authentic human connections. I suddenly felt the gap between **measurements** and **meaning**.\n\nUp to that point, I was traveling constantly—Lebanon, Iraq, Kenya, shifting from project to project with the unwavering question: **“Are we at scale yet?”** But Father Greg’s insistence on friendship woke me up to a deeper truth: real change depends on *authentic relationship*, not transactional exchange. It was time to stop the frantic hustle and take **root** in one place.\n\nI moved more permanently to Lebanon, driven less by strategy and more by **trusting a deeper calling**: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, folks living on the street—individuals I had previously (often unconsciously) categorized as “beneficiaries.” Where once I saw “targets,” I began to see **humans with full stories**. And that shift changed everything.\n\n> “If you cut corners, you’ll build a round house.”  \n> — (Caribbean Saying)\n\nThe corners I had been cutting were precisely the ones that required me to slow down, listen, and be present. By letting go of the mania for *vanity metrics*, I found not only **richer outcomes** but a more **meaningful way of living** and working.\n\n---\n\n## **Part II: The Crisis in Social Impact**\n\nDespite so many good intentions, the social impact sector often defaults to a **mechanistic**, **corporate** worldview. We fixate on data, scale, efficiency—admirable pursuits, but dangerous when they become the **only** lens of value.\n\n1. **Microfinance in India**: What started as a beacon of hope—tiny loans to empower the poor—escalated into an extractive system with **aggressive repayment** and **loan quotas**. Suicides soared as rural farmers, hounded over $100 debts, found themselves cornered by institutions supposedly there to help. We measured success in *repayment rates*, ignoring the **human cost**.\n\n2. **Refugee Job Programs**: Many large NGOs trumpet the number of refugees they’ve employed or trained. But **what happens** when those same refugees face existential threats outside the program’s scope? The “jobs created” metric looks fantastic; meanwhile, the deeper tapestry of human well-being goes unseen.\n\n3. **Disaster Relief “Efficiency”**: After Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, major NGOs deployed billions in aid, focusing on donor satisfaction, ROI, and visible results. Yet local wisdom was often sidelined; “cookie-cutter” houses crumbled quickly, resources were misallocated, and Haitian voices remained marginalized.\n\n> “You cannot wash blood with blood.”  \n> — (Indian Proverb)\n\nSo many of us in social impact have realized that **the tools of forced measurement and growth** often end up inflicting the same kind of harm we pledged to end. If our mindset is grounded in **extraction** and **disconnection**, no amount of “impact labeling” can mask the underlying breach of human relationship.\n\n---\n\n## **Part III: A Different Way of Seeing**\n\nIn halting my perpetual motion and laying down roots in Lebanon, I experienced another mode of operating—one where **relationship** supersedes “impact targets.” People no longer felt like data points; they were becoming genuine friends. As **Father Greg Boyle** says, *“We stand with the dispossessed until they are dispossessed no more.”* This kind of **being-with** is qualitatively different from a project-lens of “helping.”\n\n### **Restoring a Faculty We’ve Forgotten**\n\nModernity trains us to rely on external metrics—numbers, analytics, big data. Yet we also possess an **inner compass**—an ability to discern **beauty, rightness, and deep value**—that is often dismissed as “unscientific.” Philosophers, poets, and spiritual teachers across cultures have reminded us that *intuition and relational knowing* are no less real than metrics.\n\n- **Rumi** speaks of a heart-based perception that sees reality without filters:  \n  > “Close your eyes. Fall in love. Stay there.”  \n  A social enterprise that can “stay there”—in love with people’s stories rather than obsessed with spreadsheets—taps a truer kind of power.\n\n- **William Blake**’s admonition to “cleanse the doors of perception” resonates with the moment I let go of numbers-first. Doing so revealed the **full humanity** of the people I served.\n\n> “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”  \n> — Albert Einstein\n\n**Einstein’s** admonition cuts to the root: adopting corporate best practices without **shifting the underlying mindset** only replicates the same oppressive, extractive systems.\n\n---\n\n## **Part IV: Introducing the Craft Mindset**\n\n> “Craft means delighting in the process even as you aim for the outcome.”  \n\nWhen we consider **craft**, we envision artisans—woodworkers, potters, weavers—who invest **time**, **attention**, and **care** in the process. A craftsperson does not blindly force materials to fit a mold; rather, they *converse* with them, sensing possibilities and limitations.\n\n1. **Integrating Reason and Intuition**:  \n   - A potter measures clay consistency, but also “feels” when it’s right to shape it.  \n   - A blacksmith times the quench not by clock alone, but by the changing color of the metal.  \n   In **social impact**, an entrepreneur might measure finances, but also sense the intangible alignment of purpose, relationships, and community needs.\n\n2. **Deep Attention as Generosity**:  \n   - **Simone Weil** wrote, “Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.” In craft, giving genuine attention to each stroke or each seam transforms utility into art.  \n   - So too in social change: devoting time to an individual’s story or a community’s context fosters **trust and belonging**, intangible yet invaluable outcomes.\n\n3. **Lessons from The Gardener**:  \n   - Like a gardener, a craftsperson knows growth cannot be forced—only nurtured. *“You can’t grow flowers in poisoned soil.”* We must clean the soil (our worldview) first.  \n   - Social initiatives that act as “gardeners” cultivate conditions—networks, local leadership, shared resources—allowing resilience and healing to emerge organically.\n\n### **Embodiment of Craft in Organizations**\n\n- **Buurtzorg (Netherlands)**: Flattened hierarchies, trusting nurses to respond to patients without bureaucratic oversight. The result? *Better care, lower costs,* and sky-high satisfaction. Their “craft” was **patient-centered** nursing.  \n- **Barry-Wehmiller (USA)**: A manufacturing firm that invests in human dignity by listening to employees—particularly in times of crisis. They refused mass layoffs in 2008, opting for shared sacrifice of reduced hours. The intangible trust built among staff became a strategic advantage later.\n\n> “A crooked tree will never yield straight timber.”  \n> — (English Proverb)\n\nIf our “tree” is shaped by numbers alone, our outcomes will always bear that rigidity. By prioritizing craft, we re-center **human presence**, **wisdom**, and **quality**.\n\n---\n\n## **Part V: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing — Natural Models for Social Impact**\n\n### **1. The Wisdom of Gardens**\n\nA gardener **partners with nature** rather than dominating it. They test soil, observe climate, rotate crops. **This** is not passivity—on the contrary, it demands responsive, skillful engagement. But it **respects** the organic process of life rather than imposing quick fixes. In social impact, the “factory manager” might demand immediate results, while the “gardener” invests in relationships, community capacity, and local leadership—resulting in **natural resilience**.\n\n### **2. The Craft Way of Seeing**\n\n- **Quality Emerges from Relationship**: A boat at **Arlan’s Boat Works** isn’t just hammered together; it’s formed through *dialogue* between maker, wood, and the ocean environment for which it’s intended. The same principle applies to a social venture: real solutions emerge when the organization converses with community realities.\n- **Deep Material Understanding**: Traditional craft keeps knowledge alive through **apprenticeship** and **storytelling**. In social impact, that might mean older mentors passing on contextual wisdom, bridging generational gaps, and preserving local knowledge.\n\n> “What you build reflects how you build it.”  \n> — (Modern Saying)\n\n### **3. The Integration of Measurement and Meaning**\n\nCraft unites **quantitative** and **qualitative**. A carpenter uses a ruler but also trusts their hands. Similarly, a social enterprise may use dashboards but must also trust direct relational insight. **Metrics serve meaning**, not the other way around.\n\n### **4. Smooth Is Fast: The Paradox of Pace**\n\n> “Better maps don’t help if you’re heading in the wrong direction.”  \n\nRushing often leads to more errors and delays. In craft, haste can ruin an entire piece. In social impact, forced acceleration can create superficial programs, dependency, or burnout—slowing down our **true** progress. Sometimes, ironically, “smooth is fast.”\n\n---\n\n## **Part VI: The Craft Mindset at Bloom — From Platform to Practice**\n\n**Bloom** has long been known for its programs, accelerators, and coaching models. Yet we risk turning everything into a **data funnel** if we forget the craft behind it. Our real “product” isn’t an app or a pipeline; it’s the cultivation of **human insight and community relationship**.\n\n### **1. Rethinking Our Foundation**\n\n1. **Platform vs. Craft**:  \n   We used to assume software was the path to sustainability. But in a world swarmed by AI and automation, our true value may lie in the *high-touch*, *deeply relational* work that machines can’t replicate.\n\n2. **What We Really Offer**:  \n   - People love our **in-depth programs**.  \n   - Participants experience **deep transformations** and lasting connections.  \n   - We consistently see **real growth** emerge in entrepreneurs who find alignment with their deeper purpose.  \n\nLet’s trust that these intangible **sources of meaning** can guide how we design offerings, rather than forcibly engineering “tech engagement.”\n\n### **2. New Models for Our Work**\n\n- **For Entrepreneurs**:  \n  Instead of pushing platform metrics, create conditions for them to feel seen, develop self-knowledge, gain confidence, and recognize quality themselves.  \n- **For Our Team**:  \n  Shift from constant monitoring to *nurturing*. We can *cultivate relationships*, find true mentors, and measure outcomes lightly—*after* real value emerges.  \n- **For Partners**:  \n  Let relationships develop organically. Move away from funders who only want short-term “quick wins.” Seek those who appreciate depth, co-creation, and time-honored craft.\n\n### **3. Embracing the Craft Mindset in Practice**\n\n- **Come Alive Coaching**:  \n  Pilot a coaching program that starts with human connection, not project outcomes. Document transformations as stories first, then add numbers as a mirror, not a master.  \n- **Core Practice Development**:  \n  Identify our “true craft”—the intangible process of helping people find *their* alignment—and trust that real scale will follow genuine value.  \n- **Measuring Success Differently**:  \n  Look at indicators like “meaningful moments,” “strength of community ties,” or “flow of authentic conversation.” Notice how financial sustainability emerges as people *crave* that authentic approach.\n\n> “As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.”  \n> — (English Proverb)\n\nIf we bend our “twig” toward relationship, craft, and attention, the entire structure of Bloom—and its impact—will follow suit.\n\n---\n\n## **Part VII: The Road Ahead — A Call to Craft and Community**\n\n### **1. Building on Our Strengths**\n\n- **Learning Journeys** at Bloom: Already rooted in personal challenge and reflective practice.  \n- **Core Practices**: Focusing on deeper “why,” group well-being, and building genuine relationships.\n\n### **2. Necessary Shifts**\n\n- **From Software-First to Human-First**: Technology assists, but doesn’t lead.  \n- **From Metrics to Meaning**: We measure after we sense the territory. *“Start with territory, end with maps.”*  \n- **From Programs to Practice**: Adopt a master-apprentice model, continuous coaching, and relational development.\n\n### **3. Practical Experiments**\n\n- **Pilot Coaching Program**: Give it a 1–3 month run. Document actual, lived transformations rather than cherry-picking data.  \n- **Core Practice Development**: Clarify Bloom’s “craft identity”—be explicit about the intangible relational dimension.  \n- **Relationship Restructuring**: Engage funders who respect *depth over scale*. Nurture “communities of practice,” not just “participants.”\n\n### **4. Measuring Success Differently**\n\nWe still measure but do so in service to **beauty, meaning, and alignment**:\n\n- **Real transformation** in participants (personal stories, testimonies).  \n- **Natural resource flow** (people find the resources they need organically).  \n- **Quality recognition development** (a culture that senses rightness before analyzing it).  \n\n> “The spirit in which you give is more important than the gift itself.”  \n> — (African Proverb)\n\n---\n\n## **Part VIII: Choosing Beauty Over Scale — The Super Bloom Vision**\n\nInstead of forcing growth, let us **nurture the soil**: trust that when we align with **quality**, the fruits will come naturally. This doesn’t mean moving more slowly; it means *moving more truly*, akin to how a seasoned musician plays with both precision and emotion.\n\n> “You can’t fix a broken system with broken tools.”  \n> — (Modern Saying)\n\nWe must lay aside the master’s tools of extraction and control, choosing instead the way of the **gardener** and the **craftsperson**:\n\n1. **Creating Conditions**: Tilling the soil, providing the water, letting the seed sprout at its own pace.  \n2. **Supporting Emergence**: Encouraging local leadership and community-led designs.  \n3. **Enabling Transmission**: Passing along wisdom as a living tradition, rather than bureaucratic manuals.  \n4. **Trusting Quality**: Believing that deeper relationships and care ultimately yield real social impact—and yes, *natural scale*.\n\n**This** is how we contribute to a “super bloom,” not by acceleration alone, but by *consistency, attentiveness, and relational depth*. In the final analysis, metrics can be a helpful tool—but **they should never override the craft of being human together**.\n\n> “What you build reflects how you build it.”  \n\nWhen we center on **craft, relationship, and the quiet power of meaning**, we build organizations where **beauty emerges naturally**, resources flow, and impact unfolds in ways that no forced “scaling plan” can replicate. This isn’t wishful thinking; it’s the lived experience of those who have dared to trust authenticity over superficial metrics.\n\n---\n\n### **Three Final Questions**\n\n1. **Communicating the Vision**: How do we inspire funders, partners, and stakeholders who still fixate on scale or ROI? Can we invite them into the *experience*—not just the report—of human-centered impact?\n\n2. **Immediate Practices**: How do we begin living this craft-mindset now—within existing programs or tight funding cycles? Can we set small “presence circles” or pilot new coaching models to demonstrate proof of concept?\n\n3. **Signs of Growth**: What are the intangible “leading indicators” of real, human-centered success? (e.g., safer communities, deeper friendships, more creative responses in crises.)\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: A Renewed Paradigm for Social Change**\n\n> “They’re my friends.”  \n> — Father Greg Boyle\n\nFor me, Father Greg’s words were a doorway to a **new paradigm**—one in which metrics still exist, but only to reflect **real transformation** rather than define it. We see this same spirit in **craft**, where the potter’s care for each line and curve matters just as much as the final vessel.\n\nLet us **dare to trust** the deeper faculty of direct perception. Let us **honor** the intangible resources—quality, presence, friendship—as the true bedrock of social change. And let us **listen** to the wisdom from so many cultures and proverbs reminding us that *how* we plant the seeds determines *what* ultimately grows.\n\nBy blending **measurement** with **meaning**, technology with **touch**, and quantity with **quality**, we stand to create not just “impactful programs,” but an entirely different world—one where dignity, relationship, and care are not afterthoughts, but the very foundation of our collective flourishing.\n\n> “As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.”  \n> — (English Proverb)\n\nMay we bend our organizational “twig” towards craft, compassion, and authentic connection—and watch as the entire forest of social impact grows in ways more beautiful and enduring than any metric can fully capture.",

      "content": "Below is a **rewritten, long-form essay** that weaves together the metaphors of **craft** and **gardening** (“crafting a garden”), references **Father Greg Boyle’s** story from the *On Being* podcast, and directly addresses the **genocide in Palestine** (rather than hinting at it). It is designed to be both **narrative** and **reflective**, giving readers time to settle into each section, consider stories, and connect with the deeper arguments. This version trims the number of direct quotes but preserves a few impactful ones. Finally, it’s been critiqued and reshaped with an eye toward **storytelling** strategies often used by authors like **Malcolm Gladwell**, while staying true to your personal context and voice.\n\n---\n\n# **From Metrics to Meaning: Crafting a Garden of Real Impact**\n\n> “The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”  \n> —Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n## **Part I: The Moment That Changed Everything**\n\nA few years ago, I was listening to the *On Being* podcast when I first encountered **Father Greg Boyle’s** story about **Homeboy Industries**—the largest gang rehabilitation program in the world. Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg for his metrics, his method, his proof that lives were truly changing. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:  \n> “They’re my friends.”\n\nIt was a moment that **upended my understanding** of social impact. I’d been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for “scaling impact”—always with an eye on the next pilot or next data set. Yet here was Father Greg, a man who’d transformed countless lives, insisting that **friendship** lay at the heart of change, more than metrics or theories of impact.\n\nI felt a shock of recognition, like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in my pursuit of *“doing good,”* I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new “success” story. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn’t **rooting**. That single line—“They’re my friends”—pierced me with its radical simplicity.  \n\nAnd so I made a choice: rather than continuing my peripatetic rounds, I would anchor myself where I was needed. I put down deeper roots in Lebanon. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised **relationship**—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. In stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of **human connection** over data.\n\n---\n\n## **Part II: The Crisis in Social Impact**\n\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a **wider crisis** pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase **scale and efficiency**, they often **instrumentalize** people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change.\n\n1. **Neoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong**  \n   - **Microfinance** soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as it ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas. In India, farmers burdened by micro-debts faced **harassment** and, tragically, **suicides**. The metric—repayment rate—became more important than any relational approach to poverty.\n\n2. **Ignoring Genocide While Creating Jobs**  \n   - A stark example is the ongoing **genocide in Palestine**. International agencies pour resources into “job creation” for Palestinian refugees, touting how many short-term positions are funded or how many training certificates distributed. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is **systemically downplayed**—overshadowed by a tidy “jobs for refugees” success statistic. The raw metric of “employment rates” doesn’t speak to generational trauma, land theft, or the dismantling of entire communities.  \n   - In focusing on short-term numeric “impact,” we often fail to address—or even openly name—root injustices.\n\n3. **Cookie-Cutter Approaches to Crises**  \n   - Following natural disasters—like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti—major NGOs rushed to build houses and infrastructure, guided by **ROI** and **donor satisfaction**. Many solutions fell apart due to minimal community input. A house built *for* people—rather than *with* them—ignores local wisdom and fosters dependency rather than resilience.\n\nThroughout it all, we chase metrics: **jobs created, houses built, tests passed, repayment rates achieved.** We pride ourselves on scaling up “solutions.” Yet in conversation after conversation, I hear **deep unease**: a sense that behind the well-polished data, we are repeating the same logic of control and extraction that caused these crises in the first place.\n\n---\n\n## **Part III: A Different Way of Seeing**\n\n**Father Greg’s** statement—“They’re my friends”—wasn’t just a warm sentiment. It was a **radical critique** of the mechanistic worldview that sees people as “beneficiaries,” “stakeholders,” or “target populations.” Friendship implies **presence** and **empathy**, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\n\n### **Stereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open**\n\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use **only one eye**: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose the **other eye**—the one that perceives **intangible depth**, emotional truth, moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide **stereoscopic vision**, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in flat outlines, easily manipulated.\n\n- **Eye One (Metrics and Tools)**: We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.  \n- **Eye Two (Meaning and Relationship)**: This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that **calling out genocide** might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n\n> “Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”  \n> —(Paraphrased concept)\n\n---\n\n## **Part IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact**\n\nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: **“craft”** and **“gardening.”** Lately, I’ve combined them into “crafting a garden,” which captures the delicate balance between **artistry** and **cultivation**—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n\n### **1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea**\n\nWhen you **craft** something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You have an intuitive sense of when the clay yields and how it wants to form. You measure, but you also *feel*. Similarly, a **gardener** sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You cannot *force* a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\n\n**Crafting a garden** merges these ideas: we pay **reverent attention** to every interaction (the “craft” side), while **recognizing natural growth cycles** (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n\n### **2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic**\n\n- **Factory Mindset**: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.  \n- **Garden-Craft Mindset**: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\n\nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of **community trust**. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n\n### **3. Lessons from Craftsmanship**\n\nA **craftsperson** understands:\n\n1. **Attentiveness**: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.  \n2. **Timing and Rhythm**: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, a sense of **readiness** is as crucial as speed.  \n3. **Embrace of Imperfection**: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\n\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we’re letting them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\n\n---\n\n## **Part V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”**\n\nLet’s face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a “**faster, cheaper, bigger**” approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—**now**. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\n\n- **Genocide in Palestine**: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.  \n- **Post-Disaster Reconstruction**: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\n\nA gardener doesn’t **force** the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is conducive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\n\n### **Sustaining Long-Term Flourishing**\n\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—**we plant seeds** that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts.\n\n---\n\n## **Part VI: My OnBeing Encounter and the Power of Story**\n\nIt wasn’t just Father Greg’s words that struck me; it was the entire ethos of the *On Being* podcast. The show invites guests who embody **spiritual depth** and **relational insight**. Listening to these interviews, I realized that much of modern philanthropic discourse is **missing** that deeper reflection. We speak of “empowering communities” yet rarely talk about our **inward** transformation or the **spiritual** dimension of care.\n\n**Malcolm Gladwell**, in his storytelling style, often uses **vivid anecdotes** to reveal systemic truths. He unpacks data or phenomena by **zooming in** on a single individual’s story. Reflecting on that approach, I see how we can integrate personal narratives—like my own shift after hearing Father Greg—and use them to highlight the deeper, universal principle:\n\n**Authentic friendship, rooted presence, and moral clarity** do more for social transformation than any set of metrics alone.\n\n---\n\n## **Part VII: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work**\n\nI co-run programs that aim to help people rediscover meaning in work and life. At times, we used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. But gradually, we began adopting the **crafting-a-garden** approach:\n\n1. **Preparing the Soil (Community Readiness)**  \n   - Instead of imposing solutions, we spend time **listening**. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have **conversations**, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.\n\n2. **Planting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)**  \n   - We collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—**we craft** the shape together.\n\n3. **Tending the Garden (Sustained Support)**  \n   - Like a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain **ongoing** relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.\n\n4. **Harvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)**  \n   - Of course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics **follow** the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather **stories**, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\n\n### **On the Edge of True Impact**\n\nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight—especially not massive, systemic horrors like genocide. But we *can* stand with communities in a **lifelong** posture of solidarity. We *can* name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\n\n---\n\n## **Part VIII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm**\n\nSo how do we shift from metrics mania to **crafting a garden**?\n\n1. **Practice Stereoscopic Vision**  \n   - Keep your metrics if they help you see part of reality. But **never** lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees injustice, trauma, and possibilities for friendship.\n\n2. **Name Reality Clearly**  \n   - Avoid euphemisms. If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance turns exploitative, say so openly. Authentic relationships thrive on honesty, not polite obfuscation.\n\n3. **Slow Down to Go Deeper**  \n   - Slowing the pace allows you to “listen to the clay,” to sense a community’s soul. Rushing might create short-term outputs but often yields shallow or harmful outcomes.\n\n4. **Trust the Process of Craft**  \n   - Accept that not everything can be a linear blueprint. Gardening has seasons; some seeds fail. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks. This is growth, not a series of guaranteed leaps.\n\n5. **Adopt the Gardener’s Long View**  \n   - A gardener invests in the soil, knowing real harvests may come years later—or bless future generations. In social impact, facing crises that range from genocide to climate disasters, we must hold a **long-range** vision. Even small acts of genuine friendship can ripple beyond our immediate horizon.\n\n---\n\n### **A Moment for Reflection**\n\n- **What tension do you feel when pressured for quick results?**  \n- **Which relationships in your work might you deepen rather than “scale”?**  \n- **Where might you stand in truth—calling out systemic violence or injustice—rather than quietly conforming to funder-friendly narratives?**\n\nAsking these questions is an act of **reclaiming our second eye**—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden**\n\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—“They’re my friends”—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that **relationship** can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\n\n**Crafting a garden** of social impact means:\n\n- Tending relationships like precious seedlings.  \n- Using skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions **with** communities.  \n- Naming—and resisting—systemic atrocities like the genocide in Palestine, rather than burying them in shallow metrics.  \n\nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that truly **integrates** rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—**we** simply refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of **stereoscopic vision**—two ways of seeing that yield a deeper perception of reality.\n\nIn the end, what we **grow**—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We may witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or a donor report existed. We may craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly **come alive**.\n\nAnd that, I believe, is what *real* impact looks like.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\nWhen we stand next to someone—whether a refugee, a farmer crushed by debt, or a family in Palestine facing daily violence—and say, “You are not my data point; you are my friend,” we enact the very transformation we hope to see in the world. We show that **life** isn’t a mechanical series of inputs and outputs, but a shared tapestry of stories, joys, and struggles.  \n\nMay we all become **craftspeople** and **gardeners** of this new paradigm—human beings who measure thoughtfully but love wholeheartedly, who plant seeds of change with skilled hands and open hearts, cultivating relationships that outlast any spreadsheet.",

The clarity finally came through stories of beauty and meaning - like when I heard Father Greg Boyle explain his work with gang members not through impact metrics but simply because \"they're my friends.\" This pointed toward a way of being that wasn't instrumental, that was beautiful, that I wanted to experience for myself.\n\n## The Crisis I'm Seeing\n\nI've felt increasing frustration and anger when not able to express meaningful ways of being at work. I was stifled from connecting deeply with teams, watching us build systems that were dead on arrival because they never had soul in them in the first place - designed from goal setting, ambition, funder interest, and requirements for tracking rather than authentic experiments and connection with people and true care for their inner lives.\n\nMy inability to articulate these feelings led me to be passive, silent, frustrated, small. This led to increasing anger, mostly with myself for not being clear about what was frustrating me about what Bloom was building. I wasn't brave enough. I felt social pressure to conform, thinking about the team not wanting to show divided leadership, wanting to \"keep things afloat.\" I allowed my doubt (maybe I'm wrong) to squish my growing tension and feeling that we're going the wrong way.\n\n## Moments of Clarity\n\nThe contrast became clearest in Dubai. I'll never forget Marie Claire talking about how women need tampons and a space to talk about feminine hygiene, sharing her journey into realizing this for herself and solving it for other women. Going from school to school installing dispensers, finding a way out of thin air, using waste material from agriculture to produce cheaper tampons, finding funding, creating accessibility. It wasn't just making things - it was establishing spaces to talk about things considered shameful in her society.\n\nIt was all so beautiful - seeing her gratitude, feeling like we were part of helping her find a community of supportive women, all surrounding her and crying too, each bearing gifts for each other, sharing hugs and smiles. It was wonderful.\n\nBut then I'd feel the system pulling against aliveness in our Bloom meetings, drawing hockey stick charts about our growth while NO ONE was using the platform. This wishful thinking, disconnection from reality, and fear (fear of realizing we built the wrong thing, fear that we wasted our savings, fear that we're so close to getting it right) led us to keep going. It was wrong. I knew it was wrong, yet I couldn't stop the train.\n\n## My Own Pattern\n\nI see this in myself too - I'm a hacker who builds first and connects second, knowing there's nothing alive in there. Just today I built a meaning expression app because technology is cool and because I can, somehow thinking if I build it it means I'm good enough to share something \"valuable\" because people like software. But no one used it. I didn't even share it, because part of me knows it was just a toy.\n\nI hyperfixate on code and underfixate on things that bring me to life. I brought this to Bloom by building assessment-to-practices tools while doing less and less of what I love most - being with teams, talking, helping them navigate and see.\n\n## A Different Way Forward\n\nI've had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading \"Winners Take All\" and realizing that what we're doing isn't what we're talking about. We're not saving the world - we're helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency. We're not even really helping them establish financially successful exponential businesses, because we don't embody that. We embody something that matters to many, yet we're not clear about that. Instead, we pretend to sell other things, and that tension hurts.\n\nThis isn't abstract theory - there are organizations showing a different way forward. Look at Buurtzorg in the Netherlands, where they eliminated all management and metrics-based control, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country. Or Sounds True, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\n\nThese aren't just nice stories - they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that honors quality recognition and craft. When I say craft, I don't just mean artisanal products. I mean any work that:\n- Develops through direct relationship and apprenticeship\n- Values mastery and depth alongside innovation\n- Creates containers for meaningful work to emerge\n- Trusts people's natural capacity to recognize quality\n\n## What This Could Mean for Bloom\n\nInstead of our current approach - dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools - we could build like craftspeople:\n\n1. From Programs to Practice Spaces:\n- Replace fixed curriculum with living apprenticeship\n- Create conditions for natural emergence\n- Support direct transmission of wisdom\n- Let timing follow organic development\n\n2. From Metrics to Meaning:\n- Stop forcing impact numbers that don't reflect reality\n- Start measuring meaningful moments and real relationships\n- Track how quality recognition develops\n- Notice where authentic community forms\n\n3. From Tools to Relationships:\n- Build technology only when we have to\n- Start with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out\n- Only add systems when the human work demands it\n- Let tools serve connection, not replace it\n\nI know this sounds risky in the social impact space. But I'm increasingly convinced that the \"factory farm\" mindset - maxing out growth, chasing big donor checks, compressing meaning into bullet points - cannot sustain the life we want, nor the dignity we say we value. We've seen glimpses of a better way.\n\n## An Experiment Worth Trying\n\nWhat if we started small:\n\n1. Finding Our Masters:\n- Identify people who embody this way of working\n- Create spaces for direct transmission\n- Build real apprenticeship relationships\n- Trust natural development\n\n2. Creating Practice Spaces:\n- Replace workshops with \"craft circles\"\n- Focus on direct experience and feedback\n- Allow natural emergence of skills and wisdom\n- Support authentic community building\n\n3. New Ways of Measuring:\n- Track quality recognition development\n- Document wisdom transmission\n- Notice where real community forms\n- See what emerges naturally\n\n## The Deeper Vision\n\nThis isn't just about better programs - it's about acknowledging that real impact emerges when we create conditions for people to recognize and act from quality. Like a good gardener uses soil tests not to control but to support natural growth, we need systems that enhance rather than replace our capacity to recognize and act from quality.\n\nI know this is a big shift. But watching entrepreneurs like Marie Claire, seeing what happens when we trust people's natural movement toward beauty, I'm convinced this is the direction we need to explore.\n\nWould you be open to experimenting with this approach in our next accelerator cycle? Even a small pilot could help us learn what's possible when we trust this deeper way of working.\n\n## On Technology and Tools\n\nI realize I'm part of this pattern - as a hacker, I keep building things first and connecting second. But what if instead we:\n- Only build tools when human connection demands it\n- Start with calling people, figuring things out together\n- Use technology to enhance relationship, not replace it\n- Let systems emerge from real needs\n\nTechnology should serve the craft, not direct it. Like how a good craftsperson's tools enhance their connection to the material rather than separating them from it.\n\n## On Scale and Growth\n\nWe keep drawing hockey stick charts but maybe there's a different way to think about scale:\n- Through depth not just breadth\n- Through wisdom not just metrics\n- Through quality not just quantity\n- Through relationship not just systems\n\nLook at Buurtzorg - they spread to 25 countries not through traditional scaling strategies but through the natural spread of a better way of working. Or traditional craft villages that sustained communities for generations through apprenticeship and direct transmission.\n\n## What I'm Really Proposing\n\nI think what I'm really suggesting is that we need to:\n1. Trust quality recognition first - let people's natural capacity to see what's beautiful and true guide the work\n2. Build like gardeners - create conditions rather than forcing outcomes\n3. Learn through craft - develop through relationship and practice\n4. Measure what serves beauty - let metrics follow meaning, not replace it\n\n## The Hard Questions\n\nI know this raises challenging questions:\n- How do we stay financially sustainable?\n- What do we tell funders who want traditional metrics?\n- How do we know if we're succeeding?\n\nBut maybe these questions come from the same mindset we're trying to shift. What if instead we asked:\n- How do we create something so meaningful people naturally want to support it?\n- What if we found funders who understand this deeper approach?\n- What if success was measured by the quality of transformation we enable?\n\n## A Personal Note\n\nI know this has been a long letter, and maybe it sounds idealistic. But I'm tired of shrinking myself, of not speaking what I know to be true. I've watched real transformation happen when we trust people's capacity to recognize and move toward quality. I've seen it in Dubai, in our best moments with teams, in organizations like Buurtzorg and Sounds True.\n\nWhat if Bloom could be a pioneer in this different way of working? Not just another accelerator pushing metrics and growth, but a space where people learn to trust their quality recognition, develop real mastery, and create lasting impact through authentic relationship.\n\nI'd love to explore this together - to start small, experiment, and see what emerges when we trust this deeper way of working.\n\nWith hope and conviction,\nBilal\n\n## Concrete Examples of This Approach\n\nLet me share some examples that show this isn't just theory:\n\n1. Sounds True publishing - they built success by honoring both quality and practicality. When publishers rejected spirituality books as too niche, they built direct relationships with authors and customers. They let wisdom guide business decisions while staying financially sound. This shows how trusting deeper perception creates new possibilities.\n\n2. Buurtzorg's healthcare - they eliminated management hierarchies and trust nurses to make decisions. Instead of metrics controlling care, they let natural care relationships guide the work. They prove that trusting human quality recognition creates better outcomes at lower costs.\n\n3. Traditional craft networks - look at how Jaipur Rugs connects 40,000 artisans in ways that preserve craft knowledge while creating sustainable livelihoods. They show how craft thinking can scale through relationship rather than control.\n\n## A Practical Path Forward for Bloom\n\nHere's how we could start experimenting with this approach:\n\n1. Start with a Small Pilot\n- Choose 5-10 entrepreneurs who resonate with this approach\n- Focus on quality recognition over traditional metrics\n- Document the journey through stories and direct observation\n- Let natural patterns of success emerge\n\n2. Change How We Work with Teams\n- Replace \"mentor speed dating\" with real apprenticeship relationships\n- Create spaces for authentic sharing like we saw in Dubai\n- Trust emergence over forced outcomes\n- Support natural community formation\n\n3. Shift Our Measurement Approach\n- Track moments of meaningful connection\n- Document authentic growth and development\n- Notice where natural community forms\n- See what emerges when we trust the process\n\n4. Transform Our Technology Use\n- Only build tools when human connection demands it\n- Start with direct calls and relationships\n- Let systems emerge from real needs\n- Use technology to enhance connection, not replace it\n\n## First Steps We Could Take Tomorrow\n\n1. With Current Teams:\n- Have honest conversations about what's actually meaningful in their work\n- Create more spaces for authentic sharing like we saw in Dubai\n- Support natural connections rather than forced networking\n- Document real stories instead of just metrics\n\n2. With Our Programs:\n- Shift from workshops to \"craft circles\" where real learning happens\n- Create more space for direct transmission of wisdom\n- Support organic community formation\n- Let natural timing guide development\n\n3. With Our Technology:\n- Pause new platform development\n- Focus on direct relationship building\n- Only add tools when truly needed\n- Let systems serve connection\n\n## Next Conversation\n\nI know this is a lot to take in. Maybe we could:\n1. Share this with our core team and hear their responses\n2. Pick one small aspect to experiment with\n3. Document what emerges when we trust this process\n4. Learn together what's possible\n\nWhat I'm really suggesting is that we've been trying to build a garden by focusing on measurement tools rather than understanding the soil and plants. Maybe it's time to become gardeners first, and let the tools serve that deeper understanding.\n\nWith hope for what we might grow together,\nBilal\n\n## What This Looks Like in Practice\n\nLet me share what I've seen work and what I've seen fail:\n\nIn Dubai, watching Marie Claire work on feminine hygiene - it wasn't just about the products or metrics. She created spaces for women to discuss what was considered shameful, used agricultural waste to make affordable tampons, built real community. Every aspect emerged from deep care and connection. The tears and hugs in that room showed what's possible when we trust people's natural movement toward what matters.\n\nContrast this with our own platform development - drawing hockey stick charts while no one was using the tools. I've been part of this problem, hyperfixating on code, building assessment tools instead of deepening relationships. It's easier to build another feature than to sit with the uncomfortable truth that maybe we're avoiding the real work.\n\n## Organizations Showing A Different Way\n\nLook at Buurtzorg in healthcare. They eliminated management hierarchies and metrics-based control. Instead of forcing nurses to follow protocols, they trust their direct perception of what patients need. The result? Better care, lower costs, happier workers. They spread to 25 countries not through forced scaling but because the model works.\n\nOr Sounds True in publishing - they built a $60M company by trusting both business sense and deeper wisdom. When publishers said spirituality books wouldn't sell, they built direct relationships with authors and readers. They proved you can be successful by honoring what rings true.\n\nEven in traditional manufacturing, Barry-Wehmiller shows what's possible. During the 2008 recession, instead of layoffs, everyone took shorter hours together. They treated people like family, trusted human dignity over short-term profits. They emerged stronger and more connected.\n\n## Our Own Moments of Truth\n\nI keep thinking about our retreat experiences - when we stepped away from dashboards and metrics, real connection happened. People shared their struggles, their hopes, what actually mattered to them. That's when we saw real transformation.\n\nBut then we'd go back to our regular programming - mentor speed dating, pitch practice, growth projections. We were teaching people to perform impact rather than create it. I stayed quiet about this too long, thinking maybe we needed this tension, maybe I was wrong.\n\n## A Different Path Forward\n\nWhat if instead we:\n\n1. Started with Real Connection\n- More retreats where people can be authentic\n- Less pitch practice, more story sharing\n- Support for actual relationship building\n- Space for natural community formation\n\n2. Changed Our Success Measures\n- Track meaningful moments like Marie Claire's story\n- Document where real community forms\n- Notice when people find their authentic work\n- Let natural growth patterns emerge\n\n3. Used Technology Differently\n- Only build tools when human connection demands it\n- Start with direct calls and relationships\n- Let systems emerge from real needs\n- Support connection, don't replace it\n\n## Small Experiments We Could Try\n\n1. With Current Teams:\n- Create more spaces for authentic sharing\n- Support natural connections over forced networking\n- Document real stories instead of just metrics\n- Let timing follow organic development\n\n2. With Our Programs:\n- Replace workshops with \"craft circles\"\n- Enable direct learning relationships\n- Support emergent community\n- Trust natural development cycles\n\n3. With Our Technology:\n- Pause platform development\n- Focus on direct relationship building\n- Only add tools when truly needed\n- Let systems serve connection\n\n## The Bigger Vision\n\nThis isn't just about better programs - it's about acknowledging what we've seen work. Every powerful moment at Bloom came from authentic connection and trust, not from perfect metrics or platforms.\n\nI know this feels risky. But watching entrepreneurs like Marie Claire, seeing what emerges when we trust people's capacity to recognize and move toward quality, I'm convinced this is the direction we need to explore.\n\nWould you be open to trying even a small experiment in this direction? We could start with just a few entrepreneurs, create more retreat-like spaces, document what emerges when we trust this process.\n\n## Success at Every Step\n\nI've been thinking about what Father Greg Boyle taught me about doing things because people are our friends, not for some future impact. When they asked his intentions for his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends in themselves, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify.\n\nThis made me realize we've got success backwards. We keep planning for future impact, drawing hockey stick charts, setting goals - but what if success isn't about reaching some future state? What if it's about being successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\n\nThink about a food forest versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, every moment is successful - even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. The food forest isn't waiting for the apples; it's alive and successful in every moment.\n\n## Quality in the Age of AI\n\nThis becomes even more crucial as AI develops. I keep building software because it's cool and because I can, somehow thinking if I build it, it means I'm good enough to share something \"valuable.\" But here's what I've realized: AI can digest all of the output and quantity, but not any of the quality. Automation is something we would never want to give to anything that brings us a source of meaning.\n\nWhen we craft a life we want to live (and I use that word craft very literally and explicitly here), we're touching things that are meaningful for us in ways that are impossible to even articulate because they're infinite and vast and beyond our ability to put into words. We need to experience them and know them and see them as sources of guidance, but we can't teach this to AI.\n\nAI is not going to be moral. It's going to require us to stay connected to that sense we have, that qualitative sense that is impossible to bring into the AI. Sure, AI can pattern match, but it can't recognize quality. It can support but not replace our human capacity to recognize what's beautiful and true.\n\nThis is why I'm increasingly skeptical of platforms and tools that promise to scale impact. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage instead of leaning into the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\nLook at Buurtzorg again - they achieved scale not through automation but through relationship. Or traditional craft communities that sustained themselves for generations not through efficiency but through direct transmission of wisdom. They show us that real scale comes through depth, not just breadth.\n\n## What This Means for Our Work\n\nThis changes everything about how we approach social impact:\n\n1. Stop trying to automate relationship\n- Real connection can't be scaled through platforms\n- Quality recognition requires human presence\n- Let technology serve connection, not replace it\n\n2. Focus on depth over breadth\n- Better to work deeply with few than superficially with many\n- Trust that quality spreads naturally\n- Let impact emerge from meaning\n\n3. Measure what matters\n- Track moments of real connection\n- Notice where quality recognition develops\n- Document authentic transformation\n- Let patterns emerge naturally\n\nThe future isn't in better automation or control systems - it's in better supporting our natural capacity to recognize and move toward what's beautiful and true. Everything else follows from that.\n\n## Fear and Beauty\n\nI understand now that what held me back wasn't just doubt - it was fear. Like when I couldn't say \"I love you\" because I asked for definitions instead of trusting what I knew in my heart. I let my doubt (maybe I'm wrong) squish my growing tension, thinking it was just a mood or emotion rather than a legitimate knowing.\n\nWe do this institutionally too. We're afraid of not getting funding, afraid of looking unprofessional, afraid of trusting people's natural capacity for quality. So we create systems of control, endless metrics, \"objective\" measures. But these fears block us from the very thing we're trying to create - meaningful impact that actually transforms lives.\n\nOur emotions aren't the enemy here - they're messengers. Each tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. When we feel sad seeing animals going extinct, or frustrated with meaningless metrics, these emotions are treasures pointing us toward what matters.\n\n## The Economics of Aliveness\n\nThis leads me to think about indigenous economics - talking about cyclical time (not linear), thinking seven generations ahead (not retiring when I'm 40), building relationships with a world of meaning (not treating humans and nature as resources to extract). These aren't just nice ideas - they're proven ways of creating sustainable value.\n\nOur neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is hard to argue with. Market efficiency sort of works, as does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core. We can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy, resources, and food—all commodities—which the markets manage. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy-sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short-sighted efficiency of materiality.\n\nWhat if instead of measuring:\n- Platform engagement\n- Growth projections\n- Impact metrics\n- Resource utilization\n\nWe measured:\n- Moments of meaning\n- Quality of relationships\n- Wisdom transmission\n- Community vitality\n\nWhat if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone?\n\n## A New Way of Valuing Work\n\nThis isn't just idealistic - organizations are already showing it works:\n\n1. Craft Enterprises\nLook at Heath Ceramics or other craft-based businesses. They measure success by:\n- Quality of relationships\n- Depth of skill development\n- Community impact\n- Cultural preservation\nAnd they're financially sustainable while doing it.\n\n2. Living Organizations\nBuurtzorg again shows us that when we trust people's capacity to recognize quality:\n- Costs go down naturally\n- Care improves authentically\n- Community strengthens organically\n- Value emerges sustainably\n\n3. Indigenous Businesses\nTraditional markets and craft communities have sustained themselves for generations through:\n- Direct relationships\n- Quality recognition\n- Wisdom transmission\n- Natural sustainability\n\n## What This Means for Bloom\n\nI think we need to:\n\n1. Stop measuring what doesn't matter\n- Less focus on platform metrics\n- More attention to real transformation\n- Trust emergence over control\n\n2. Start measuring what does\n- Quality of relationships\n- Depth of learning\n- Community formation\n- Wisdom transmission\n\n3. Create conditions for aliveness\n- Support natural development\n- Enable real relationships\n- Trust organic growth\n- Foster quality recognition\n\nI know this sounds like a big shift. But I'm tired of pretending we're saving the world when what we're really doing - helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency - is actually more beautiful and valuable than our metrics suggest.\n\n## How Fear Blocks Our Seeing\n\nLet me be more specific about how fear blocks us from seeing quality:\n\nIn my own journey, I see it clearly now - when I couldn't tell that woman I loved her because I was afraid of going against my family's expectations, afraid of confronting questions about faith and tradition. Instead of taking a deep breath and looking in my heart for truth, I deflected. I asked for definitions. I created confusion in my life and compounded that confusion for years.\n\nI see the same pattern in our work at Bloom:\n- Fear of failure makes us draw hockey stick charts instead of facing reality\n- Fear of looking unprofessional makes us create unnecessary metrics\n- Fear of losing funding makes us pretend to be what we're not\n- Fear of uncertainty makes us build platforms no one needs\n\nIt's like we're all playing a game of \"looking good\" instead of doing good. We're afraid to say \"I don't know\" or \"let's try something different\" or \"maybe we built the wrong thing.\" So we keep pushing ahead with systems and metrics that don't serve life.\n\n## Indigenous Economics Reimagined\n\nWhen I talk about indigenous economics, I'm not suggesting we all need to take their principles directly. We need to discover these principles ourselves in our own indigeneity - our Lebanese indigenous economics - emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality.\n\nThis means:\n- Cyclical time: Understanding success happens in every moment, not just at exit\n- Seven generations thinking: Building for real sustainability, not quick wins\n- Relationship with meaning: Seeing resources as living participants, not just materials\n- Local wisdom: Trusting community knowledge over abstract metrics\n\nLook at traditional craft villages - they sustained communities for generations without:\n- Growth projections\n- Efficiency metrics\n- Resource optimization\n- Scale strategies\n\nInstead they focused on:\n- Direct relationships\n- Quality transmission\n- Community vitality\n- Natural sustainability\n\n## Making Measurement Serve Life\n\nHere's what this could look like practically at Bloom:\n\nInstead of measuring:\n1. Platform engagement\n- Daily active users\n- Time on site\n- Feature adoption\n- User journey metrics\n\n2. Growth metrics\n- Month-over-month growth\n- Market penetration\n- Scale factors\n- Revenue projections\n\n3. Impact numbers\n- People reached\n- Resources deployed\n- Problems \"solved\"\n- Efficiency gains\n\nWe could measure:\n1. Quality Recognition\n- Moments of meaningful insight\n- Quality of decision making\n- Depth of understanding\n- Natural wisdom emergence\n\n2. Relationship Depth\n- Authentic connections formed\n- Knowledge transmission quality\n- Community formation patterns\n- Trust development\n\n3. Living Impact\n- Real transformation stories\n- Community vitality signs\n- Cultural preservation\n- Natural sustainability patterns\n\nThe key isn't just changing what we measure, but how we measure:\n- Through direct relationship not just data\n- Through story not just metrics\n- Through observation not just tracking\n- Through community not just systems\n\n## A Different Kind of Economy\n\nThis isn't about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It's about putting them in service of life rather than the other way around. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning - that help us purify our fears and nurture our natural attraction to what's true and good.\n\nWhen we do this, something interesting happens:\n- Quality naturally reduces waste\n- Relationship naturally builds resilience\n- Meaning naturally guides growth\n- Beauty naturally creates value\n\n## Learning to Trust Quality: A Personal Journey\n\nLet me share something personal about learning to trust quality recognition. In 2004, I met the person who would become my wife. On paper, nothing added up. She spoke a different language, came from a different part of the world, was planning to return to France. We didn't even have that overwhelming spark of desire or creative resonance that people often look for.\n\nBut I decided, finally, for once in my life, I'm not going to think my way into a relationship and ask \"what will my parents think?\" or \"does this make sense according to the religion I was given?\" Instead, I trusted the thing that religions try to connect you with - that part of us that can know truth. When I met my wife and I held her, my shoulders dropped. I felt connected to my body and to her. There was a leaning towards, a yes. This was very early in our relationship.\n\nNow I watch our baby grow, surprised and grateful at the beauty that unfolds when we ask not \"what do I want?\" but \"what wants to happen?\" There's something profound here about stepping back from the \"I\" - because it's the \"I\" that has the fear, the self-protection, all these things that block us from seeing clearly.\n\n## Seeing with Both Eyes\n\nThis experience taught me something crucial about quality recognition. It's not about rejecting rational analysis - it's about using both \"eyes.\" One eye sees metrics, plans, logical fit. The other sees quality, meaning, truth. We need both.\n\nThink about a bird waking up to feed its young. It opens its eyes and sees hungry children, and leaves its nest in fear and hope, seeking worms and seeds. This way of seeing the world requires both eyes - we do have a rational faculty. We can think ahead to plant seeds, to organize our land, to let land rest after understanding soil depletion for a better harvest next year.\n\nBut my love of planning and stability, along with my rejection of traditions that were teaching me how to open the eye of the heart, limited me from being able to explore in an open way. It's like walking a tightrope - you need to keep your eyes focused on beauty and walk without looking down, knowing and not knowing that the next step will land.\n\nThe rope is invisible to the tightrope walker, just like the worm is invisible to the bird. In the Muslim tradition, we're given promises about what happens to those who trust and have god-consciousness. These beliefs must be taken gradually, step by step. You take one step that proves the rope is there, you leave one morning, you find the worms. But winter comes, things change, the wind blows, and the rope moves ever so slightly.\n\n## What This Means for Our Work\n\nThis integration of both eyes - rational and quality-recognizing - could transform how we work:\n\n1. In Program Design:\n- Use metrics to inform but not control\n- Let quality recognition guide major decisions\n- Create space for both planning and emergence\n- Trust the process while staying practical\n\n2. In Mentorship:\n- Balance skill training with wisdom transmission\n- Teach tools while developing judgment\n- Support both doing and being\n- Honor both knowledge and knowing\n\n3. In Measurement:\n- Track numbers while watching quality\n- Document outcomes while feeling impact\n- Measure growth while sensing development\n- Count results while recognizing transformation\n\nThe trick isn't choosing between these approaches - it's learning to use both eyes together. Like a craftsperson who uses measurements and tools but ultimately trusts their sense of quality, we need to develop our capacity to work with both rational analysis and quality recognition.\n\n## Integrating Both Ways of Seeing\n\nLet me share more examples of how this integration of rational analysis and quality recognition works:\n\nLook at traditional craftspeople - they use precise measurements and tools, but ultimately trust their sense of when something is right. A woodworker measures twice and cuts once, but also knows through touch when the wood is ready. They're using both eyes - precision and quality recognition together.\n\nOr think about Father Greg Boyle's work with gang members. He uses data and programs, but his core decisions come from recognizing people as friends, not metrics. The practical tools serve the deeper knowing, not the other way around.\n\nEven in my own coding work, the best solutions come when I balance technical analysis with a sense of elegance and rightness. But too often, I let the metrics take over - building features no one needs because the numbers said we should.\n\n## The Bird and the Tightrope\n\nThis balance is like the bird leaving its nest each morning. It has natural fear - winter is coming, predators exist - but also natural trust. It doesn't need complicated analysis to know worms exist and its children need feeding. It uses both instinct and intelligence, fear and trust, planning and presence.\n\nOn the tightrope, you actually fall if you only use analytical thinking. Try to calculate each step and you'll freeze. But pure feeling without any technique is also dangerous. You need both - technique serving intuition, measurement serving quality recognition.\n\nThe rope might be invisible, but with each step you prove it's there. Like in my journey with my wife - each moment of trust built evidence for the next step. You don't need to see the whole path, just the next true step.\n\n## Practical Implications for Bloom\n\nThis transforms how we work in very concrete ways:\n\n1. In Team Development:\nInstead of:\n- Setting rigid goals\n- Following fixed timelines\n- Measuring standard KPIs\n- Forcing growth\n\nWe could:\n- Create conditions for natural development\n- Trust organic timing while maintaining rhythm\n- Track emergence of quality\n- Support natural growth\n\n2. In Program Design:\nInstead of:\n- Standard workshops\n- Fixed curricula\n- Predetermined outcomes\n- Uniform metrics\n\nWe could:\n- Create practice spaces\n- Enable natural learning\n- Support emergent goals\n- Measure real transformation\n\n3. In Technology Use:\nInstead of:\n- Building platforms first\n- Automating relationships\n- Scaling through systems\n- Measuring engagement\n\nWe could:\n- Start with direct connection\n- Let tools emerge from need\n- Scale through depth\n- Measure meaningful interaction\n\n## Transforming Decision-Making\n\nThis changes how we make every decision:\n\n1. With Entrepreneurs:\nOld Way:\n- \"Do they fit our criteria?\"\n- \"What's their growth potential?\"\n- \"Can they scale quickly?\"\n- \"What's their impact metric?\"\n\nNew Way:\n- \"Is there real quality here?\"\n- \"What's trying to emerge?\"\n- \"How can we support natural development?\"\n- \"What's the deeper impact?\"\n\n2. With Programs:\nOld Way:\n- \"How many can we serve?\"\n- \"What's our completion rate?\"\n- \"How efficiently can we deliver?\"\n- \"What's our cost per impact?\"\n\nNew Way:\n- \"Where's the real transformation?\"\n- \"What's the quality of learning?\"\n- \"How deep is the development?\"\n- \"What's actually changing?\"\n\n3. With Technology:\nOld Way:\n- \"What can we automate?\"\n- \"How can we scale this?\"\n- \"What's the engagement metric?\"\n- \"How efficient is it?\"\n\nNew Way:\n- \"Does this serve real connection?\"\n- \"Does this enhance human quality?\"\n- \"Does this support natural development?\"\n- \"Does this enable deeper work?\"\n\nThe key is that we're not abandoning rational analysis - we're putting it in service of quality recognition. Like a good craftsperson uses tools to serve their sense of quality, we use metrics and systems to serve our recognition of what's truly valuable.\n\n## Living This Transformation\n\nLet me share how this shift has played out in my own work:\n\nI used to think I could keep doing/building the same way, thinking maybe there's a productive tension between the eye of reason and the eye of quality. I'd pull on the quality side while the rest of the team pulled on the rational side, hoping for balance. But I got quieter and quieter because I didn't have the language or the recognition of how important this was. \n\nBecause of how much our society prioritizes the rational, I think it's more important for Bloom to overemphasize the qualitative and the humane and to work on that aspect more than the other one because that other one already is being addressed.\n\nI see this most clearly in our retreats - when we step away from metrics and platforms, real transformation happens. People share their true stories, their struggles, their hopes. Like Marie Claire talking about feminine hygiene, creating spaces for women to discuss what was considered shameful. The tears, the hugs, the authentic connections - these moments show what's possible when we trust quality recognition.\n\n## Rethinking Funder Relationships\n\nThis raises obvious questions about funding and sustainability. But what if we flip the script:\n\nInstead of:\n\"How do we get funding to do what funders want?\"\n\nWe ask:\n\"How do we find funding that allows us to do what's truly needed?\"\n\nI believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards?\n\nLook at the iNGOs - they're happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). The goals, the SDGs, the plans - these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to organizations focused on the attainment of something.\n\nMaybe we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs that we should slow down and think deeper.\n\n## Quality Recognition: What I've Come to See\n\nThere's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage instead of leaning into the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\n\n## When Metrics Led Us Astray\n\nI've seen this play out painfully in our work. I hyperfixate on code and underfixate on things that bring me to life. I brought this to Bloom by building assessment-to-practices tools while doing less and less of what I love most - being with teams, talking, helping them navigate and see.\n\nJust recently I built a meaning expression app because technology is cool and because I can, somehow thinking if I build it it means I'm good enough to share something \"valuable\" because people like software. No one used it. I didn't even share it, because part of me knows it was just a toy.\n\nThe system pulled us into un-aliveness when we were in meetings drawing hockey stick charts about our growth while NO ONE was using the platform. This wishful thinking, lack of connection to reality, and fear (fear of realizing we built the wrong thing, fear that we wasted all our savings, and fear that we're so close to getting it right and we're going to give up) all led us to keep going and it was wrong. I knew it was wrong, yet I couldn't stop the train.\n\n## Coming Alive vs Getting By\n\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate.\n\nInitially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance. But I don't think there's a productive tension here. Because of how much our society prioritizes the rational, I think it's more important for Bloom to overemphasize the qualitative and the humane.\n\n## A Vision for Bloom\n\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs that we should slow down and think deeper.\n\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no, it's not only because we don't have money for paid holidays; there's something burning about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions—we must treat people as ends and get close. Relationships matter, commitment matters, connection matters. Scale can happen in a beautiful and authentic way, probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again.\n\n## The Contrast Between Metrics and Meaning\n\nLet me share specific moments where I've seen this tension play out:\n\nDuring our retreat in Turkey, I started feeling off about our approach, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do.\n\nI felt it again watching people use our platform - or rather, not use it. We kept pushing features and metrics while missing the real human connection people needed. It reminded me of my own pattern - building a meaning expression app no one would use because I was trying to prove value through technology rather than trusting in real connection.\n\nBut then I see moments like in Dubai - Marie Claire moving everyone to tears sharing her work on feminine hygiene, creating spaces for women to discuss what was considered shameful. No metric could capture the power of that moment, the real transformation happening in that room.\n\n## A Deeper Vision for Bloom\n\nWhat if instead of trying to scale impact through platforms and metrics, we:\n\n1. Focus on Coming Alive First\n- Help people recognize and trust their quality perception\n- Create spaces for authentic connection and development\n- Let impact emerge from meaning rather than forcing it\n- Support natural growth rather than predetermined paths\n\n2. Build Real Community\n- Foster direct relationships rather than platform connections\n- Enable wisdom transmission through apprenticeship\n- Create conditions for natural learning and development\n- Trust emergence over control\n\n3. Transform Our Approach to Value\n- Measure at the end of the day but attend to our sources of meaning at the start\n- Let goals emerge from becoming rather than planning\n- Build from self-knowledge and alignment with values\n- Create space for quality recognition to guide development\n\n## Practical Steps Toward Transformation\n\nHere's how we could start this journey:\n\n1. Immediate Changes\n- Pause platform development\n- Create more retreat-like spaces\n- Focus on direct relationship building\n- Document real stories and transformations\n\n2. Program Evolution\n- Shift from workshops to \"craft circles\"\n- Replace mentor speed dating with real apprenticeship\n- Let timing follow natural development\n- Support organic community formation\n\n3. New Ways of Working\n- Start with quality recognition in every decision\n- Trust emergence while maintaining discipline\n- Use technology only when it serves connection\n- Let metrics follow meaning rather than lead it\n\n4. Funding Approach\n- Look for partners who understand this vision\n- Start small and prove the model works\n- Build evidence through real transformation stories\n- Let growth happen naturally\n\n## Moving Forward Together\n\nI know this is a big shift. But I'm increasingly convinced that our current approach - dashboards, assessments, growth projections - is missing something essential. We can't take down the master's house with the master's tools. We need to trust in something deeper.\n\nMaybe we start small:\n- Pick one group to work with differently\n- Document what emerges when we trust the process\n- Build evidence through real stories of transformation\n- Let the work speak for itself\n\nI'd love to explore this together - to see what's possible when we trust in quality recognition and let real impact emerge from meaning.\n\n[Previous sections continue...]\n\nLet me assess the overall letter:\n\nStrengths:\n1.

      "content": "Below is a **new draft** of your letter, **preserving your voice and personal style** as much as possible, while weaving in the **fresh insights**: Father Greg Boyle’s story as a catalyst, **clear references to Palestine**, a **garden-craft metaphor**, and the **“two eyes”** concept for stereoscopic vision.\n\n---\n\n# Reconnecting with Quality: Crafting a Garden for Bloom’s Future\n\nDear Dara and Munir,\n\nI’ve been trying to speak clearly about something fundamental to our work at Bloom—an understanding that can’t just be captured by metrics or hockey stick charts. It crystallized when I first heard **Father Greg Boyle** say he doesn’t measure success with fancy impact data because, at the end of the day, *“They’re my friends.”*\n\nThat line felt like a lightning bolt. It laid bare the difference between **using people as means to an end** and simply being in relationship with them because you care. In the social impact space, we talk about “helping beneficiaries” or “tracking success,” but rarely about *friendship*. Listening to Father Greg, I realized we often fool ourselves into thinking we’re doing good, even as we treat human beings like data points for donors.\n\n## **The Tension: Metrics vs. Meaning**\n\nI’ve felt rising frustration, even anger, at a system that demands numbers first and actual **human connection** second (if at all). I remember how, in Dubai, we watched Marie Claire tearfully share her work creating spaces for women to discuss what was once shameful in her community—feminine hygiene. She formed supply chains out of agricultural waste, made affordable tampons, and built real solidarity among those who felt unseen. It moved us to tears: the **power of human ingenuity and raw empathy** happening right before our eyes.\n\nYet back in our Bloom meetings, we were obsessing over a platform hardly anyone used, drawing projections that soared while our actual community engagement lagged behind. Fear—of sunk costs, lost savings, or admitting we’d built the wrong thing—drove us to keep going, though we *knew* it wasn’t truly alive.\n\nI see this tension echoed globally. We celebrate job creation for refugees, but remain silent about the **genocide in Palestine**, where entire communities are dismantled under violent oppression, day after day. Quantifiable data (“X thousand jobs created!”) looks triumphant on a spreadsheet, but it **ignores** the deeper injustice that ravages people’s daily reality. The disconnect between “the metric of the moment” and what truly matters is jarring.\n\n## **Personal Crisis: Realizing I’m Part of It**\n\nI’ve noticed the same pattern in myself. As a hacker, I often build **tools** before forging genuine connections. I code and iterate, thinking that if the tech is clever enough, we’ll prove our worth. But I’ve seen it flop. Recently, I built a “meaning expression app,” then never shared it. Deep down, I knew it was more about proving I could build something than serving genuine human need.\n\nBloom often fell into this trap: we poured energy into assessments and user funnels, then wondered why we felt so disconnected. I didn’t speak up enough, worried about “rocking the boat.” I’d let my doubts gnaw at me—maybe I’m just emotional, maybe “metrics are necessary.” But the tension grew until it felt like a lie I couldn’t keep living.\n\n## **How We Lost Our Second Eye**\n\nReflecting on Father Greg’s words, I realize we’ve been operating with only one eye open: the eye of **metrics, rationality, and future goals**. We neglect the second eye, the one that sees **quality, empathy, moral clarity**—the intangible truths that give life meaning. Without both eyes, we see the world in flat, forced outlines. We try to measure “impact” like it’s a widget, forgetting to ask, *“Is this actually serving life?”*\n\nOur fear compounds it. We’re afraid of losing funding, looking unprofessional, or admitting mistakes. Instead of trusting our **capacity to recognize what’s good and true**, we hide behind data and dashboards. We let tasks become transactional. Sometimes, we even side-step naming **genocidal violence** or oppression because it’s “complicated,” focusing on superficial achievements instead.\n\n## **A Garden-Craft Metaphor: Replacing the Factory Mindset**\n\nIf the current system is a **factory**, pumping out programs and chasing quick returns, what if we became **gardeners**—or, better yet, **“craftspeople of a garden”**? This means:\n\n1. **Craft**: Like a potter who knows when the clay feels “just right” or a woodworker who balances exact measurements with the material’s grain, **craft** demands patient attention. You sense when something is working or not, beyond mere formula.\n\n2. **Garden**: A gardener doesn’t yank on the seed to make it sprout faster. They nurture the soil, water diligently, allow for seasons. They know growth has its rhythm, and real flourishing can’t be forced by a chart projecting “harvest yield.”\n\nPutting these together—**“crafting a garden”**—suggests a deliberate yet **emergent** approach. We bring skill and structure where needed, but let life follow its own patterns of growth. We measure in ways that inform, not dominate. We sense the subtle signals of well-being or stress in a community, rather than over-relying on superficial data.\n\n## **Concrete Signs the Old Way Isn’t Working**\n\n- **Microfinance** in places like India began with dignity-based lending but devolved into coercive repayment structures, leading to borrower suicides—because the metric (repayment rate) overshadowed the actual health of people.\n- **Refugee “job creation”** can provide short-term stats but ignore the deeper violence or root injustices (as in Palestine). We document X many jobs, then hush up daily human rights abuses. \n- **Our own platform**: We built dashboards and “engagement trackers” while entrepreneurs quietly found transformation through personal calls, side chats, or heartfelt peer discussions—moments we never properly valued.\n\n## **Glimpses of a Better Way**\n\nOccasionally, we see **real transformation** blossoming in front of us:\n\n- Marie Claire’s circle of women supporting each other in Dubai—tears, hugs, raw honesty. No metric can capture that moment of human awakening. \n- Traditional craft communities preserving knowledge across generations through **apprenticeship and relationship**. They naturally scale by transmitting depth, not by mass production. \n- **Buurtzorg** in the Netherlands, trusting nurses’ direct perception of patient needs, slashing bureaucracy and costs while improving care.\n\nThese show us that, ironically, **trusting quality** and **relationship** can achieve broader, more authentic “impact” than any forced scaling plan.\n\n## **Reimagining Bloom with “Both Eyes”**\n\nI believe Bloom could be a **pioneer** in recentering what truly matters. Here’s what that might look like:\n\n1. **From Programs to Practice Spaces**  \n   - Instead of fixed curricula or “best practices” modules, we create **craft circles**: living environments where participants learn from one another, reflect in real-time, and follow organic growth rhythms.  \n   - Embrace slower, deeper development. Let people come alive through real challenges and direct feedback, not prepackaged content.\n\n2. **From Metrics to Meaning**  \n   - Let’s redefine “success.” Move away from forced “impact figures.” Start measuring something more alive: **meaningful moments**, **trusted relationships**, **newfound courage**.  \n   - We can still note numbers, but let them trail behind the deeper transformations, rather than overshadow them.\n\n3. **From Tools to Relationships**  \n   - Pause autopilot tech building. If we add a platform, it should be **because** community members genuinely demand it, not because we assume “scaling” depends on software.  \n   - Focus on phone calls, direct contact, in-person meets. Let technology enhance real connection instead of simulating it.\n\n4. **From Control to Emergence**  \n   - Like gardeners, we **nurture conditions** (cohort bonding, personal reflection, flexible pacing) rather than forcing seeds to sprout on a schedule.  \n   - Accept that some seeds won’t grow, or might grow into something unexpected. Authentic innovation often arises from the unplanned.\n\n## **Answering the Hard Questions**\n\n1. **Financial Sustainability**  \n   - I won’t lie: reorienting to a garden-craft mindset demands new funding relationships. Some donors won’t understand. But if we craft something real and beautiful, I believe there *are* partners who value depth over superficial scale.\n\n2. **Proving Success**  \n   - We’ll still “measure”—but through stories, consistent reflections, and sensible data that follows our actual relationships. We might share real-time diaries of transformation or group interviews focusing on personal agency and connection. These can be more convincing than artificially inflated metrics.\n\n3. **Handling Uncertainty**  \n   - Fear of “losing out” or “being small” can paralyze us. But if Marie Claire’s story taught me anything, it’s that **genuine human care** can flourish into something far more impactful than any forced numbers-driven blueprint.\n\n## **A Personal Plea**\n\nI’m writing all this because I’m tired of betraying my own sense of truth, of letting a single “eye” (metrics, scale, or donor demands) blind the other “eye” that sees **beauty, meaning, and relationships**. Watching Father Greg say, “They’re my friends,” was the final push I needed to speak honestly.\n\nI see it, too, in our own experiences: the tears and triumphs we witnessed in Dubai weren’t because we had a perfect software funnel—they happened when people felt seen and heard. We *know* how real transformation looks; we’ve lived it in glimpses. We just haven’t structured our organization around it.\n\n## **A Possible Experiment**\n\nLet’s start small—like a **garden plot** rather than a whole farm:\n\n1. **Choose a Handful of Entrepreneurs**  \n   - Resist the urge to onboard huge cohorts. Focus on deeper relationships.  \n2. **Craft Circles Instead of Fixed Modules**  \n   - Let them define their real struggles. Provide a “circle” for authentic feedback, not bullet-point content.  \n3. **Track Meaning Over Time**  \n   - Document their sense of purpose, emotional breakthroughs, genuine peer support. Use any data to reinforce, not replace, these real moments.  \n4. **See What Grows**  \n   - If it flops, we learn. If it flourishes, we have living evidence that a relationship-driven, craft-garden approach can yield results that outlast short-lived metrics.\n\n## **Why This Matters Right Now**\n\nThe crises around us—an unspeakable genocide in Palestine, looming climate breakdowns, the hollowness of many social enterprise efforts—remind me we can’t keep ignoring deeper truth. It’s not enough to produce “jobs” or “accelerated businesses” while entire communities and cultures are systematically destroyed.\n\nWe need to stand, as Father Greg does, on the bedrock of **“They’re my friends.”** That means we cannot reduce human lives to spreadsheets, nor casually skip over injustices for the sake of looking good to funders. It requires courage and both eyes open, trusting we can build financially sound, meaningful structures that still acknowledge the moral dimensions of life.\n\n## **Final Invitation**\n\nI know shifting Bloom’s approach might feel daunting or radical. We’ve invested time and money in certain systems. But I believe these tensions won’t vanish until we address them head-on. If we can craft a garden—where both rational analysis and **quality recognition** have their place—we might discover that our best “growth curve” is the one we never planned, blossoming out of genuine human connection.\n\nI’d love to explore a small pilot together, adapt our next accelerator to prioritize authenticity over forced metrics, and see how it unfolds. Let’s become the **craftspeople** and **gardeners** we’ve always hinted we want to be—shaping conditions for real flourishing rather than painting illusions of scale.\n\nThank you for reading this long letter. Thank you for hearing my heart on this. I’m hopeful we can co-create something braver, more human, and more **beautiful** than any measure alone can capture.\n\nWith gratitude and a willingness to trust what’s real,\n\n**Bilal**",

      "content": "now can we re-write our original essay using language verbatim from the original letter, my exacty language, you didn't do a good job above, it should be using direct quotes, paraphrases, sentences and my words rearranged not rewritten. Note, this is not a letter to munir, a broader essay for the social impact space: [[[From Metrics to Meaning: Crafting a Garden of Real Impact\n“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”\n—Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nPart I: The Moment That Changed Everything\nA few years ago, I was listening to the On Being podcast when I first encountered Father Greg Boyle’s story about Homeboy Industries—the largest gang rehabilitation program in the world. Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg for his metrics, his method, his proof that lives were truly changing. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n\n“They’re my friends.”\n\nIt was a moment that upended my understanding of social impact. I’d been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for “scaling impact”—always with an eye on the next pilot or next data set. Yet here was Father Greg, a man who’d transformed countless lives, insisting that friendship lay at the heart of change, more than metrics or theories of impact.\n\nI felt a shock of recognition, like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in my pursuit of “doing good,” I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new “success” story. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn’t rooting. That single line—“They’re my friends”—pierced me with its radical simplicity.\n\nAnd so I made a choice: rather than continuing my peripatetic rounds, I would anchor myself where I was needed. I put down deeper roots in Lebanon. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised relationship—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. In stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of human connection over data.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change.\n\nNeoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\n\nMicrofinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as it ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas. In India, farmers burdened by micro-debts faced harassment and, tragically, suicides. The metric—repayment rate—became more important than any relational approach to poverty.\nIgnoring Genocide While Creating Jobs\n\nA stark example is the ongoing genocide in Palestine. International agencies pour resources into “job creation” for Palestinian refugees, touting how many short-term positions are funded or how many training certificates distributed. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is systemically downplayed—overshadowed by a tidy “jobs for refugees” success statistic. The raw metric of “employment rates” doesn’t speak to generational trauma, land theft, or the dismantling of entire communities.\nIn focusing on short-term numeric “impact,” we often fail to address—or even openly name—root injustices.\nCookie-Cutter Approaches to Crises\n\nFollowing natural disasters—like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti—major NGOs rushed to build houses and infrastructure, guided by ROI and donor satisfaction. Many solutions fell apart due to minimal community input. A house built for people—rather than with them—ignores local wisdom and fosters dependency rather than resilience.\nThroughout it all, we chase metrics: jobs created, houses built, tests passed, repayment rates achieved. We pride ourselves on scaling up “solutions.” Yet in conversation after conversation, I hear deep unease: a sense that behind the well-polished data, we are repeating the same logic of control and extraction that caused these crises in the first place.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\nFather Greg’s statement—“They’re my friends”—wasn’t just a warm sentiment. It was a radical critique of the mechanistic worldview that sees people as “beneficiaries,” “stakeholders,” or “target populations.” Friendship implies presence and empathy, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\n\nStereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose the other eye—the one that perceives intangible depth, emotional truth, moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide stereoscopic vision, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in flat outlines, easily manipulated.\n\nEye One (Metrics and Tools): We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.\nEye Two (Meaning and Relationship): This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that calling out genocide might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n“Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”\n—(Paraphrased concept)\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact\nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: “craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve combined them into “crafting a garden,” which captures the delicate balance between artistry and cultivation—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n\n1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea\nWhen you craft something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You have an intuitive sense of when the clay yields and how it wants to form. You measure, but you also feel. Similarly, a gardener sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You cannot force a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\n\nCrafting a garden merges these ideas: we pay reverent attention to every interaction (the “craft” side), while recognizing natural growth cycles (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n\n2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.\nGarden-Craft Mindset: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of community trust. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n\n3. Lessons from Craftsmanship\nA craftsperson understands:\n\nAttentiveness: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.\nTiming and Rhythm: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, a sense of readiness is as crucial as speed.\nEmbrace of Imperfection: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we’re letting them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”\nLet’s face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a “faster, cheaper, bigger” approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\n\nGenocide in Palestine: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.\nPost-Disaster Reconstruction: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\nA gardener doesn’t force the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is conducive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\n\nSustaining Long-Term Flourishing\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—we plant seeds that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts.\n\nPart VI: My OnBeing Encounter and the Power of Story\nIt wasn’t just Father Greg’s words that struck me; it was the entire ethos of the On Being podcast. The show invites guests who embody spiritual depth and relational insight. Listening to these interviews, I realized that much of modern philanthropic discourse is missing that deeper reflection. We speak of “empowering communities” yet rarely talk about our inward transformation or the spiritual dimension of care.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell, in his storytelling style, often uses vivid anecdotes to reveal systemic truths. He unpacks data or phenomena by zooming in on a single individual’s story. Reflecting on that approach, I see how we can integrate personal narratives—like my own shift after hearing Father Greg—and use them to highlight the deeper, universal principle:\n\nAuthentic friendship, rooted presence, and moral clarity do more for social transformation than any set of metrics alone.\n\nPart VII: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work\nI co-run programs that aim to help people rediscover meaning in work and life. At times, we used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. But gradually, we began adopting the crafting-a-garden approach:\n\nPreparing the Soil (Community Readiness)\n\nInstead of imposing solutions, we spend time listening. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have conversations, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.\nPlanting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)\n\nWe collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—we craft the shape together.\nTending the Garden (Sustained Support)\n\nLike a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain ongoing relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.\nHarvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)\n\nOf course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics follow the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather stories, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\nOn the Edge of True Impact\nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight—especially not massive, systemic horrors like genocide. But we can stand with communities in a lifelong posture of solidarity. We can name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\n\nPart VIII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\nSo how do we shift from metrics mania to crafting a garden?\n\nPractice Stereoscopic Vision\n\nKeep your metrics if they help you see part of reality. But never lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees injustice, trauma, and possibilities for friendship.\nName Reality Clearly\n\nAvoid euphemisms. If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance turns exploitative, say so openly. Authentic relationships thrive on honesty, not polite obfuscation.\nSlow Down to Go Deeper\n\nSlowing the pace allows you to “listen to the clay,” to sense a community’s soul. Rushing might create short-term outputs but often yields shallow or harmful outcomes.\nTrust the Process of Craft\n\nAccept that not everything can be a linear blueprint. Gardening has seasons; some seeds fail. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks. This is growth, not a series of guaranteed leaps.\nAdopt the Gardener’s Long View\n\nA gardener invests in the soil, knowing real harvests may come years later—or bless future generations. In social impact, facing crises that range from genocide to climate disasters, we must hold a long-range vision. Even small acts of genuine friendship can ripple beyond our immediate horizon.\nA Moment for Reflection\nWhat tension do you feel when pressured for quick results?\nWhich relationships in your work might you deepen rather than “scale”?\nWhere might you stand in truth—calling out systemic violence or injustice—rather than quietly conforming to funder-friendly narratives?\nAsking these questions is an act of reclaiming our second eye—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\nConclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—“They’re my friends”—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that relationship can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\n\nCrafting a garden of social impact means:\n\nTending relationships like precious seedlings.\nUsing skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions with communities.\nNaming—and resisting—systemic atrocities like the genocide in Palestine, rather than burying them in shallow metrics.\nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that truly integrates rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—we simply refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of stereoscopic vision—two ways of seeing that yield a deeper perception of reality.\n\nIn the end, what we grow—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We may witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or a donor report existed. We may craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly come alive.\n\nAnd that, I believe, is what real impact looks like.]]]\n\ntake the essay above essay and let's take content and ideas from the letter - and most importantly language, writing style, verbatim quotes, exact sentences and phrases, i want it to be as close to my original language as possible and let's write our essay ",

References to individuals like Dara or Munir have been omitted, but otherwise the **language, phrasing, and style** remain yours.\n\n---\n\n# **Reconnecting with Quality: A Journey to Real Impact**\n\nI’ve been struggling to articulate something important about our work in the social impact space. The clarity finally came through **stories of beauty and meaning**—like when I heard **Father Greg Boyle** explain his work with gang members not through impact metrics but simply because *“they’re my friends.”* This pointed toward a way of being that **wasn’t instrumental**, that was **beautiful**, that I wanted to experience for myself.\n\n---\n\n## **The Crisis I’m Seeing**\n\nI’ve felt increasing frustration and anger when I’m not able to express meaningful ways of being at work. I was stifled from connecting deeply with teams, watching us build systems that were dead on arrival because they **never had soul in them** in the first place—designed from goal setting, ambition, funder interest, and requirements for tracking, rather than authentic experiments and genuine care for people’s inner lives.\n\nMy inability to articulate these feelings led me to be passive, silent, frustrated, small. I felt social pressure to conform, thinking about not wanting to show divided leadership, wanting to “keep things afloat.” I allowed my doubt (maybe I’m wrong) to squish my growing tension and feeling that we’re going the wrong way.\n\n---\n\n## **Moments of Clarity**\n\nThe contrast became clearest in Dubai. I’ll never forget Marie Claire talking about how women need tampons and a space to talk about feminine hygiene, sharing her journey into realizing this for herself and solving it for other women. Going from school to school installing dispensers, finding a way out of thin air, using waste material from agriculture to produce cheaper tampons, finding funding, creating accessibility. It wasn’t just making things—it was **establishing spaces to talk about things considered shameful** in her society.\n\nIt was all so beautiful—seeing her gratitude, feeling like we were part of helping her find a community of supportive women, all surrounding her and crying too, each bearing gifts for each other, sharing hugs and smiles. It was wonderful.\n\nBut then I’d feel the system pulling against aliveness in our meetings, drawing hockey stick charts about our growth while NO ONE was using the platform. This wishful thinking, disconnection from reality, and **fear** (fear of realizing we built the wrong thing, fear that we wasted our savings, fear that we’re so close to getting it right) led us to keep going. It was wrong. I knew it was wrong, yet I couldn’t stop the train.\n\n---\n\n## **My Own Pattern**\n\nI see this in myself too—I’m a hacker who builds first and connects second, knowing there’s nothing alive in there. Just recently, I built a “meaning expression app” because technology is cool and because I can, somehow thinking if I build it, it means I’m good enough to share something “valuable” because people like software. But **no one used it**. I didn’t even share it, because part of me knows it was just a toy.\n\nI hyperfixate on code and underfixate on the things that bring me to life. I brought this to our work by building assessment-to-practices tools while doing less and less of what I love most—**being with teams, talking, helping them navigate and see**.\n\n---\n\n## **A Different Way Forward**\n\nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading *Winners Take All* and realizing that what we’re doing isn’t what we’re talking about. We’re **not** saving the world—we’re helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency. We’re not even really helping them establish financially successful exponential businesses, because we don’t embody that. We embody something that matters to many, yet we’re not clear about that. Instead, we pretend to sell other things, and that tension hurts.\n\nThis isn’t abstract theory—there are organizations showing a different way forward. **Buurtzorg** in the Netherlands eliminated all management and metrics-based control, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country. Or **Sounds True**, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\n\nThese aren’t just nice stories—they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that **honors quality recognition and craft**. When I say **craft**, I don’t just mean artisanal products. I mean any work that:\n\n- Develops through **direct relationship** and apprenticeship  \n- Values **mastery** and depth alongside innovation  \n- Creates containers for **meaningful work** to emerge  \n- Trusts people’s **natural capacity** to recognize quality  \n\n---\n\n## **What This Could Mean**\n\nInstead of our current approach—dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools—we could **build like craftspeople**:\n\n1. **From Programs to Practice Spaces**  \n   - Replace fixed curriculum with **living apprenticeship**  \n   - Create conditions for natural emergence  \n   - Support direct transmission of wisdom  \n   - Let timing follow organic development  \n\n2. **From Metrics to Meaning**  \n   - Stop forcing impact numbers that don’t reflect reality  \n   - Start measuring **meaningful moments** and real relationships  \n   - Track how **quality recognition** develops  \n   - Notice where authentic community forms  \n\n3. **From Tools to Relationships**  \n   - Build technology only when we truly have to  \n   - Start with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out  \n   - Only add systems when the **human work demands** it  \n   - Let tools serve connection, not replace it  \n\nI know this sounds risky in the social impact space. But I’m increasingly convinced that the “factory farm” mindset—maxing out growth, chasing big donor checks, compressing meaning into bullet points—cannot sustain the life we want, nor the dignity we say we value. We’ve seen glimpses of a better way.\n\n---\n\n## **An Experiment Worth Trying**\n\nWhat if we started small:\n\n1. **Finding Our Masters**  \n   - Identify people who embody this way of working  \n   - Create spaces for direct transmission  \n   - Build real apprenticeship relationships  \n   - Trust natural development  \n\n2. **Creating Practice Spaces**  \n   - Replace workshops with “craft circles”  \n   - Focus on direct experience and feedback  \n   - Allow natural emergence of skills and wisdom  \n   - Support authentic community building  \n\n3. **New Ways of Measuring**  \n   - Track quality recognition development  \n   - Document wisdom transmission  \n   - Notice where **real community** forms  \n   - See what emerges naturally  \n\n---\n\n## **Technology and Tools**\n\nI realize I’m part of the pattern—**as a hacker, I keep building things first and connecting second**. But what if instead we:\n\n- Only build tools when **human connection** demands it  \n- Start with calling people, figuring things out together  \n- Use technology to **enhance relationship**, not replace it  \n- Let systems emerge from real needs  \n\n**Technology** should serve the craft, not direct it—like how a **good craftsperson’s tools** enhance their connection to the material rather than separating them from it.\n\n---\n\n## **Scale and Growth**\n\nWe keep drawing hockey stick charts, but maybe there’s a different way to think about scale:\n\n- Through **depth**, not just breadth  \n- Through **wisdom**, not just metrics  \n- Through **quality**, not just quantity  \n- Through **relationship**, not just systems  \n\nLook at Buurtzorg. They spread to 25 countries **not** through traditional scaling strategies but through the **natural spread** of a better way of working. Or traditional craft villages that sustained communities for generations through apprenticeship and direct transmission, not efficiency and forced scale.\n\n---\n\n## **Success at Every Step**\n\nWe keep planning for future impact—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at **every step of the way**, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\n\nThink about a **food forest** versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, **every moment** is successful—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for the apples; it’s alive and successful in every moment.\n\n---\n\n## **Quality in the Age of AI**\n\nThis becomes crucial as **AI** develops. I keep building software because it’s “cool” and because I can, somehow thinking if I build it, it means I’m “valuable.” But AI can digest all the **output** and **quantity**, yet **not** any of the **quality**. Automation is something we would never want to give to anything that brings us a source of meaning.\n\nWhen we craft a life we want to live, we’re touching things that are meaningful for us in ways that are impossible to even articulate because they’re infinite and vast. We need to experience them and see them as sources of guidance, but we can’t teach this to AI.\n\nThat’s why I’m increasingly skeptical of platforms and tools that promise to “scale” impact. We text instead of calling, we want to “blast” an email to thousands, and we rely on systems with drop-offs at every stage instead of leaning into the **connection** and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\n---\n\n## **What This Means for Our Work**\n\nThis changes everything about how we approach social impact:\n\n1. **Stop Trying to Automate Relationship**  \n   - Real connection can’t be scaled through platforms  \n   - Quality recognition requires **human presence**  \n   - Let technology serve connection, not replace it  \n\n2. **Focus on Depth Over Breadth**  \n   - Better to work deeply with a few than superficially with many  \n   - Trust that quality spreads naturally  \n   - Let impact emerge from meaning  \n\n3. **Measure What Matters**  \n   - Track **moments of real connection**  \n   - Notice where quality recognition develops  \n   - Document **authentic transformation**  \n   - Let patterns emerge naturally  \n\nThe future isn’t in better automation or control systems—it’s in better supporting our **natural capacity** to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true. Everything else follows from that.\n\n---\n\n## **Fear and Beauty**\n\nI understand now that what held me back wasn’t just doubt—it was **fear**. Like when I couldn’t say “I love you” because I asked for definitions instead of trusting what I knew in my heart. We do this institutionally too, creating endless metrics and “objective” measures instead of trusting people’s natural capacity for quality.\n\nFear blocks us from the very thing we’re trying to create—**meaningful impact** that actually transforms lives. Our emotions aren’t the enemy; they’re messengers. Each tense emotion reveals a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy. When we feel sad watching animals go extinct, or frustrated with meaningless metrics, these emotions are treasures pointing us toward what matters.\n\n---\n\n## **Making Measurement Serve Life**\n\nHere’s what this could look like:\n\nInstead of measuring:\n- Platform engagement  \n- Growth projections  \n- Impact metrics  \n- Resource utilization  \n\nWe measure:\n- **Moments of meaning**  \n- **Quality of relationships**  \n- **Wisdom transmission**  \n- **Community vitality**  \n\nThe key isn’t just changing what we measure, but **how** we measure: through direct relationship, story, observation, and community, not just data extraction.\n\n---\n\n## **A Different Kind of Economy**\n\nThis isn’t about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It’s about putting them in **service of life**. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning. When we do this:\n\n- Quality **naturally reduces waste**  \n- Relationship **naturally builds resilience**  \n- Meaning **naturally guides growth**  \n- Beauty **naturally creates value**  \n\n---\n\n## **Living This Transformation**\n\nI used to think we could balance the rational eye and the eye of meaning, but I got quieter and quieter, because I didn’t have the language or the recognition of how important this was. Society prioritizes the rational so heavily that I think we need to overemphasize the qualitative and the humane.\n\nEvery powerful moment we’ve witnessed came from **authentic connection** and trust, not from perfect metrics or platforms—like in Dubai, when people cried together over real needs. That’s what’s possible when we trust people’s **capacity to recognize and move toward quality**.\n\n---\n\n## **A Practical Path Forward**\n\n1. **Immediate Changes**  \n   - Pause building platforms  \n   - Create more retreat-like spaces  \n   - Focus on direct relationship building  \n   - Document real stories and transformations  \n\n2. **Program Evolution**  \n   - Shift from workshops to “craft circles”  \n   - Replace mentor speed dating with real apprenticeship  \n   - Let timing follow natural development  \n   - Support organic community formation  \n\n3. **New Ways of Working**  \n   - Start with quality recognition in every decision  \n   - Trust emergence while maintaining discipline  \n   - Use technology only when it **serves connection**  \n   - Let metrics follow meaning rather than lead it  \n\n4. **Funding Approach**  \n   - Look for partners who understand this deeper approach  \n   - Start small and prove the model works  \n   - Build evidence through **real transformation stories**  \n   - Let growth happen naturally  \n\n---\n\n## **Why This Matters Right Now**\n\nWe see entire communities systematically destroyed and genocides (like in Palestine) overshadowed by job-creation statistics. It’s **not enough** to produce “jobs” or “accelerated businesses” while ignoring deeper truths. We can’t keep ignoring the real, raw impacts on human lives. Standing with people in a **lifelong posture** of solidarity means naming injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data.\n\n## **Conclusion: Success at Every Step**\n\nWe keep planning for future impact, but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way? Think of a **food forest**—it’s successful in every moment, even in winter’s decay. It isn’t waiting for harvest to declare success. Similarly, real transformation emerges when we let **quality recognition** guide us at each step, rather than fixating on some distant “scalable” end.\n\n> “We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.”\n\nMaybe we start small, document what emerges when we trust this process, build evidence through real stories of transformation, and let the work speak for itself. We could become **gardeners**—crafting conditions for people to come alive—rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\n\nI believe we can pioneer a different way of working: **trust quality recognition first**, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves beauty. This approach might feel risky, but it leads to more authentic impact—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters real transformation.\n\n**That**, in essence, is what I think social impact can be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s **beautiful and true**, we can finally step beyond hollow metrics into the living reality of meaningful work.\n\n---\n\n*Adapted verbatim from your original letter and personal reflections, rearranged into an essay format.*",

Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg about his intentions for his work. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n“They’re my friends.”\nThat single line plunged me into a deep realization: I had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a means to an end. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but the means were often confused between my own goals, funding, validation, and scale, hinged on chasing big stories and big numbers rather than authentic human connections. I suddenly felt clear about why I had this gnawing notion that there was a disconnect between me and my work, between measurements and meaning.\nI moved more permanently to Lebanon, driven less by strategy and more by trusting a deeper calling: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street—individuals I had previously (often unconsciously) categorized as “beneficiaries.” Where once I saw “targets,” I began to see humans with full stories. And that shift changed everything.\nIt was a moment that upended my understanding of social impact. I’d been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for “scaling impact”—always with an eye on the next pilot or next data set. Yet here was Father Greg, a man who’d transformed countless lives, insisting that friendship lay at the heart of change more than metrics or theories of impact. \nI felt a shock of recognition like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in my pursuit of “doing good,” I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new “success” story, but life is not a game, and people are not pawns. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn’t rooting. That single line—“They’re my friends”—pierced me with its radical simplicity.\nAnd so I made a choice: rather than continuing my peripatetic rounds, I would anchor myself where I was needed. I put down deeper roots in Lebanon. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised relationship—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. In stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of human connection over data.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. I’m arguing that the way we do anything is the way we do everything, as the zen tradition likes to say. \nI believe many of the problems the social impact and nonprofit space attempts to address is related to a deeply rooted materialist understanding of reality. This leads us to see nature as natural resources to extract and humans as resources to be used. Without acknowledging or recognizing this I believe we will re-create many of the problems if we don’t operate differently and with different assumptions. It’s as if we’re set a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York, and instead, we’re going from Los Angeles to Portland, except we’re driving a tank, so it doesn’t matter if our goals and destination is any “better” - SDGs verses profit maximization, we’re still going to tear up the road along the way. We need to get out of the tank, re-think our lives, and decide to work where we are and cultivate a garden wherever we’re planted. \n\"Bloom where you are planted.\" – Saint Francis de Sales\nNeoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\nMicrofinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as it ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas. In India, farmers burdened by micro-debts faced harassment and, tragically, suicides. The metric—repayment rate—became more important than any relational approach to poverty.\nIgnoring Genocide While Creating Jobs\nA stark example is the ongoing genocide in Palestine. International agencies pour resources into “job creation” for Palestinian refugees, touting how many short-term positions are funded or how many training certificates distributed. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is systemically downplayed—overshadowed by a tidy “jobs for refugees” success statistic. The raw metric of “employment rates” doesn’t speak to generational trauma, land theft, or the dismantling of entire communities.\nIn focusing on short-term numeric “impact,” we often fail to address—or even openly name—root injustices.\nCookie-Cutter Approaches to Crises\nFollowing natural disasters—like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti—major NGOs rushed to build houses and infrastructure, guided by ROI and donor satisfaction. Many solutions fell apart due to minimal community input. A house built for people—rather than with them—ignores local wisdom and fosters dependency rather than resilience.\nThroughout it all, we chase metrics: jobs created, houses built, tests passed, repayment rates achieved. We pride ourselves on scaling up “solutions.” Yet in conversation after conversation, I hear deep unease: a sense that behind the well-polished data, we are repeating the same logic of control and extraction that caused these crises in the first place.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\nFather Greg’s statement—“They’re my friends”—wasn’t just a warm sentiment. It was a radical critique of the mechanistic worldview that sees people as “beneficiaries,” “stakeholders,” or “target populations.” Friendship implies presence and empathy, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\nStereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose the other eye—the one that perceives intangible depth, emotional truth, moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide stereoscopic vision, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in flat outlines, easily manipulated.\nEye One (Metrics and Tools): We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.\nEye Two (Meaning and Relationship): This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that calling out genocide might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n“Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”\n—(Paraphrased concept)\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact\nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: “craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve combined them into “crafting a garden,” which captures the delicate balance between artistry and cultivation—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea\nWhen you craft something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You have an intuitive sense of when the clay yields and how it wants to form. You measure, but you also feel. Similarly, a gardener sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You cannot force a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\nCrafting a garden merges these ideas: we pay reverent attention to every interaction (the “craft” side), while recognizing natural growth cycles (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.\nGarden-Craft Mindset: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of community trust. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n3. Lessons from Craftsmanship\nA craftsperson understands:\nAttentiveness: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.\nTiming and Rhythm: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, a sense of readiness is as crucial as speed.\nEmbrace of Imperfection: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we’re letting them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\nSuccess at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\nThink about a food forest versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, every moment is successful—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for the apples; it’s alive and successful in every moment.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”\nLet’s face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a “faster, cheaper, bigger” approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\nGenocide in Palestine: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.\nPost-Disaster Reconstruction: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\nA gardener doesn’t force the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is conducive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\nSustaining Long-Term Flourishing\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—we plant seeds that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts.\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work\nBloom can transform into being an organization that co-runs programs that aim to help people rediscover meaning in work and life. We used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. But now I’m proposing adopting the crafting-a-garden approach:\nPreparing the Soil (Community Readiness)\nInstead of imposing solutions, we spend time listening. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have conversations, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.\nPlanting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)\nWe collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—we craft the shape together.\nTending the Garden (Sustained Support)\nLike a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain ongoing relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.\nHarvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)\nOf course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics follow the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather stories, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\nOn the Edge of True Impact\nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight. But we can stand with communities in a lifelong posture of solidarity. We can name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\nWhat This Means for Our Work\nWhat This Could Mean\nInstead of our current approach—dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools—we could build like craftspeople:\nFrom Programs to Practice Spaces\nReplace fixed curriculum with living apprenticeship\nCreate conditions for natural emergence\nSupport direct transmission of wisdom\nLet timing follow organic development\nFrom Tools to Relationships\nBuild technology only when we truly have to\nStart with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out\nOnly add systems when the human work demands it\nLet tools serve connection, not replace it\nQuality recognition requires human presence\nLet technology serve connection, not replace it\nFocus on Depth Over Breadth\nBetter to work deeply with a few than superficially with many\nTrust that quality spreads naturally\nLet impact emerge from meaning\nMeasure What Matters\nTrack moments of real connection\nNotice where quality recognition develops\nDocument authentic transformation\nLet patterns emerge naturally\nThe future isn’t in better automation or control systems—it’s in better supporting our natural capacity to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true. Everything else follows from that.\nMaking Measurement Serve Life\nHere’s what this could look like:\nInstead of measuring:\nPlatform engagement\nGrowth projections\nImpact metrics\nResource utilization\nWe measure:\nMoments of meaning\nQuality of relationships\nWisdom transmission\nCommunity vitality\nThe key isn’t just changing what we measure, but how we measure: through direct relationship, story, observation, and community, not just data extraction.\n\nA Different Kind of Economy\nThis isn’t about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It’s about putting them in service of life. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning. When we do this:\nQuality naturally reduces waste\nRelationship naturally builds resilience\nMeaning naturally guides growth\nBeauty naturally creates value\n\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\nA Different Way Forward\nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading Winners Take All and realizing that what we’re doing isn’t what we’re talking about. We’re not saving the world—we’re helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency. We’re not even really helping them establish financially successful exponential businesses, because we don’t embody that. We embody something that matters to many, yet we’re not clear about that. Instead, we pretend to sell other things, and that tension hurts.\nThis isn’t abstract theory—there are organizations showing a different way forward. Buurtzorg in the Netherlands eliminated all management and metrics-based control, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country. Or Sounds True, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\nThese aren’t just nice stories—they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that honors quality recognition and craft. When I say craft, I don’t just mean artisanal products. I mean any work that:\nDevelops through direct relationship and apprenticeship\nValues mastery and depth alongside innovation\nCreates containers for meaningful work to emerge\nTrusts people’s natural capacity to recognize quality\nSo how do we shift from metrics mania to crafting a garden?\nPractice Stereoscopic Vision\nKeep your metrics if they help you see part of reality. But never lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees goodness, truth, beauty and possibilities for friendship.\nName Reality Clearly\nAvoid euphemisms. If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance turns exploitative, say so openly. Authentic relationships thrive on honesty, not polite obfuscation.\nSlow Down to Go Deeper\nSlowing the pace allows you to “listen to the clay,” to sense a community’s soul. Rushing might create short-term outputs but often yields shallow or harmful outcomes.\nTrust the Process of Craft\nAccept that not everything can be a linear blueprint. Gardening has seasons; some seeds fail. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks. This is growth, not a series of guaranteed leaps.\nAdopt the Gardener’s Long View\nA gardener invests in the soil, knowing real harvests may come years later—or bless future generations. In social impact, facing crises that range from genocide to climate disasters, we must hold a long-range vision. Even small acts of genuine friendship, alignment with our perception of beauty, can ripple beyond our immediate horizon.\n\nA Moment for Reflection\nWhat tension do you feel when pressured for quick results?\nWhich relationships in your work might you deepen rather than “scale”?\nWhere might you stand in truth—calling out systemic violence or injustice—rather than quietly conforming to funder-friendly narratives?\nAsking these questions is an act of reclaiming our second eye—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\nConclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—“They’re my friends”—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that relationship can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\nCrafting a garden of social impact means:\nTending relationships like precious seedlings.\nUsing skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions with communities, cultivating the context in the present moment - anticipating the “impact” in the future like a gardener planting seeds in the spring hopes for tomatoes in the summer, yet can’t ensure it.\n\n\nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that truly integrates rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—we simply refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of stereoscopic vision—two ways of seeing that yield a deeper perception of reality.\nIn the end, what we grow—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We may witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or a donor report existed. We may craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly come alive.\nAnd that, I believe, is what real impact looks like.\n\nFinal Thought\nWhen we stand next to someone—whether a refugee, a farmer crushed by debt, or a family in Palestine facing daily violence—and say, “You are not my data point; you are my friend,” we enact the very transformation we hope to see in the world. We show that life isn’t a mechanical series of inputs and outputs, but a shared tapestry of stories, joys, and struggles.\nMay we all become craftspeople and gardeners of this new paradigm—humans who measure thoughtfully but love wholeheartedly, who plant seeds of change with skilled hands and open hearts, cultivating relationships that outlast any spreadsheet.\nConclusion: Success at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact, but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way? Think of a food forest—it’s successful in every moment, even in winter’s decay. It isn’t waiting for harvest to declare success. Similarly, real transformation emerges when we let quality recognition guide us at each step, rather than fixating on some distant “scalable” end.\n“We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.”\nMaybe we start small, document what emerges when we trust this process, build evidence through real stories of transformation, and let the work speak for itself. We could become gardeners—crafting conditions for people to come alive—rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\nI believe we can pioneer a different way of working: trust quality recognition first, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves beauty. This approach might feel risky, but it leads to more authentic impact—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters real transformation.\nThat, in essence, is what I think social impact can be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true, we can finally step beyond hollow metrics into the living reality of meaningful work.]]]",

Where text was duplicated, it’s been **merged** into a single coherent passage.\n\n---\n\n### **From Metrics to Meaning: Crafting a Garden of Real Impact**\n\n**(P1)**  \n*“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”*  \n—Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n---\n\n## **Part I: The Moment That Changed Everything**\n\n**(P2)**  \nA few years ago, I was listening to the *On Being* podcast when I first encountered Father Greg Boyle’s story about Homeboy Industries—the largest gang rehabilitation program in the world. Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg about his intentions for his work. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n\n> “They’re my friends.”\n\n**(P3)**  \nThat single line plunged me into a deep realization: I had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a means to an end. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but my approach was often entangled in funding requirements, validation, and scale—chasing big stories and big numbers rather than authentic human connections. Suddenly, I saw why there was a disconnect between **measurements** and **meaning** in my work.\n\n**(P4)**  \nMoved by this insight, I decided to anchor myself more permanently in Lebanon. This choice wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised *relationship*—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street—individuals I had previously (often unconsciously) thought of as “beneficiaries.” Where once I saw “targets,” I began to see **humans with full stories**. And that shift changed everything.\n\n**(P5)**  \nIt upended my understanding of social impact. I’d been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for “scaling impact”—always with an eye on the next pilot or next data set. Yet here was Father Greg, a man who’d transformed countless lives, insisting that *friendship* lay at the heart of change more than metrics or theories of impact. I felt a shock of recognition, like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. By focusing on people as friends rather than instruments for metrics, I rediscovered the **primacy of human connection** over data.\n\n---\n\n## **Part II: The Crisis in Social Impact**\n\n**(P6)**  \nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often **instrumentalize** people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. I’m arguing that *the way we do anything is the way we do everything,* as the Zen tradition likes to say.\n\n**(P7)**  \nMany problems that the social impact and nonprofit space attempts to address are rooted in a deeply materialist understanding of reality—seeing nature as resources to extract and humans as tools to be used. Unless we **operate differently and with different assumptions**, we’ll end up re-creating the very problems we try to solve. It’s like setting a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York but going in the opposite direction in a tank: we might claim our destination is more “noble” (e.g., the SDGs versus profit maximization), yet we still tear up the road on the way. We need to get out of the tank, rethink our approach, and cultivate a garden wherever we’re planted.\n\n> “Bloom where you are planted.”  \n> —Saint Francis de Sales\n\n---\n\n### **Neoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong**\n\n**(P8)**  \nMicrofinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as it ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas. In India, farmers burdened by micro-debts faced harassment and, tragically, suicides. The metric—repayment rate—became more important than any relational approach to poverty.\n\n---\n\n### **Ignoring Genocide While Creating Jobs**\n\n**(P9)**  \nA stark example is the ongoing genocide in Palestine. International agencies pour resources into “job creation” for Palestinian refugees, touting how many short-term positions are funded or how many training certificates distributed. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is systemically downplayed—overshadowed by a tidy “jobs for refugees” success statistic. The raw metric of “employment rates” doesn’t speak to generational trauma, land theft, or the dismantling of entire communities. In focusing on short-term numeric “impact,” we often fail to address—or even openly name—root injustices.\n\n---\n\n### **Cookie-Cutter Approaches to Crises**\n\n**(P10)**  \nFollowing natural disasters—like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti—major NGOs rushed to build houses and infrastructure, guided by ROI and donor satisfaction. Many solutions fell apart due to minimal community input. A house built *for* people—rather than *with* them—ignores local wisdom and fosters dependency rather than resilience.\n\n**(P11)**  \nThroughout it all, we chase metrics: jobs created, houses built, tests passed, repayment rates achieved. We pride ourselves on scaling up “solutions.” Yet in conversation after conversation, I sense deep unease: behind the well-polished data, we are repeating the same logic of **control and extraction** that caused these crises in the first place.\n\n---\n\n## **Part III: A Different Way of Seeing**\n\n**(P12)**  \nFather Greg’s statement—*“They’re my friends”*—wasn’t just a warm sentiment. It was a radical critique of the mechanistic worldview that sees people as “beneficiaries,” “stakeholders,” or “target populations.” Friendship implies presence and empathy, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\n\n---\n\n### **Stereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open**\n\n**(P13)**  \nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose the other eye—the one that perceives intangible depth, emotional truth, moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide **stereoscopic vision**, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in flat outlines, easily manipulated.\n\n- **Eye One (Metrics and Tools)**: We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.  \n- **Eye Two (Meaning and Relationship)**: This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that calling out genocide might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n\n> “Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”  \n\n---\n\n## **Part IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact**\n\n**(P14)**  \nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: “craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve combined them into **“crafting a garden,”** which captures the delicate balance between artistry and cultivation—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea**\n\n**(P15)**  \nWhen you craft something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You measure, but you also *feel.* Similarly, a gardener sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You can’t force a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\n\n**(P16)**  \nCrafting a garden merges these ideas: we pay **reverent attention** to every interaction (the “craft” side), while recognizing **natural growth cycles** (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic**\n\n**(P17)**  \n- **Factory Mindset**: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.  \n- **Garden-Craft Mindset**: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\n\n**(P18)**  \nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of **community trust**. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Lessons from Craftsmanship**\n\n**(P19)**  \nA craftsperson understands:\n\n- **Attentiveness**: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.  \n- **Timing and Rhythm**: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, readiness is as crucial as speed.  \n- **Embrace of Imperfection**: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\n\n**(P20)**  \nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we let them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\n\n---\n\n### **Success at Every Step**\n\n**(P21)**  \nWe keep planning for future impact—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being **successful at every step** of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\n\n**(P22)**  \nThink about a **food forest** versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, every moment is successful—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for the apples; it’s alive and successful in every moment.\n\n---\n\n## **Part V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”**\n\n**(P23)**  \nLet’s face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a “faster, cheaper, bigger” approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\n\n**(P24)**  \n- **Genocide in Palestine**: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.  \n- **Post-Disaster Reconstruction**: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\n\n**(P25)**  \nA gardener doesn’t force the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is conducive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\n\n---\n\n### **Sustaining Long-Term Flourishing**\n\n**(P26)**  \nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—we plant seeds that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts.\n\n---\n\n## **Part VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work**\n\n**(P27)**  \nBloom can transform into an organization that co-runs programs aimed at helping people rediscover meaning in work and life. We used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. Now, I’m proposing we adopt the **crafting-a-garden** approach:\n\n- **Preparing the Soil (Community Readiness)**: Instead of imposing solutions, we spend time listening. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have conversations, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.  \n- **Planting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)**: We collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—we craft the shape together.  \n- **Tending the Garden (Sustained Support)**: Like a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain ongoing relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.  \n- **Harvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)**: Of course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics follow the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather stories, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\n\n**(P28)**  \nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight. But we can stand with communities in a lifelong posture of solidarity. We can name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\n\n---\n\n### **What This Means for Our Work**\n\n**(P29)**  \n**What This Could Mean**  \nInstead of our current approach—dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools—we could **build like craftspeople**:\n\n1. **From Programs to Practice Spaces**  \n   - Replace fixed curriculum with living apprenticeship  \n   - Create conditions for natural emergence  \n   - Support direct transmission of wisdom  \n   - Let timing follow organic development  \n\n2. **From Tools to Relationships**  \n   - Build technology only when we truly have to  \n   - Start with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out  \n   - Only add systems when the human work demands it  \n   - Let tools serve connection, not replace it  \n\n3. **Quality Recognition Requires Human Presence**  \n   - Let technology serve connection, not replace it  \n   - Focus on depth over breadth: better to work deeply with a few than superficially with many  \n   - Trust that quality spreads naturally, and let impact emerge from meaning  \n\n4. **Measure What Matters**  \n   - Track moments of real connection  \n   - Notice where quality recognition develops  \n   - Document authentic transformation  \n   - Let patterns emerge naturally  \n\n---\n\n### **Making Measurement Serve Life**\n\n**(P30)**  \nHere’s what this could look like:\n\n- **Instead of measuring**: platform engagement, growth projections, impact metrics, resource utilization  \n- **We measure**: moments of meaning, quality of relationships, wisdom transmission, community vitality  \n\nThe key isn’t just changing *what* we measure, but *how* we measure—through direct relationship, stories, observation, and community, not mere data extraction.\n\n---\n\n### **A Different Kind of Economy**\n\n**(P31)**  \nThis isn’t about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It’s about putting them in **service of life**. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning. When we do this:\n\n- Quality **naturally** reduces waste  \n- Relationship **naturally** builds resilience  \n- Meaning **naturally** guides growth  \n- Beauty **naturally** creates value  \n\n---\n\n## **Part VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm**\n\n**(P32)**  \nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading *Winners Take All* and realizing that what we’re doing isn’t what we’re talking about.

They got better patient outcomes, lower costs, and happier workers. Or **Sounds True**, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\n\n**(P34)**  \nThese aren’t just nice stories—they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that honors **quality recognition and craft**.

But never lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees goodness, truth, and beauty.  \n\n2. **Name Reality Clearly**  \n   - Avoid euphemisms.

It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden**\n\n**(P37)**  \nFather Greg Boyle’s line—*“They’re my friends”*—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that **relationship** can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\n\n**(P38)**  \nCrafting a garden of social impact means **tending relationships like precious seedlings** and using skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions with communities—cultivating the context in the present moment, much like a gardener planting seeds in spring hopes for tomatoes in summer, yet can’t guarantee them.\n\n**(P39)**  \nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that integrates **rational analysis with moral imagination**. We don’t discard numbers—we just refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of stereoscopic vision—two ways of seeing that yield deeper perception.\n\n**(P40)**  \nIn the end, what we grow—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We might witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or donor report existed. We could craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly come alive. And that, I believe, is what real impact looks like.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\n**(P41)**  \nWhen we stand next to someone—whether a refugee, a farmer crushed by debt, or a family in Palestine facing daily violence—and say, *“You are not my data point; you are my friend,”* we enact the very transformation we hope to see in the world. We show that life isn’t a mechanical series of inputs and outputs, but a shared tapestry of stories, joys, and struggles.\n\n**(P42)**  \nMay we all become **craftspeople and gardeners** of this new paradigm—humans who measure thoughtfully but love wholeheartedly, who plant seeds of change with skilled hands and open hearts, cultivating relationships that outlast any spreadsheet.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Success at Every Step**\n\n**(P43)**  \nWe keep planning for future impact, but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at **every step** of the way? Think of a food forest—it’s successful in every moment, even in winter’s decay. It isn’t waiting for harvest to declare success. Similarly, real transformation emerges when we let quality recognition guide us at each step, rather than fixating on some distant “scalable” end.\n\n**(P44)**  \n“*We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.*” Maybe we start small, document what emerges when we trust this process, build evidence through real stories of transformation, and let the work speak for itself. We could become gardeners—crafting conditions for people to come alive—rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\n\n**(P45)**  \nI believe we can pioneer a different way of working: *trust quality recognition first, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves beauty.* This approach might feel risky, but it leads to more authentic impact—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters real transformation. That, in essence, is what I think social impact can be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true, we can finally step beyond hollow metrics into the **living reality** of meaningful work.",

      "content": "can you review this and identify a better flow, awkward passages, and duplication fix any issues with grammar tone and return the entire essay edited in one go:\nHere are some ideas: Part I: The Moment That Changed Everything\nThis section works well as an introduction, using a personal anecdote to set up the essay's central theme. The writing is engaging and the message about the importance of authentic human connection comes through clearly. I would suggest a few minor tweaks:\n\nBreak up the longer paragraphs into shorter ones for easier reading. For example, split the third paragraph into two after \"individuals I had previously (often unconsciously) categorized as 'beneficiaries.'\"\nVary the sentence structure a bit more. There are several sentences in a row that start with \"I\" - try rephrasing a couple of them.\nThe final paragraph in this section is very powerful. Consider moving the sentence \"I felt a shock of recognition like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway\" to be the first sentence of that paragraph to draw the reader in.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\nThis section does an excellent job expanding the scope to discuss broader issues in the social impact sector. A few suggestions:\n\nThe first paragraph introduces the idea that organizations often \"instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change.\" It would be helpful to provide a concrete example here to illustrate this point.\nI love the metaphor about driving from LA to Portland in a tank. It's very vivid and drives home the point well. That said, the paragraph feels a bit long - try breaking it up or condensing slightly.\nThe examples under the \"Neoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\" heading are powerful but the section overall feels a tad disjointed. Consider adding some brief introductory and concluding sentences to tie it together more cohesively with the rest of Part II.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\nThe stereoscopic vision metaphor is extremely effective and works well here. A couple small notes:\n\nThere's a slight duplication of ideas between the first and second paragraphs. Condense them into one stronger lead-in before launching into the explanation of the two \"eyes.\"\nWhen you mention \"calling out genocide\" as part of the second eye perspective, it connects back nicely to Part II but might feel abrupt if someone skipped straight to this section. Consider a brief segue or reference to genocide to link the ideas.\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden\nThe crafting a garden metaphor is beautiful and encapsulates your vision meaningfully. Some suggestions:\n\nUnder \"The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\" consider adding 1-2 more specific examples of how social impact work sometimes falls into this paradigm. The examples you have in Part II could actually fit well here.\nThe \"Lessons from Craftsmanship\" section is excellent - the three key points (Attentiveness, Timing/Rhythm, Embrace of Imperfection) connect seamlessly to social impact. If anything, this section could even be expanded with another illustrative example or two.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of \"Faster, Cheaper, Bigger\"\nThis section hits on a very real tension in the field. The examples you provide are relevant and underpin your argument well. One possibility for improvement:\n\nThe section on \"Sustaining Long-Term Flourishing\" could be woven in more throughout Part V rather than tacked on at the end. Consider integrating a sentence or two about this after each of the examples you give (genocide in Palestine, post-disaster reconstruction) to drive home how a more relational approach could make a difference.\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom\nIt's great that you ground the philosophy in the concrete practices and possibilities at Bloom. A few tweaks to consider:\n\nThe \"Instead of our current approach\" section is highly skimmable and engaging. See if you can apply a similar format to some of the other sections that are a bit more dense prose. Using bullet points, short paragraphs, or visuals can help break things up.\nI would move the \"A Different Kind of Economy\" part to be the conclusion of this section, rather than sandwiched in the middle. End with the inspiring vision that \"Quality naturally reduces waste, Relationship naturally builds resilience\" etc.\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\nThe examples of Buurtzorg and Sounds True are excellent illustrations of the core concepts in action. I suggest:\n\nClarifying the through-line that links this section to the previous ones. How does it build on or conclude the thoughts from Parts IV-VI?\nThe \"Conclusion: Success at Every Step\" paragraphs that come after the Final Thought seem a little out of place. Integrate these ideas elsewhere or consider removing them if they are redundant to other points you've made.\nThe final few paragraphs are inspiring but very lofty. Ground it with a final specific example of what this kind of \"different way of working\" could look like - either a real organization or a hypothetical.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe interweaving of the personal narrative with the bigger picture issues works really well to keep the reader engaged.\nThe garden metaphor is powerful and used effectively throughout. I wonder if it could be brought in even more consistently from the beginning (rather than primarily concentrated in Parts IV and VI).\nThere are a lot of sub-sections and not always a clear arc linking them. Consider pruning any redundant points and making sure each section clearly builds on the previous ones.\nThe writing is almost poetic in places, which fits the topic well. That said, varying the sentence lengths a bit more could improve the flow. Throw in a few more short, punchy lines amidst the beautiful longer sentences.\n\nI hope this feedback is helpful as you refine this thought-provoking piece! Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of the suggestions.\n\n[[[From Metrics to Meaning: \nCrafting a Garden of Real Impact\n“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”\n—Martin Luther King Jr.\nPart I: The Moment That Changed Everything\nA few years ago, I was listening to the On Being podcast when I first encountered Father Greg Boyle’s story about Homeboy Industries—the largest gang rehabilitation program in the world. Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg about his intentions for his work. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n“They’re my friends.”\nThat single line plunged me into a deep realization: I had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a means to an end. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but the means were often confused between my own goals, funding, validation, and scale, hinged on chasing big stories and big numbers rather than authentic human connections. I suddenly felt clear about why I had this gnawing notion that there was a disconnect between me and my work, between measurements and meaning.\nI moved more permanently to Lebanon, driven less by strategy and more by trusting a deeper calling: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street—individuals I had previously (often unconsciously) categorized as “beneficiaries.” Where once I saw “targets,” I began to see humans with full stories. And that shift changed everything.\nIt was a moment that upended my understanding of social impact. I’d been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for “scaling impact”—always with an eye on the next pilot or next data set. Yet here was Father Greg, a man who’d transformed countless lives, insisting that friendship lay at the heart of change more than metrics or theories of impact. \nI felt a shock of recognition like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in my pursuit of “doing good,” I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new “success” story, but life is not a game, and people are not pawns. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn’t rooting. That single line—“They’re my friends”—pierced me with its radical simplicity.\nAnd so I made a choice: rather than continuing my peripatetic rounds, I would anchor myself where I was needed. I put down deeper roots in Lebanon. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised relationship—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. In stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of human connection over data.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. I’m arguing that the way we do anything is the way we do everything, as the zen tradition likes to say. \nI believe many of the problems the social impact and nonprofit space attempts to address is related to a deeply rooted materialist understanding of reality. This leads us to see nature as natural resources to extract and humans as resources to be used. Without acknowledging or recognizing this I believe we will re-create many of the problems if we don’t operate differently and with different assumptions. It’s as if we’re set a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York, and instead, we’re going from Los Angeles to Portland, except we’re driving a tank, so it doesn’t matter if our goals and destination is any “better” - SDGs verses profit maximization, we’re still going to tear up the road along the way. We need to get out of the tank, re-think our lives, and decide to work where we are and cultivate a garden wherever we’re planted. \n\"Bloom where you are planted.\" – Saint Francis de Sales\nNeoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\nMicrofinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as it ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas. In India, farmers burdened by micro-debts faced harassment and, tragically, suicides. The metric—repayment rate—became more important than any relational approach to poverty.\nIgnoring Genocide While Creating Jobs\nA stark example is the ongoing genocide in Palestine. International agencies pour resources into “job creation” for Palestinian refugees, touting how many short-term positions are funded or how many training certificates distributed. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is systemically downplayed—overshadowed by a tidy “jobs for refugees” success statistic. The raw metric of “employment rates” doesn’t speak to generational trauma, land theft, or the dismantling of entire communities.\nIn focusing on short-term numeric “impact,” we often fail to address—or even openly name—root injustices.\nCookie-Cutter Approaches to Crises\nFollowing natural disasters—like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti—major NGOs rushed to build houses and infrastructure, guided by ROI and donor satisfaction. Many solutions fell apart due to minimal community input. A house built for people—rather than with them—ignores local wisdom and fosters dependency rather than resilience.\nThroughout it all, we chase metrics: jobs created, houses built, tests passed, repayment rates achieved. We pride ourselves on scaling up “solutions.” Yet in conversation after conversation, I hear deep unease: a sense that behind the well-polished data, we are repeating the same logic of control and extraction that caused these crises in the first place.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\nFather Greg’s statement—“They’re my friends”—wasn’t just a warm sentiment. It was a radical critique of the mechanistic worldview that sees people as “beneficiaries,” “stakeholders,” or “target populations.” Friendship implies presence and empathy, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\nStereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose the other eye—the one that perceives intangible depth, emotional truth, moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide stereoscopic vision, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in flat outlines, easily manipulated.\nEye One (Metrics and Tools): We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.\nEye Two (Meaning and Relationship): This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that calling out genocide might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n“Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”\n—(Paraphrased concept)\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact\nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: “craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve combined them into “crafting a garden,” which captures the delicate balance between artistry and cultivation—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea\nWhen you craft something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You have an intuitive sense of when the clay yields and how it wants to form. You measure, but you also feel. Similarly, a gardener sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You cannot force a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\nCrafting a garden merges these ideas: we pay reverent attention to every interaction (the “craft” side), while recognizing natural growth cycles (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.\nGarden-Craft Mindset: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of community trust. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n3. Lessons from Craftsmanship\nA craftsperson understands:\nAttentiveness: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.\nTiming and Rhythm: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, a sense of readiness is as crucial as speed.\nEmbrace of Imperfection: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we’re letting them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\nSuccess at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\nThink about a food forest versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, every moment is successful—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for the apples; it’s alive and successful in every moment.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”\nLet’s face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a “faster, cheaper, bigger” approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\nGenocide in Palestine: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.\nPost-Disaster Reconstruction: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\nA gardener doesn’t force the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is conducive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\nSustaining Long-Term Flourishing\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—we plant seeds that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts.\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work\nBloom can transform into being an organization that co-runs programs that aim to help people rediscover meaning in work and life. We used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. But now I’m proposing adopting the crafting-a-garden approach:\nPreparing the Soil (Community Readiness)\nInstead of imposing solutions, we spend time listening. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have conversations, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.\nPlanting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)\nWe collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—we craft the shape together.\nTending the Garden (Sustained Support)\nLike a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain ongoing relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.\nHarvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)\nOf course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics follow the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather stories, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\nOn the Edge of True Impact\nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight. But we can stand with communities in a lifelong posture of solidarity. We can name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\nWhat This Means for Our Work\nWhat This Could Mean\nInstead of our current approach—dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools—we could build like craftspeople:\nFrom Programs to Practice Spaces\nReplace fixed curriculum with living apprenticeship\nCreate conditions for natural emergence\nSupport direct transmission of wisdom\nLet timing follow organic development\nFrom Tools to Relationships\nBuild technology only when we truly have to\nStart with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out\nOnly add systems when the human work demands it\nLet tools serve connection, not replace it\nQuality recognition requires human presence\nLet technology serve connection, not replace it\nFocus on Depth Over Breadth\nBetter to work deeply with a few than superficially with many\nTrust that quality spreads naturally\nLet impact emerge from meaning\nMeasure What Matters\nTrack moments of real connection\nNotice where quality recognition develops\nDocument authentic transformation\nLet patterns emerge naturally\nThe future isn’t in better automation or control systems—it’s in better supporting our natural capacity to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true. Everything else follows from that.\nMaking Measurement Serve Life\nHere’s what this could look like:\nInstead of measuring:\nPlatform engagement\nGrowth projections\nImpact metrics\nResource utilization\nWe measure:\nMoments of meaning\nQuality of relationships\nWisdom transmission\nCommunity vitality\nThe key isn’t just changing what we measure, but how we measure: through direct relationship, story, observation, and community, not just data extraction.\n\nA Different Kind of Economy\nThis isn’t about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It’s about putting them in service of life. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning. When we do this:\nQuality naturally reduces waste\nRelationship naturally builds resilience\nMeaning naturally guides growth\nBeauty naturally creates value\n\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\nA Different Way Forward\nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading Winners Take All and realizing that what we’re doing isn’t what we’re talking about. We’re not saving the world—we’re helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency. We’re not even really helping them establish financially successful exponential businesses, because we don’t embody that. We embody something that matters to many, yet we’re not clear about that. Instead, we pretend to sell other things, and that tension hurts.\nThis isn’t abstract theory—there are organizations showing a different way forward. Buurtzorg in the Netherlands eliminated all management and metrics-based control, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country. Or Sounds True, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\nThese aren’t just nice stories—they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that honors quality recognition and craft. When I say craft, I don’t just mean artisanal products. I mean any work that:\nDevelops through direct relationship and apprenticeship\nValues mastery and depth alongside innovation\nCreates containers for meaningful work to emerge\nTrusts people’s natural capacity to recognize quality\nSo how do we shift from metrics mania to crafting a garden?\nPractice Stereoscopic Vision\nKeep your metrics if they help you see part of reality. But never lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees goodness, truth, beauty and possibilities for friendship.\nName Reality Clearly\nAvoid euphemisms. If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance turns exploitative, say so openly. Authentic relationships thrive on honesty, not polite obfuscation.\nSlow Down to Go Deeper\nSlowing the pace allows you to “listen to the clay,” to sense a community’s soul. Rushing might create short-term outputs but often yields shallow or harmful outcomes.\nTrust the Process of Craft\nAccept that not everything can be a linear blueprint. Gardening has seasons; some seeds fail. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks. This is growth, not a series of guaranteed leaps.\nAdopt the Gardener’s Long View\nA gardener invests in the soil, knowing real harvests may come years later—or bless future generations. In social impact, facing crises that range from genocide to climate disasters, we must hold a long-range vision. Even small acts of genuine friendship, alignment with our perception of beauty, can ripple beyond our immediate horizon.\n\nA Moment for Reflection\nWhat tension do you feel when pressured for quick results?\nWhich relationships in your work might you deepen rather than “scale”?\nWhere might you stand in truth—calling out systemic violence or injustice—rather than quietly conforming to funder-friendly narratives?\nAsking these questions is an act of reclaiming our second eye—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\nConclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—“They’re my friends”—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that relationship can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\nCrafting a garden of social impact means:\nTending relationships like precious seedlings.\nUsing skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions with communities, cultivating the context in the present moment - anticipating the “impact” in the future like a gardener planting seeds in the spring hopes for tomatoes in the summer, yet can’t ensure it.\n\n\nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that truly integrates rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—we simply refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of stereoscopic vision—two ways of seeing that yield a deeper perception of reality.\nIn the end, what we grow—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We may witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or a donor report existed. We may craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly come alive.\nAnd that, I believe, is what real impact looks like.\n\nFinal Thought\nWhen we stand next to someone—whether a refugee, a farmer crushed by debt, or a family in Palestine facing daily violence—and say, “You are not my data point; you are my friend,” we enact the very transformation we hope to see in the world. We show that life isn’t a mechanical series of inputs and outputs, but a shared tapestry of stories, joys, and struggles.\nMay we all become craftspeople and gardeners of this new paradigm—humans who measure thoughtfully but love wholeheartedly, who plant seeds of change with skilled hands and open hearts, cultivating relationships that outlast any spreadsheet.\nConclusion: Success at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact, but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way? Think of a food forest—it’s successful in every moment, even in winter’s decay. It isn’t waiting for harvest to declare success. Similarly, real transformation emerges when we let quality recognition guide us at each step, rather than fixating on some distant “scalable” end.\n“We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.”\nMaybe we start small, document what emerges when we trust this process, build evidence through real stories of transformation, and let the work speak for itself. We could become gardeners—crafting conditions for people to come alive—rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\nI believe we can pioneer a different way of working: trust quality recognition first, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves beauty. This approach might feel risky, but it leads to more authentic impact—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters real transformation.\nThat, in essence, is what I think social impact can be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true, we can finally step beyond hollow metrics into the living reality of meaningful work.]]]",

Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg about his intentions for his work. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n\n> “They’re my friends.”\n\nThat single line plunged me into a **deep realization**: I had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a **means to an end**. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but the means were entangled with my own goals, funding pressures, and the allure of scale. I suddenly felt clear about why there was a gnawing sense of **disconnect** between measurements and meaning.\n\nI moved more permanently to **Lebanon**, driven less by strategy and more by trusting a deeper calling: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street—individuals I had **previously (often unconsciously)** categorized as “beneficiaries.” Where once I saw “targets,” I began to see **humans with full stories**. That shift changed everything.\n\nUp to that point, I’d been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for “scaling impact.” Yet here was **Father Greg**, who had transformed countless lives, insisting that **friendship** lay at the heart of change more than any theory of impact or metrics. I felt a shock of recognition, as if someone flicked on a light in a dark hallway. In my quest to “do good,” I had been adopting a worldview where **people became instruments** for numbers: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new “success” story—but life is not a game, and people are not pawns.\n\nSo I made a choice: instead of continuing my peripatetic rounds, I **anchored** myself where I was needed. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise any massive scale on a graph. But it promised **relationship**—the kind Father Greg spoke of. Stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of **human connection** over data.\n\n---\n\n## **Part II: The Crisis in Social Impact**\n\nMy journey might sound personal, but it highlights a **wider crisis** pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase **scale** and **efficiency**, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. In my view, the way we do anything is the way we do everything.\n\nMany of the challenges the nonprofit space addresses stem from a **deeply rooted materialist view**—seeing nature as “resources” to be extracted and humans as “resources” to be used. If we don’t shift these assumptions, we risk re-creating the problems we claim to solve. It’s like setting a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York but instead ending up in Portland—while driving a tank that tears up roads, regardless of whether our goals are the SDGs or profit maximization. We need to **get out of the tank**, rethink our lives, and cultivate a garden where we’re planted.\n\n> “Bloom where you are planted.”  \n> —Saint Francis de Sales\n\n### **Neoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong**\n\n**Microfinance** soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. Yet as it ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas. In India, farmers burdened by micro-debts faced harassment and, tragically, suicides. The metric—repayment rate—became more important than a relational approach to poverty.\n\n### **Ignoring Genocide While Creating Jobs**\n\nA stark example is the **ongoing genocide in Palestine**. International agencies pour resources into “job creation” for Palestinian refugees, touting how many short-term positions they’ve funded or how many training certificates they’ve issued. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is systemically downplayed—replaced by a neat “jobs for refugees” statistic. The raw metric of “employment rates” doesn’t speak to **generational trauma**, **land theft**, or the **dismantling** of entire communities.\n\nBy focusing on **short-term numeric “impact,”** we fail to address—or even openly name—root injustices.\n\n### **Cookie-Cutter Approaches to Crises**\n\nFollowing disasters—like the 2010 earthquake in **Haiti**—major NGOs rushed to build houses and infrastructure, guided by ROI and donor satisfaction. Many efforts fell apart due to minimal community input. A house built *for* people, instead of *with* them, ignores local wisdom and fosters dependency rather than resilience.\n\nThroughout it all, we chase metrics: **jobs created, houses built, tests passed, repayment rates achieved**. We pride ourselves on scaling “solutions.” Yet beneath the well-polished data is a **deep unease**: are we simply reproducing the same logic of control and extraction that caused these crises in the first place?\n\n---\n\n## **Part III: A Different Way of Seeing**\n\n**Father Greg’s** statement—“They’re my friends”—wasn’t just a nice sentiment. It was a **radical critique** of the mechanistic worldview that sees people as “beneficiaries” or “target populations.” Friendship implies presence and empathy. It **refuses** to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\n\n### **Stereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open**\n\nIn our quest to measure impact, we tend to use **only one eye**: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose the second eye—the one that perceives **intangible depth**, **emotional truth**, **moral complexity**. With both eyes open, we gain **stereoscopic vision**—true depth perception. Without it, we see the world in flat outlines, easily manipulated.\n\n- **Eye One (Metrics and Tools)**: We **do** need numbers. They guide resources and demonstrate accountability.  \n- **Eye Two (Meaning and Relationship)**: This eye sees the **humanity** behind the metrics. It recognizes that **calling out genocide** can matter more than a superficial job statistic. It sees how a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n\n> “Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”  \n\n---\n\n## **Part IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact**\n\nI’ve long resonated with **two metaphors**—“craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve merged them into the phrase **“crafting a garden,”** which captures the **delicate balance** between careful artistry and letting nature unfold.\n\n### **1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea**\n\nWhen you **craft** something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on **skill**, **attention**, and **care**. You measure, but you also feel. Similarly, a **gardener** sets conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches **growth emerge**. You can’t **force** a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\n\n**Crafting a garden** merges these ideas: we give **reverent attention** to each interaction (the craft side) while **recognizing natural growth cycles** (the garden side). We create conditions for **transformation** without rigid control.\n\n### **2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic**\n\n- **Factory Mindset**: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.  \n- **Garden-Craft Mindset**: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the **unpredictable beauty** of living systems.\n\nSocial enterprises often behave like factories, chasing immediate “wins” while neglecting the community’s fertile soil of **trust**. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no **lasting root structure**.\n\n### **3. Lessons from Craftsmanship**\n\nA **craftsperson** understands:\n\n- **Attentiveness**: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.  \n- **Timing and Rhythm**: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it. In social impact, a sense of readiness is as crucial as speed.  \n- **Embrace of Imperfection**: Real creations often bear the marks of process, like communities may have “flaws” that are hidden sources of resilience.\n\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait for certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust natural cycles. Treating a community like a **“crafted garden”** allows it to keep its selfhood while we offer **supportive hands**.\n\n### **Success at Every Step**\n\nWe keep planning for **future impact**—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future milestone? What if it’s about being **successful at every step**, whether or not we arrive where we originally planned?\n\nThink of a **food forest** vs. a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. The food forest, however, is **successful at every moment**—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for apples to declare success; it’s alive **now**.\n\n---\n\n## **Part V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”**\n\nLet’s face it: funders, donors, and boards often prefer “faster, cheaper, bigger.” They want to see **hundreds of houses** built or **thousands of jobs** created—**now**. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma or confronting systemic injustice are tough to capture in a bar chart.\n\n- **Genocide in Palestine**: If we stay silent on structural oppression, no short-term jobs program will address the root violence.  \n- **Post-Disaster Reconstruction**: When we fail to **co-create** with local communities, our “efficiency” can yield irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\n\nA gardener doesn’t pry open a seed to “help” it sprout. They ensure the soil is rich and the environment supportive. Similarly, a **craftsperson** learns the wood’s grain instead of “shaving wood faster.” Otherwise, we crack and split the very materials we hope to shape.\n\n### **Sustaining Long-Term Flourishing**\n\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or cultivate **genuine friendships**—like Father Greg does—we plant seeds that sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts.\n\n---\n\n## **Part VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work**\n\nConsider how we might transform a social impact organization—like **Bloom**—from a factory model into something more alive. We used to **focus on performance dashboards**; now let’s adopt the crafting-a-garden approach:\n\n### **Preparing the Soil (Community Readiness)**\n\n- Instead of imposing solutions, **listen**.  \n- Move beyond “user feedback” forms. Have real conversations, learn local stories, see what’s already happening.  \n\n### **Planting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)**\n\n- Collaborate with participants as **partners**, not recipients.  \n- Ask, “What do you envision?” rather than dictating solutions.  \n- Craft **impact metrics** together, letting shape emerge **organically**.\n\n### **Tending the Garden (Sustained Support)**\n\n- Like a gardener who checks moisture and weeds, maintain **ongoing relationships**—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship.  \n- Honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate **emergent growth**.\n\n### **Harvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)**\n\n- Of course we measure—numbers, surveys—but **these metrics follow the meaning** rather than replace it.  \n- Gather **stories** of intangible transformations: self-confidence, alliances, deeper alignment.\n\n### **On the Edge of True Impact**\n\nReal social impact can’t be forced or “sped up” overnight. We can’t solve all problems immediately, but we can stand with communities in a **lifelong posture** of solidarity. We can name injustices, rather than burying them beneath “neutral data.” In that naming, in that presence, seeds of hope stay alive.\n\n---\n\n## **What This Means for Our Work**\n\n### **From Programs to Practice Spaces**\n\n- Replace fixed curricula with **living apprenticeship**.  \n- Let timing follow **organic development**.  \n- Support direct transmission of **wisdom**.\n\n### **From Tools to Relationships**\n\n- Build technology only when **absolutely needed**.  \n- Start with phone calls, personal connection, and **figuring things out**.  \n- Let tools **serve** connection, not replace it.\n\n### **Focus on Depth Over Breadth**\n\n- Work **deeply** with a few rather than superficially with many.  \n- Trust that **quality** spreads naturally.  \n- Let impact **emerge** from meaning.\n\n### **Measure What Matters**\n\n- Track **moments of real connection**.  \n- Notice where **quality recognition** develops.  \n- Document **authentic transformation**.  \n- Let patterns **emerge** naturally.\n\n### **Making Measurement Serve Life**\n\nInstead of measuring:\n\n- Platform engagement  \n- Growth projections  \n- Impact metrics  \n- Resource utilization\n\nWe measure:\n\n- **Moments of meaning**  \n- **Quality of relationships**  \n- **Wisdom transmission**  \n- **Community vitality**\n\nThe key isn’t just changing **what** we measure, but **how**—through direct relationship, stories, and observation, not mere data extraction.\n\n---\n\n## **Part VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm**\n\n### **A Different Way Forward**\n\nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space—especially after reading *Winners Take All*—and realizing we’re often **not** doing what we claim. We’re not saving the world. We’re helping people find **community**, **confidence**, **agency**. We aren’t actually building giant “exponential businesses,” because we don’t embody that. Instead, we pretend to sell something else, and that tension hurts.\n\nYet there **are** organizations showing a different way. **Buurtzorg** in the Netherlands removed management hierarchies, trusting nurses to perceive patient needs. They get better outcomes at lower costs. **Sounds True** built a $60M publishing company by honoring both **business sense** and **deeper wisdom**, proving spiritual values can drive real success.\n\nThey point to a different way of working that **honors quality recognition and craft**. By “craft,” I don’t just mean artisanal products—I mean any work that:\n\n- Develops through **direct relationship** and apprenticeship  \n- Values **mastery and depth** alongside innovation  \n- Creates containers for **meaningful work** to emerge  \n- Trusts people’s **natural capacity** to recognize quality  \n\n### **Practical Shifts**\n\n- **Practice Stereoscopic Vision**: Keep metrics if they help, but don’t lose the second eye—the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension.  \n- **Name Reality Clearly**: If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance is exploitative, say so. Relationships thrive on honesty.  \n- **Slow Down to Go Deeper**: Rushing might create short-term outputs but can yield shallow or harmful outcomes.  \n- **Trust the Process of Craft**: Not everything is a linear blueprint. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks.  \n- **Adopt the Gardener’s Long View**: Invest in the soil, knowing the real harvest may come years later—or bless future generations.\n\n---\n\n### **A Moment for Reflection**\n\n1. What tension do you feel when pressured for **quick results**?  \n2. Which relationships in your work might you **deepen** rather than “scale”?  \n3. Where might you stand in truth—**calling out systemic violence**—rather than quietly conforming to “funder-friendly” narratives?\n\nAsking these questions reclaims our **second eye**—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s the necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden**\n\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—*“They’re my friends”*—stays with me as a **beacon**. It reminds me that **relationship** can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we slip into the **mechanistic** mindset we meant to oppose.\n\n**Crafting a garden** of social impact means:\n\n- **Tending relationships** like precious seedlings  \n- **Using skilled, attentive “craft”** to shape solutions in the present, trusting that the “impact” will follow in its own season  \n\nYes, gardens demand **consistent care**; craft demands **repeated practice and humility**. But it’s the only path I’ve found that fuses rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—we just **refuse to make them our God**. We combine **metrics with love**, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That’s the essence of **stereoscopic vision**—two ways of seeing that yield deeper perception.\n\nIn the end, what grows—in ourselves and our communities—can **far surpass** the limited ambitions of mere “outputs” or “outcomes.” We may see genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing in places once reduced to metrics. We can **craft gardens** so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly **come alive**.\n\n> “We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.”\n\nMaybe we start small: documenting what emerges when we trust this process, building evidence through **real stories** of transformation, letting the work speak for itself. We could become **gardeners**, crafting conditions for people to come alive, rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\n\nI believe we can pioneer a **different way of working**: trust **quality recognition** first, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves **beauty**. This approach may feel risky, but it leads to a more **authentic impact**—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters true transformation.\n\nAnd that, in essence, is what I think social impact **can** be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s **beautiful and true**, we finally step beyond **hollow metrics** into the **living reality** of meaningful work.",
