This focus underlines the importance of financial awareness for future business endeavors, illustrating how foundational these skills are.\n\n**Assessing financial understanding**\n\nI'm gathering info on the need for personal financial management and planning in startups. It seems participants often overlook its importance, as their accounts lack comprehensive details and records.\n\n**Understanding financial habits**\n\nI'm noticing how many young people and those without accounting tools, often rely on scattershot receipts and Excel. They lack the awareness of financial management's significance for sound business decisions.\n\n**Assessing business dynamics**\n\nI'm analyzing data on customer trends, sales fluctuations, cash flow, and market conditions to enhance decision-making and identify potential debt situations in Iraq.\n\n**Clarifying financial insights**\n\nOK, let me see.

Adjusting our models to reflect core pressing issues while adding key financial insights, like setting budgets and savings goals, ensures comprehensive and practical training.\n\n**Enhancing business survival**\n\nOK, let's think about this: financial education is crucial for business survival, especially for young entrepreneurs. Providing clear information on expenses, income management, and budgeting is vital.\n\n**Revising the course**\n\nI’m refining a financial literacy course to emphasize personal financial management, goal setting, and practical finance tools, ensuring participant engagement through interactivity and relevant examples.",

      "content": "Can you further develop the outline above, i want the content for the section and speakers notes so I can give the session. Also align it with the module where we talk about sustainability - i sort of like the idea of a sustainability training takling about financial literacy because it's the basis of sustainability \nClimate change concerns and the escalating demand for a sustainable future are two prevalent challenges of the 21st century. The world of finance promises a worthwhile solution for these issues. In this scenario, sustainable finance education is gaining paramount significance. Dig deeper to discover more about this concept and figure out how environmental sustainability is linked to the financial sector. \n\nThe connection between finance and sustainability\nThe process of managing one’s capital to accomplish life goals is known as financial planning. It entails setting aside money for savings and making a budget for current costs. Moreover, it is about financial freedom. Though sustainability and finance are sometimes seen as distinct concepts, they are actually intrinsically related. \n\nKeep in mind that the choices we make regarding our financial resources have a big effect on the environment. We can substantially lessen our carbon footprint and contribute to a better future by using sustainable energy sources like wind and hydroelectricity.\n\nYou may also like: Importance of financial literacy in India\n\nFinancial literacy of a net-zero lifestyle\nAdopting a net-zero lifestyle allows individuals to make significant contributions towards sustainability. They produce an equivalent amount of renewable energy as their consumption, thereby achieving a balanced carbon footprint. The best eco-friendly financial practices have a crucial role in enabling a net-zero lifestyle by making conscious decisions that have long-term environmental benefits.\n\nBudgeting to achieve a net-zero lifestyle\nWith proper sustainable budgeting skills, you will be able to make the financial move to bring down your overall costs. Expensive sustainable living is not a necessity. Rather, small incremental changes such as repairing items instead of replacing them can catalyse financial benefits. \n\nWith eco-friendly financial education, you will learn how to set long-term goals and a budget that supports your net-zero lifestyle. It will ensure that you can make a significant impact on the environment and achieve financial savings.\n\nAlso read: Financial freedom formula\n\nThe key principles of green financial literacy\nGreen finance revolves around supporting prosperity while staying within the ecological limits of the planet. This concept of green financial literacy is based on the five following principles:\n\nThe wellbeing principle\nThis principle of environmental literacy programs focuses on developing a people-centred economy for everyone to enjoy genuine, shared prosperity. The idea behind this is wealth generation to support wellbeing. Therefore, The ultimate focus is on prioritising investments in sustainable natural systems. \n\nWith this particular approach toward climate-smart financial literacy, individuals can witness a rise in opportunities for decent livelihoods. Even though it is based on individual choices, this principle revolves around collective action for public goods. \n\nThe justice principle\nThe purpose of sustainable money management is to promote equity between generations. Therefore, this type of financial literacy is all-inclusive and does not believe in discrimination. It concentrates on eliminating elite capture and supports equal decision-making as well as its benefits. \n\nWith an extensive focus on green investing education, promoting equitable allocation of opportunities becomes easier. Moreover, it supports the equal distribution of the positive impacts of the desired outcomes. It is an effort to reduce disparities between people with a long-term economic outlook. \n\nThe justice principle prioritises solidarity to strengthen social ties and support human rights. Moreover, it concentrates on the rights of indigenous communities and minorities for sustainable development. \n\nThe planetary boundaries principle\nThis is an important aspect of environmental impact investing because it focuses on protecting and restoring nature. Moreover, it continues to develop an inclusive green economy which recognises the diverse values of nature. These values covering functional, cultural, and ecological aspects are an extensive part of green economy education. \n\nIt uses the precautionary principle to prevent the loss of vital natural capital and the infringement of ecological bounds. At the same time, the principle acknowledges the limited substitutability of natural capital with other capitals.\n\nIt makes investments in soil, water, air, biodiversity, and natural systems preservation, growth, and restoration. It is creative in the way it manages natural systems, drawing on characteristics like circularity. Moreover, the principle is in line with the livelihoods of the local people, which depend on natural systems and biodiversity.\n\nThe efficiency and sufficiency principle\nWhen sustainable wealth management is aligned with safeguarding the planet, it promotes balanced consumption and production. A green economy that is inclusive is circular, resource-conserving, low-carbon, and varied. \n\nThe concept welcomes novel approaches to economic growth that tackle the problem of generating prosperity within the confines of our planet. It acknowledges that for us to stay within the bounds of our planet, there needs to be a major worldwide shift toward keeping the consumption of natural resources to levels that are physically sustainable.\n\nThis focuses on a “social floor” of fundamental goods and services consumption that is necessary to meet people’s needs for wellness and dignity. Additionally, it concentrates on the inappropriate peaks of consumption. \n\nThe efficiency and sufficiency principle will always connect prices, subsidies, and incentives with the evident costs in society. It is done through mechanisms where the polluter is made to pay, and benefits are available for individuals focused on green outcomes. \n\nThe good governance principle\nAccountable and resilient institutions need to be at the forefront of promoting environmental awareness in finance. An inclusive green economy relies on empirical facts to inform its norms and institutions, which are multidisciplinary. It will utilise local knowledge for adaptive strategy in addition to strong science and economics.\n\nIt is backed by institutions that are capable of carrying out their various responsibilities in an effective, efficient, and accountable manner. These institutions are integrated, cooperative, and cohesive both vertically across governance levels and horizontally across sectors.\n\nTo ensure that societal demand complements intelligent leadership, it necessitates public engagement. Prior informed consent and democratic accountability from entrenched interests in all institutions—public, private, and civil society are also necessary.\n\nWhile upholding shared standards and compliance systems, it encourages decentralised decision-making for local economies and the management of natural systems. It creates a financial system that is structured to safely advance societal goals while promoting sustainability and wellbeing.\n\nAlso read: What is financial procrastination\n\nEnding Note\nFinancial literacy and green finance are crucial instruments in dealing with climate change and promoting a more sustainable future. They are interdependent, with each complementing the other to achieve maximum impact. \n\nAs we strive towards sustainability, it is essential to enhance climate-responsible finance education to make informed decisions. By doing so, we can empower ourselves with the knowledge and tools necessary to improve our personal financial health and the wellbeing of the planet.#\nTitle\nFocus\nResources Used\nSustainable

Every financial decision we make has an environmental impact. For example, choosing to invest in energy-efficient appliances may have a higher upfront cost but saves money and reduces energy consumption in the long run.\"\n\n- \"Sustainable finance is about considering environmental, social, and governance factors when making financial decisions. It's not just about maximizing profits but also about contributing positively to society and the environment.\"\n\n### **Module 3: Personal Financial Management as a Tool for Sustainability**\n\n**Speaker's Notes for 3.3 Practical Budgeting Exercise:**\n\n- \"Let's get hands-on with budgeting. Using the template provided, start by listing all your sources of income. Next, detail your expenses—both fixed (like rent) and variable (like food and entertainment).\"\n\n- \"As you fill this out, think about where you might be able to reduce expenses, especially those that could also benefit the environment, such as cutting down on electricity usage.\"\n\n**Speaker's Notes for 3.4 Financial Planning for Sustainable Goals:**\n\n- \"Setting financial goals is crucial. Ensure that your goals are SMART. For example, 'I want to save 10% of my income over the next six months to invest in a solar water heater for my home.' This goal is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.\"\n\n### **Module 4: Practical Application – Home Energy Audit and Budgeting**\n\n**Speaker's Notes for 4.1 Conducting a Home Energy Audit:**\n\n- \"An energy audit helps you understand how much energy your home uses and identify ways to reduce consumption. Common areas to check include insulation, windows, lighting, and appliances.\"\n\n- \"Don't worry if you can't access all areas of your home right now. Focus on what you can assess, and consider completing the audit fully when you're at home.\"\n\n**Speaker's Notes for 4.2 Calculating Energy Costs and Savings:**\n\n- \"Using the spreadsheet, input the data from your audit. The tool will help you visualize your current energy costs and potential savings if you implement certain changes.\"\n\n- \"For example, replacing incandescent bulbs with LED lights can reduce electricity consumption significantly.\"\n\n### **Module 5: Sustainable Investment and the Path Forward**\n\n**Speaker's Notes for 5.1 Introduction to Sustainable Investment:**\n\n- \"Sustainable investment isn't just for large corporations or wealthy individuals. There are accessible options like investing in local cooperatives, green bonds, or community projects that have positive environmental impacts.\"\n\n- \"Consider the long-term benefits—not just financial returns but also contributing to a healthier environment.\"\n\n**Speaker's Notes for 5.3 Planning for Sustainable Investments:**\n\n- \"Think about a small portion of your savings that you could allocate toward a sustainable investment. Research opportunities that align with your values and assess the risks involved.\"\n\n- \"Remember, investing always carries some risk, so it's important to be informed and perhaps consult a financial advisor.\"\n\n---\n\n# **References**\n\nFor further reading and to enhance your understanding, consider exploring the following resources:\n\n1. **\"Incorporating Environmental Sustainability into Financial Literacy Education\"**\n   - *Source:* [StockGro Blog](https://www.stockgro.club/blogs/personal-finance/incorporating-environmental-sustainability-into-financial-literacy-education/)\n2. **\"The Heat is On: How Financial Literacy Can Help Combat Climate Change\"**\n   - *Source:* [Medium Article](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/the-heat-is-on-how-financial-literacy-can-help-combat-climate-change-ca9b7ab94586)\n3. **\"Financial Literacy for a Sustainable Future in Iraq\"**\n   - *Source:* [Conserbil News](https://conserbil.esteri.it/en/news/dal_consolato/2024/05/financial-literacy-for-a-sustainable-future-in-iraq/)\n4. **\"Islamic Finance for the Sustainable Development Goals\"**\n   - *Source:* [Learning for Nature](https://www.learningfornature.org/en/courses/islamic-finance-for-the-sustainable-development-goals/)\n\n---\n\nBy integrating financial literacy with sustainability education, you are equipping participants with the knowledge and tools to make a meaningful impact.

An onerous timeframe. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance.\n\nThe Paris Agreement laid it out clearly: to limit global warming to 1.5°C, greenhouse gas emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest and decline 43% by 2030. Otherwise we will need to contend with higher sea levels, fiercer storms, animal and plant extinctions, melting ice, wildfires, and more people dying from heat, smog and infectious diseases. An existential crisis is in the making.\n\nWhile some progress is being made, it’s not nearly enough. We need to use every tool in our arsenal to combat this looming climate catastrophe. Financial literacy is one often-overlooked tool in this regard.\n\nWhilst the link between financial literacy and climate change isn’t immediately obvious, a closer look reveals important connections and correlations that could help us leverage this tool.\n\nConscious Consumption\n\nFinancial decisions like the purchases we make have a significant impact on the environment. For example, the types of products we buy and the way we consume resources can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and other kinds of pollution. Financial literacy can help people make conscious consumption decisions about the products they buy and the resources they consume, leading to more sustainable living practices.\n\nResearch has shown that individuals with higher levels of financial literacy are more likely to make environmentally conscious financial decisions, such as purchasing energy-efficient products, and reducing their carbon footprint. However, without financial literacy, individuals may find it challenging to understand the financial implications of their environmental decisions, limiting their ability to make informed choices.\n\nSustainable Living\n\nFinancial literacy can also play an important role in promoting sustainable living. A report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that individuals with low levels of financial literacy were less likely to have insurance or emergency savings, leaving them financially fragile and thus more vulnerable to the financial impacts of climate change. Low-income and marginalized groups are especially at risk here.\n\nBy educating people on personal finance, insurance and budgeting, they can make informed decisions that lead to sustainable lifestyle choices. This includes everything from choosing appropriate financial products, using public transportation, and reducing energy consumption.\n\nGreen Investments\n\nGreen investments have become an essential aspect of investment and financial planning. However, having a good understanding of financial literacy is a prerequisite to making any investment decisions.\n\nIt’s crucial to have a clear understanding of how to calculate returns, determine risks, and create a balanced portfolio. This knowledge helps in making informed decisions regarding green investments.\n\nGreen investments can provide financial benefits while also making a positive impact on the environment. These investments include renewable energy technologies, green infrastructure, eco-friendly technologies, and sustainable agriculture. By investing in these companies, we can play an active role in reducing carbon emissions and promoting a sustainable future.\n\nFinancial Wellbeing\n\nThere’s a reason airlines ask us to put on our own oxygen masks before helping anyone else. This is because helping others is way more effective when our own survival isn’t in question.\n\nPeople who are struggling to make ends meet, or pay off debt may not have luxury of focusing their attention on long term environmental goals, no matter how great the existential threat. They are forced to prioritize immediate financial concerns and focus on their day to day survival.\n\nIn their provocative book Scarcity, Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir say that in the context of money, ‘Scarcity diminishes mental bandwidth, making us less insightful, less forward thinking, less controlled.’ This reduced bandwidth they argue is the reason for poor financial decisions. And it’s not a big leap of logic to see how a feeling of scarcity can adversely affect environmental decisions as well.\n\nFinancial literacy can help build financial resilience which translates into a sense of financial security and wellbeing. This enables people to engage in a wider perspective and make environmentally-conscious decisions.\n\nThe Missing Link\n\nFinancial literacy helps individuals develop conscious consumption habits and sustainable living practices. It also helps garner interest in green investments and gives individuals a sense of financial wellbeing that allows them to create a sustainable future and be better world citizens.\n\nUnderstanding how the issues of financial literacy and climate change are intertwined not only allows us to make meaningful progress on both but also allows us to see the bigger picture of how our financial decisions impact the environment and how financial literacy can be the missing link in our fight against climate change.\n\nClimate Change",

ORIGIN OF TRAINING COURSE (JUSTIFICATION AND PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES)\r\nBELGIUM\r\nAs discussed during first meeting of the Focus Group Sustainable Finance is an issue that will affect us for a\r\nlot of years by changing our life habits and working conditions.  Financial literacy as such is more important\r\nthan ever. The curriculum on financial literacy as defined by OECD totally coversthe scope of financial literacy\r\nas well as sustainability issues. What is decisive to make financial literacy more sustainable (incorporation of\r\nESG factors) is to incorporate ESG factor when teaching the syllabus by giving examples with ESG factors.\r\nNationally, throughout Europe, there islegislation on sustainable finance. The SFInLIt Program combines both\r\nabove issues.  \r\nFINLAND\r\nThe proposal for a national strategy to promote financial literacy in Finland was prepared in the Bank of\r\nFinland’s financial literacy project in 2020. The work was led by Senior Adviser Anu Raijas. The main actors\r\nengaged in financial literacy work and researchers in the field participated in the preparation of the strategy.\r\nThe digitalisation of financial services has changed people’s management of finance matters. As a result,\r\nservices accessibility and financial market participation varies within and between different population\r\ngroups. Household debt problems and an increase in payment defaults have highlighted concerns about\r\npeople’s ability to manage their finances. At the same time, some people are unsure about saving and\r\ninvesting. Financial literacy is a key civic skill, the importance of which is becoming increasingly important in\r\na constantly changing economic environment. People need financial literacy in making short‐ and long‐term\r\ndecisions about their own finances.\r\nThe ultimate beneficiaries of the strategy will be individual citizens; the goal isto increase citizens’ knowledge\r\nof financial matters and financial management, and to influence their behaviour and attitudes. The objective\r\nof the strategy is, on the one hand, to prevent people from getting into difficulties with their own finances\r\nand, on the other hand, to support people to make advantageous choicesin the financial markets. The overall\r\ngoal of the financial literacy strategy is to improve citizens’ financial literacy. This requires systematic and\r\ngoal‐oriented education, which has been shown in scientific research to improve financial literacy (see e.g.\r\nKaiser et al. 2020).\r\nFinancial education in schools is linked to the strategy but not directly included in it. School education\r\nimplements a curriculum based on laws and decrees in which one of the key objectives has long been to\r\nstrengthen the financial literacy of children and young people, and this has been reinforced in recent years.\r\nThe objectives of the strategy are linked to curricula and to the continuum of developing financial literacy,\r\nand their utilisation in future curriculum work will also help to develop financial education in schools in line\r\nwith common national guidelines. The education sector is also involved in the strategy through financial\r\neducation work undertaken for schools by external parties and via various cooperation projects.\r\nMultidisciplinary actors outside schools can support the implementation of curricula and provide (further)\r\ntraining for teachers. Teachers, like students at different school levels, are therefore within the scope of the\r\nstrategy and among its key beneficiaries.\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\nFinnish teachers consider teaching financial literacy at school is important. This is the opinion of 94% of the\r\nFinnish teachers. However, less than a third believe that the school provides sufficient financial skills. The\r\nresults are based on a Financial Competence of Teachers 2019 survey.\r\nThe results are in line with the Youth Financial Competence Survey conducted in autumn 2018. Admittedly,\r\nyoung people are even more critical of the financial literacy skills offered by the school. 90% of young people\r\nbelieve that the school needs to teach financial skills, and only a fifth of young people feel that they learn\r\nfinancial skills sufficiently at school.\r\nAccording to the study, teachers are concerned about the poor financial skills of young people. Nearly two\r\nout of three teachers say they are quite or very concerned about the young people's poor financial skills.\r\nVocational education teachers are the most concerned (73%). However, teachers think they can influence\r\nyoung people’s financial skills. 78% of respondents agree.\r\nIn addition to teachers' financial literacy skills, the study also examined their attitudes and interest in\r\neconomics. 80% said they were interested in the economy. 71% of respondents feel that they have enough\r\nknowledge of economics to be able to teach it, but only 14% of teachers say that their own financial skills are\r\nbased on teacher training. This result highlights the importance of providing adequate skills for teaching\r\nsustainable financial literacy in teacher education.\r\nThe results of the PISA 2018 financial literacy assessments were published in 20 countries on 7 May 2020.\r\nWith their average score of 537 points for the financial literacy assessment, Finnish young people were the\r\nsecond best together with Canada (532 points). The most financially literate youth were found in Estonia,\r\nwhere the average of 547 points was statistically significantly higher than the average of all other countries.\r\nThe financial literacy assessment is an optional national assessment in the PISA survey. Finland participated\r\nin this assessment for the first time.\r\nGREECE\r\nThe introduction of finance sustainability into the educational reality in recent decades to raise\r\nstudent’s awareness of financial, environmental, social and cultural issues has gradually led to a\r\nchange in the perception of school as an organization at all levels of its function. The traditional\r\napproach of school is receding, and the concept of sustainable school is emerging, transforming\r\nschool into a factor of change of attitudes and behaviors, into a major lever of transforming\r\nsociety toward sustainability, leading to the revision of leadership and organization views.\r\nEducation for Sustainable Development (E.B.A.) reflects the four pillars of sustainable\r\ndevelopment which are the economy, the environment, society and culture in order to prepare\r\ntoday's students and tomorrow's citizens to live sustainably (Kostoula ‐ Makraki, 2011).\r\nProblems related to sustainability are interrelated with the relationship between man, his natural\r\nand social environment. Thus the term Education for Sustainable Development while easily\r\nidentified with the environment and environmental education is not holistically approached unless\r\ninextricably linked to social, cultural, and economic issues such as poverty, health, unequal\r\neconomic development and exclusion from educational opportunities (Dovros & Makrakis, 2011).\r\nSustainable Development Pillars and indicative thematic areas:\r\nEconomy: poverty, overconsumption, local economy\r\nCivilization: cultural heritage, cultural diversity, cultural values\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\nSociety: social inequality, Human Rights, child labour\r\nEnvironment: climate change, waste management, energy\r\nThe existing legal framework in Greece for sustainable financial regulation derives from the\r\nEuropean Union. Environmental and social considerations for investment decisions led to the\r\nrelevant policy framework, designed so that finance can support sustainable economic growth, in\r\naccordance with the European Green Deal (European Green Deal Investment Plan). The\r\nEducational policy for Sustainable Finance is based into the previous framework. Into the Greek\r\nEducational System and specifically until the end of Secondary education,  Sustainable Finance is a\r\nnew thematic area in a great percentage. According to the current curriculums, both in Primary\r\nand Secondary Education sustainable finance are covered mainly by environmental and citizenship\r\ncourses or projects.  \r\nIRELAND\r\nEnvironmental laws at both EU and National level feed into the green economy. In order to build a greener\r\nfuture, sustainable financial literacy looks to include ESG (Environmental, Social and corporate Governance)\r\naspects. Additionally, at EU level we have the 2030 agenda on sustainable development for which Ireland is\r\nto develop its national blueprint for sustainable finance.\r\n  \r\nFinancial education is a crucial element for all citizens, financial literacy itself is a life skill that all individuals\r\nshould have access to.  At the primary level, children learn the basics of finance in practical terms. Earning,\r\nusing and spending pocket money, this type of education is normally assisted with some of the money\r\ntraining programs supported by external organizations to the school e.g. MoneySense.  \r\nThis is advanced at secondary school level, sustainable finance is addressed in the civic, social and political\r\neducation module and home economics module. Students are exposed to more advanced financial\r\ninformation and the impact their spending decisions can have. Sustainability is introduced to give students\r\nthe understanding of the ethical and environmental implications/costs to the items they purchase, dispose\r\nof or invest in. Programs run by the Environmental Protection Agency assist in the role of sustainability\r\neducation.  In addition, programs like financial literacy for you are targeted to secondary level students to\r\ngive them stronger financial skills.\r\nThe SFinLit Training Curriculum, which will be accessible via an open and flexible VLE, will be targeted to\r\nthese very students to provide them with a high‐quality online tool. Which will help them to develop\r\nsustainable finance understanding and improve their understanding of the environmental impact of their\r\nbuying power.\r\nITALY\r\nAiming at continuous education on topics that can bring benefits, such as sustainable financial education, is\r\nessential, especially in a world forced to face ever more frequent economic and social shocks. The Covid19\r\nPandemic is a clear example of this. Finance is evolving by considering and including ESG (Environmental,\r\nSocial and corporate Governance) aspects, in order to contribute to building new, greener and more\r\ninclusive growth models, thereby struggling to contain environmental and social risks.  \r\nFinancial education is a crucial element for active citizenship, as finance itself is a basic service for every\r\nindividual; the sustainable aspect allows to go beyond the purely economic dimension, by considering also\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\nsocial, environmental and good governance aspects. Therefore, it is deeply important to boost the\r\nspreading of sustainable financial literacy by involving the young generation in the financial education\r\nprocess.  \r\nAt national level, according to a recent study by Standard and Poor's, Italy has one of the lowest levels of\r\nfinancial literacy in Europe and among the OECD industrialised countries. Only 37% of the adult population\r\nhas sufficient knowledge. Although financial literacy is currently taught in primary, lower and upper\r\nsecondary schools, a flexible, self‐learning and customized training curriculum, targeted to secondary\r\nschool students, represents a crucial tool to foster sustainable financial literacy in Italy and to boost young\r\npeople knowledge, in view of aligning the Italian financial system to SDGs.  \r\nMoreover, digital has always been representing a resource for amplifying the reach and effectiveness of\r\nschool initiatives, beyond the needs arisen by the pandemic crise, offering more stimulating approaches\r\nand useful tools not only for better learning, but also in view of tomorrow's professions, which will\r\nincreasingly require digital skills. The Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan, which is part of the Next\r\nGeneration EU (NGEU) programme, includes among its priorities the \"Green Revolution and Ecological\r\nTransition\", with the main objectives of improving the sustainability and resilience of the economic system\r\nand ensuring a fair and inclusive environmental transition, and the \"Education and Research\", with the aim\r\nof strengthening the education system, digital and technical‐scientific skills, research and technology\r\ntransfer. Taking into consideration the above, SFinLit Training Curriculum, to be uploaded to an open and\r\nflexible learning environment, fits perfectly into the current context, as it represents a high‐quality online\r\nand pedagogically oriented tool, which will help young students develop sustainable finance know‐how and\r\nmake smart decisions.\r\nNETHERLAND\r\nSPAIN\r\nThe need is detected in secondary school financial education programmes, where the importance of\r\nsustainable finance content is growing, to the point of justifying the creation of a complementary training\r\nmodule, even thinking about future legal requirements and certification beyond secondary school. The\r\nexisting contents should be adjusted to the target group in order to educate them in 3 realities: an increasing\r\nsupply of sustainable financial products, a demand that does not match the supply due to a lack of financial\r\neducation and the need for a change of attitude towards these products, being this training the pillar to\r\nunderstand the circular economy. At national level, sustainable finance is already contemplated in the\r\nnational qualification system on which VET and professional certification are based, and the inclusion of a\r\n30‐hour transversal module on sustainability (together with digitalization) is already being prepared with the\r\nactors involved as a response to the new and urgent training needs, in secondary education a new chapter\r\nin the curricular adaptation is proposed.\r\nIt would also be necessary to have its own transversal module in CERTIFICATES OF PROFESSIONALISM in\r\nsustainable finance for all professional families as a basic unit of competence.\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\n2. SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS (EQF LEVEL AND PRE‐REQUISITES)\r\nBELGIUM\r\n1. EQF level 2 for school children with no pre‐requisites\r\n2. EQF level 3‐5 for VET and other target groups with examinations as a pre‐requisite for certification\r\nFINLAND\r\nEQF level 2 for basic education, EQF level 4 for general upper secondary education and vocational\r\neducation and training (VET), EQF level 6 for university of applied sciences education.\r\nGREECE\r\nThe EQF level in Greece is level 2 for graduate students of junior high school and level 3 for graduates of\r\nsenior high school. The pre‐requisites for the students in order to understand the new learning material are\r\nbasic knowledge in economics, mathematics and sustainability.  \r\nIRELAND\r\nThe EQF level indentified for secondary school students is level 2 for junior cycle and level 3 for senior\r\ncycle, junior cert and leaving certificate grades in Ireland.  \r\nPre‐requisites ‐ Students should understand what financial literacy is and what sustainable finance is and\r\nthe impact it has on their day to day lives. Delivery of this information should be in short simple messages\r\nusing practical examples, potential here to use short videos, infographics, digital posters etc.\r\nITALY\r\nThe EQF level indentified for secondary school students is level 2 for lower secondary school and level 3 for\r\nupper secondary school.  \r\nWith regards to the pre‐requisites, the targeted students should be explained why it is crucial for their lives\r\nto be literated on Sustainable Finance, through a young students‐friendly approach, which should foresee\r\npractical examples and a catchy language, in order to get students' attention. Such information could be\r\nshared through short videos, supported by infographic to make the understanding process easier and\r\nfaster.  \r\nOnce students have understood and internalized how important sustainable financial education is to them,\r\nbasic notions and concepts about Mathematics, Economics and Sustainability should be taught to them, in\r\norder to allow the tartget group of the training curriculum to face the course by starting from the same\r\nknowledge level. Moreover, target students must have a common linguistic competence: basic notions of\r\nfinancial literacy must be understood and known from every student, as far as the meaning is concerned.\r\nNETHERLAND\r\nSPAIN\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\nThe EQF level determined for secondary school pupils is set at level 2*, the key competences determined\r\nwould be mathematics, language and social.\r\nSpecifically, in social studies: economics and entrepreneurship.\r\nExtend it to training in entrepreneurship for all sectors (especially SMEs and the self‐employed). To this end,\r\nit would be necessary to include it in FUNDAE through the negotiation of continuous training with the social\r\nagents and/or to promote it through training providers such as the CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE and through\r\nthe professional associations concerned.\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\n3.

METHODOLOGY AND SESSION TIME (ACTIVITIES PROPOSAL TO BE CARRIED\r\nOUT IN TRAINING SESSIONS)   \r\nBELGIUM\r\n20‐25 hours and see comments on the analytical excel sheet\r\nFINLAND\r\nAt Laurea, we've utilized the spectrum of gamification from simple quizzes, memory games and flipcards on\r\nLMSs all the way to business simulations that span entire courses. On a similar strain, students have also\r\ndeveloped games as part of their coursework. On the basis of our extensive experience, we highly\r\nrecommend gamification and serious games to be utilized in the course. Gamification and serious games\r\nwere also strongly supported by the Finnish Focus Group as a motivating way to support the learning\r\nprocesses in basic studies, in general upper secondary school and in VET education.\r\nIn addition to gamification, we consider highly important peer‐to‐peer learning and from youth‐to‐youth\r\nlearning based on our experiences. In SFinLit, e.g., we have integrated several Laurea University of Applied\r\nSciences business student teams. The purpose is to develop business students' skills in responsible financial\r\nmanagement and to strengthen peer learning between upper secondary school students and university of\r\napplied science’s students. Students operate in a modern Peer‐to‐Peer (P2P) learning environment with a\r\nfocus on supervised small group work and peer‐to‐peer learning. The Peer‐to‐Peer model is one of the\r\nlearning environments created in Laurea University of Applied Sciences' Learning by Developing model,\r\nwhere the learner is seen in an active role in learning and where emphasizes the importance of assessing and\r\napplying knowledge as part of learning and integrating education into working life.\r\nThe starting point for students' learning and the framework for their learning were: sustainable financial\r\nliteracy, ESG criteria (environment,social, governance), UN Sustainable Development Goals, European Green\r\nDevelopment Program (EU Green Deal) , OECD National Strategies for Financial Education and Sustainable\r\nFinance Roadmaps. The theoretical framework of the project consisted of the following topics: green financial\r\nproducts and services in retail, commercial and corporate banking, insurance and the fintech industry. At the\r\nbeginning of the project, students also became acquainted with the processes, methods and tools of service\r\ndesign, gamification and storytelling in learning games.\r\nGREECE\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\nTaking in mind that the course will be provided in an online   environment, each lesson could be consisted of\r\na) informative PPTs, which can include some self assessment questions in order to go on to slights,  (the info\r\nin the ppts can be supported by narrative dialogues), b) short videos  which can explain in an easier way and\r\nwith certain examples each certain thematic, c) a relative to the content of the lesson quiz for the students,\r\nd) a short project which can implemented either personally or in small team work (in pairs).    Also, an\r\ninteresting idea could be the organization of experts’ connection during the lessons by an online procedure\r\nin case of a face‐to‐face session or a synchronous online session or by watching videos by experts in case of\r\nan online asynchronous session. The Greek expert’s proposal is for a 20  ‐25 hours course, which can be\r\norganized in a two hours lesson per week and a three months duration. The suitable period for the Greek\r\nschools can be between March 2022‐May 2022.  \r\nIRELAND\r\nThe course is to be delivered online using digital technologies. Lessons will consist of a variety of digital\r\ntechnologies; content will provide learners with tangible examples to allow scaffolding of their learning\r\nexperience. To increase engagement for learners the course should look to use active learning, such as\r\nscenario‐based learning, case studies, games and simulations. Simulations or scenarios are to be used to\r\nput learners in real world situations where each decision has an impact on the end result, this will allow\r\nlearners to fail in a safe environment.  \r\nITALY\r\nThe course is to be provided digitally through an online environment. Therefore, lessons should consist of\r\nshort videos, with a catchy infographic, to make the understanding process easier, faster and more\r\ninteresting, but without neglecting thoroughness and precision. Videos' content should be mainly\r\nrepresented by examples, which allow to concretely explain not only the theoretical notions but also the\r\npractical and tangible usefulness of finance in the real life. Gamification represents an interesting tool to be\r\nexploited for the purpose of the course. Therefore, the concepts acquired through the concrete examples\r\ncan be put into practice through a simulation game, where each move has a specific impact on the final\r\nresult. In this way, students have the possibility to effectively understand and internalize concepts and\r\nconsequences of the related actions.  \r\nIt is important that face‐to‐face sessions are foreseen, given the young target group, which represent the\r\npossibility for a fruitful exchange in person.\r\nTaking into consideration the above, the course should last up to 20 hours, including videos, games, face‐\r\nto‐face events and evaluation.\r\nNETHERLAND\r\nSPAIN\r\nProposed methodology: It is determined that materials will be produced that can be used both\r\nasynchronously on the digital platform and synchronously in virtual or face‐to‐face sessions.\r\nProposed duration: 30 hours over the course.\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\nCreation of a didactic guide not only for teachers, but also a version for tutors or companions in online self‐\r\ntraining should be envisaged.\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\n6. EVALUATION AND CERTIFICATION (TEST AND DIPLOMA)\r\nBELGIUM\r\nUse other methods of assessment other than testing forstudents. Promote group presentations and projects.\r\nFINLAND\r\nThe evaluation could consist of self‐assessment, peer review and assessment made by a teacher/trainer. The\r\nevaluation could be continuous throughout the course and help learners to improve.  \r\n360‐feedback has been a crucial part of students' coursework which also includes self‐assesment. As the\r\nstudies in Laurea revolve around groupwork together with working life partners, self‐assesment is an\r\nimportant tool for individual students to relfect on and recognize their own contributions in projects.\r\nLaurea is currently adopting a new LMS (Canvas) and we're evaluating new self‐assesment tools to\r\ncomplement the native tools provided by the LMS itself. We've piloted Peergrade and Feedback Fruits in\r\n2020.\r\nDigital open badges could be used as a certificate.\r\nGREECE\r\nThe evaluation of the Training Curriculum could be based in two sectors:  \r\n1) in a self assessment procedure, in which students can answer to relative questionnaires\r\n(specially formed for each unit content) or quizzes and  \r\n2) a formal assessment procedure which can follow three phases:  \r\na) preliminary assessment, which focusesto the already acquired knowledge related to the unit\r\npedagogical content and goals,  \r\nb) formative assessment which can be measured in a test procedure during the\r\nimplementation each course with specific questions or work assignments to students and  \r\nc) final evaluation in the end of each unit which can evaluate the learning result for the\r\nstudents themselves or the teaching methods. Except the traditional ways of testing, such\r\nas questionnaires, PPT presentations or final reports pupils can create mini projects that\r\ncould show the learning results.  \r\nIRELAND\r\nLearners will complete exercises as they proceed through the course. Each unit will have a final scenario\r\nwhich will require the learner to use the information learned in the LU to pass the LU.\r\nITALY\r\nConsidering the gamification element, evaluation itself could be a game, which allows a step‐by‐step self‐\r\nassessment: a kind of quiz, to be foreseen for each Learning Unit, requiring correct answers to go ahead and\n              Project n° 2020‐1‐ES01‐KA201‐082997                              \r\nAny communication or publication related to the Project made by the beneficiaries jointly or individually in any form and using any\r\nmeans reflects only the author's view and the NA and the Commission are not responsible  \r\nfor any use that may be made of the information it contains.\r\nobtain a final certificate of achievement, which both has a symbolic value and provides training credits.  \r\nSince young people are usually very competitive, another option of evaluation could be represented by a\r\ncompetition, through which they can challenge knowledge, skills and competences acquired. The successful\r\noutcome of each step of the competition allows the student to gain an acknowledgment of the learned\r\nexpertise.\r\nSuch evaluation tools could be additional to the traditional ones, used in secondary school environment,such\r\nas questionnaires, PPT presentations or final reports.\r\nNETHERLAND\r\nSPAIN\r\nThe same assessment criteria as the rest of the secondary school subjects. Students should be able to\r\ndescribe the most common financial products for saving, investing and borrowing. They should also be able\r\nto appreciate the importance of our financial decisions in building a more sustainable future.",

What are these ‘other assets’? \r\nI’ve never seen a whole map of all the different types of \r\n‘valuable resources’. In Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual, \r\nBill Mollison offers and expands on a categorization of assets \r\nbased on their potential: Degenerative, Generative, Pro\u0002creative, Informational, Conservative.1 These always seem like \r\na good way to think about things, but I don’t use them in \r\nany tangible way.\r\nI wanted something that would be more helpful for under\u0002standing the complex transactions and exchanges swirling \r\naround me as a human being and us as a global community. \r\nAs I tried to enumerate all of the different ‘valuable resources’ \r\nwhich an individual or entity could gather or exchange in a \r\ncommunity, the ‘Eight Forms of Capital’ emerged (Figure 1).\r\nSocial Capital\r\nInfluence and connections are social capital. A person or entity \r\nwho has ‘good social capital’ can ask favors, influence decisions \r\nand communicate efficiently. Social capital is of primary \r\nimportance in politics, business and community organizing. \r\nJason Eaton of Social Thread LLC explained to me that \r\ncapital can be in the form of equity or debt. In social capital, \r\na person can ‘owe’ favors or decision-making influence to \r\nanother person or entity.\r\nMaterial Capital\r\nNon-living physical objects form material capital. Raw and \r\nprocessed resources like stone, metal, timber, and fossil fuels \r\nare ‘complexed’ with each other to create more sophisticated \r\nmaterials or structures. Modern buildings, bridges, and other \r\npieces of infrastructure along with tools, computers and other \r\ntechnologies are complexed forms of material capital.\r\nFinancial Capital\r\nWe are most familiar with financial \r\ncapital: money, currencies, secur\u0002ities and other instruments of \r\nthe global financial system. The \r\ncurrent global society focuses \r\nenormous amounts of attention on \r\nfinancial capital. It is our primary \r\ntool for exchanging goods and \r\nservices with other humans. It can \r\nbe a powerful tool for oppression, \r\nor (potentially) liberation.\r\nLiving Capital\r\nA precious metal dealer who atten\u0002ded both Financial Permaculture \r\ncourses advises, “Rather than US \n58 permaculture\t permaculture\t No. 68 www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk No. 68 permaculture permaculture 59\r\nFinancial & Community Design\r\nValuing more \r\nthan money\r\nSpiritual\r\nLiving\r\nFinancial\r\nMateria\r\nS\r\nl\r\nocial\r\ndollars, measure your wealth in ounces [of gold and silver]!” \r\nRecognizing that ‘precious’ metals are just another form \r\nof financial capital, Catherine Austin Fitts recommends that \r\nwe diversify and, “Measure your wealth in ounces, acres, and \r\nhooves”. Living capital is made up of the animals, plants, water \r\nand soil of our land – the true basis for life on our planet.\r\nPermaculture design teaches us the principles and practices \r\nfor the rapid creation of living capital. Permaculture encour\u0002ages us to share the abundance of living capital rather than \r\nthe intangible ‘wealth’ of financial capital.\r\n(Note: ‘Natural Capital’ could be a synonym for living \r\ncapital, but the 1999 book, Natural Capitalism, by Hawken \r\net al. focuses more on a slightly updated system of capitalism \r\nthan on the true wealth of living systems. The current Slow \r\nMoney movement is also making strides in a similar direction, \r\nseeking to transfer financial capital into the living forms of \r\nsoil, animals, and agriculture.)\r\nIntellectual Capital\r\nIntellectual capital is best described as a ‘knowledge’ asset. \r\nThe majority of the current global education system is focused \r\non imparting intellectual capital – whether or not it is the \r\nmost useful form of capital for creating resilient and thriving \r\ncommunities. Having intellectual capital is touted as the \r\nsurest way to ‘be successful’. Science and research can focus \r\non obtaining intellectual capital or ‘truth’, though it is often \r\nmotivated by the desire for financial or social capital. For \r\nexample, ‘going to university’ is primarily an exchange of \r\nfinancial capital for intellectual capital. It is supposed to \r\nprepare people for the rest of their lives in the world. \r\nExperiential (or Human) Capital\r\nWe accumulate experiential capital through actually organizing \r\na project in our community, or building a strawbale house, or \r\ncompleting a permaculture design. The most effective way \r\nto learn anything comes through a blended gathering of \r\nintellectual and experiential capital. My personal experience \r\ngetting a Master’s degree at Gaia University showed me that \r\nexperiential learning is essential for my effective functioning \r\nin the world: I was able to do projects instead of take classes, \r\nand I’m now collaboratively organizing the local permaculture \r\nguild and co-running a successful permaculture design firm.2\r\nI can see that human capital is a combination of social, \r\nintellectual and experiential capital – all facets of a person that \r\ncan be gathered and carried in essentially limitless amounts. \r\nBut there’s one more form of capital that a person can gather \r\nand carry inside themselves...\r\nSpiritual Capital\r\nSpiritual capital contains aspects of intellectual and experiential \r\ncapital, but is deeper, more personal and less quantifiable. \r\nMost of the world’s religions include a concept of ‘the great \r\nchain of being’, a holarchic understanding of existence where \r\nspiritual attainment (in this context, the accumulation of \r\nspiritual capital) leads to different levels of being.3\r\nIn spiritual capital, there again enters the concept that \r\ncapital can be in the form of equity (gathering positive spiritual \r\nexperience/understanding/attainment) OR in the form of debt. \r\nIn some Mayan cultures (like the Tzutujil of Lago Atitlan), \r\na basic understanding of existence is that humans owe a \r\n‘spiritual debt’ to the magnificent beauty and complexity of \r\nexistence. According to this worldview, the goal of one’s life \r\nin the world is to create works of unspeakable beauty and \r\ngratitude, thereby repaying the spiritual debt to existence.4\r\nThe Tzutujil also recognize that single human beings can never \r\nreally be effective at gathering and flowing capital if they are \r\nseparated from their community.\r\nCultural Capital\r\nAll the other forms of capital may be held and owed by \r\nindividuals, but cultural capital can only be gathered by a \r\ncommunity of people. Cultural capital describes the shared \r\ninternal and external processes of a community – the works \r\nof art and theater, the songs that every child learns, the ability \r\nto come together in celebration of the harvest or for a religious \r\nholiday. Cultural capital cannot be gathered by individuals \r\nalone. It could be viewed as an emergent property of the \r\ncomplex system of inter-capital exchanges that takes place \r\nin a village, a city, a bioregion, or nation (Figure2 overleaf). \r\nProperties of the System\r\nThese eight forms of capital help us map our understanding \r\nof the world. The map clarifies that money is not the only \r\nform of capital flowing around and through us. This map \r\nexpands the concepts of wealth (and poverty) to include the \r\n‘valuable resources’ of personal connections, natural resources, \n60 permaculture\t permaculture\t No. 68 www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk No. 68 permaculture permaculture 61\r\nFigure 3\r\nFinancial & Community Design\r\nFigure 2\r\nland, knowledge, experience, and \r\nmore. It provides a language for \r\npermaculture designers to com\u0002municate the value of healthy soil \r\nand healthy communities to people \r\nimmersed in the current mindset \r\nof global capitalism, where finan\u0002cial capital is the only reality.\r\nWhat are the mediums of \r\nexchange used for each form \r\nof capital?\r\nEight Forms of Currency\r\nAlthough most definitions of \r\ncurrency focus on financial capital, \r\nthe Oxford American Dictionary\r\nand the Princeton Wordnet5 both \r\ninclude the definition of “the \r\nfact or quality of being generally \r\naccepted or in use”. For this map, I define a currency as the \r\ngenerally accepted (or in use) medium of exchange between \r\npools of capital. In many cases, the currency is the capital itself \r\n– for example, items of ‘material capital’ like copper or steel, \r\ncan be the medium of exchange. Currencies can also be ‘comp\u0002lexed’ into more interconnected and functional forms and still \r\nused as a medium of exchange (Figure 3).\r\nPractical Applications\r\nEarlier this year, as my partner and I designed a four-weekend \r\nseries of Forest Garden courses, we were having a lot of trouble \r\nwith the budget. The costs of renting space and paying teachers \r\ncombined with our desire to keep fees affordable for the local \r\ncommunity made the numbers look unfeasible. No matter how \r\nwe changed things around, we couldn’t figure out how to make \r\na reasonable financial return. Then we realized that our thinking \r\nwas too narrow – we were only looking at financial capital! \r\nWhen we considered the experiential capital we’d gain by \r\nrunning a course, the social capital gathered by planting forest \r\ngardens at a new education center, and the living capital of \r\nhundreds of useful plants going into the ground... it became \r\nclear that financial remuneration was only one facet of the \r\nsystem. Nonetheless, we still needed to balance our inflow and \r\noutflow of this one form of capital.\r\nThe eight forms of capital provide a clear path towards \r\na small point of great leverage: Eco-social Investing. We \r\ncan encourage individuals, businesses, organizations, and \r\ngovernments to mimic nature’s practices of investing: locally, \r\nintimately, diversely, and primarily in living capital. The \r\nFinancial Permaculture community, Gaia University, and \r\na host of connected businesses and organizations are invest\u0002ing diverse baskets of capital, offering events like the Carbon \r\nFarming Course in Tennessee and the thriving eco-social \r\nchocolate business, BooyaCacao.\r\nI’ve outlined a set of principles for Eco-Social and Ecosystem \r\nInvesting, which you can find on my blog.\r\nOne of the most useful applications of this map is for \r\ngrowing and shifting our own understanding of the world and \r\nthe transactions we engage in. When I volunteer time working \r\non my friend’s organic permaculture farm, more than just \r\n‘free labor’ is taking place:\r\n◗ I’m gaining experiential and intellectual capital about the \r\nfarm’s soil, crops, and management.\r\n◗ We’re supporting the growth of healthy living capital \r\nin the soil.\r\n◗ My friend gets help producing\r\nproducts to exchange for \r\nfinancial capital (her right \r\nlivelihood).\r\n◗ We both build social capital\r\nthrough positive interaction\r\nand connection with each\r\nother.\r\nThis amount of clarity can lead \r\nto a whole new level of trans\u0002parency in our work as eco-social\u0002cultural-economic designers. It \r\ncan guide us towards an ever\u0002deepening practice of the third \r\nethic of permaculture.\n60 permaculture\t permaculture\t No. 68 www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk www.permaculture permaculture.co.uk No. 68 permaculture permaculture 61\r\nFinancial & Community Design\r\nThe Third Ethic\r\nAlthough Bill Mollison originally stated the third ethic of \r\npermaculture as “Setting limits to population and consumption”,6\r\nmany of us (especially in the more recent waves of permaculture) \r\nhave been taught different forms of the third ethic. Some learn \r\n‘Fair Share’, a toned-down and friendlier version of ‘Limits’. \r\nOthers learn ‘Resource Share’, which directs attention away \r\nfrom scarcity and towards reinvestment of abundance. And \r\nmore recently I’ve seen Starhawk refer to the third ethic as \r\n‘Future Care’, which synthesizes the call for Fair Share and \r\nResource Share into a focus on creating thriving inheritances \r\nfor future generations. The eight forms of capital can and should \r\nbe considered in terms of each version of the third ethic.\r\nFair Share\r\nWhen people, and the businesses, organizations and govern\u0002ments, understand the eight forms of capital, they may find \r\nthat financial capital is not the whole system. This can lead to \r\ndecreased consumption of non-essential goods and services \r\nthat fuel our infinite-growth-based financial system. \r\nA truly just society requires fair and equitable distribution \r\nof all forms of capital. While financial capital is important, \r\nnon-financial capitals offer pathways to empowerment for the \r\noppressed communities of our planet. In communities I’ve \r\nvisited (Kazakhstan, Chile, and Latin America), the abundance \r\nof cultural capital often outweighs the financial capital, \r\nregenerating into a wealth of experiential and living capital that \r\nI’ve never seen in my north-eastern USA home. Any of us in the \r\nover-developed world can follow this modeling, working to end \r\noppression caused by our current financial-capital-centric systems.\r\nResource Share\r\nWe can use the eight forms of capital to include resource \r\nsharing in our projects. AppleSeed Permaculture has set a new \r\nCarbon Policy, whereby 5% of our revenues will be dedicated \r\nto offsetting our carbon footprint through carbon-farming \r\nprojects (living capital). The Permaculture Activist’s tree tax \r\nfunctions in much the same way, transforming financial capital \r\ninto living capital for the good of the planet.\r\nAppleSeed Permaculture is also inspired by our friends \r\nShabazz and Josephine of Greenway Environmental Services, \r\nwho explicitly donate 10% of every work week back to the \r\ncommunity through education and consulting. They share \r\ntheir intellectual and experiential capital with urban youth \r\ngroups and rural permaculturists alike, generating social \r\ncapital for themselves at the same time.\r\nFuture Care\r\nTo care for future generations, we need to move beyond \r\nfinance into living and cultural capital. Of all eight forms, these \r\ntwo have the greatest potential for positive systemic change. \r\nMollison writes, “We should develop or create wealth just as \r\nwe develop landscapes, by conserving energy and natural \r\nresources [and] by developing procreative assets (proliferating \r\nforests, prairies, and life systems)”.7 Only through the songs, \r\nstories, and shared ethics of cultural capital can a focus on living \r\ncapital can be sustained for the seventh generation to come.\r\nSome pieces are missing from the map: where does ‘labor’ fit \r\ninto the picture? What form of capital is ‘time’? There may \r\nbe some dangerous implications: this map could commodify \r\necosystem services, spirituality, and culture. To care for the \r\nfuture, we must think more holistically about our current \r\ncapital system. So let this map be a first draft\r\nEthan C Roland is a permaculture designer, teacher, and eco\u0002social entrepreneur based in the Hudson river valley of New \r\nYork, USA.
