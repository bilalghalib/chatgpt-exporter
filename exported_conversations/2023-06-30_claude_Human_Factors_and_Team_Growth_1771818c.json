Let’s decide together what we do during the team check-ins. We want this time to be really helpful time for us all, to experiment with ways to make this more meaningful, and for each of you to take leadership on regular check-ins and activities. As a remote team, this 30 minutes per day connected together is very important, and largely makes up for coffee-break chats, shared lunches, and other encounters that make being in an office really valuable.\n\nAs a bonus, feel free to eat 🥗 or have coffee/tea ☕ during this call, but you should be fully focused with camera on/etc, so not driving/cooking/preparing things during this time.\n\nApproach:\n\nBasic check-ins shift to being on the Bloom taskboard. Weekly powermoves (set on Mondays & reviewed on Fridays) and daily powermoves should be shared on the taskboard and reviewed on the call through the filtered views. We just use the “WIGs” section on the spreadsheet to update and check in on that weekly (for the Lag measures).\n\nFriday includes everyone sharing a reflection on a Bloom Value they leveraged or appreciated that week\n\nPeople should update their Bloom taskboard daily with the main things they will work on (and/or did work on) that day.\n\nIdeas to make this part of the check-in more effective are also welcomed! Please share here.\n\nOther check-in + team activities can include:\n\nInternal collective intelligence sessions, with discussion items prepared/shared in advance\n\n1-on-1 breakouts to help people understand more about what others are working on, recent activities/challenges/etc, then brief summaries shared as a group\n\nReflection and peer coaching discussions about work-related growth\n\nTime not seated, learning wellbeing habits such as stretching, meditation, etc\n\nSomehow a “serious game”? Something fun that we learn from?\n\nHave people practice / develop key universal skills\n\nIdeas to make this part of the check-in more effective are also welcomed! Please share here.\n\nONGOING LEARNING\n\nWe want to keep learning, adapting, and growing together … so we’ll invite everyone to do a quick 2-question feedback form each day on the facilitation + content, with results in a shared table so we can keep learning from that. Only 2 questions:\n\nHow effective was this session for you? Score 1-5.\n\nWhat would you suggest to improve it? Either the content, or facilitation, etc.\n\n\"You need to be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins.\"\n\n– Jim Stovall\n\nTogether Time on Zoom\n\nYou should spend roughly ⅓ of your work time in BloomHQ on zoom\n\nShall we set some standard “coworking time” for part of that? And people can do that other time as well?\n\nPlay music\n\nWork together\n\nTake breaks together\n\nAsk quick questions to unblock each other\n\nRun pomodoro work sprints together, etc.\n\nBe present with each other\n\nSHARED DECISION-MAKING, SHARED SUCCESS\n\nWe want to help everyone be a part of our shared success, and help each other, and be a part of the decision-making for shared rewards, so we’re going to start a Weekly Shout-Outs Form where we invite people to share max 3 “shout-outs” privately per week for who went above and beyond to really support each other and the team, who’s working to help with team energy, help us grow, etc.\n\nThe results will be kept private and anonymous (only shared with DMN+BG), with anecdotes pulled out monthly or quarterly …\n\nAll of those items above will be included in the reflections above when it comes to discussion promotions, bonuses, and profit-sharing when we get to that … and we firmly believe that the better we all do on those items above, the sooner we will be able to get to the point of having profit-sharing, improving benefits for everyone, etc.\n\n\"The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.\"\n\n– Phil Jackson\n\n\"The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don’t play together, the club won’t be worth a dime.\"\n\n– Babe Ruth",

      "content": "Here are some suggestions and critiques on the document:\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1. Be more specific on the purpose and principles. State clearly what the goals and objectives are for the team and how improving team effectiveness will help achieve them. For example, improving collaboration will help accelerate product development, improve customer service, etc. \n\n2. Provide more structure and specifics on the team activities like daily check-ins, Friday reflections, coworking time, etc. For example, for daily check-ins specify the format, duration, required preparation and expected outcomes and participation. This will make the activities more effective and purposeful. \n\n3. Consider designating team roles and responsibilities to increase accountability. For example, appoint a check-in facilitator, a \"team energy\" leader, etc. This can help avoid diffusion of responsibility.\n\n4. Provide more specifics on how the team will make shared decisions and determine rewards and compensation. The statements seem vague. A clear process should be outlined.\n\n5. Include a mechanism to regularly review and revise the team's operating principles and processes. As the team evolves, the approach may need adaptation. Built-in continuous improvement is important.\n\nCritiques: \n\n1. The document comes across as somewhat superficial with an overfocus on team spirit and togetherness. More substance and purpose is needed regarding team objectives, priorities, and key results.\n\n2. There are no deadlines or timelines provided for any of the team activities or priorities. This may result in lack of urgency and accountability. \n\n3. Rewarding team members for “going above and beyond” and “really supporting each other” can lead to perceptions of unfairness if not done transparently. The criteria for rewards and shoutouts should be very clear and based on measurable impact and results.  \n\n4. References to compensation, profit-sharing and improving benefits seem out of place in this document and premature. The team should first focus on effectiveness and key results before discussing rewards. \n\n5. The team values and principles reference helping each other improve and grow but there are no specifics on how growth and development will be supported. This should be clarified.\n\nIn summary, a good start but more work is needed to provide a comprehensive and purposeful team operating plan. I would recommend revising the document to address the feedback and suggestions provided. Please let me know if you have any other questions!",
