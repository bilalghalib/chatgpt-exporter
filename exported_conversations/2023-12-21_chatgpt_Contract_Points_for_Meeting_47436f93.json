      "content": "Today, my dad and I talked about some important points for the contract with the team in Qaraf, led by FALAH. First, my dad won't take payment because he's a partner in the project. Second, he will pay for Steve's past work to help the project succeed.\n\nWe want to ask for one million dollars when the pilot project is done. This way, they don't have to pay before knowing if it works well. Also, WET won't pay for the pilot. The contractors need to cover that cost.\n\nLastly, we want my dad, Saad, to be part of making decisions as a partner. Please make a short formal summary of these points to add to the contract. We will use this in a meeting with Falah. Thank you!\n\nPlease first summarize what oyu heard and ask clarifying questions. Then please return a Markdown formatted summary as well as an agenda to discuss these issues with Falah on a call. ",
