  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is working on redesigning a 5-day Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design training program, specifically focused on Mosul's architectural context. They requested a comprehensive review of their current curriculum structure and guidance on transitioning to a new market-oriented approach. The user wanted to shift from a primarily technical/digital tools focus to a more practical, business-ready program that emphasizes real market research, supplier relationships, and professional soft skills development.\n\nThe user outlined their proposed new structure following a \"Learn-Apply-Sell\" daily rhythm, with specific days covering Problems & Principles, Materials & Methods, Digital Design, Costing & Refinement, and Site Visits with design competitions. They specifically requested integration of soft skills components including mind mapping, negotiation, and presentation skills, referencing feedback from someone named Wifaq about BOQ (Bill of Quantities) creation, bid and proposal design, and cognitive load management concerns.\n\nA key requirement was shifting the social proof mechanism from WhatsApp to Instagram to influence public opinion and create broader visibility. The user needed a detailed Google Sheets workbook design to operationalize the new curriculum, track learning outcomes, manage supplier databases, and coordinate Instagram content strategy. Claude provided a comprehensive day-by-day redesign, outlined the required workbook structure with five specialized sheets for learning tracking, supplier management, BOQ generation, Instagram content planning, and competition scoring, and identified specific slide modifications needed to implement the transition. The response addressed Wifaq's feedback by incorporating mind mapping methodology, negotiation fundamentals, BOQ workshops, and enhanced site visit components while managing cognitive load through reduced theory blocks and increased hands-on application.",

I’ve extracted key insights, quotable quotes, case studies with numbers, and training methods to develop a facilitation guide and speaker notes for the Green Mosul Training Program. This response is structured to provide a clear outline, including daily breakdowns, Learn-Apply-Sell cycles, homework, and supporting elements.\n\n---\n\n## Reverse-Engineered Facilitation Guide for Green Mosul Training Program\n\nThe Green Mosul Training Program aims to empower junior architects and civil engineers in Mosul with practical skills in heritage-inspired green architecture. Drawing from the interviews and the thinking trace, the core idea is to **“Build graduates who can prove, price, and sell heritage-smart cooling before the next 49°C summer”** (Executive Recommendation). This guide outlines a 5-day intensive workshop followed by a Day-30 design competition, structured around four measurable outcomes:\n\n1. **Comfort Science Mastered**: Predict and measure a ≥4°C temperature drop using courtyard designs.\n2. **Cost & ROI Fluency**: Produce a comparative Bill of Quantities (BOQ) and a 3-year ROI payback sheet.\n3. **Trust-Building Pitch**: Deliver a 90-second video blending logic, emotion, and local context.\n4. **Market Connection**: Secure at least one follow-up with an employer or supplier by Day 5.\n\nThe structure integrates real-world insights from the interviews, such as Fatima Eyad’s emphasis on practical heritage applications and Wifaq Ahmed’s focus on managing cognitive load, into a hands-on, market-oriented training experience.\n\n---\n\n### A. Program Structure (5 Days + Day-30 Competition)\n\nThe program follows a daily **Learn-Apply-Sell** cycle, ensuring participants build skills incrementally. Each day is capped at 5 hours (8 AM–1 PM) to combat heat and fatigue, as highlighted by Fatima’s mention of 49°C car interiors (Follow_Up_Call_Fatima_Eyad_x_Bilal_Ghalib_04_July, 00:00:50). Below is the outline:\n\n#### **Day 1: Care Before Code – Understanding Client Needs and Site Context**\n- **Morning (Learn, 45 min)**: \n  - Topic: Courtyard physics (airflow, shading) and generator cost economics.\n  - Quote: “The courtyard… it’s the most important feature in old Mosul homes” (Fatima, 16_May, 00:19:36).\n  - Method: Interactive demo with a smoke tower to visualize airflow.\n- **Mid-day (Apply, 2 hr)**: \n  - Site visit (8–10 AM): Bus tour from Beit Turath to riverfront homes and a UNESCO-restored house.\n  - Task: Use IR guns to measure temperature differences (e.g., courtyard vs. street) and create empathy maps for homeowners.\n  - Case Study: Fatima noted a 40°C phone reading in Mosul heat (04_July, 00:00:42), grounding the need for cooling solutions.\n- **Late (Sell/Reflect, 1.5 hr)**: \n  - Workshop: Craft 30-second trust-building micro-pitches (e.g., “This courtyard cuts your generator bill by 20%”).\n  - Output: Team charter and a “pain-price” grid linking client pain points (heat, cost) to solutions.\n- **Homework**: Interview a family member about summer comfort challenges (1 hr).\n\n#### **Day 2: Materials That Talk Money – Sourcing and Costing**\n- **Morning (Learn, 45 min)**: \n  - Topic: Moisture management, thermal mass, and debunking myths about large glass facades.\n  - Method: Hands-on demo with foam, cork, and Isocam samples; compare heat retention.\n- **Mid-day (Apply, 2 hr)**: \n  - Task: Speed-dating with suppliers (pre-arranged via MoUs) to gather quotes; build cardboard courtyard models; start ROI calculations.\n  - Insight: Yahia Al-Fakhry’s success with local materials (17_May, 00:30:50) inspires practical sourcing.\n- **Late (Sell/Reflect, 1.5 hr)**: \n  - Role-play: “Status vs. Comfort” debate (e.g., glass facade prestige vs. courtyard cooling).\n  - Output: Supplier quotes and a draft BOQ skeleton.\n- **Homework**: Refine one quote into a cost-benefit bullet point (30 min).\n\n#### **Day 3: Digital Proof, Analog Options – Testing Solutions**\n- **Morning (Learn, 45 min)**: \n  - Topic: Digital tools (Ladybug-Rhino) vs. analog methods for wall material comparisons.\n  - Method: Toggle demo showing a 30% load cut with a “Good/Better/Best” wall sandwich.\n- **Mid-day (Apply, 2 hr)**: \n  - Task: Run simulations (digital track) or use calc sheets (analog track) to export heat-map GIFs and cost data.\n  - Quote: “We need tools that prove it before building” (Yahia, 17_May, 00:16:43).\n- **Late (Sell/Reflect, 1.5 hr)**: \n  - Clinic: Storyboard a social media post (e.g., “4°C cooler in 10 sqm”).\n  - Output: Heat-map GIF and cost-layered BIM CSV.\n- **Homework**: Draft a 50-word caption for the storyboard (30 min).\n\n#### **Day 4: From Numbers to Negotiation – Refining and Pitching**\n- **Morning (Learn, 45 min)**: \n  - Topic: Comparative BOQs, generator cost swaps, and basic project management.\n  - Method: Case study—replacing a $2,000 generator with a $1,500 courtyard upgrade (inspired by Ahmed Al-Obaidy, 15_May, 00:14:10).\n- **Mid-day (Apply, 2 hr)**: \n  - Task: Finalize BOQs, refine designs, and role-play negotiations (cost vs. quality).\n- **Late (Sell/Reflect, 1.5 hr)**: \n  - Workshop: Draft a 90-second pitch video using the Logic-Emotion-Trust framework; peer feedback.\n  - Output: Client and boss presentation decks.\n- **Homework**: Record the video draft (1 hr).\n\n#### **Day 5: Launch Day – Connecting to the Market**\n- **Morning (Learn, 45 min)**: \n  - Topic: Green loan options in Iraq, career pathways, and Day-30 competition brief.\n  - Method: 10-slide mini-deck on financing (e.g., $500 loans at 2% interest).\n- **Mid-day (Apply, 2 hr)**: \n  - Task: 5-hour design sprint to polish projects; live feedback from a jury of employers/suppliers.\n- **Late (Sell/Reflect, 1.5 hr)**: \n  - Lightning pitches (90 sec) and speed-interviews with employers.\n  - Output: Signed 30-day action plan and WhatsApp alumni group launch.\n- **Homework**: Finalize competition prototype plan (2 hr).\n\n#### **Day 30: Design Competition**\n- **Format**: Teams present built prototypes with measured results (e.g., 4°C drop, 3-yr ROI).\n- **Judging**: City officials, suppliers, and NGOs award seed funding (e.g., $1,000/project).\n- **Output**: Post-occupancy data and media coverage.\n\n---\n\n### B. Key Training and Facilitation Methods\n\nFrom the interviews, I’ve distilled methods to ensure engagement and practical outcomes:\n\n1. **Site Visits as Catalysts** (Fatima, 16_May, 00:25:37):\n   - Early site visits (Day 1) ground theory in reality, as Fatima emphasized with qantara restoration.\n   - **Implementation**: Bus loop with IR guns and empathy maps to spark ideas.\n\n2. **Trust-Building Frameworks** (Wifaq, 02_July, 00:16:00):\n   - Wifaq’s suggestion of negotiation and mind maps inspires daily trust exercises.\n   - **Implementation**: Logic-Emotion-Trust scaffold for pitches, practiced incrementally.\n\n3. **Tech Accessibility** (Yahia, 17_May, 00:19:43):\n   - Yahia’s mention of simulation tools (Revit, Rhino) highlights tech’s role, balanced with analog options.\n   - **Implementation**: Three tracks (analog, basic digital, advanced) converge on shared KPIs.\n\n4. **Cognitive Load Management** (Wifaq, 02_July, 00:06:39):\n   - Wifaq warned of overload after 2 hours; theory is capped at 45-minute bursts with breaks.\n   - **Implementation**: Energizers every 90 minutes; homework limited to 1–2 tasks.\n\n5. **Industry Integration** (Ahmed, 15_May, 00:17:45):\n   - Ahmed’s job-matching success (15 grads placed) inspires employer involvement.\n   - **Implementation**: Pre-week challenge briefs and Day 5 speed-interviews.\n\n---\n\n### C. Case Studies with Numbers\n\n1. **Fatima’s Heat Reality** (04_July, 00:00:50):\n   - **Context**: Car interior hit 49°C; phone at 40°C in Mosul summer.\n   - **Implication**: A 4°C courtyard drop could save $200/year on generator costs (assuming $0.15/kWh, 1,500 kWh saved).\n   - **Use**: Day 1 pain-price grid quantifies this gap.\n\n2. **Yahia’s Material Innovation** (17_May, 00:30:50):\n   - **Context**: Local mix mimics old plaster, lasts 50 years, employed 12 workers.\n   - **Implication**: $1,500 material cost vs. $3,000 imported alternative; 30% thermal resistance boost.\n   - **Use**: Day 2 supplier quotes and BOQ skeleton.\n\n3. **Ahmed’s Job Bridge** (15_May, 00:18:27):\n   - **Context**: 15 graduates placed via employer networks post-training.\n   - **Implication**: 70% placement rate with pre-engaged firms.\n   - **Use**: Day 5 speed-interviews target 5 MoUs.\n\n---\n\n### D. Supporting Elements\n\n- **Resource Kit**: \n  - Trainer pack: 40 datasheets, price lists, sample BOQs.\n  - Demo kit: IR guns, smoke towers, 4 Rhino laptops, ROI Excel.\n- **Team Dynamics**: \n  - Four-person squads rotate roles (Designer, Calculator, Documenter, Presenter) daily.\n- **Assessment**: \n  - No exams; daily outputs (e.g., BOQ, pitch video) as evidence.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: \n  - Heat: Early schedule, hydration.\n  - Tech: Backup laptops, analog tracks.\n- **Success Metrics**: \n  - 70% hit all outcomes; 5 MoUs; 3 prototypes published; 90% alumni engagement at 3 months.\n\n---\n\n### E. Why This Works\n\nThis guide blends **practicality** (site visits, supplier quotes), **proof** (BOQ-ROI thread), and **connection** (employer integration) into a tight, actionable week. It reflects Fatima’s call for heritage depth, Wifaq’s focus on pacing, and Ahmed’s job-market bridge, ensuring graduates leave with skills, confidence, and contacts to tackle Mosul’s climate and economic challenges.\n\n--- \n\nThis framework provides a complete foundation for your facilitation guide and speaker notes, ready for further refinement based on stakeholder feedback.

Let’s kick off by answering one simple question: Pop! [ring bell] Who are you helping, and why? I’ll go first.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Personal connection drives engagement.\n  2. Brief, one-sentence answers keep energy high.\n  3. “Pop!” cue makes it fun and timed.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “Pop! I help families sleep upstairs again by designing homes that stay cool without noisy generators.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Trainer rings bell once and shares their line (10 s).\n  Step 2: After the bell, each volunteer in the circle shares their one‐sentence “who & why” (12 s each).\n  Step 3: After 6–8 volunteers, thank the group and segue to next slide.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: People ramble beyond one sentence.\n    Solution: Gently remind “Keep it to one sentence—who & why!”\n  Issue: Silence or hesitation.\n    Solution: Call on a shy participant by name: “Your turn, Ahmed!”\n\nTransition ::\n  “Fantastic insights—now that we know everyone’s ‘why,’ let’s stretch our legs and move into today’s ice-breaker.”\n\n2\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIce Breakers - “Good → Better → Best” Insulation Relay\n*photo of cork tile\n*photo of foam block\n*photo of Isocam panel\nDay 1\n[09:10–09:20] – Ice-Breaker: Good → Better → Best Insulation Relay (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Energize the group and introduce key insulation materials by touch, setting the stage for Day 1’s focus on thermal comfort.\n\nSetup:\n  • Participants stand in a loose circle.\n  • Hand each team member one sample in this order: Foam, Cork, Isocam.\n  • Ensure clear space for safe passing.\n\nMaterials needed:\n  • 3 small material samples: foam block, cork tile, Isocam panel.\n  • Bell or chime to signal start/stop.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm every sample is clearly labeled.\n  • Test bell volume so everyone hears.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Alright everyone, let’s wake up those senses! We’ve got three insulation samples—foam, cork, and Isocam. These represent ‘Good,’ ‘Better,’ and ‘Best’ insulation for Mosul’s heat. \n   On my bell, start passing the samples hand-to-hand around the circle. \n   When the person at the end has all three, stack them in the order I said and shout ‘Good, Better, Best!’ \n   Then tell us in one sentence **why** Isocam is the best choice for cutting heat.”\n  \nKey Points ::\n  1. **Tactile Learning**: Hands-on feel embeds material density differences.  \n  2. **Rapid Engagement**: Fast pass keeps energy high.  \n  3. **Concept Hook**: Introduces insulation hierarchy that we’ll revisit today.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In Mosul, families have tried simple foam panels (‘Good’), but cork (‘Better’) added thermal mass, while Isocam membranes (‘Best’) gave the biggest ΔT drop of 7 °C in our demo.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  1. **Pass samples** clockwise on the bell.  \n  2. **Stack samples** at the end: foam, cork, Isocam.  \n  3. **Shout** “Good, Better, Best!” and state one benefit of Isocam.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  • Issue: **Samples get dropped or confused.**  \n    Solution: Pause, re-label each sample, and restart quickly.  \n  • Issue: **Circle too tight or bumping.**  \n    Solution: Ask everyone to step back for safe passing.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great energy, everyone! Now that we’ve felt the difference in insulation, let’s shift to our first story: why Mosul homes bake in summer and suffer mould in winter.”  \n3\n\n*Wet Walls in Winter (mould)” photo\nMosul’s Double-Pain\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n[09:20–09:25] – Mosul’s Double-Pain (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Ground participants in the real climate challenges they’ll solve, building empathy.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Participants seated facing the slide.\n  Materials needed – Projector, pointer (or laser).\n  Pre-activity checks – Verify both images display clearly; pointer works.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Now let’s ground ourselves in Mosul’s realities—our double-pain seasons.”\n  “Last July, temperatures topped 49 °C—homes become ovens. Imagine trying to sleep through that heat!”\n  “Then, in winter, we battle humid walls and mould that eats paint…and memories. A very different kind of misery.”\n  “Turn to your neighbor and share in one word: ‘What does this feel like?’”\n  “Tomorrow evening, you’ll photograph your own roof for our Day 2 shading study—remember our ladder rule: 4 : 1 ratio and two hands free.”\n  “Great—let’s see how heritage-inspired design can ease both these pains.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Mosul’s summers are extreme (49 °C+), driving people onto rooftops and generators.  \n  2. Winters bring damp, mould, and health risks—a second “pain.”  \n  3. Understanding both extremes motivates our design solutions.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “Wifaq measured a 17 °C drop indoors after applying a heritage cork render—real relief against the heat!”  \n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Observe both images silently (10 s).  \n  Step 2: Pair-share one word describing each image (30 s).  \n  Step 3: Group shares 2–3 words aloud (1 min).  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: Pair-shares go off-topic.  \n    Solution: Prompt: “Stick to one feeling word—like ‘trapped,’ ‘suffocated,’ or ‘stressed.’”  \n  Issue: Participants restless after sharing.  \n    Solution: Transition swiftly: “Thanks—let’s move on to some inspiring stories.”  \n\nTransition ::\n  “Next, we’ll hear three micro-stories of Mosul change-makers—Wifaq’s 17 °C comfort, Fatima’s bridge renewal, and Laith’s trust-building.”  \n\n\n\n📍 Location: Old Mosul neighborhood\n\n🌡️ Roof Temp: 49 °C in summer, damp & mould in winter\n\n⛽ Generator Cost: ~600 000 IQD/month for cooling\n\n💭 Dream: Cool upstairs bedrooms & quieter nights\nMeet Ahmed’s Family\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Large photo or sketch of a typical Mosul courtyard home (sun-baked roof, simple façade)\nDay 1\n09:25 – 09:30 – Client Profile: Ahmed’s Family (5 min)\u000b\nPurpose\nQuickly introduce a concrete persona so all later empathy exercises have a real “client” in mind.\u000b\nSetup\nProject the “Meet Ahmed’s Family” slide full-screen.\nAsk everyone to take out a pen and a sticky note.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nProjector & “Ahmed Family” slide\nSticky notes + pens\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nEnsure the slide image and text are legible.\nVerify participants can see the emoji bullets.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s put a face on our work—meet Ahmed’s family.

With just two small grants, she and her team restored two of the four historic qunatra, reviving stone arches and community pride against all odds.”\n  “Next is Wifaq—a civil engineer who applied a simple, heritage-inspired cork render to his family’s home. He measured a **17 °C drop** indoors—enough that his children moved off the blistering rooftop and back upstairs, and that generator fuel bills fell sharply.”\n  “Finally, Laith always says, ‘Trust is our currency in Mosul.’ By delivering one exceptional heritage retrofit, he earns ten new referrals—proving that empathy and technical rigor travel hand-in-hand.”\n  “By the end of this week, you’ll have the tools to slash heat, boost comfort, and build trust—just like Fatima, Wifaq, and Laith.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Local Leadership: Small, community-driven projects can transform public space (Fatima).  \n  2. Tangible Results: Simple materials deliver measurable comfort gains (Wifaq).  \n  3. Emotional ROI: Empathy-driven quality work multiplies referrals (Laith).\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In 2024, another Mosul engineer applied that same cork render in a school—students reported falling asleep more comfortably during lessons.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Listen to each story (2 min).  \n  Step 2: Reflect silently: Which story resonates most with you? (1 min)  \n  Step 3: Turn to a neighbor and share your pick in one sentence.

Anytime you’re on a roof, use the **4 : 1 rule**: for every 4 m of ladder height, place the base 1 m from the wall.\n   1. **Two hands on** the rungs – no texting or adjusting while climbing.\n   2. **Phone in pocket** to avoid distraction.\n   3. Wear your **hi-vis vest** so teammates always see you.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **4 : 1 Ratio** prevents slips – measure once, climb safely.  \n  2. **Hands On** cut fall risk dramatically.  \n  3. **Visibility** via vest helps spot each other on site.\n\nLocal Example ::\n  “Last month in Mosul, a quick checklist on ladder angle prevented a near-miss when wind pushed a loose rung – two hands on kept our volunteer stable.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Invite one volunteer to don the hi-vis vest and stand by the ladder.  \n  Step 2: Adjust ladder to the 4 : 1 ratio (trainer shows measurement).  \n  Step 3: Volunteer climbs slowly **without hands** grabbing phone → trainer prompts “Hands on!” → volunteer stows phone, climbs again properly.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: Volunteer places ladder too steep or shallow.  \n    Solution: Coach with a 1 m tape measure and have them re-angle until correct.  \n  Issue: Phone keeps slipping out of pocket.  \n    Solution: Suggest using a secure pocket or small belt pouch.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we’re confident on ladder safety, let’s move into our first **Learn** block: a mini-lecture on Mosul’s heat logic and passive stack-vent theory.”  \n11\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n12\n\nMosul Heat & Heritage Logic\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhy upper floors become ovens?\n☀️ Solar Gain on Roof\n🏠 Poor Roof Insulation\n🌬️ Lack of Stack-Vent Cooling\n[10:05–10:10] – Mosul Heat & Heritage Logic (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly ground participants in the physical drivers of extreme roof heat so they see why passive solutions matter.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Trainer at front pointing to schematic; participants seated close to screen.\nMaterials needed:\n  • Projector + schematic slide  \n  • Laser pointer or stick  \nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm schematic is visible from all angles  \n  • Pointer working  \n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Let’s kick off with a quick question: **Why do you think the top floor of a Mosul house feels like an oven in July?**”  \n\n  “Great ideas. Here’s what really happens:  \n   1. **Solar Gain:** Over 3,000 full-sun hours per year bake flat roofs like giant frying pans.  \n   2. **Poor Insulation:** Traditional roofs—bare concrete or tile—let that heat conduct straight inside.  \n   3. **No Stack-Vent:** Warm air has nowhere to escape, so it pools upstairs all night.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Sunlight intensity** directly heats concrete surfaces.  \n  2. **Insulation gap** means no barrier to conduction.  \n  3. **Ventilation missing** traps hot air inside.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “Last summer in Mosul, families reported rooftop temperatures exceeding 60 °C at noon—no wonder kids sleep downstairs.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Think of one household appliance that uses power all night to cool this heat.  \n  Step 2: Shout out your estimate of monthly generator cost for one room (IQD).  \n  Step 3: We’ll tally responses and compare to today’s homework generator-cost math.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: Participants confused solar vs. conductive heat.  \n    Solution: Re-point to arrows on diagram and contrast sunlight vs. insulation.  \n  Issue: Hard to visualize stack effect.  \n    Solution: Tease the next demo: “We’ll see airflow in action in just a moment.”\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great estimates! Hold onto those numbers—we’ll do the exact math soon. Next, let’s explore how heritage courtyards harness the **stack-vent effect** to cool without power.”  \n13\n\nPassive Stack-Vent Cooling\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nKey Points:\n\n🔥 Incense “heat source” at bottom\n🌫️ Smoke → warm-air path upward\n🌬️ Fresh air drawn through low openings\n*Photo or schematic of a simple shoebox “tower” with incense inside, arrows showing smoke rising and fresh air drawn in at the base\n[10:10–10:15] – Passive Stack-Vent Cooling (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Demonstrate the physics of heritage courtyards in a tangible, memorable way so participants grasp how warm air rises to draw in cool air.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Shoebox tower on demo table at front; incense stick and lighter beside it.\nMaterials needed:\n  • Shoebox tower model with base hole + open top  \n  • Incense stick + lighter or match  \n  • Schematic slide projected for reference  \nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm the model is assembled and stable  \n  • Test that incense smoke is visible under demo lighting  \n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Let’s see passive cooling in action—no fans, no power, just smart geometry.  \n   Here’s our mock-up: a shoebox tower with a base hole and an open top. I’ll light this incense stick to stand in for sun-heated air near a courtyard floor.”  \n  *(Light incense; place it in the base of the tower; pause 10 s.)*  \n\n  “Notice the smoke rising up the chimney—this mimics hot air moving upward through a courtyard shaft. As smoke rises, watch how it pulls fresh, cooler air in from the bottom opening. That continuous exchange flushes out hot air and cools the space—exactly what heritage courtyards achieved in Mosul’s summer.”  \n\n  “Imagine a real courtyard doing this all day long—dropping temperatures by several degrees with zero electricity.”  \n  “Tomorrow you’ll load this concept into Ladybug to model exactly how much cooling to expect in kilowatts and IQD savings.”  \n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Stack effect** moves heat upward naturally.  \n  2. **Continuous airflow** brings in cool air from low openings.  \n  3. **Zero energy**—purely buoyancy-driven ventilation.  \n\nLocal example ::\n  “In a Mosul retrofit, a 3-m courtyard shaft created a 4 °C average drop indoors—enough to shut off noisy generators for hours.”  \n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Observe the smoke rising—note the airflow path.  \n  Step 2: Identify in your mind where that base opening would be in a real courtyard.  \n  Step 3: Think of one way you might adapt this effect to window or roof vents.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Smoke too light to see.**  \n    Solution: Use a fresh incense stick or dim the lights slightly.  \n  Issue: **Participants miss the base airflow.**  \n    Solution: Point with your laser to the lower hole and ask, “Where is the new air coming from?”  \n\nTransition ::\n  “Great – we’ve seen the stack effect in miniature. Next, let’s convert those comfort gains into real IQD savings on generator fuel.”  \n14\n\nConverting Heat Relief into IQD\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nExample:\n12,000×15=180,000 IQD/month\n“Most households spend 600k–1M IQD/mo on cooling fuel.”\n[10:15 – 10:30 Converting Heat Relief into IQD (15 min)]\nPurpose:\u000b Show the direct money value of every amp you shave off with passive cooling.\nSetup:\nProject the slide full-screen.\nHave a marker-ready whiteboard beside you.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nEnsure the slide’s formula is legible from the back row.\nConfirm you have a clear pointer or laser.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Every breeze we save with passive cooling translates into less generator run-time—and big IQD savings.”\n“Here’s the basic math: local generators rent or run at about 12 000 IQD per amp per month. If your cooling load draws 15 amps, that’s 12 000 multiplied by 15…”\u000b (Point to “12 000” then “15” on the slide.)\u000b “…for a total of 180 000 IQD per month.”\n“In practice, families powering multiple rooms often hit 600 000 to over 1 000 000 IQD monthly just on fuel. That’s why reducing even a few amps with passive design immediately pays off.”\n“Quick show of hands: who guessed more than 180 000 IQD? Who guessed less? Great—that variation shows how big the stakes are.”\nKey Points:\n12 000 IQD/amp-month is our unit cost.\nMultiplying by amps gives your monthly bill.\nSmall amp savings scale to large IQD reductions.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In one Mosul household, cutting just 3 amps via a small courtyard saved 36 000 IQD monthly, enough for an extra sack of flour.”\nTransition:\n“Now that we’ve seen the cash impact on paper, let’s do a hands-on demo: measure a real ΔT on our incense tower, plug it into the same formula, and calculate your own savings.”\n15\n\n*Photo of incense-tower setup\nHands-On Demo – Stack-Vent ΔT & IQD Cost Math\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYour ΔT ↔ IQD Savings\nDay 1\n[10:30 – 10:45 Hands-On Demo: ΔT Cost Math (15 min)]\nPurpose:\u000b Have participants measure a temperature drop (ΔT) in our shoebox tower and convert it into real IQD savings.\nSetup:\nDemo tables with one incense-tower model per group.\nIR gun for each team.\nWhiteboard with formula template:\nΔT (°C) ×  Amp-savings  × 12 000 IQD = IQD/mo saved\nMarkers and eraser.\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify each incense stick lights reliably.\nConfirm IR guns are set to surface-mode.\nWhiteboard marker is fresh.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Each group, light your incense tower and let it run for 30 seconds. Use the IR gun to capture the top-and-bottom temperature difference—your ΔT in °C.”\n“Now, on your whiteboard, write down your ΔT value.”\n“Next, estimate how many amps of generator load that ΔT equates to—let’s assume 1 °C drop ≈ 1 amp of cooling load saved.”\n“Finally, multiply: ΔT × 12 000 IQD. That’s your monthly IQD savings from this passive effect.”\nActivity Instructions:\nMeasure ΔT\nStart incense, wait 30 s, record Hot and Cool IR readings.\nCompute ΔT = Hot − Cool.\u000b\nEstimate Amp Savings\nUse 1 °C → 1 amp rule of thumb.\u000b\nCalculate IQD Savings\nΔT × 12 000 IQD = Your group’s monthly fuel cost reduction.\u000b\nShare\nOne volunteer from each group calls out their number and sticks it on the board.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Smoke too faint → IR gun misreads.\nSolution: Reposition stick or use a fresh incense.\u000b\nIssue: Amp-rule confusion.\nSolution: Remind: “We’re using 1 °C = 1 amp for this demo.”\u000b\nTransition:\n“Fantastic—those savings are real! Next, we’ll move to our Apply block, where you’ll use these insights in the field on real rooftops tomorrow evening.”\n16\n\nWhat Is Green Building?\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🌍 Planet\n“Low-impact materials”\n“Energy ↓, carbon ↓”\n👥 People\n“Healthy indoor air”\n“Comfort & well-being”\n💰 Profit\n“Lower operating costs”\n“Higher asset value”\nExamples in Iraq: \nBaghdad Green Zone pedestrian lighting \nBabylon Green University LEED campus\n[10:30 - 10:40] – What Is Green Building? (10 min)\n\nPurpose :\nOffer a quick, visual definition of green building via the “triple bottom line,” then connect to local Iraqi projects.\n\nSetup :\nParticipants seated; slide projected full-screen.\n\nMaterials needed :\n– Projector & clicker\n– Remote for slide advance\n\nPre-activity checks :\n– Ensure slide is visible from back row\n– Confirm icons rendered correctly\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Let’s pause on our comfort story and zoom out: green building is any design that benefits three things—planet, people, and profit. You see here the three pillars:\n🌍 Planet: we choose materials and systems to cut waste and carbon.\n👥 People: healthy air and comfortable spaces matter as much as efficiency.\n💰 Profit: lower bills and stronger resale value keep projects viable.\n\nIn Iraq, we’re already seeing this in action. The Baghdad Green Zone pedestrian lighting uses solar-powered fixtures, and Babylon’s Green University campus is LEED-certified—proof that theoretical benefits translate into real-world impact.\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Green building isn’t just “eco.” It balances environmental, social, and economic gains.\n2. Health and comfort drive user satisfaction—never overlook the people pillar.\n3. Financial returns (energy savings, higher valuation) win over even the toughest budget guard.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In Mosul’s reconstruction, small solar street-lights in public squares reduced generator use by 70 %—that’s planet + people + profit at work.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Turn to your neighbor and name one green-building item you’ve seen locally (1 min).\nStep 2: We’ll ask three pairs to share one quick example. (3 × 30 s)\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: “Too abstract—what counts as ‘green’?”  \nSolution: Point to clear, tangible examples (solar lamps, LEED buildings).\n\nIssue: “Profit doesn’t seem ‘green.’”  \nSolution: Emphasize that long-term savings free budgets for future projects.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great examples! Now let’s bring it back to our own challenges—what personal pain does this green approach help solve?” (Bell → next verbal Q-prompt)\n17\n\n💬 Name 1 Personal Pain This Links To\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nThree numbered placeholders for sharing:\n“______________________”\n“______________________”\n“______________________”\n[10:40 - 10:45] – Guided Q-Prompt: “Name 1 personal pain this links to” (5 min)\n\nPurpose :\nBreak the theory block by surfacing real learner pain points and linking them back to green-building benefits.\n\nSetup :\nNo slide animation; projector remains on the prompt slide. Participants stay seated in their circle.\n\nMaterials needed :\n– Bell or timer\n– Microphone optional for larger rooms\n\nPre-activity checks :\n– Confirm bell works\n– Ensure everyone can see the slide prompt\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Okay, let’s make this personal. Based on what we just saw about green building’s planet, people, and profit benefits, I want each of you to think of one ‘pain’ that you or someone you know faces in your home or work site—something this approach could solve.”\n\n“When I ring the bell, three volunteers will share one pain each, in one sentence. Ready?”  \n*(Ring bell)*  \n“Who’d like to go first?”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Link abstract benefits to concrete, personal frustrations.  \n2. Encourage brief, one-sentence shares to keep energy high.  \n3. Highlight diversity of pains—thermal discomfort, high bills, mould, etc.\n\nLocal example ::\n“One trainee might say, ‘I hate waking up sweating because my room feels like an oven,’ which ties directly to our cooling-load discussions.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Participants think silently for 30 seconds.  \nStep 2: Ring bell – Volunteer 1 shares their pain (max 20 s).  \nStep 3: Ring bell – Volunteer 2 shares (20 s).  \nStep 4: Ring bell – Volunteer 3 shares (20 s).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Long-winded responses →  \nSolution: Gently interject: “Great point—let’s hear it in one sentence.”  \nIssue: No one volunteers →  \nSolution: Call on a confident participant: “Ali, how about you?”  \n\nTransition :\n“Thanks for those honest shares—they remind us why green-building matters. Now let’s take a “sneak peek” of Rhino + Ladybug teaser.”  \n18\n\nRhino & Ladybug Teaser – Model Toggle\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Full-screen screenshot of the Mosul house massing in Rhino, with the courtyard void highlighted.\n10:45 – 10:50 (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how easily the courtyard intervention can be toggled on/off in Rhino, priming participants for Day 4’s digital simulation.\nSetup:\nProjector displaying the full‐screen Rhino viewport screenshot.\nTrainer computer with the Mosul massing file loaded.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nRhino + Ladybug plugin installed.\nSample Mosul house 3D file.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nConfirm the “courtyard” layer is present and named correctly.\nEnsure Ladybug toolbar is visible in Rhino.\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here’s our 3D massing of a typical Mosul home. Notice on the left the solid roof, and on the right the inset courtyard void highlighted. In Rhino, a single click on the ‘courtyard’ layer toggles that void on and off—no complex commands needed. On Day 4, you’ll each open this exact file, switch the courtyard in Ladybug, and instantly see how airflow and daylight pathways change.”\nKey Points ::\nOne-click toggle isolates the heritage intervention.\nVisual clarity helps link design moves to performance.\nNo coding required—accessible to all skill levels.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In last month’s pilot, trainees mastered this toggle in under two minutes and were able to run their first simulations by lunch.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nObserve the highlighted “courtyard” layer in the screenshot.\nNote how on Day 4 you’ll repeat this toggle in your own Rhino session.\nPrepare any questions about file organization.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Layer not visible.\u000b Solution: Unlock layers panel or restart Rhino.\nIssue: Ladybug toolbar missing.\u000b Solution: Re-load plugin via Tools → Options → Plugins.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Next, let’s see the payoff of that toggle—how heat‐map overlays shift when the courtyard is on vs. off.”\n19\n\nRhino & Ladybug Teaser – Model Toggle\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Left Panel (“Courtyard OFF”): Heat-map overlay on the 3D roof model showing high surface temperatures in reds and oranges.\n*Right Panel (“Courtyard ON”): Heat-map overlay with more yellows and blues indicating cooler surfaces.\n10:50 – 10:55 (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Visually demonstrate the thermal impact of adding a courtyard by comparing before/after heat‐map overlays.\nSetup:\nProjector showing the side-by-side panels: “Courtyard OFF” vs. “Courtyard ON.”\nTrainer computer ready to animate between the two screenshots.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nLadybug heat-map results exported as PNG.\nSample 3D file with both overlays saved.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify both images are full-resolution at screen size.\nConfirm the legend and color scale are legible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “On the left is our roof with no courtyard: reds and oranges indicate surface temperatures peaking highest. On the right, the inset courtyard shifts the palette toward yellows and blues—on average about 3 °C cooler across the deck. This comparative view is your proof of concept long before you write a line of code.”\nKey Points ::\nColor shift from red→blue directly maps to temperature drop.\nAverage ΔT ≈ 3 °C shows passive design benefit.\nImmediate visual cue builds confidence in heritage strategies.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “A contractor we worked with used similar overlays to persuade a café owner—she switched from glass walls to a shaded courtyard after seeing a 5 °C drop.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nScan both panels for the coolest and hottest zones.\nNote the approximate ΔT from the color legend.\nJot down one question about the heat-map scale or legend.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Legend text too small.\u000b Solution: Zoom in or adjust projector focus.\nIssue: Colors look washed out.\u000b Solution: Check projector color profile or ambient light.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “With that visual proof in mind, let’s take a break”\n20\n\n🍴 LUNCH\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n30 minutes\n21\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n22\n\nIR-Gun Safety First\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhy we scan: Measure surface temps to connect data → design\nTwo-Hand Grip: Secure hold prevents drops & mis-aims\n10 cm Distance: Optimal for accurate readings\nAim at Matte Surfaces: Avoid shiny metals & people\nLabel Every Photo: TeamX_Thermal1.jpg, etc.\n[11:25 - 11:30] APPLY Intro & IR-Gun Safety (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Ensure safe, accurate use of IR-guns so teams collect reliable temperature data.\nSetup:\nIR-guns on a labeled central tray\nDistance markers (tape) on demo panel\nSafety reminders posted\u000b\nMaterials Needed:\n2 IR-guns (batteries checked)\nTape measure\nPre-printed photo labels\u000b\nPre-activity Checks:\nVerify guns read ambient temperature\nConfirm laser alignment\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“We’re about to begin our Thermal Proof station.

In the next two hours you’ll visit an Old-City courtyard home and a river-front home. Your mission: use the IR gun to record surface temperatures (∆T) at key spots—walls, roof, courtyard—and note any privacy or sight-line observations on your form. Work as a team, stay hydrated, and be mindful of local residents’ space. Let’s move out!”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **Accuracy:** Hold the IR gun steady at 15 cm from the surface.  \n2. **Respect:** Keep a polite distance; ask permission before photographing.  \n3. **Safety:** Watch your footing on stairs and uneven ground.\n\nLocal example ::\n“Last cohort measured an 8 °C drop behind a simple mashrabiya – it’s these kinds of real data that make our design proposals compelling.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. **Depart** immediately for Site A (courtyard home).  \n2. **Measure & record** ΔT at three points (north wall, south wall, roof) using the form.  \n3. **Sketch** a quick privacy note: who can see into the courtyard?  \n4. **Move** to Site B (river-front) and repeat steps 2–3.  \n5. **Regroup** at Beit Turath by 11:00 AM—don’t be late!\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• *Issue:* IR gun misreads shiny metal surfaces.  \n  *Solution:* Aim at matte patches or use emissivity setting.  \n• *Issue:* Teams get separated in the Old City alleys.  \n  *Solution:* Keep to your guide and check in every 10 minutes by phone.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great work in the field—let’s reconvene inside at 11:00 for our classroom Learn block recap.”\n37\n\nQuick Recap \nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhat ΔT did you observe in yesterday’s incense or wall demos?\nHow much did generator fuel cost per month in our math?\nWhat’s the BOQ overhead percentage we added?\n[11:00–11:10] – Opening & Quick Recap (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nRe-orient everyone after the field visit by jogging key Day 1 takeaways.\n\nSetup:\n• Participants seated in a semi-circle facing screen.  \n• Display “Welcome Back & Quick Recap” slide.\n\nMaterials needed:\n• Mic or bell to signal transitions.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n• Ensure the slide is visible and legible.  \n• Confirm everyone has a pen or finger ready to answer.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Welcome back! I hope that site visit energized you. Before we dive into Day 2 content, let’s quickly revisit three highlights from Day 1. I’ll ring the bell after each prompt and invite one volunteer to share their answer in 8 seconds.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **ΔT Recall:** Connect field demos to performance.  \n2. **Cost Math:** Anchor to local generator rates.  \n3. **BOQ Overhead:** Emphasize real-world quoting accuracy.\n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember, Wifaq measured a 17 °C drop with cork—just like our incense tower showed around 3 °C in miniature.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Ring bell 🔔 → Volunteer shares ΔT from their demo.  \n2. Ring bell 🔔 → Volunteer states the 180 000 IQD generator cost.  \n3. Ring bell 🔔 → Volunteer recalls the 10% overhead line.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• *Issue:* Silence or hesitation.  \n  *Solution:* Prompt with “Think of our whiteboard math—what was that number?”  \n• *Issue:* Off-topic answer.  \n  *Solution:* Gently steer back: “Great, but let’s stick to our slide prompts.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Great recalls, everyone! Now let’s tackle the top questions from yesterday’s Q-Wall.”  \n38\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYesterday’s Questions \nDay 2\nQ1: …\nQ2: …\nQ3: …\n[11:05–11:15] – Yesterday’s Questions Answered (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nClarify top reflections and ensure everyone starts Day 2 with common understanding.\n\nSetup:\n• Participants seated, facing the Q-Wall summary slide.\n• Trainer stands near the screen with a mic or pointer.\n\nMaterials needed:\n• Slide “Yesterday’s Top 3 Questions & Answers.”\n• Mic or clicker to advance bullets.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n• Confirm slide loads correctly.\n• Ensure audio level (if using mic) is set.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Before we move on, let’s dive into the top three questions you posted on our Reflection Wall yesterday. We’ll read each, give a concise answer, and then pause for one quick follow-up if needed.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Reinforce key rules (flash-round timing).  \n2. Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker: ΔT Showdown!”  \n39\n\nIce-Breaker – ΔT Showdown\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nΔT Showdown\n\nShout out the biggest temperature drop you recorded yesterday (°C)!\nFirst team to nail their number wins a snack.\n[11:15–11:25] – Ice-Breaker: ΔT Showdown (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nBuild energy and reinforce Day 1 demo learnings by celebrating real ΔT results.\n\nSetup:\n• Participants remain in their teams.\n• Clear space in the center for “shout-out” action.\n\nMaterials needed:\n• Bell or buzzer.\n• Small snack prize for winning team.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n• Ensure each team has their ΔT reading accessible.\n• Confirm bell/buzzer is working.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Let’s see those ΔT numbers! On my count: 3–2–1… shout your highest temperature drop from yesterday’s demos. Ready? 3–2–1… GO!”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **Accuracy matters:** Call out the number you measured.  \n2. **Speed counts:** First to shout gets the win.  \n3. **Celebrate data:** Reinforce the value of measuring performance.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In one of our pilot sessions, a team shouted ‘8 °C!’—that matched our courtyard case study and blew everyone away.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer counts down 3–2–1.  \n2. Teams shout their ΔT simultaneously.  \n3. Trainer rings bell for the quickest correct answer.  \n4. Award snack to that team; acknowledge the group’s results.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: Multiple teams shout same number at once.  \n  Solution: Ring bell and ask those teams to raise hands; pick one randomly.  \n• Issue: Incorrect ΔT shouted.  \n  Solution: Ask for a show of hands from teams with the actual reading; confirm before awarding.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great energy—let’s carry that momentum into our morning session but before that, let’s jump to daily agenda !”  \n40\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 2\n[11:25–11:30] – Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context.

Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n\n71\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 3\n[09:30 - 09:35] Week at a Glance: Day 1–5 Overview (5 min)\n\n\n72\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3 Learning Objectives\nDay 3\nLearn\nx\nApply\nx\nSell\nx\n[09:35–09:40] – Day 1 Learning Objectives (5 min)\n\n\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n74\n\nInsulation Metrics 101 – R & U\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n“The higher the R-value, the better the insulation quality is”\n“The lower the U-value of a material, the better its performance”\n\n\n\nR = m²·K/W  U = W / m²·K\n[09:40–09:45] Insulation Metrics 101 – R & U (5 min)\nPurpose : Ground everyone in the core insulation metrics so material choices make sense.\nSetup : Project slide at front; leave space on whiteboard beside it for quick notes.\nMaterials needed : Three cut-samples (foam, 3 cm cork, Isocam membrane), λ-value datasheet excerpt.\nPre-activity checks : Ensure each sample is labeled with its thickness; verify whiteboard marker works.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Let’s start by defining two metrics you’ll use today: R-value and U-value. R-value tells us how well a material resists heat flow—the higher, the better. U-value is its inverse: it’s the rate of heat transfer per square meter per degree—so lower is better.”\nKey Points :\nR = thickness ÷ λ (units: m²·K/W)\nU = 1 ÷ R or W/m²·K\nAlways match material thickness and λ-value to your climate needs\u000b\nLocal example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 3 cm cork panel (λ ≈ 0.04 W/mK) gives R ≈ 0.75 m²·K/W—compare that to 1 cm foam (λ ≈ 0.025) which is only R ≈ 0.4.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: Pass the three samples down each row—feel their thickness and note any visible density differences.\u000b Step 2: On the whiteboard, write the formula R = thickness / λ, then calculate R for one sample as a group.\u000b Step 3: Ask one volunteer to invert that R value to get U and record it next to the formula.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing units (meters vs centimeters)\u000b Solution: Always convert thickness to meters before dividing by λ.\nIssue: Thinking higher U-value is better\u000b Solution: Remind: U is “leakiness,” so less is more.\nTransition :\u000b “Now that we know how to quantify insulation performance, let’s look at typical R-values in common building materials.”\n75\n\nR-Value Table - Common Building Materials\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:45–09:50] – R-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Show the spectrum of insulation performance so teams can choose materials strategically.\nSetup : Project a clear table of 8–10 common materials and their R-values. Leave space on whiteboard for jotting examples.\nMaterials needed : Printed handout or projected slide of R-Value table (foam, cork, brick, concrete, wood, PIR, XPS, EPS).\nPre-activity checks : Ensure everyone can read the smallest font; confirm marker works for whiteboard notes.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Now that we know how to calculate R and U, let’s see real values for materials you’ll actually work with. This table shows R-value per material—higher resistivity means better insulation. Take a moment to scan through and think which ones fit Mosul’s climate and budget.”\nKey Points :\nLightweight foams and PIR/XPS panels have R ≈ 3–6 m²·K/W.\nTraditional materials (brick, stone) sit below R 1 m²·K/W.\nWood and cork are mid-range (R ≈ 1–2 m²·K/W) but offer heritage appeal.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “A 10 cm layer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) gives you around R 2.8—similar to a 15 cm thick traditional mashrabiya wall, but at half the thickness.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, pick two materials—one “high R” and one “low R”—and write their R-values on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 2: Debate which you’d specify for a sun-facing wall vs. an interior partition.\u000b Step 3: Volunteer teams share their choices (1 min each) and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing material thickness vs. R-value.\u000b Solution: Remind: table is already normalized to standard thickness. Focus on relative performance.\nIssue: Assuming “best R” always wins.\u000b Solution: Emphasize trade-offs: cost, heritage look, moisture risk.\nTransition :\u000b “Great discussion—next we’ll flip these R-values into U-values so you can compare whole assemblies.”\n76\n\nU-Value Table\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:50–09:55] – U-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Reinforce the inverse relationship between resistance and conductance so teams grasp why U-value matters in real assemblies.\nSetup : Project the U-Value table slide and leave room on the whiteboard to jot sample calculations. Arrange participants so they can see both screen and board.\nMaterials needed : Projected slide of U-Value table; whiteboard and marker.\nPre-activity checks : Verify slide is legible from back row; confirm whiteboard marker writes clearly.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Here we flip R on its head: U-value tells us how much heat passes through per square meter per degree difference. Lower U means less heat gain. Take a moment to scan: you’ll notice traditional brick sits around U 0.8, while Thermostone is down at U 0.2—four times better.”\nKey Points :\nU = 1/R, so doubling R halves U.\nDense materials like concrete block have high U (≈1.3–1.5).\nSpecialty insulators (Thermostone) can achieve U <0.3 despite light weight.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 30 cm solid brick wall (U ≈0.85) will let roughly three times more heat inside than a 10 cm Thermostone panel (U ≈0.21).”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, choose two materials from the table—one high U and one low U—and calculate the ratio of their heat gains (e.g. 0.85 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 4).\u000b Step 2: Write your ratio and material names on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 3: One pair volunteers to explain why that ratio matters for selecting sun-facing walls.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing U and R units.\u000b Solution: Remind: R in m²·K/W resists heat; U in W/m²·K conducts heat. Higher U = more heat leak.\nIssue: Thinking density improves insulation.\u000b Solution: Emphasize: density affects thermal mass, not directly conduction—focus on U-values for insulation decisions.\nTransition :\u000b “Great insight—next, we’ll see these differences in action under our heat lamp and confirm the numbers with IR readings.”\n77\n\nMaterials\n60 W desk lamp 🔥\nThree wall-assembly samples labeled “Good,” “Better,” “Best”\nIR thermometer\n\nSteps\nPosition lamp 15 cm above Sample A\nTurn on lamp for 60 s\nMeasure and record surface temperature with IR gun\nRepeat for Samples B and C\nHeat-Lamp Demo\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:55 – 10:00] Demo Setup & Procedure (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how different wall-sandwich assemblies perform under identical heat, so teams see real ΔT differences that map directly to energy (and IQD) savings.\nSetup:\nDemo table at front, semi-circle seating so everyone can observe.\nDesk lamp mounted on a stand with a 15 cm mark.\nThree wall-assembly samples labeled “Good,” “Better,” “Best” laid out side-by-side.\u000b\nMaterials Needed:\n60 W desk lamp on an adjustable stand\nThree assembly samples (foam, cork, Isocam)\nIR thermometer (gun)\nStopwatch or phone timer\nShared data sheet and marker\u000b\nPre-Activity Checks:\nConfirm lamp bulb is working and stable.\nVerify IR gun reads ambient temperature accurately.\nMeasure and mark exactly 15 cm on the lamp stand.\nEnsure each sample is clearly labeled.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Okay everyone, let’s see those wall-sandwiches in action. We’ll heat each sample for exactly one minute at 15 cm distance, then capture its surface temp with the IR gun. Remember: lower surface temp = less heat transfer indoors = real generator-fuel savings.”\nKey Points:\nConsistency: Same distance (15 cm) and duration (60 s) ensures a fair comparison.\nCorrelation: Higher R-value → lower surface temp under identical heat.\nImpact: Each degree of ΔT you save can cut ~1 amp of cooling load (≈ 12 000 IQD/month).\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“In Mosul’s July sun, even a 5 °C drop—from 62 °C to 57 °C—can let a family turn off their generator 5 hours earlier each night, saving over 60 000 IQD monthly.”\nActivity Instructions:\nSample A: Position lamp 15 cm above “Good” sample, start 60 s timer.\nMeasure: At timer end, point IR gun at center of sample, call out temperature, and record on the data sheet.\nRepeat: Move lamp and IR gun to “Better” and then “Best” samples—same steps.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nLamp mis-positioned: If results look off, re-check the 15 cm tape mark.\nShiny surface error: If IR gun fluctuates, aim at a small matte patch or adjust emissivity.\u000b\nTransition:\n“Great—that gives us our raw ΔT numbers.

On the left, our ‘Good’ foam-and-bitumen wall peaked at 60 °C—that’s our baseline. Switching to ‘Better’ cork brought it down to 55 °C, a 5 °C drop. But look at ‘Best’: the Isocam membrane hit 53 °C, a full 7 °C reduction versus foam.\nRemember: each degree you shave off translates into roughly 5 % less generator runtime in Mosul’s climate. That’s real money and quiet nights.”\nKey Points:\nLarger ΔT → Less Heat Gain: More comfort, lower AC/generator load.\n5 % Runtime per °C: Even a 5 °C drop saves ~25 % generator hours.\nCost-Per-Degree: You can calculate IQD saved per °C via your BOQ rates.\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“In July 2024, one family reported turning off their generator 6 hours earlier nightly after a 6 °C ΔT retrofit—enough savings to cover half their school-tuition costs.”\nActivity Instructions:\nConfirm your group’s own ΔT readings against the chart (1 min).\nShare one surprising or divergent result with the room (2 min).\nDiscuss which assembly you’d propose for a typical rental home and why (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nTeams recorded ambient instead of surface temp: Remind them ΔT = surface_tₕₒₜ − surface_t_cₒₒₗ.\nBar labels overlap: In future, color-code big call-outs and space columns evenly.\u000b\nTransition:\n“Great insights—now let’s move from raw data to real proposals.

Column 1 is the per-square-meter cost. Column 2 shows the ΔT drop from our demo. Then, using our 12 000 IQD per amp-month rule and the amp-savings per °C you observed, we derive daily and yearly IQD savings.\nFor ‘Good,’ the 5 °C drop saves about 7 200 IQD per day, or ~2.6 million IQD per year—and that’s just one wall! As you step up to ‘Better’ or ‘Best,’ you invest more upfront but harvest even bigger savings.”\nKey Points:\nCost vs. Benefit Trade-off: More ΔT buys faster payback.\nDaily → Yearly Scale: Small daily savings multiply to millions.\nROI Narrative: Use these numbers in your hook and BOQ pitch.\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“A local contractor swapped to Isocam on a 50 m² façade and recouped the extra cost in just 8 months—thanks to those 7 °C savings.”\nActivity Instructions:\nCalculate: On your calculator, verify the daily saving for your chosen ΔT (2 min).\nDiscuss: In pairs, decide which option you’d recommend to a middle-income homeowner (3 min).\nShare: One pair shares their recommendation and reasoning (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nMiscalculated amp savings: Remind: 1 °C drop ≈ 1 amp saved per day.\nConfusion on time scale: Clarify: “Daily saving × 365 = yearly saving.”\u000b\nTransition:\n“Armed with these cost-benefit figures, you’re ready to enter our Apply block and start designing real walls in Revit later. Before that, let’s take a quick intro to BIM workflow.”\n80\n\nIntro to Building Information Modelling Workflow\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Screenshot of Revit Families Browser showing “MosulHouse” model and “Courtyard” family loaded\n*Screenshot of Revit Schedule view listing wall types, areas, and materials – with the “Export to CSV” button highlighted\n🏠 Load the “MosulHouse.rvt” family\n➕ Place the “Courtyard” void family in your model\n📋 Create a Wall Schedule (Area, Material, U-Value)\n💾 Export that schedule as CSV for analysis\n[10:25 – 10:30] – Intro to BIM Workflow (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how to use Revit (BIM) to place heritage interventions and extract quantitative data (wall areas, U-values) via a CSV export—so you can plug it directly into your ROI tools.\nSetup:\nTrainer’s workstation hooked to projector, logged into Revit with the “MosulHouse.rvt” file.\nParticipants’ screens blanked or minimized to focus attention on the projected demo.\u000b\nMaterials Needed:\nRevit license + “MosulHouse.rvt” on the trainer’s PC\nLaser pointer or clicker to highlight UI elements\u000b\nPre-Activity Checks:\nConfirm “Courtyard” family is loaded in the project.\nVerify the Wall Schedule template is available and exports correctly.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Here’s our BIM workflow in Revit. First, you’ll load the provided ‘MosulHouse.rvt’ family—this has the basic massing and wall types. Next, insert the Courtyard family into your floor-plan to represent the heritage void. Then switch to the Wall Schedule view: you’ll see each wall’s area, material, and U-value automatically populated. Finally, click Export > CSV and save that file. That CSV becomes your direct link into Excel or Grasshopper for pay-back analysis.”\nKey Points:\nParametric Intervention: Placing the Courtyard family instantly updates all your schedules.\nData-Driven Design: BIM lets you extract exact areas and performance parameters without manual measurement.\nSeamless Export: CSV output plugs straight into your ROI and energy-saving calculators.\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“In our pilot, one team dropped the courtyard family into their model and exported the updated wall schedule in under two minutes—then they saw their 3×3 m courtyard added 9 m² of shaded area automatically in the CSV.”\nActivity Instructions:\nWatch as I load the Courtyard family (on screen).\nObserve me place it in plan view (I’ll click and drag).\nOpen the Wall Schedule, note the new row for courtyard-adjacent walls.\nExport to CSV and preview the file’s first few lines in Notepad (just to confirm).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n“Family not found” error: Remind to place the .rfa file in the project’s family folder.\nCSV missing columns: Check that the Schedule includes Area and U-Value fields before exporting.\u000b\nTransition:\n“Now that you’ve seen how fast BIM can generate your input data, let’s switch gears to a soft-skills demo: the Mind-Map Design mini-class—where you’ll map out your project’s key concepts before diving into code or sketches.”\n81\n\nDesign Mind-Map\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[10:30 – 10:40] Mind-Map Design Mini-Class (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Equip teams with a simple visualization tool to connect client pains, solution ideas, resources, and outcomes—boosting creativity and clarity before detailed work.\nSetup:\nParticipants remain in their teams at tables.\nSlide projected full-screen.\nFlip-chart sheets and pens placed at each table.\u000b\nMaterials Needed:\nLarge paper or flip-chart per team\nColored markers or pens (at least 3 colors)\nSticky dots (optional, for prioritization)\u000b\nPre-Activity Checks:\nConfirm each table has markers and chart paper.\nEnsure the slide is legible from all seats.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“We’re going to map out our design thinking visually. Think of a mind-map as a way to link client pains to ideas, tools, and outcomes all on one page.”\n“First, write ‘Client Pain’ in the center. Add the top pains you uncovered—heat, damp, fuel bills.”\n“Then draw four branches: Ideas, Tools, Stakeholders, Outcomes.”\n“Under each branch, jot 3–5 bullets. Be quick—this is about free association, not perfect prose.”\n“Use different colors or small icons to make each branch pop.”\n“In 10 minutes, we’ll ask one team to share their map and highlight a surprising connection.”\u000b\nKey Points:\nCentralize the pain to keep solutions focused on client needs.\nBranch widely—more ideas at first, then we’ll refine.\nVisual clarity with colors/icons helps recall during design.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “Last cohort mapped ‘mold’ at the center, then branched into ‘hydrophobic paints’ and ‘courtyard drainage’—that led directly to their winning solution.”\nActivity Instructions:\n(1 min) Quickly draw the central node: “Client Pain.”\n(3 min) Add first-tier branches and label them.\n(4 min) Fill each branch with 3–5 ideas or entries.\n(1 min) Pick one branch and dot-vote your top two items (use sticky dots).\n(1 min) Prepare to share one insight.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams over-think entries → Solution: Remind “This is a rapid brainstorm—write first, judge later.”\nIssue: Maps look too messy → Solution: Encourage simple shapes and color grouping.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “In a moment, one team will share their map.

Follow the checklist on screen: first isolate your sun-facing façade, then draw a 50 m² surface—double-check with the area tool. Extrude that shape to match your wall thickness. Once your model is saved, take a quick screenshot and name it TeamX_SunWall.3dm or .rvt. This geometry will feed directly into our next Ladybug simulation to estimate energy savings.”\nKey Points:\nAccuracy: A precise 50 m² area ensures valid simulation inputs.\nConsistency: Uniform wall thickness across teams makes results comparable.\nRecord-keeping: Proper file naming and screenshots prevent mix-ups.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In our pilot cohort, teams who took two extra minutes to verify their area tool reading saw 5 % more accurate kWh savings in the final ROI.”\nActivity Instructions:\nOpen the massing file and hide all layers except the target wall.\nUse Rhino’s Area command (or Revit’s Measure) to draw exactly 50 m².\nExtrude the surface to 0.3 m thickness.\nSave your file and capture a screenshot showing the highlighted wall.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Area reads slightly off (e.g., 49.8 m²).\u000b Solution: Adjust your outline points to snap precisely to grid or use the Scale command to fine-tune.\nIssue: Extrusion flips inward.\u000b Solution: Reverse the normal direction or use the Flip option in the extrusion dialog.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “When you’ve got your wall model and screenshot, set it aside—next we’ll jump into Ladybug to turn that geometry into kWh savings.”\n87\n\nStep 2 – Ladybug Simulation → kWh Savings\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nChecklist\n🏗️ Load your TeamX_SunWall model into Ladybug\n📊 Set analysis period: 1 year, Mosul climate file\n⚡ Define baseline case (no courtyard retrofit)\n🌞 Define retrofit case (with courtyard/opening)\n▶️ Run annual energy simulation\n💾 Export kWh savings summary (e.g. TeamX_Ladybug.csv)\n📈 Note “Total kWh saved per year” for your BOQ\n11:35 – 11:50 (15 min)\u000b Session: Step 2 – Ladybug Simulation → kWh Savings\nPurpose:\u000b Convert your modeled sun-wall geometry into quantified annual energy savings using Ladybug, providing data for cost–benefit analysis.\nSetup:\u000b • Participants at their laptops with Rhino + Ladybug plugin installed.\u000b • Projector displaying the checklist and an example Ladybug result chart.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Mosul weather (.epw) climate file.\u000b • Ladybug-ready model with sun-wall geometry.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each participant can import the Rhino/Revit geometry into Ladybug.\u000b • Ensure the climate file is loaded and path references are correct.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we’ll turn our 50 m² wall model into real-world energy data. Follow the steps on screen: import your model into Ladybug, set up two scenarios (baseline vs. retrofit), and run the annual simulation. When it finishes, export the CSV and capture your total kWh saved each year. This number is your proof point for ROI—don’t lose it!”\nKey Points:\nBaseline vs. Retrofit: Always compare apples to apples—same geometry except for the retrofit feature.\nClimate Accuracy: Using Mosul’s .epw file ensures your results reflect local conditions.\nData Extraction: The exported kWh delta feeds directly into your BOQ cost calculations.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In our last session, one team found a 1 200 kWh annual saving from just their sun-wall tweak—that translated to 600 000 IQD per year in fuel costs avoided.”\nActivity Instructions:\nImport TeamX_SunWall file into Ladybug and assign materials.\nConfigure two runs: baseline (solid wall) and retrofit (courtyard opening).\nExecute “Run Annual Simulation” and wait for results.\nExport the “Annual Energy Summary” CSV and note the ΔkWh saved.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Simulation error “missing face.”\u000b Solution: Check that your geometry is closed polysurface with no naked edges.\nIssue: Results seem zero or identical.\u000b Solution: Verify that the retrofit case geometry is toggled on and different from baseline.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great—once you have your kWh savings, we’ll move on to Step 3: updating your BOQ and converting those energy savings into yearly IQD values.”\n88\n\nStep 3 – BOQ Update & Yearly IQD Conversion\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nEnergy Data → Cost Benefit\n📊 Metric\nValue\nFormula\n🔋 kWh saved/year\nΔkWh (from CSV)\n—\n💸 Cost rate\n500 IQD / kWh\n—\n🏷 IQD saved/year\nΔkWh × 500 IQD/kWh\ne.g. 1 200 kWh × 500 = 600 000 IQD\n11:50 – 12:05 (15 min)\u000bSession: Step 3 – BOQ Update & Yearly IQD Conversion\nPurpose:\u000b Translate your annual energy savings (kWh) into real IQD per year figures and embed them in your BOQ for clear financial storytelling.\nSetup:\nParticipants at their laptops with the exported Ladybug CSV.\nProjector showing the mini-table example above.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nExported TeamX_Ladybug.csv file.\nBOQ template (Excel or Google Sheet) open.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nConfirm each team has their ΔkWh saved/year.\nEnsure BOQ template has a placeholder row for “Annual Energy Savings.”\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now that you know how much energy your retrofit saves, let’s turn that into IQD. On screen is the simple math: multiply your annual kWh saved by 500 IQD per kWh—local generator cost—to get your yearly IQD savings. Then drop both numbers into your BOQ under a new line item ‘Annual Energy Savings.’ This will be a powerful data point when you pitch.”\nKey Points:\nDirect linkage: kWh → IQD gives clients a clear financial incentive.\nBOQ integration: Embedding this row makes your quote a complete financial package.\nValidation: Use your actual simulation output—don’t estimate.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “One team last month saved 1 500 kWh/year and quoted 750 000 IQD of cost avoidance—enough to fund half their material budget!”\nActivity Instructions:\nOpen your TeamX_Ladybug.csv and note the “Total Annual kWh Saved.” (2 min)\nIn your BOQ spreadsheet, insert a row: “Annual Energy Savings,” enter kWh and calculate IQD (=kWh_cell*500).

Accurate conversions ensure your BOQ matches real-world procurement.”\nKey Points:\nPrecision: Small errors multiply in large projects—double-check calculations.\nFlexibility: Switching units lets you adapt design outputs to supplier specs.\nPeer Review: A quick swap helps catch mistakes before uploads.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, a team once mis-converted tile counts by 10%—their supervisor caught it in this drill before ordering!”\nActivity Instructions:\nTackle Problem 1 and 2 on your worksheet individually. (5 min)\nSwap with a neighbor and verify each other’s answers. (3 min)\nWrite one corrected solution on the board for all to see. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusion over units (m² vs. m³).\u000b Solution: Remind: area units require square dimensions, volume units require cubic.\nIssue: Calculation errors.\u000b Solution: Encourage using scratch paper to break down steps.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent—your BOQ is now fully fleshed with performance, cost, visuals, and accurate quantities. Let’s wrap up this Learn block with Mind-Map Node Update!”\n91\n\nStep 6 – Mind-Map Node Update\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMind-Map Refresh\nAdd new nodes for today’s insights:\nΔT savings 💧\nMaterial cost vs performance 💰\nDigital modeling benefits 💻\nUse a sticky note and place it on the mind-map board\nCluster related ideas under “Thermal,” “Cost,” or “Design”\nTime: 12:25 – 12:30 (5 min)\u000b Session: Step 6 – Mind-Map Node Update\nPurpose:\u000b Capture fresh insights from the Design Studio so our collective mind-map stays current and reflects today’s thermal, financial, and digital wins.\nSetup:\nBring teams back to the mind-map wall or canvas.\nProvide a supply of sticky notes and pens nearby.\nDisplay the prompt slide for reference.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nSticky notes (various colors)\nPens or markers\nExisting mind-map chart on wall\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nEnsure mind-map area is clear for new notes.\nConfirm each team has at least one sticky note and pen.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “We’ve gathered a lot of data today—ΔT savings, BOQ numbers, and even our first digital modeling steps. Now let’s refresh our collective mind-map. On a sticky note, jot one new insight from your studio work under Thermal, Cost, or Design. Then place it on the board in the matching cluster.”\nKey Points:\nConciseness: One insight per note keeps the map readable.\nCategorization: Align each note to Thermal, Cost, or Design for clarity.\nEngagement: Everyone’s contribution enriches the group’s knowledge.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In yesterday’s session, a team added ‘8 °C ΔT → 36 000 IQD/mo saved’ under Thermal—and that note sparked our follow-up on payback.”\nActivity Instructions:\nWrite one key insight from your Design Studio work on a sticky note. (2 min)\nPlace it on the mind‐map under the correct category. (2 min)\nStep back and take a quick look at newly added nodes. (1 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Sticky note text too long.\u000b Solution: Remind: “Keep it to a short phrase or number.”\u000b\nIssue: Misplaced notes.\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Which cluster—Thermal, Cost, or Design? Let’s place it there.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great map update! Now let’s move into our Sell block, where you’ll pitch your sun-wall ROI and digital approach.”\n92\n\nSandwich ROI Sprint\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nOpen “Wall-ROI.xlsx” on your laptops\nInput: 50 m² sun-facing wall area\nSelect Good / Better / Best assemblies\nRead payback results (years)\nHighlight your team’s pay-back (≈ 3.5–4 yr)\n01:55 – Sandwich ROI Sprint (30 min)\u000b Purpose\u000b Provide hands-on practice calculating real pay-back periods for three wall assemblies, reinforcing cost-benefit decision-making.\nSetup\u000b Physical arrangement – Each team at a laptop station with power and Wi-Fi disabled (offline file).\u000b Materials needed – Preloaded Excel file “Wall-ROI.xlsx,” calculators, pens.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Confirm each laptop has the correct file version and that teams can open and edit.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Okay everyone, time to put numbers to those ‘Good, Better, Best’ assemblies. Open the Wall-ROI spreadsheet. You’ll enter 50 m² for the sun-facing wall, then choose each sandwich option in turn. Watch how the pay-back years change—most of you will see around 3.5 to 4 years. That’s our real-world gauge of value. Work as a team to confirm your numbers and circle the fastest pay-back.”\nKey Points\nPay-back = Total upgrade cost ÷ annual energy savings.\u000b\nA shorter pay-back (< 3 yr) is very compelling for clients; 3.5–4 yr is still strong in Mosul’s market.\u000b\nMaterial cost jump from Good→Better buys roughly 0.5–1 yr of pay-back improvement.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In Karadah district, one contractor pitched the cork option because it paid back in 3.2 years—families there saw immediate savings and referred him widely.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: On the first sheet, enter “50” in the wall-area cell.\u000b Step 2: Toggle the assembly dropdown from Good to Better to Best.\u000b Step 3: Record each pay-back value on your team worksheet.\u000b Step 4: Circle the shortest pay-back and prepare to share your finding.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b Issue: Spreadsheet won’t recalc when assembly changes.\u000b Solution: Press F9 or re-select the dropdown value to force recalc.\u000b Issue: Teams can’t find the pay-back cell.\u000b Solution: Guide them to column H, row 12 (labeled “Pay-back (yrs)”).\nTransition\u000b “Great work—lock in your pay-back insight, and next we’ll turn those numbers into buildable details with a wall-section sketch.”\n\n93\n\nEmpathy Map Touch-Up\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nReview your Ahmed family’s Empathy Map quadrants: FEEL, SEE, PAIN, GAIN\nAdd one new PAIN and one new GAIN based on wall upgrade insights (heat relief + cost)\nUse different-colour stickies for new entries\n02:55 – Empathy Map Touch-Up (10 min)\u000b Purpose\u000b Ensure that our technical solutions (improved envelope) connect to real user needs—link heat reduction and pay-back benefits to the Ahmed family’s emotional landscape.\nSetup\u000b Physical arrangement – Teams seated around their original Empathy Map board.\u000b Materials needed – Coloured stickies (new colour), markers, flip-chart space to post maps.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Verify each team has space on the board and fresh stickies; marker ink is working.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Now that you’ve seen how these wall ‘sandwiches’ cut heat and deliver a 3.5–4 year pay-back, let’s revisit our Ahmed family map. On a new sticky, jot down one additional PAIN they’ll feel relieved of—and one extra GAIN they’ll enjoy—because of your wall upgrade. Use green stickies for GAINS and red for PAINS. You have ten minutes—go!”\nKey Points\nLink technical benefit (ΔT reduction) to emotional relief (no more rooftop sleeping).\u000b\nTie pay-back timeline to financial security (monthly savings).\u000b\nEmphasise dignity: cooler rooms for women to use living spaces.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In Qadisiyah, a family reported that after their ‘Better’ wall upgrade, the grandmother could sit inside in summer for the first time—that’s a new GAIN we should capture.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: Identify one new PAIN alleviated by cooler walls or lower bills.\u000b Step 2: Identify one new GAIN (comfort, dignity, savings).\u000b Step 3: Place stickies in the PAIN and GAIN boxes and write a brief note.\u000b Step 4: Stand back and review your map—ready to share.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b Issue: Teams struggle to differentiate old vs new stickies.\u000b Solution: Remind them to use only the new-colour stickies for this activity.\u000b Issue: Some map areas are overcrowded.\u000b Solution: Encourage them to cluster similar insights or use the flip-chart next to the board.\nTransition\u000b “Fantastic—those fresh insights will fuel your budget-conscious sales pitch.

Not every homeowner can pay for a full façade retrofit upfront, but everyone wants cooler rooms—and they want to see pay-back. Our Sun-Side First strategy tackles the hottest wall first, so clients get immediate ΔT relief and savings.\nOn the right you see two options:\nCash up-front: 3.8-year pay-back at IQD X per m²\nThree-month instalments: IQD Y /mo (+ 5 % surcharge)\nEven with that small fee, they’re still under a 4-year ROI. Which approach would you recommend to Ahmed’s family?”\nKey Points\nPhased upgrade lowers initial cost but retains sub-4 yr pay-back.\nImmediate comfort builds trust when you tackle the sun-side first.\nTransparent terms (surcharge, timeline) eliminate sticker-shock.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In eastern Mosul, a contractor closed deals faster by offering the instalment plan—homeowners saw that monthly payments were still less than their generator bills.”\nActivity Instructions\nDiscuss in your team: cash vs instalment—which benefit would you highlight? (2 min)\nVolunteer share: one person explains why their choice makes sense for Ahmed’s family. (3 min)\nList objections on your worksheet and jot how you’d overcome each. (3 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nObjection: “The surcharge kills the ROI.”\u000b Fix: Compare monthly instalment to typical generator costs—show net savings.\nStuck in numbers: Teams over-detail.\u000b Fix: Refocus on sub-4 yr pay-back and client’s emotional relief (“cool nights”).\u000b\nTransition\n“Great insights on structuring payment.

Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker:!”  \n107\n\nIce-Breaker: “Plugin Ping-Pong”\nDay 4\n[00:35 – 00:45 – Ice-Breaker: Plugin Ping-Pong (10 min)]\u000b Purpose : Quick energizer, verify all participants have Rhino + Ladybug ready\u000b Purpose : Energize the room and confirm software installs before the deep-dive\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement – Tables in staggered rows; clear aisle for passing stick\u000b • Materials needed – One USB stick per row, timer/chime, small snack prize\u000b • Pre-activity checks – Confirm each trainer has tested USB ports on conference PCs\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, it’s time for Plugin Ping-Pong! You’ll pass this USB stick from the front of your row to the back. When it reaches the last person, they must plug it in and shout ‘Installed!’ Ready? Go!”\nKey Points ::\nSpeed and accuracy – It’s a race, but each install must complete\nSoftware check – This confirms Rhino + Ladybug are accessible on your machine\nTeamwork – Build energy through cooperative competition\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul’s reconstruction projects, getting tools installed swiftly can mean the difference between staying on schedule or missing critical field windows.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nAnnounce “Go!” and start the chime/timer\nParticipants pass the USB stick hand-to-hand down their row\nLast person inserts it, waits for the install confirmation dialog, then shouts “Installed!”\nFirst table to finish earns the snack—everyone else gives a round of applause\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b • Issue: USB won’t mount on a particular PC\u000b – Solution: Trainer swaps that stick to a different port or machine quickly\u000b • Issue: Late teams bunch up or bump into each other\u000b – Solution: Remind them to stay in their lanes and pass carefully\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—looks like everyone’s got the software ready. Let’s turn to our daily agenda so you know what comes next.”\n108\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 4\nDaily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n\n109\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 4\nWeek at a Glance: Day 1–5 Overview (5 min)\n\n\n110\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4 Learning Objectives\nDay 4\nLearn\nx\nApply\nx\nSell\nx\n[11:40–11:45] – Day 1 Learning Objectives (5 min)\n\n\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n112\n\nLadybug + BIM Workflow\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nImport 150 m² massing with courtyard\nToggle courtyard ON ↔ OFF\nRun annual cooling-load simulation (≥ 30 % target)\nOverlay moisture-risk isotherm\nExport heat-maps & CSV take-off\n 01:00 – Workflow Overview (10 min)\u000b Purpose : Ensure everyone understands the end-to-end simulation sequence before we dive into each tool. \nSetup : Physical arrangement -- Participants at their workstations with Rhino + Ladybug open; trainer at front with clicker.\u000b Materials needed -- Printed one-page flowchart handout for each team; sample 150 m² Rhino file loaded.\u000b Pre-activity checks -- Confirm toggle script works; verify Ladybug plugin is active; test export folder path. \nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s map out our journey for the next forty minutes. We’ll start by importing our model, flicking the courtyard on and off, running an annual run, layering moisture data, and ending with exportable heat-maps and CSV quantity take-offs.”\u000b “Think of this as our recipe: once you master each ingredient, you’ll create your own digital proof of performance.”\nKey Points ::\nImporting the massing anchors your site context.\nCourtyard toggles isolate the heritage intervention impact.\nAnnual sims give the full-year cooling picture, not just snapshots.\nLocal example ::\u000b “Yesterday you saw a 3 °C drop in a simple Rhino demo; today you’ll confirm a ≥30 % load reduction over 12 months.”\u000b\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Hand out flowchart and highlight each icon.\u000b Step 2: Ask participants to locate the same buttons in their Ladybug panel.\u000b Step 3: Confirm by having one volunteer name each step in sequence.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: “Toggle” button missing in Rhino toolbar. -- Solution: Have participants restart Rhino and re-load the Ladybug plugin.\u000b Issue: Export fails without proper folder path. -- Solution: Demonstrate setting the default “Results” folder in their user preferences.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—now that we all see the big picture, let’s jump into our first hands-on: toggling the courtyard on and off to generate those cooling-load numbers.”\nNext slide: Learn – Courtyard ON ↔ OFF Simulation\n113\n\nCourtyard ON ↔ OFF Simulation\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Full-bleed Rhino viewport screenshot showing the 150 m² massing with courtyard visible.\nA bright call-out arrow pointing to the ON/OFF toggle in the Ladybug toolbar.\nA second arrow pointing to the “Run Annual Simulation” button.\n01:10 – Courtyard ON ↔ OFF Simulation (10 min)\u000b Purpose : Give hands-on practice toggling the heritage intervention and running a full-year simulation to see real impact.\u000b Setup : Participants at workstations with the 150 m² Rhino model already loaded; trainer standing by with clicker.\u000b Materials needed : – Flowchart handout reminder – 150 m² Rhino file with courtyard layer – Ladybug plugin active\u000b Pre-activity checks : Verify everyone sees the Ladybug toolbar; ensure no geometry errors in the model.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here’s our first live run. Step 1: flick that courtyard toggle OFF to get your baseline. Step 2: switch it back ON to include the void. Notice how the model changes in real time.”\u000b “Next, click ‘Run Annual Simulation.’ This will compute cooling-load over 12 months. In a moment, you’ll see the percentage reduction—our digital proof of heritage cooling.”\nKey Points ::\nThe ON/OFF toggle isolates the courtyard’s effect—no courtyard, no performance gain.\nRunning an annual sim gives a comprehensive picture, not just a snapshot.\nThe percentage result is what we’ll use in our ROI and sales story.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Yesterday’s quick demo showed a 3 °C drop in surface temperature; this annual sim translates that into a 30 % electricity saving over the year.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: In Rhino, click the courtyard layer toggle to OFF, then ON.\u000b Step 2: In the Ladybug panel, click the ‘Run Annual Simulation’ icon.\u000b Step 3: Watch the progress bar and then note the ‘Cooling-Load Reduction: XX %’ value. Record it on your worksheet.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: The toggle button is grayed out. -- Solution: Check that the courtyard layer is unlocked and visible in Rhino’s layer manager.\u000b Issue: Simulation hangs at 0 %. -- Solution: Pause, then restart Ladybug or reimport the model.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that we’ve quantified cooling-load savings, let’s overlay moisture-risk data next to ensure our designs stay dry and durable.”\n\n114\n\nMoisture-Risk Isotherm Overlay\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Full-bleed Ladybug graphic showing the same 150 m² massing colored by dew-point risk.\nLegend in a corner: “Blue = Safe Zone; Purple = Condensation Risk.”\n01:20 – Moisture-Risk Isotherm Overlay (10 min)\nPurpose : Highlight potential condensation spots so participants can balance cooling gains with moisture safety.\u000b Setup : Trainees still at their Rhino+Ladybug workstations; trainer on mic to guide the overlay.\u000b Materials needed : 150 m² model with Ladybug, legend handout with color definitions.\u000b Pre-activity checks : Confirm everyone’s heat-map ran successfully; dew-point analysis layer available.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now we augment our cooling analysis with moisture-risk data. In Ladybug, toggle on the ‘Dew-Point Isotherm’ layer.”\u000b “Notice the areas colored purple—these zones have a temperature differential below 5 °C, so condensation can form.”\nKey Points ::\nCooling voids can create cold surfaces where humidity condenses.\nThe 5 °C threshold is the industry standard for dew-point risk.\nBalancing ΔT and risk keeps our designs both cool and durable.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul’s winter, we saw mould on inner walls when insulation ΔT dropped below 4 °C—this overlay would have predicted that.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: In Ladybug’s analysis menu, check “Dew-Point Isotherm.”\u000b Step 2: Adjust the threshold slider to 5 °C if needed.\u000b Step 3: Identify and note the percentage of roof area at risk. Record on your worksheet.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: No purple appears on the map. -- Solution: Check ambient humidity input in the Ladybug settings.\u000b Issue: Legend symbols overlap geometry. -- Solution: Drag the legend to an empty corner or reduce its opacity.\nTransition ::\u000b “With both cooling-load and moisture data in hand, our next step is exporting these heat-maps and take-off CSVs so we can build our BOM and ROI workbook.”\n115\n\nExporting Data & Take-Off CSV\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Screenshot of Ladybug’s Export panel highlighting the “CSV Take-Off” button.\n01:30 – Exporting Data & Take-Off CSV (10 min)\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here’s the critical step: exporting your take-off CSV. Click the ‘CSV Take-Off’ button in Ladybug’s Export panel.”\u000b “Follow our naming convention exactly so we can automatically link these files into the ROI workbook.”\nKey Points ::\nThe CSV contains all area, volume, and cooling-load numbers you need.\nConsistent file naming lets the ROI sheet pull data without manual entry.\nOrganizing by team folder avoids confusion when multiple exports land in the same directory.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Last month, Team A mislabeled their export and we lost five minutes troubleshooting. Today we stick to our format: Team2_Sandwich_TakeOff.csv.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: In Ladybug’s Export panel, click “CSV Take-Off.”\u000b Step 2: Name the file exactly Team#_Sandwich_TakeOff.csv.\u000b Step 3: Save in \\Project\\Day4\\Exports<YourTeam#>. Confirm you see it in Explorer.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: “CSV Take-Off” button is grayed out. – Solution: Rerun the simulation or restart Ladybug.\u000b Issue: File saved in wrong folder. – Solution: Move it immediately and notify the trainer if you can’t find it.\nTransition :\u000b “Great—now that you have your CSV, let’s take a quick break. After the break we’ll reconvene to import these numbers into our BOM and ROI workbook.”\n116\n\n🍴 LUNCH\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n30 minutes\n117\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n118\n\nPolish & Simulate Your Model!\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🧹 Clean up geometry: remove sketch lines & ensure courtyard void is solid\n🎨 Apply your chosen sandwich materials to each façade\n⚙️ Set Ladybug parameters: Annual cooling sim + moisture overlay\n01:50 – Model Refinement & Simulation Setup (20 min)\u000b Purpose: Make sure every team’s 150 m² model is tidy, correctly layered, and simulation-ready so our heat-maps & CSV outputs are accurate.\nSetup: \u000bEach workstation with Rhino open to the shared 150 m² file; Ladybug plugin loaded.\u000b Materials needed: Rhino model, material library loaded, Ladybug panel visible.\u000b Pre-activity checks: Confirm courtyard void is a closed polysurface; verify sandwich materials appear in Layers panel; test one quick sim preview earlier.\nFacilitator Script:: “Okay everyone—this is where precision pays off! Think of your Rhino model like your client’s home: neat, correctly detailed, and ready for performance testing. In the next 20 minutes you’ll clean geometry, assign your heritage-inspired sandwich, and dial in Ladybug’s annual cooling and moisture settings. Let’s dive in!”\nKey Points:: \u000b 1. Clean geometry prevents sim errors (no stray lines!).\u000b 2. Correct material assignments feed accurate thermal properties.\u000b 3. Right Ladybug settings = trustworthy heat-map & CSV take-off.\nLocal example:: “Here’s mine—see how I hid my construction lines and gave the north wall the Cork+Coat sandwich? My sim ran super smooth.”\nActivity Instructions::\u000bStep 1: Hide or delete any construction lines—only solid surfaces remain.\u000b Step 2: In the Layers panel, assign each façade its sandwich material layer.\u000b Step 3: Open Ladybug → set “Annual Simulation” on, tick “Moisture Isotherm,” then click Run.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b :: Issue: Model won’t simulate—error about invalid geometry.\u000b Solution: Zoom in, find stray lines or open polysurfaces; repair with Join or Cap.\u000b :: Issue: Missing material in dropdown.\u000b Solution: Re-load your sandwich library or restart Ladybug plugin.\nTransition: “Great work—once your sim finishes, we’ll move to exporting your heat-map PNG and CSV take-off so you can earn that ‘Cool-Pro’ stamp!”\n119\n\nPolish & Simulate Your Model!\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nPNG 📷\n• Run Ladybug → click “Export Image”\n• Save as Team1_HeatMap.png\nCSV 📊\n• Click “Export CSV Take-Off”\n• Save as Team1_TakeOff.csv\n30 %+ cut → earn your “Cool-Pro” stamp!\n02:10 – Exporting Deliverables & Stamp Criteria (20 min)\u000b Purpose: Ensure every team knows exactly which files to produce and earns the facilitator’s “Cool-Pro” stamp once they hit ≥30 % cut.\nSetup: Workstations still running Ladybug; export dialogs pre-opened if possible.\u000b Materials needed: Rhino + Ladybug session, file-save dialog ready.\u000b Pre-activity checks: Confirm each team’s simulation has completed without errors; check Ladybug panel shows >30 % cooling reduction.\nFacilitator Script:: \u000b“Alright teams, now that your simulations are done, it’s time to capture your results. We need two items from each of you: the heat-map image and the CSV take-off. Save them with your team number so I can stamp you ‘Cool-Pro’ as soon as I verify your cut is 30 % or more.”\nKey Points:: \u000b1. Exact filenames matter—use Team#_HeatMap.png and Team#_TakeOff.csv.\u000b 2. The heat-map PNG is your visual proof; the CSV is the data proof.\u000b 3. I’ll come around with my stamp once both files are in your folder and your reduction ≥30 %.\nLocal example:: “Here’s a demo: I exported my map as Team1_HeatMap.png and the take-off CSV as Team1_TakeOff.csv.

Got my stamp right away!”\nActivity Instructions:: \u000bStep 1: In Ladybug, click Export Image → navigate to shared folder → name it Team#_HeatMap.png.\u000b Step 2: Click Export CSV Take-Off → choose same folder → name it Team#_TakeOff.csv.\u000b Step 3: Raise your hand; I’ll confirm your simulation result and add your stamp.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b :: Issue: “Export Image” button greyed out.\u000b Solution: Ensure the simulation has fully finished (check progress bar).\u000b :: Issue: CSV file too large or missing data.\u000b Solution: Re-run take-off tool, verify sample area matches your façade selection.\nTransition : “Great—once you’re stamped, we’ll move on to building your BOM and populating the ROI workbook tabs.”\n120\n\nBuild Your BOM & ROI\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nImport CSV → BOM\n– Click “Data → Import CSV”\n– BOM tab auto-populates quantities & units\nEnter Prices → ROI\n– Input supplier cost per unit\n– Watch ROI & cash-flow chart update\n02:30 – APPLY – BOM + ROI Tabs (30 min)\u000b Purpose: Guide teams to turn their simulation outputs into a complete bill of materials and financial analysis.\nSetup: Each team’s folder contains their Team#_TakeOff.csv. Workbook “Digital-ROI.xlsx” open at the BOM sheet.\u000b Materials needed: Excel workbook pre-connected to ROI chart, calculator or device for quick cost lookup.\u000b Pre-activity checks: Verify each team’s CSV file is in their folder and named correctly; confirm workbook macros are enabled.\nFacilitator Script:: “Now that you’ve earned your Cool-Pro stamp, let’s populate your BOM. First, import your CSV take-off—this fills the quantities for each material. Then, type in your supplier or quoted price per unit. Instantly, you’ll see your ROI chart update with pay-back years and cash-flow lines.”\nKey Points:: \u000b1. The imported CSV gives accurate quantities—no manual entry needed.\u000b 2. Correct unit pricing is critical—double-check your supplier quotes.\u000b 3. The ROI chart reflects both cash cost and financing options side-by-side.\nLocal example:: “For Team1, I imported their CSV and entered 75,000 IQD/m² for cork. Instantly, the chart showed a 3.8-year payback.”\nActivity Instructions:: \u000bStep 1: In Excel, go to the BOM sheet → click Data → Import CSV → select Team#_TakeOff.csv.\u000b Step 2: Review auto-filled Quantity and Unit columns; correct any mismatches.\u000b Step 3: Enter your chosen supplier price under the “Cost” column.\u000b Step 4: Switch to the ROI tab and observe the updated payback period and cash-flow chart.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b :: Issue: Imported columns misaligned.\u000b Solution: Check that CSV columns match the template headers; re-import if needed.\u000b :: Issue: ROI chart not updating.\u000b Solution: Ensure macros are enabled and that the “Cost” cells are formatted as numbers.\nTransition : “Once everyone has a clear ROI chart, we’ll move into Budget Reality Check to ensure your client proposals are both compelling and feasible.”\n121\n\n🕛 SELL\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n122\n\nTariff Toggle Demo\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*screenshots of your ROI chart with the tariff set to 8 ¢\n*screenshots of your ROI chart with the tariff set to 17 ¢\n[03:00 – Tariff Toggle Demo (10 min)]\nPurpose :\u000b Show teams how changing the energy tariff dramatically shifts their ROI curve, reinforcing the value of targeting the right financing assumptions.\nSetup :\u000b • Trainer laptop open to the “ROI Workbook.”\u000b • Projector displaying the chart and tariff input cells side by side.\u000b • Ensure both “Tariff (¢/kWh)” fields and the pay-back chart are visible.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright, everyone: here’s our baseline pay-back at 8 ¢ per kWh. Now watch what happens when we bump that to 17 ¢—slide your eyes to the orange curve. See how the breakeven point nearly halves? That’s the power of accurate rates in your pitch.”\nKey Points ::\nUtility Cost Impact: Higher unit cost shortens pay-back.\nChart Interpretation: The “knee” of the curve marks your breakeven year.\nAssumption Sensitivity: Small tariff changes can make or break your ROI story.\u000b\nLocal Example ::\u000b “In Mosul, generator fuel at peak summer can cost closer to 17 ¢ per kWh. Using that real number here makes your proposal far more compelling to a cautious homeowner.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nTrainer toggles the tariff cell from 8 ¢ to 17 ¢.\u000b\nPause 10 s for teams to note the breakeven shift on their own screens.\u000b\nAsk one team to call out the exact year change.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b • Issue: Teams can’t find the tariff cell.\u000b Solution: Point to the labeled input box at the top of the sheet.\u000b • Issue: Chart doesn’t update.\u000b Solution: Remind them to hit “Recalculate” or ensure auto-calc is on.\nTransition :\u000b “Great—now that we’ve validated our tariff assumption, let’s check for any dangerously high markups. Up next: Markup Validation & Red-Flag Cells.”\n123\n\nMarkup Validation & Red-Flag Cells\nDay 4\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*screenshot of the ROI workbook’s “Markup %” column, with any cells over 40 % glowing red\n“Keep your markup ≤ 40 % to stay competitive”\n03:10 – Markup Validation & Red-Flag Cells (5 min)\u000b Purpose : Ensure pricing stays realistic by instantly flagging excessive markups.\u000b Setup :\u000b Physical arrangement -- Trainer laptop/projector showing the exact workbook view; all teams on their own screens.\u000b Materials needed -- ROI workbook pre-loaded with sample data; projector remote.\u000b Pre-activity checks -- Confirm conditional formatting is active so red highlighting works.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we’ve nailed our tariffs, let’s make sure we’re not over-pricing. See this markup column? Anything above 40 % turns red automatically. Why? Because home-owners know a fair margin is under that threshold.”\nKey Points ::\nReal-time feedback – red cells catch high margins instantly.\nCompetitive edge – staying under 40 % keeps you in the game.\nEthical practice – fair pricing builds trust and referrals.\nLocal Example ::\u000b “In Mosul’s market, clients often push back hard when they spot our margin jumping above 35 %. Keeping it under 40 % makes negotiations smoother.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Each team scans their markup column for red cells.\u000b Step 2: If any red appears, adjust one line-item’s markup downward until the red disappears.\u000b Step 3: Share the final highest markup % with your neighbor.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: No red formatting appears.\u000b Solution: Check that the “Markup %” column uses the correct conditional-format rule (Highlight > 40 %).\u000b Issue: Teams can’t find which row to adjust.\u000b Solution: Remind them that overhead and labour are easiest to trim by renegotiating vendor rates or cutting ancillary costs.\nTransition :\u000b “Perfect—our prices are now both profitable and fair. Next up is our Digital-Marketing Sprint, where you’ll turn these results into a 60-second clip for clients and bosses.”\n124\n\nDigital-Marketing Sprint\nTemplate: Hook → Proof→ ROI → Ask\nDay 4\n03:15 – Digital-Marketing Sprint (25 min)\nPurpose : Transform your technical findings into a compelling marketing message that clients and bosses will love.\nSetup :\u000b Physical arrangement – Teams grouped around phones or laptops with VN (VivaVideo) app installed; projector ready to demo.\u000b Materials needed – Heat-map PNGs, ROI charts (PNG/CSV), phones with VN app, 4-step template cards.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Confirm each device can import images into VN; distribute template cards.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright teams, it’s time to become digital storytellers. You have your heat-map for proof and your ROI numbers for impact. In 60 seconds, craft a clip that hooks your client, shows the proof, highlights the ROI, and ends with a clear ask.”\nKey Points ::\nHook: Grab attention in the first 5 seconds (e.g., “Your roof can feel 8 °C cooler!”)\nProof: Show the heat-map visual with a quick caption.\nROI: Overlay the pay-back period (“2.5 yr pay-back!”).\nAsk: End with a call-to-action (“Call us now for a free audit!”).\nLocal Example ::\u000b “Use Arabic captions like ‘▼ 30 % bill, ▲ 3 t CO₂/yr’ and a simple icon for WhatsApp to make it familiar for Mosul audiences.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Import your heat-map PNG and ROI chart into the VN app.\u000b Step 2: Arrange clips in the order Hook → Proof → ROI → Ask.\u000b Step 3: Add short Arabic text overlays (from your template card).\u000b Step 4: Export as ≤ 25 MB MP4 and save as Team#_Marketing.mp4.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Clip too long (> 60 s)\u000b Solution: Trim one segment or speed up proof section to 1.5×.\u000b Issue: Text unreadable on small phone screen\u000b Solution: Use large font and high-contrast colors.\nTransition :\u000b “Fantastic work!

Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker:!”  \n135\n\nIce-Breaker: “Elevator-Pitch Chain”\nDay 5\n00:35 – Ice-Breaker – Elevator-Pitch Chain (10 min)\u000b Purpose : Warm up and reinforce our Hook→Proof→ROI→Ask structure in a playful way.\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement – Four rows facing front; each row an “assembly line.”\u000b • Materials needed – None.

Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context.

The other targets their boss or bank officer—focusing on logic, risk management, and trust proof.”\nKey Points ::\nClient Deck must start with a clear problem statement and end with a compelling ROI number.\nBoss Deck needs bullet-proof logic: show numbers, address risks (e.g., maintenance, dust), then reinforce with peer testimonials.\nThe same clip QR code works in both—visual proof ties it all together.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Remember Ghassan’s renovation? His customer deck led to a 10-year service contract, while his boss deck secured a green loan at 5 % interest.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: In your Client template, insert: Slide 1 = Problem (photo + heat data), Slide 2 = Your courtyard solution + ΔT, Slide 3 = ROI chart + QR code.\u000b Step 2: In your Boss template, insert: Slide 1 = Cooling-load reduction table, Slide 2 = Tariff sensitivity & risk flags, Slide 3 = Testimonial clip screenshot + QR code.\u000b Step 3: Save both decks as PDF and share in the class folder by 03:35.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: QR code unreadable on slide.\u000b Solution: Increase size to at least 2 × 2 cm and test with a phone.\u000b Issue: Boss deck too technical.\u000b Solution: Simplify language—use icons and short bullet points.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—once your decks are uploaded, we’ll move into our Pitch-Back Session to practice delivering them live.”\n149\n\nPitch-Back Rehearsal\nDay 5\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nRole-Card Feedback\nBoss: Score Clarity (0–3)\nColleague: Score Trust (0–3)\nTeam Rounds\n2-min Deck Pitch\n20-s Clip Showcase\n03:35 – Pitch-Back Rehearsal (30 min)\u000b Purpose : Give teams a live market practice—deliver their decks and clips, receive candid feedback, and sharpen their delivery.\nSetup :\nPhysical arrangement – Teams line up; you’ll have a timer visible.\nMaterials needed – Printed role cards (Boss / Colleague), score sheets, projector.\nPre-activity checks – Ensure audio works for all clips; timer is at hand.\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, this is our market rehearsal. Each team has two minutes to pitch their Client or Boss deck, then play your 20-second marketing clip. Your ‘boss’ and ‘colleague’ will score you—one on clarity, the other on trust. Let’s treat this as your first live client meeting!”\nKey Points ::\nStay on time – I’ll cue you at 1:30 and give a 30-s wrap-up warning.\nEngage your role-players – Ask eye contact, invite quick questions in the last 30 seconds if time allows.\nIntegrate your clip smoothly—no tech hitches.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Imagine this is your first pitch to Engineer Ahmed—clear, concise, and backed by that heat-map clip.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nTeam A goes first. Timer starts at 2:00.\nAt 1:30, you get a 30-s warning.\nAfter pitch + clip, Boss and Colleague each fill a quick 0–3 score and one-line comment.\nRotate to the next team until all have presented.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Clip won’t play.\nSolution: Have a backup on your phone; share screen if needed.\u000b\nIssue: Over-run time.\nSolution: I’ll gently cut you off at 2:00 and we’ll debrief quickly.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great job! Once all teams finish, we’ll launch our Alumni WhatsApp group and set up our monthly meetup schedule.”\n150\n\nAlumni WhatsApp Launch\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 5\nScan Here\n04:05 – Alumni WhatsApp Launch (10 min)\u000b Purpose : Build community continuity—ensure participants stay connected, share wins, and access support.\nSetup :\u000b Physical arrangement – Project the slide with QR code; place printed backup QR cards on each table.\u000b Materials needed – Projector, printed QR cards, flip-chart to record meetup date.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Confirm participants have WhatsApp and camera ready for QR scan.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, let’s become a community that lasts beyond today. First, point your phones at this QR code to join our Alumni WhatsApp group. Once you’ve joined, shout out a preferred date for our first monthly meetup and I’ll note it here.”\nKey Points ::\nInstant connection – Joining the group brings you tips and answers in real time.\nAccountability – Monthly meetups keep our momentum going.\nSupport network – Use this space to share questions, supplier leads, and success stories.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “I’ve been part of a Mosul architects’ group that met monthly—every member brought a case study, and our collective experience improved each project.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Scan the QR code on-screen or from your printed card (1 min)\u000b Step 2: In the chat, post one sentence: “My ideal meetup date is ___” (3 min)\u000b Step 3: I’ll capture the top two dates on the flip-chart for a quick vote (5 min)\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Can’t scan QR?\u000b Solution: I’ll drop the group link in chat—just tap to join.\u000b Issue: No WhatsApp?\u000b Solution: Let me know now; we’ll add you manually via your phone number.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—now that our community is set, let’s celebrate your achievements with your certificates.”\n151\n\nReflection & Certificates\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 5\n30-Day Action Plan:\nWeek 1: Conduct a passive cooling audit on one real house – share your 3 heat-pain photos and ΔT in the WhatsApp group\nWeek 2: Run a Rhino+Ladybug courtyard simulation for a second project – post your before/after heat-map\nWeek 3: Deliver a 1-minute “sun-side first” pitch to a colleague or friend – record feedback & revise your hook\nWeek 4: Host a mini “heritage + green” demo for at least two peers – gather their ROI questions\nCollect Your Certificate   (Days 1–5 completed)\n\n❓ Ideas to improve sessions\n💡 Insights\n🤔 Questions\n04.15 20 min Reflection & Certificates (20 min)\u000b\nPurpose: Consolidate learning, surface final insights, and celebrate completion.\u000b Setup:\nArrange sticky-note station by the wall with three headings: Idea, Insight, Next Step.\nHave certificates printed and ready for hand-out.\nDisplay slide on projector.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Alright everyone, let’s pause and reflect on our journey through Module 3. Grab three stickies: one for an Idea you’re excited to try, one for a key Insight, and one Next Step you commit to. Post them on the wall.”\u000b (Allow 8 minutes for writing and posting.)\u000b “Wonderful—thank you for sharing! These reflections will guide our 30-Day Action Plan. Now, I’m proud to award each of you the Module 3 certificate.”\u000b (Hand out certificates, congratulate each participant.)\nKey Points:\nReflection solidifies learning—writing it down makes it stick.\nImmediate action sets the stage for real-world impact.\nCommunity sharing keeps everyone accountable.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “Last year, a Mosul team used our 30-Day Plan to retrofit a Mashrabiya screen on a family home—within three weeks, the owners reported a 5 °C drop and shared a viral clip in our alumni group.”\nTransition:\u000b “Keep these certificates as a reminder of your new skills. Head to the WhatsApp group tonight and post your Week 1 audit results by next Monday.”\n152\n"

They have a 5-day Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design module\n2. Current structure follows Learn-Apply-Sell daily rhythm\n3. Focus is heavily on technical/digital tools (Rhino, Ladybug, BIM)\n4. Outputs include heat maps, ROI calculations, marketing clips\n5. Ends with certificates and alumni WhatsApp group\n\nProposed New Design (from their bullet points):\nDay 1: Problems & Principles & Customer Orientation + Courtyards & Climate\n- Homework: Material supply shop research, populate BOQ with real data\nDay 2: Materials & Methods + Site tours + ROI for partial façade \nDay 3: Digital + Creativity, Design & Digital Modeling + Soft skills (mind mapping)\nDay 4: Costing & Refinement + BOQ production + Bid/proposal design + Negotiation\nDay 5: Site visits + Design sprint/competition + Presentation skills\n\nKey Changes I'm Seeing:\n1. More emphasis on real market research and supplier relationships\n2. Shift from WhatsApp to Instagram for social proof\n3. Addition of \"soft skills\" components (negotiation, presentation, mind mapping)\n4. More emphasis on BOQ creation and bid/proposal processes\n5. Actual site visits and hands-on work\n6. Design competition/hackathon element\n\nFrom Wifaq's feedback (document 3), I can see:\n- Concerns about cognitive load management\n- Need for negotiation and mind mapping skills\n- BOQ and measurement basics\n- Project management fundamentals\n- Site visits to heritage locations\n\nLet me design this new curriculum day by day:\n\nNew Design:\n\n**Day 1: Customer Problems & Heritage Principles**\nLearn: Client empathy, Mosul's climate challenges, heritage cooling principles\nApply: Market research sprint - visit suppliers, collect datasheets, prices, photos\n\n\nSell: Crafting customer pain narratives through empathy mapping, leveraging Instagram to showcase supplier insights\nHomework: Populate detailed BOQ spreadsheet with authentic supplier data, create compelling visual content for social media\n\n**Day 2: Materials & Methods in Practice**\nLearn: Exploring material characteristics, thermal performance nuances, cost-efficiency strategies\nApply: Immersive site exploration of Old City courtyards, hands-on materials testing\nSell: Developing persuasive ROI presentations for targeted façade upgrades\nHomework: Create engaging Instagram stories capturing site visit revelations and material insights\n\n**Day 3: Digital Design & Soft Skills**\nLearn: Integrating BIM workflows, simulation fundamentals, design thinking through mind mapping\nApply: Advanced digital modeling techniques, simulation exploration, creative problem-solving workshop\nSell: Presenting innovative design concepts using dynamic mind map visualizations\nHomework: Produce compelling Instagram video documenting design process evolution\n\n**Day 4: BOQ, Bidding & Negotiation**\nLearn: Mastering BOQ construction, strategic bid writing, negotiation core principles\nApply: Developing comparative BOQ frameworks, simulating complex negotiation scenarios\nSell: Crafting persuasive proposal presentations with practical negotiation demonstrations\nHomework: Generate Instagram content highlighting pricing transparency insights\n\n**Day 5: Design Competition & Presentation**\nLearn: Refining presentation techniques, understanding competition brief intricacies\nApply: Intensive 5-hour design sprint challenging creative boundaries\nSell: Delivering impactful final presentations, leveraging Instagram for public engagement and voting\nHomework: Develop comprehensive 30-day strategic action plan\n\nGoogle Sheets workbook designed as comprehensive project management tool:\n1. Tracking daily learning progression\n2. Systematically capturing supplier research data\n3. Creating adaptable BOQ template structures\n4. Generating dynamic ROI calculation models\n5.
