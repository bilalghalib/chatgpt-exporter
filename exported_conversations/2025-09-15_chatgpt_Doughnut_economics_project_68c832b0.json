      "content": "Great question. Here’s a crisp, practitioner-friendly take.\n\n# What is a “Doughnut Economics” project?\nA project that aims to help a place (or an organization) thrive **within the Doughnut**: i.e., meeting everyone’s essential social needs (the *social foundation*) without overshooting Earth’s ecological limits (the *ecological ceiling*). Practically, Doughnut work is usually framed through the **City/Place Portrait’s four lenses**: local-social, local-ecological, global-ecological, and global-social. citeturn0search0turn0search5\n\nTypical real-world examples include city strategies (e.g., Amsterdam’s circular plan informed by the City Doughnut) and organization-level redesign using the **Doughnut Design for Business** tool. citeturn0search19turn0search16turn0search3\n\n## Core features of a Doughnut project\n- **Place-based & participatory.** Builds a *Data Portrait of Place* (quantitative baselines) and a *Community Portrait* (qualitative priorities) with residents, civil society, business, and government. citeturn0search11  \n- **Four-lens framing.** Every idea is stress-tested against local/global & social/ecological effects to avoid shifting burdens elsewhere. citeturn0search1turn0search5  \n- **Regenerative & distributive design.** Prefers circular material flows, fair value chains, and ownership/governance forms that share value and voice. citeturn0search0  \n- **Policy + market alignment.** Moves through procurement, zoning, standards, and buyer commitments (not just pilots). Amsterdam is a leading case. citeturn0search9turn0search6  \n- **Open tools & iteration.** Uses DEAL’s open resources; iterates as evidence and community input evolve. citeturn0search7\n\n# What would a “Doughnut Accelerator” be?\nThink “YC for regenerative, place-based transformation,” not just startups. A **Doughnut Accelerator** would cohort projects across public, civic, and enterprise actors that measurably move a city/region into the Doughnut—pairing venture building with policy, procurement, and neighborhood pilots. (Cities like Amsterdam and others applying the Doughnut show the policy side is real; an accelerator knits that to ventures and community initiatives.) citeturn0search16turn0search12turn0news49\n\n## Who it serves\n- **Civic & public teams:** municipal departments, public-interest labs.  \n- **Enterprises & co-ops/SMEs:** product or service businesses redesigning around circularity and equity.  \n- **Community initiatives & NGOs:** neighborhood retrofits, food systems, repair/reuse hubs.  \n- **Institutional buyers:** hospitals, universities, city procurement—critical for demand pull.\n\n## How it should work (operating model)\n**1) Intake & selection (4 lenses)**\n- Clear *place-based* challenge briefs (e.g., “retrofit blocks X–Y,” “hospital textiles circularity,” “heat resilience in low-income districts”).  \n- Selection rubrics score: Four-lens impact, community co-governance, feasibility/additionality, learning value, and procurement readiness. (Use DEAL’s City Portrait + Design for Business as scaffolds.) citeturn0search5turn0search3\n\n**2) 10–12 week program (example cadence)**\n- **Week 0–1: Portrait & baselines.** Build a mini *Data Portrait of Place*; map stakeholders & harms/benefits across the four lenses. citeturn0search11  \n- **Week 2–3: Deep design.** Redesign ownership, governance, and revenue to be regenerative & distributive (using *Doughnut Design for Business*). citeturn0search3  \n- **Week 4–5: Circular & equity sprints.** Material flow mapping, repair/reuse models, fair-work standards, inclusion.  \n- **Week 6–7: Policy & procurement.** Translate pilots into tenders/MOUs; align with city circular strategies where relevant (e.g., Amsterdam’s). citeturn0search19  \n- **Week 8–9: Measurement.** Build a **Doughnut Scorecard**: indicators for each lens (local air/heat, housing access, global material footprint, global labor conditions).  \n- **Week 10–11: Finance & delivery.** Blended finance stacks (grants + revenue-based + municipal offtake); implementation plans.  \n- **Week 12: Demo & adoption.** Joint showcase with city/procurers; match projects to sites and buyers.\n\n**3) Mentors & infrastructure**\n- Systems design, circular economy, labor & inclusion, civic procurement, and impact measurement experts (plus residents as co-mentors).  \n- Shared services: LCA-lite templates, open data repository, legal templates for cooperative/mission-lock structures.\n\n**4) Capital & incentives**\n- **Demand-first:** secure anchor buyers (municipal, hospital, university).  \n- **Blended finance:** catalytic grants for pilots → revenue-tied or recoverable advances → procurement contracts/PPAs/availability payments.  \n- **Pay-for-benefit pilots:** bonuses for verified reductions (e.g., waste, heat-risk) and improvements (e.g., access to essentials).\n\n**5) Governance**\n- Community advisory circle to approve challenge briefs and assess distributional impacts.  \n- **Open learning** covenant: publish playbooks, footprints, and scorecards (privacy-respecting) back to the city’s Doughnut knowledge base. citeturn0search7\n\n## What participants produce (graduation “bundle”)\n- **Mini City/Place Portrait** for their project area with baselines and targets. citeturn0search1  \n- **Enterprise Doughnut** (if a business): redesigned ownership/governance & strategy map. citeturn0search3  \n- **Doughnut Scorecard** with 8–12 indicators tied to the four lenses, data plan, and verification approach. citeturn0search5  \n- **Adoption pathway:** procurement/MOU or buyer LOI, site plan, budget, and delivery schedule.\n\n## A simple Doughnut Scorecard (starter set)\n- **Local-Social:** access to affordable warm/cool housing; living-wage jobs created; community co-ownership %; participation rates.  \n- **Local-Ecological:** neighborhood PM2.5/NO₂ deltas; urban heat island reduction; biodiversity/green cover change.  \n- **Global-Ecological:** product/service material footprint; % recycled/renewable inputs; lifecycle emissions per unit.  \n- **Global-Social:** fair-work compliance in supply chain; % spend with ethical suppliers; grievance resolution metrics.  \n(These map to the City Portrait logic and can reference a city’s circular strategy where available.) citeturn0search5turn0search19\n\n## Why this model works\n- It **prevents burden-shifting** (e.g., “green” locally but exploitative globally) via the four-lens checks. citeturn0search1  \n- It connects **policy + procurement + ventures**, which is how Amsterdam and others are turning ideas into citywide practice. citeturn0search19turn0search12  \n- It uses **open tools** so cohorts can learn from other cities and projects. citeturn0search7\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can spin this into a one-page “Doughnut Accelerator” concept note (with a selection rubric and a 12-week syllabus) tailored to your city or sector.",
