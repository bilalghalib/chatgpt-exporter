      "content": "This error message suggests that there are two separate issues that need to be resolved.\n\nThe first issue is related to the environment variable `MOBILE_PROSE_HOST`. This variable is not set or is not set correctly in your environment, which is causing the error. You should check if this variable is required by the application you are working on and set it to the appropriate value. If you are unsure what the value should be, you should consult the documentation or contact the application developers for assistance.\n\nThe second issue is related to the registration of the main component of your application with `AppRegistry.registerComponent`. This error occurs when the main component is not registered with `AppRegistry`. To resolve this issue, you should make sure that the component is correctly defined and registered with `AppRegistry` using the appropriate syntax. You may also want to check if there are any other errors that may be preventing the component from being registered properly.\n\nOnce you have resolved both issues, you should be able to run your application without encountering these errors.",
