Tomorrow insha'allah we'll have 20 mins to discuss your projects, your journey with Bloom in the ACSI program, and any advice you might want to share with the new ACSI teams. \n\nWe'll also encourage you to join us in the selection process and to watch the pitching at the end. It should be an exciting day. \n\nFeel free to share some instagram handles/project and life updates in this thread. See you all soon! \n\n+BG\"\"",
