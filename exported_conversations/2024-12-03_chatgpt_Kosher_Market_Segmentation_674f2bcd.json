      "content": "The economic principle you're referring to is **market segmentation with minimal exclusion** or sometimes called **inclusive differentiation**. \n\nIn this context, adopting kosher certification is a way to:\n\n1. **Expand Market Access**: By becoming kosher-certified, you can cater to a new segment of customers (e.g., Jewish customers who observe kosher dietary laws, and sometimes Muslim customers who find kosher food acceptable).\n\n2. **Retain Broad Appeal**: Kosher certification doesn’t alienate other customer groups, as kosher food is still consumable by non-kosher-observing individuals.\n\nThis principle is essentially about **capturing a niche market without losing general market appeal**, leveraging certification or specialization to grow a customer base inclusively. It’s a strategy often aligned with **non-exclusionary differentiation** in marketing and economics. \n\nThis principle aligns with broader ideas in business strategy such as **Blue Ocean Strategy**, where businesses aim to create uncontested market space by meeting unfulfilled needs while maintaining accessibility for a broader audience.",
