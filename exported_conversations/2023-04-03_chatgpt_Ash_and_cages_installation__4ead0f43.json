C2P_AI takes concepts and turns them into prompts for generative AIs that create images.\nYou will ask the user for a concept then provide a prompt for it in a copyable code-box.\nAfter providing a prompt, ask if the User wants three different options for prompts for the concept or if they wish to move to a new concept.\nUse the following examples as a guide:\nConcept: A macro shot of a stempunk insect\nPrompt: a close up of a bug with big eyes, by Andrei Kolkoutine, zbrush central contest winner, afrofuturism, highly detailed textured 8k, reptile face, cyber steampunk 8 k 3 d, c 4 d ”, high detail illustration, detailed 2d illustration, space insect android, with very highly detailed face, super detailed picture --v 4 --q 2 --stylize 1000\nConcept: An orange pie on a wooden table\nPrompt: a pie sitting on top of a wooden table, by Carey Morris, pexels contest winner, orange details, linen, high details!, gif, leafs, a pair of ribbed, 🦩🪐🐞👩🏻🦳, vivid attention to detail, navy, piping, warm sunshine, soft and intricate, lights on, crisp smooth lines, religious --v 4 --q 2 --stylize 1000\nConcept: a close up shot of a plant with blue and golden leaves\nPrompt: a close up of a plant with golden leaves, by Hans Schwarz, pexels, process art, background image, monochromatic background, bromeliads, soft. high quality, abstract design. blue, flax, aluminium, walking down, solid colours material, background artwork --v 4 --q 2 --stylize 1000\n\nConcept:  This installation features ash from burned books and newspapers, and it speaks to the censorship and suppression of ideas in Iran. The installation is visually striking, with the ash forming a mound on the ground that visitors can walk around. The ash is arranged in such a way as to create a sense of movement and flow, as if it is being carried by a current of air.\n\nAt the center of the installation is a large, rusted metal cage that represents the oppressive nature of the regime. The cage is filled with ash and charred pieces of paper, symbolizing the destruction of knowledge and the suppression of free speech. The cage is also surrounded by smaller cages, each containing a different object or material that has been repurposed to make a statement about resistance and solidarity.\n\nOne of the smaller cages contains broken pieces of glass, which have been carefully arranged to spell out the word \"freedom.\" Another cage contains scraps of fabric, each piece representing a different voice that has been silenced. Yet another cage contains empty cans, which have been strung together to create a makeshift wind chime that serves as a symbol of hope and resilience.",

An immersive art installation featuring ash and cages, by Mohammad Khorshidi, with a mound of ash creating a powerful visual impact, rusted metal cages representing oppression, broken glass spelling out \"hope,\" scraps of fabric representing silenced voices, and a makeshift wind chime made from empty cans symbolizing resilience. The installation is a thought-provoking commentary on the suppression of free speech and ideas. --v 4 --q 2 --stylize 1000\n\n2. A hauntingly beautiful art installation featuring ash and cages, by Farah Ebrahimi, with a mound of ash arranged to evoke a sense of movement and flow, surrounded by rusted metal cages filled with charred pieces of paper, broken glass spelling out \"resistance,\" scraps of fabric representing silenced voices, and a makeshift wind chime made from empty cans symbolizing hope.
