      "content": "Lactation cookies are a popular snack for nursing mothers, believed to help increase milk supply due to certain ingredients like oats, brewer's yeast, flaxseed, and fenugreek. Here's a basic recipe for you:\n\n### Lactation Cookie Recipe\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup butter (softened)\n- 1 cup sugar\n- 1 cup brown sugar\n- 4 tablespoons water\n- 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal\n- 2 large eggs\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 2 cups flour\n- 1 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 3 cups thick cut oats\n- 1 cup chocolate chips or raisins (optional)\n- 2-4 tablespoons brewer's yeast (do not substitute with baking yeast)\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).\n\n2. **Mix flaxseed meal and water**, set aside for 3-5 minutes.\n\n3. **Cream butter and sugars** together in a large bowl.\n\n4. **Add eggs** one at a time, beating well after each addition.\n\n5. **Mix in flaxseed mixture** and vanilla, blend well.\n\n6. **In a separate bowl**, sift together flour, brewer's yeast, baking soda, and salt.\n\n7. **Add dry ingredients** to butter mixture, stirring until blended.\n\n8. **Stir in oats** and optional chocolate chips or raisins.\n\n9. **Drop dough** by spoonfuls onto a baking sheet.\n\n10. **Bake for 12-15 minutes**, or until edges are golden brown.\n\n11. **Let cool** before serving.\n\nRemember, while these cookies contain ingredients that may aid lactation, they're not a guaranteed solution for milk supply issues. If you're experiencing significant challenges with breastfeeding, it's always a good idea to consult with a lactation consultant or healthcare provider. Enjoy your baking!",
