      "content": "It sounds like you're referring to the hadith about the qualities of **forbearance (ḥilm)** and **deliberation (anāh)** that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) praised in a companion. \n\nThe hadith is narrated in **Sahih Muslim**:\n\n> **“You have two qualities that Allah loves: forbearance (ḥilm) and deliberation (anāh).”**  \n> (Sahih Muslim 17:25)\n\nThis was said to **Ashajj ‘Abd al-Qays**, a leader of the tribe of **‘Abd al-Qays**, when he came to visit the Prophet ﷺ. Unlike others in his delegation who rushed to meet the Prophet, Ashajj took his time, changing his clothes and preparing himself properly before approaching. The Prophet ﷺ recognized this as a sign of wisdom and praised his calm, deliberate nature.\n\nThis hadith emphasizes the value of being composed, patient, and thoughtful in one’s actions. It suggests that these qualities are not just personal virtues but are beloved by Allah.",
