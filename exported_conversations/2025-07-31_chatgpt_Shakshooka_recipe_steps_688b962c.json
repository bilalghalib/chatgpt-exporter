Here’s the classic shakshooka next steps:\n\n### 1. **Add spices**\nNow’s the time to bloom your spices in the oil:\n- 1 tsp ground cumin  \n- 1 tsp paprika (smoked or sweet)  \n- Optional: pinch of chili flakes or cayenne  \nStir for 30–60 seconds until fragrant.\n\n### 2. **Add tomatoes**\n- Add **chopped fresh tomatoes** or **a can of crushed/diced tomatoes** (400g / ~14oz)\n- Simmer for 10–15 minutes, until thickened and saucy  \n- Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar if needed\n\nOptional: Add chopped bell peppers with the tomatoes for more sweetness and texture.\n\n### 3. **Taste and adjust**\n- Check seasoning: balance salt, acidity, spice\n- Add herbs like parsley, cilantro, or thyme if you like\n\n### 4. **Make wells and crack eggs**\n- Use a spoon to make little dips in the sauce  \n- Crack eggs directly into the dips  \n- Cover and simmer gently for 5–8 minutes until the whites are set but yolks are still runny\n\n### 5. **Finish**\n- Sprinkle with fresh herbs, crumbled feta, or a drizzle of olive oil  \n- Serve with warm bread or pita\n\nLet me know if you want a twist on the classic—like harissa shakshooka, green shakshooka, or adding cheese or beans!",

Shakshooka is very forgiving.\n\nHere’s how to adapt it with **zucchini and tomatoes** (no bell pepper needed):\n\n### After your onions & garlic:\n1. **Add spices** (as mentioned before — cumin, paprika, chili flakes if you want)\n2. **Add chopped zucchini**\n   - Sauté for 5–7 minutes until it softens and starts to brown\n3. **Add tomatoes**\n   - Use chopped fresh tomatoes (ripe ones work best) or canned  \n   - Simmer 10–15 minutes until saucy and rich  \n   - Taste and adjust with salt (and sugar if tomatoes are sour)\n\nThen proceed with the eggs:\n- Make wells\n- Crack eggs in\n- Cover and simmer until done\n\nOptional finish:\n- A drizzle of olive oil  \n- Fresh herbs or even some yogurt on the side\n\nZucchini adds a nice creamy texture once cooked down—so this will still be great!

Even rough chopping is fine — it all softens and becomes delicious.\n\nLet me know if you’re using cherry tomatoes or a specific type!",

Plums and apples make a delicious combo for crumble — sweet, tart, juicy, and perfect together.\n\nHere’s a quick guide:\n\n---\n\n### 🍎🍑 **Fruit Filling (for ~4–6 servings)**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- **2–3 apples** (peeled or not, your choice), chopped  \n- **4–6 plums**, pitted and chopped  \n- **2–3 tbsp sugar** (brown or white, depending on how sweet your fruit is)  \n- Optional:  \n  - 1 tsp cinnamon or mixed spice  \n  - A squeeze of lemon juice (especially if apples are sweet)  \n  - 1 tsp cornstarch/flour if fruit is super juicy\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Toss fruit, sugar, and spices together in a baking dish  \n2. Let it sit while you make the topping (draws out juices)\n\n---\n\n### 🧈 **Crumble Topping**\n\n**Basic Ratio:**\n- 100g flour  \n- 75g oats (optional but great for texture)  \n- 100g cold butter  \n- 50–75g sugar (adjust to taste)\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Rub butter into flour until it looks like breadcrumbs  \n2. Mix in oats and sugar  \n3. Scatter crumble evenly over the fruit\n\n---\n\n### 🔥 **Bake**\n- 180–200°C (350–400°F)  \n- 30–40 minutes, until golden on top and bubbling underneath\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’re working without a scale or want to adjust for your ingredients!",
