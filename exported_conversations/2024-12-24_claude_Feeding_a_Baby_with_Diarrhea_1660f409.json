      "content": " If your baby has diarrhea, it's important to be very careful with their diet. While eggs and rice can be appropriate, I want to be clear that for a baby with diarrhea, you should:\n\n1. First consult your pediatrician, especially if:\n- The baby is under 6 months old\n- The diarrhea has lasted more than a few days\n- There are signs of dehydration\n- The baby has a fever\n\nThe BRAT diet (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) is often recommended for diarrhea, but for babies specifically:\n\n- Plain, well-cooked white rice can be good if your baby is already eating solids\n- Bananas (mashed if needed) can help\n- Clear broths\n- Gentle foods they're already familiar with\n- Most importantly: continue breast milk or formula to prevent dehydration\n\nI would actually recommend avoiding eggs during acute diarrhea, even without the yolk, until the symptoms improve.\n\nHow old is your baby? This would help me provide more specific guidance about appropriate foods.",
