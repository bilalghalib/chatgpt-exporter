  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user engaged in an extensive design conversation about building \"Cursive,\" a platform for deep intellectual community inspired by Benjamin Franklin's Junto. They are developing a system centered around weekly questions, mutual witnessing, and structured conversation that resists social media's attention economy. The conversation evolved from initial technical questions about group journals and cohorts into a comprehensive exploration of cultural transmission, scaling mechanisms, and global applicability.\n\nThe user demonstrated deep thinking about community design, asking probing questions about Franklin's original 24 standing queries, meeting frequency, enforcement mechanisms, and membership dynamics. They proposed innovative adaptations like using \"liberating structures\" (1-2-4-all processes) for question generation and creating a \"genetic material\" system where experienced members carry culture to new circles. Key design elements discussed included weekly question cycles, monthly essay requirements, circle size limits of 12 people, and a forking mechanism when groups reach capacity.\n\nA significant portion focused on scaling challenges: how to maintain intimate culture while growing globally, creating meaningful honor systems without status games, attracting committed participants through waitlists rather than mass marketing, and motivating hosts through intrinsic rather than extrinsic rewards. The user explored a \"seasonal commitment\" model allowing honorable graduation after 6-month periods while preserving lifelong alumni connections. They showed particular interest in updating Franklin's 24 questions to address modern challenges like social media addiction, AI displacement, attention economy pressures, and platform capitalism.\n\nThe conversation concluded with the user asking a crucial question about similar practices from the Global South and Global Majority, recognizing the need to learn from non-Western traditions of collective learning and mutual improvement rather than centering only European models. This demonstrated their commitment to inclusive, globally-informed design that acknowledges diverse intellectual traditions and community practices.",

Perfect! I've completed Week 1 of the build plan. Here's what's been built:\n\n  ✅ Week 1 Complete: Book Creation + Cohort Setup\n\n  Database Schema\n\n  - ✅ Added schedule JSONB column to cohorts table\n  - ✅ Supports flexible schedules: daily, weekly, custom dates, on-demand\n  - ✅ Updated groupJournalService to save schedule data\n\n  API Endpoints\n\n  - ✅ POST /api/books - Create book\n  - ✅ GET /api/books - List my books\n  - ✅ GET /api/books/:id - Get book details\n  - ✅ PUT /api/books/:id - Update book\n  - ✅ DELETE /api/books/:id - Delete book\n  - ✅ POST /api/cohorts - Create cohort with schedule\n  - ✅ GET /api/cohorts - List my cohorts\n  - ✅ POST /api/cohorts/join - Join via code\n\n  UI Pages\n\n  - ✅ /books - List books, empty state, create button\n  - ✅ /books/new - Create book form with dynamic TOC entries\n  - ✅ /books/[id]/cohorts/new - Cohort setup with:\n    - Start date picker\n    - Schedule type selector (daily/weekly/custom/on-demand)\n    - Config options for each schedule type\n    - Timezone selector\n    - Max members (optional)\n  - ✅ /join/[code] - Preview cohort + join button\n  - ✅ /cohorts/[id] - Cohort details with invite link and join code\n\n  Key Features\n\n  - Flexible Schedules: Hosts can choose daily (30 days), weekly (every Friday for 12 weeks), custom dates, or on-demand\n  - Schedule Presets: Helper functions in types for common patterns\n  - Join Codes: Auto-generated unique 12-character codes\n  - Invite Links: Shareable /join/[code] URLs\n  - Validation: Ownership checks, max members enforcement\n\n  Next Steps (Week 2 Priority)\n\n  According to BUILD_PLAN.md, Week 2 focuses on:\n  1. Today's Frame View - /cohorts/[id]/today page showing prompt + editor\n  2. Time Tracking Integration - useKeystrokeTracking hook with active time counter\n  3. Frame Generation Job - Cron job to create daily frames based on schedule\n\n  The foundation is solid. Ready to move to Week 2 when you are!\n\n> let's do week 2! also can we think about the onboarding process so people understand and always have a help and about page explaining things and home\n page refresher / update and being able to navigate from there from the notebook also having a \"landing page\" logged in. I thought what we can do is \nhave always the\" first book / app / thing - to be the thing that me, as Bilal Ghalib, will host. I will ask a question a day - muscular questions, and \nhave it be a part of a journal. Or a qustion a week? What's the most beatuiful way to do it. Then we have a gallery where me and other facilitators and\n hosts with hospitality being a deep art of it can pick and highlight interesting answers and notebooks in response (notebook, page? how do people \nrespond so they can go deep?) and make agallery fo all answers and facilitator or host favorites - opinionated platform - people can unsubscribe to \nthis question thing - but I'd like it to be there sort of like a demo and the first experience and who knows. maybe this will be our twitter. is it \npossible to host it outside on its own? yet still ocnnected to the main project? so we can have a landing page and conversion into the thing with that \npage? \n\n⏺ This is a beautiful vision! Let me break down what you're describing and then we'll build it:\n\n  The Vision: Cursive as Daily Practice + Platform\n\n  Core Concept\n\n  \"Questions from Bilal\" - A default cohort everyone joins on signup:\n  - You (Bilal) ask muscular questions daily/weekly\n  - Everyone gets the same prompt in their journal\n  - People respond with depth (full notebook pages, not just text boxes)\n  - You + curated facilitators highlight beautiful responses in a Gallery/Commons\n  - This becomes the \"heartbeat\" of Cursive - like Twitter's timeline but for deep reflection\n\n  Architecture Options\n\n  Option 1: Integrated (Recommended)\n  cursive.app\n  ├── / (landing page - showcases Questions from Bilal)\n  ├── /questions (gallery of all responses - public)\n  ├── /questions/today (today's question + featured responses)\n  ├── /my/notebook (your personal journal space)\n  ├── /books (create your own guided journals)\n  └── /cohorts (join other people's cohorts)\n\n  On signup → auto-join \"Questions from Bilal\" cohort\n\n  Option 2: Separate Domain\n  questions.cursive.app (public landing/gallery)\n  └── auth.cursive.app (shared auth)\n      └── app.cursive.app (main notebook app)\n\n  Benefits: Clean separation, SEO, can market independently\n  Downside: More complex deployment\n\n  I strongly recommend Option 1 because:\n  - Simpler to build and maintain\n  - \"Questions from Bilal\" becomes the onboarding flow\n  - Gallery is the public face that converts visitors\n  - Seamless experience: see question → sign up → immediately start reflecting\n\n  How Responses Work (Key UX Decision)\n\n  Question: How do people respond so they can go deep?\n\n  Three options:\n\n  1. Full Page Response (Recommended)\n    - Each day's question gets its own dedicated page\n    - Full canvas: text, drawing, images\n    - Like a notebook entry\n    - Can be as long as needed (scrolls)\n    - This is what we're building with frames/artifacts\n  2. Block-based Response\n    - Question at top\n    - Multiple blocks below (text, drawing, etc.)\n    - Can expand infinitely\n    - More structured\n  3. Linked Notebook\n    - Question creates a prompt\n    - User opens a full notebook to respond\n    - Most freedom but maybe too complex\n\n  I recommend #1 (Full Page Response) - it matches the artifact model we already built.\n\n  The Most Beautiful Way\n\n  Here's what I envision:\n\n  Landing Page (/)\n  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n  │   CURSIVE                     Login │\n  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n  │                                     │\n  │     Today's Question:               │\n  │     \"What are you building          │\n  │      toward?\"                       │\n  │                                     │\n  │     [Start Reflecting →]            │\n  │                                     │\n  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n  │   Gallery of Responses              │\n  │   ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐      │\n  │   │ Card │ │ Card │ │ Card │      │\n  │   └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘      │\n  │   [See All Responses]               │\n  └─────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n  After Login - Home (/home or /my)\n  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n  │ CURSIVE              [Profile] [?]  │\n  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n  │ Today's Question                    │\n  │ \"What are you building toward?\"     │\n  │ [Reflect on This] [8 min left]      │\n  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n  │ My Journals                         │\n  │ • Questions from Bilal (30 days)    │\n  │ • 30 Days of Quran                  │\n  │ + Create New Journal                │\n  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n  │ [Gallery] [My Cohorts] [About]      │\n  └─────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n  Gallery/Commons (/gallery or /commons)\n  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n  │ Gallery - Day 15: \"What are you...\" │\n  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n  │ Filter: [All] [Featured] [Recent]   │\n  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n  │ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │\n  │ │ ⭐ Featured by Bilal             │ │\n  │ │ [Excerpt of response...]         │ │\n  │ │ 12 min · 45 strokes              │ │\n  │ │ [Read Full Response]             │ │\n  │ └─────────────────────────────────┘ │\n  │ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │\n  │ │ [Another response...]            │ │\n  └─────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n  Implementation Plan\n\n  Let me create:\n\n  1. Auto-join system - Everyone who signs up auto-joins \"Questions from Bilal\" cohort\n  2. Landing page - Public gallery + today's question\n  3. Home page - Logged-in dashboard\n  4. Help/About pages - Explain the platform\n  5. Gallery/Commons - Featured responses\n  6. Navigation - Clear paths between all areas\n\n  Should I:\n  - A) Start with Week 2 (frame view + time tracking) first, then layer in the landing/gallery?\n  - B) Build landing/home/gallery first to establish the \"Questions from Bilal\" experience, then do Week 2?\n\n  I recommend A because you need the frame view working before the gallery makes sense. But we can do B if you want the full experience mapped out\n  first.\n\n  What feels right? And daily or weekly questions from you?\n\n● How is Claude doing this session?

They've shared a document about building a group journals system, and they've just described a vision for \"Questions from Bilal\" - a default cohort everyone joins.\n\nThey want me to search the project knowledge to understand what values and purposes they've established, and then make recommendations based on that context.\n\nI should use the project_knowledge_search tool to find information about their values, purposes, and ideas.I'll search through your project knowledge to understand the values and purposes you've established, then we can figure out the right direction.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nThis is rich - let me pull out the key values and purposes from the project knowledge:\n\nCore Values:\n1. \"Build truth. Make it last\" - fighting against the internet being a lonely place where nothing is real\n2. Thinking happens in public (when you want)\n3. Humans verify humans (not algorithms)\n4. Work accumulates into wisdom (not feeds)\n5. Craft is visible and valued (not just viral)\n6. Make human thinking visible and valuable\n7. Reduce fragmentation & isolation with hospitable, curated spaces\n8. Resist AI sludge by proving provenance & effort\n9. Cultivate craft & pride\n10. Build competency, not dependency\n11. Values human knowledge over AI output\n12. Creates genuine connections, not followers\n\nThe core loop:\n- Shared prompt (we start together)\n- Individual work (but visible)\n- Mutual witnessing (verify each other)\n- Collective artifact (builds commons)\n- Permanent record (creates history)\n\nDesign principles from the \"Parliament\":\n- Mark, Space, Connection, Flow as primitives\n- Person and Intention as universal lenses\n- Values determine which flows/rules appear\n- \"Becoming\" philosophy - help people develop competencies then not need the tool\n\nKey tensions/competing commitments identified:\n- Simplicity vs power\n- Individual vs social\n- Open vs commercial\n- Fluid vs structured\n\nGiven all this context, let me think about where to go with the \"Questions from Bilal\" concept...\n\nThe user wants a daily/weekly question system where:\n1. Bilal asks muscular questions\n2. Everyone joins by default on signup\n3. People respond with depth (full notebook pages)\n4. A gallery showcases responses\n5. Facilitators can highlight beautiful responses\n6. This becomes the heartbeat/demo/onboarding\n\nLooking at the values:\n- \"Shared prompt (we start together)\" - YES, this is the daily question\n- \"Individual work (but visible)\" - YES, notebook responses\n\n\n- \"Mutual witnessing (verify each other)\" - YES, the gallery + highlighting\n- \"Collective artifact (builds commons)\" - YES, the gallery of responses\n- \"Permanent record (creates history)\" - YES, archived responses\n\nI see the hospitality concept as crucial - creating an interactive space that's deeply thoughtful. The design must avoid passive observation, focusing instead on meaningful engagement. Interactive experiences with clear frames and logical pathways can create genuine human connection. Values-driven design means prioritizing care, depth, and mutual understanding over superficial interactions.\n\nThe key is crafting an environment where struggle isn't spectacle, but a shared journey of discovery and growth. Each question becomes an invitation to explore, not just answer - a space where human thinking can unfold with dignity and purpose.\n\nThe platform's core philosophy emerges through its economic model: not extracting attention, but creating genuine nodes of connection. Publishing becomes a gift - an act of generosity where someone shares because they feel truly understood.\n\nFor the onboarding approach, the strategy centers on:\n1. Automatic community participation\n2. Demonstrating the collaborative core loop\n3. Visualizing mutual witnessing through a dynamic gallery\n4. Highlighting as an act of emotional recognition\n5. Treating response curation as a nuanced craft\n6. Creating an immediate, tangible demonstration of platform values\n\nGiven these principles, building the landing/gallery/home experience first becomes the clear priority. This approach immediately surfaces the platform's core values, fights isolation, and establishes a commons that transcends typical productivity tools.\n\nI want to understand the user's perspective and explore what feels most aligned with our fundamental goal of building enduring truth.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nLooking at the values and what they've built so far, here's what I'm seeing:\n\nCORE VALUES FROM RESEARCH:\n1. \"Build truth. Make it last\" - fight isolation and fakeness\n2. Thinking happens in public (when you want)\n3. Humans verify humans (not algorithms)\n4. Work accumulates into wisdom (not feeds)\n5. Craft is visible and valued\n6. Make human thinking visible and valuable\n7. Hospitable, curated spaces\n8. Resist AI sludge by proving provenance & effort\n9. Build competency, not dependency\n\nTHE CORE LOOP:\n- Shared prompt (we start together)\n- Individual work (but visible)\n- Mutual witnessing (verify each other)\n- Collective artifact (builds commons)\n- Permanent record (creates history)\n\nWHAT'S ALREADY BUILT:\n- Group journals system with books, cohorts, frames\n- Schedule flexibility (daily, weekly, custom, on-demand)\n- Join codes and invite system\n- Database schema for books, cohorts, members, frames\n- Service layer for managing all of this\n\nTHE NEW VISION (\"Questions from Bilal\"):\n- Auto-join everyone to a default cohort on signup\n- Daily/weekly muscular questions from Bilal\n- Gallery of responses\n- Facilitators highlight beautiful work\n- Hospitality as deep art\n- This becomes the heartbeat and onboarding\n\nWHERE THEY SHOULD GO:\n\nGiven the values around \"shared prompt → individual work → mutual witnessing → collective artifact → permanent record\" and \"fight isolation,\" I think they should:\n\n1. BUILD THE ONBOARDING/LANDING FIRST (Option B) because:\n   - It establishes the social contract immediately\n   - It demonstrates the core loop visibly\n   - It fights isolation from Day 1\n   - The \"Questions from Bilal\" becomes the demo\n   - The gallery shows \"this is what we value here\"\n   - It makes the VALUES concrete, not abstract\n   \nI'm probing critical design questions about the core concept. The fundamental challenge is creating a meaningful interaction framework that balances depth, visibility, and participant agency. Key considerations include question frequency, response visibility, and curation mechanisms. The core insight emerges: Bilal's question approach isn't just a feature—it's the entire product's philosophical foundation, with other systems merely enabling similar generative interactions.Looking at your values and what you've already articulated, I see where you need to go. Let me be direct about what's actually here.\n\n## What Your Research Reveals About Direction\n\nYour core loop is clear:\n1. **Shared prompt** (we start together)\n2. **Individual work** (but visible)\n3. **Mutual witnessing** (verify each other)\n4. **Collective artifact** (builds commons)\n5. **Permanent record** (creates history)\n\nThis loop \"fights every poison: Not alone / Not fake / Not shallow / Not ephemeral / Not performative\"\n\n## The Tension You're Resolving\n\nYou've been circling between:\n- **Personal thinking tool** (frames, notebooks, private work)\n- **Social platform** (witnessing, commons, gallery)\n\n\"Questions from Bilal\" **resolves this** by making the social aspect:\n- Demonstrated (everyone sees it works)\n- Optional (you can unsubscribe)\n- Hospitable (curated, not algorithmic)\n\n## Where to Go: Build the Social Contract First\n\n**Recommendation: Option B - Landing/Gallery/Home before Week 2**\n\nWhy? Because your values require it:\n\n1. **\"Reduce fragmentation & isolation\"** - The gallery shows you're not alone from Day 1\n2. **\"Hospitable, curated spaces\"** - Curation is your differentiator, make it visible\n3. **\"Build truth. Make it last\"** - The permanent archive of responses proves this isn't Twitter\n4. **\"Humans verify humans\"** - Highlighting responses IS the verification\n\nThe frame view (Week 2) will work better once people understand *why* they're writing in frames - because it becomes part of a commons.\n\n## Questions That Need Answers:\n\n1. **Daily or weekly questions from you?** \n   - Daily = more presence, less depth per response\n   - Weekly = muscular questions get muscular answers\n   - What feels true to \"cultivate craft & pride\"?\n\n2. **What IS a \"muscular question\"?**\n   - Not \"what did you eat today\"\n   - More like \"what are you building toward?\" or \"what truth are you avoiding?\"\n   - Questions that require reflection, not reporting\n\n3. **Gallery mechanics:**\n   - Do ALL responses appear in gallery initially?\n   - Or only featured ones?\n   - How does featuring work - is it just you, or other facilitators too?\n   - Is it a feed or a deliberate collection?\n\n4. **Public by default or opt-in?**\n   - Your values say \"thinking happens in public (when you want)\"\n   - So: write the response → choose to share to gallery?\n   - Or: auto-shared but you can keep private?\n\n5. **Hospitality as craft means what technically?**\n   - You're not just clicking \"feature\" \n   - You're writing a note about WHY you featured it?\n   - Like a gallery curator's wall text?\n\n## The Metaphor That Actually Fits\n\nThis isn't \"Twitter for thinking\" - it's **a salon**. \n\nBilal poses a question → people retire to their studies to think → they return to share → you (the host) highlight beautiful thinking → everyone learns from each other.\n\nThe product is **hosting-as-a-service**. You're showing people how to host well, then letting them host their own salons.\n\n## What This Changes About the Build\n\nInstead of building abstract \"books and cohorts,\" you're building:\n\n1. **The Question** (today's prompt for everyone)\n2. **Your Study** (where you respond - the frame view)\n3. **The Gallery** (curated responses)\n4. **The Salon** (your profile of all your responses over time)\n5. **Host Console** (for you/facilitators to pose questions & curate)\n\nThen later: \"Create your own salon\" = custom books/cohorts\n\n**The build order should be:** Landing → Gallery → Response UI → Host console → Then let others host\n\nDoes this feel true? What am I missing about the hospitality piece?",

It trains the muscle that turns exploration into generosity.\n\nHow Joe Edelman would rework Cursive (values-first redesign)\n\nJoeâ€™s lens: design for qualities of experience (values) and social moves that cultivate themâ€”not for engagement or throughput. Hereâ€™s how that translates.\n\n1) Start with explicit values & success states\n\nBook Values Charter: Each book declares 3â€“5 qualities weâ€™re trying to grow here (e.g., â€œhonesty about confusion,â€ â€œsolidarity in challenge,â€ â€œalivenessâ€).\n\nFelt Success Prompts: Every session ends with a 10-second check: â€œDid you feel more [value] today? Why?â€ These replace gamified metrics.\n\n2) Design social moves, not features\n\nCodify a small set of moves with UI affordances:\n\nAsk (for help/eyes on), Witness (pay attention, leave one note),\n\nReflect (mirror back what shifted), Offer (a crafted resource or intro),\n\nChallenge (invite a counter-example), Bless (name what to keep).\nEach move has a clear ritual & tiny template. Notifications become invitations to a move aligned to the bookâ€™s values (not generic â€œsomeone commentedâ€).\n\n3) Small publics over big audiences\n\nCircles of Practice (4â€“8 people): cadence, covenant, and boundaries.\n\nGuild windows: time-boxed, topical micro-publics (2 weeks on â€œrecursion visualsâ€).\n\nDiscovery is values-matching (â€œJoin if you want more X in your lifeâ€), not popularity.\n\n4) Value-routing instead of engagement ranking\n\nThe system routes attention by fit to declared values and current needs (e.g., â€œseeking gentle challengeâ€), not by recency or reacts.\n\nReputation = reliability signals (â€œkeeps commitments,â€ â€œgives usable feedbackâ€), not follower counts.\n\n5) AI as values-aligned facilitator\n\nEach book defines AI stance as values constraints:\nâ€œNever answer; ask one grounded question; invite a move (Witness/Offer) when appropriate; prefer human routing when someone nearby can help.â€\n\nâ€œParliamentsâ€ become role-based guides tied to values (Guardian of Nuance, Steward of Sources), not flashy debate.",

Everything else is UI decoration.\n\nBret Victor (Interaction & Manipulability)\n\nâ€œMarks, Spaces, Rules ignores the medium. The essence isnâ€™t the mark, itâ€™s seeing and manipulating connections. You need Connections as a primitive. Otherwise, knowledge graphs, dynamic diagrams, causality â€” all become bolted-on hacks.â€\n\nVictor says: Add Connections as a visible, manipulable primitive.\n\nJoe Edelman (Values & Meaning)\n\nâ€œMarks without values are dead. Spaces without commitments are noise. Rules without purpose are bureaucracy. The primitive is the Choice â€” the moment a human expresses or aligns with a value. Your system must represent value-bearing choices, or itâ€™s just another productivity toy.â€\n\nEdelman says: Add Choices/Values as metadata woven into Marks and Rules.\n\nSeth Godin (The Gift & Audience)\n\nâ€œYouâ€™re all missing the audience. Every mark is for someone. Every space exists because itâ€™s shared. Every rule only matters if others witness it. The primitive is the Gift â€” knowledge created and shared for someone else. Without the gift, thereâ€™s no reason to create.â€\n\nGodin says: Add Gift/Recipient as a primitive, or you wonâ€™t get the social layer right.\n\nâœ¦ The Negotiated Resolution\nconst CursivePrimitives = {\n  Mark: \"Human expression (text, stroke, voice, etc)\",\n  Space: \"Where marks live (linear, canvas, graph)\",\n  Rule: \"Conditions for progression or transformation\",\n  Connection: \"Visible links between marks/concepts (Victor)\",\n  Value: \"Choice or orientation expressed (Edelman)\",\n  Gift: \"Recipient or audience implied (Godin)\"\n}\n\n\nðŸ‘‰ Jobs wanted 3, but the others forced expansion.\nðŸ‘‰ The compromise: Marks, Spaces, Rules stay core, but Connections, Values, Gifts are treated as first-class metadata.",

People donâ€™t write in claims, they write in messy notes.\n\nSo:\n\nClaims are useful, but maybe they emerge later (AI suggests: â€œthis note could be distilled into a claim nodeâ€).\n\nOtherwise, we lose the rawness of handwriting/sketching.\n\n4. Narrowing the definition\n\nHereâ€™s a progressive refinement path:\n\nLevel 1 â€” Pragmatic\n\nNode = any artifact (text block, sketch, audio snippet).\n\nEasy for devs: everything is a node.\n\nEasy for users: â€œthat thing I made is a node.â€\n\nLevel 2 â€” Semantic\n\nNode = artifact + concept links.\n\nExample: a drawing of sine wave links to [[periodicity]].\n\nNow itâ€™s not just content, itâ€™s semantically anchored.\n\nLevel 3 â€” Reasoning\n\nNode = claim (distilled meaning).\n\nAI or humans distill nodes into claims, hypotheses, insights.\n\nGraph now models arguments, not just links.\n\nSo:\nðŸ‘‰ Start with Level 1 (artifact).\nðŸ‘‰ Grow into Level 2 (concept-linked).\nðŸ‘‰ Offer Level 3 (claims) for advanced users / communities.\n\nThis keeps parsimony while still honoring the reasoning vision.\n\n5.

            "thinking": "This is rich - let me pull out the key values and purposes from the project knowledge:\n\nCore Values:\n1. \"Build truth. Make it last\" - fighting against the internet being a lonely place where nothing is real\n2. Thinking happens in public (when you want)\n3. Humans verify humans (not algorithms)\n4. Work accumulates into wisdom (not feeds)\n5. Craft is visible and valued (not just viral)\n6. Make human thinking visible and valuable\n7. Reduce fragmentation & isolation with hospitable, curated spaces\n8. Resist AI sludge by proving provenance & effort\n9. Cultivate craft & pride\n10. Build competency, not dependency\n11. Values human knowledge over AI output\n12. Creates genuine connections, not followers\n\nThe core loop:\n- Shared prompt (we start together)\n- Individual work (but visible)\n- Mutual witnessing (verify each other)\n- Collective artifact (builds commons)\n- Permanent record (creates history)\n\nDesign principles from the \"Parliament\":\n- Mark, Space, Connection, Flow as primitives\n- Person and Intention as universal lenses\n- Values determine which flows/rules appear\n- \"Becoming\" philosophy - help people develop competencies then not need the tool\n\nKey tensions/competing commitments identified:\n- Simplicity vs power\n- Individual vs social\n- Open vs commercial\n- Fluid vs structured\n\nGiven all this context, let me think about where to go with the \"Questions from Bilal\" concept...\n\nThe user wants a daily/weekly question system where:\n1. Bilal asks muscular questions\n2. Everyone joins by default on signup\n3. People respond with depth (full notebook pages)\n4. A gallery showcases responses\n5. Facilitators can highlight beautiful responses\n6. This becomes the heartbeat/demo/onboarding\n\nLooking at the values:\n- \"Shared prompt (we start together)\" - YES, this is the daily question\n- \"Individual work (but visible)\" - YES, notebook responses\n\n\n- \"Mutual witnessing (verify each other)\" - YES, the gallery + highlighting\n- \"Collective artifact (builds commons)\" - YES, the gallery of responses\n- \"Permanent record (creates history)\" - YES, archived responses\n\nI see the hospitality concept as crucial - creating an interactive space that's deeply thoughtful. The design must avoid passive observation, focusing instead on meaningful engagement. Interactive experiences with clear frames and logical pathways can create genuine human connection. Values-driven design means prioritizing care, depth, and mutual understanding over superficial interactions.\n\nThe key is crafting an environment where struggle isn't spectacle, but a shared journey of discovery and growth. Each question becomes an invitation to explore, not just answer - a space where human thinking can unfold with dignity and purpose.\n\nThe platform's core philosophy emerges through its economic model: not extracting attention, but creating genuine nodes of connection. Publishing becomes a gift - an act of generosity where someone shares because they feel truly understood.\n\nFor the onboarding approach, the strategy centers on:\n1. Automatic community participation\n2. Demonstrating the collaborative core loop\n3. Visualizing mutual witnessing through a dynamic gallery\n4. Highlighting as an act of emotional recognition\n5. Treating response curation as a nuanced craft\n6. Creating an immediate, tangible demonstration of platform values\n\nGiven these principles, building the landing/gallery/home experience first becomes the clear priority. This approach immediately surfaces the platform's core values, fights isolation, and establishes a commons that transcends typical productivity tools.\n\nI want to understand the user's perspective and explore what feels most aligned with our fundamental goal of building enduring truth.",

Make it last\" - fight isolation and fakeness\n2. Thinking happens in public (when you want)\n3. Humans verify humans (not algorithms)\n4. Work accumulates into wisdom (not feeds)\n5. Craft is visible and valued\n6. Make human thinking visible and valuable\n7. Hospitable, curated spaces\n8. Resist AI sludge by proving provenance & effort\n9. Build competency, not dependency\n\nTHE CORE LOOP:\n- Shared prompt (we start together)\n- Individual work (but visible)\n- Mutual witnessing (verify each other)\n- Collective artifact (builds commons)\n- Permanent record (creates history)\n\nWHAT'S ALREADY BUILT:\n- Group journals system with books, cohorts, frames\n- Schedule flexibility (daily, weekly, custom, on-demand)\n- Join codes and invite system\n- Database schema for books, cohorts, members, frames\n- Service layer for managing all of this\n\nTHE NEW VISION (\"Questions from Bilal\"):\n- Auto-join everyone to a default cohort on signup\n- Daily/weekly muscular questions from Bilal\n- Gallery of responses\n- Facilitators highlight beautiful work\n- Hospitality as deep art\n- This becomes the heartbeat and onboarding\n\nWHERE THEY SHOULD GO:\n\nGiven the values around \"shared prompt → individual work → mutual witnessing → collective artifact → permanent record\" and \"fight isolation,\" I think they should:\n\n1. BUILD THE ONBOARDING/LANDING FIRST (Option B) because:\n   - It establishes the social contract immediately\n   - It demonstrates the core loop visibly\n   - It fights isolation from Day 1\n   - The \"Questions from Bilal\" becomes the demo\n   - The gallery shows \"this is what we value here\"\n   - It makes the VALUES concrete, not abstract\n   \nI'm probing critical design questions about the core concept. The fundamental challenge is creating a meaningful interaction framework that balances depth, visibility, and participant agency. Key considerations include question frequency, response visibility, and curation mechanisms. The core insight emerges: Bilal's question approach isn't just a feature—it's the entire product's philosophical foundation, with other systems merely enabling similar generative interactions.",

            "text": "Looking at your values and what you've already articulated, I see where you need to go. Let me be direct about what's actually here.\n\n## What Your Research Reveals About Direction\n\nYour core loop is clear:\n1. **Shared prompt** (we start together)\n2. **Individual work** (but visible)\n3. **Mutual witnessing** (verify each other)\n4. **Collective artifact** (builds commons)\n5. **Permanent record** (creates history)\n\nThis loop \"fights every poison: Not alone / Not fake / Not shallow / Not ephemeral / Not performative\"\n\n## The Tension You're Resolving\n\nYou've been circling between:\n- **Personal thinking tool** (frames, notebooks, private work)\n- **Social platform** (witnessing, commons, gallery)\n\n\"Questions from Bilal\" **resolves this** by making the social aspect:\n- Demonstrated (everyone sees it works)\n- Optional (you can unsubscribe)\n- Hospitable (curated, not algorithmic)\n\n## Where to Go: Build the Social Contract First\n\n**Recommendation: Option B - Landing/Gallery/Home before Week 2**\n\nWhy? Because your values require it:\n\n1. **\"Reduce fragmentation & isolation\"** - The gallery shows you're not alone from Day 1\n2. **\"Hospitable, curated spaces\"** - Curation is your differentiator, make it visible\n3. **\"Build truth. Make it last\"** - The permanent archive of responses proves this isn't Twitter\n4. **\"Humans verify humans\"** - Highlighting responses IS the verification\n\nThe frame view (Week 2) will work better once people understand *why* they're writing in frames - because it becomes part of a commons.\n\n## Questions That Need Answers:\n\n1. **Daily or weekly questions from you?** \n   - Daily = more presence, less depth per response\n   - Weekly = muscular questions get muscular answers\n   - What feels true to \"cultivate craft & pride\"?\n\n2. **What IS a \"muscular question\"?**\n   - Not \"what did you eat today\"\n   - More like \"what are you building toward?\" or \"what truth are you avoiding?\"\n   - Questions that require reflection, not reporting\n\n3. **Gallery mechanics:**\n   - Do ALL responses appear in gallery initially?\n   - Or only featured ones?\n   - How does featuring work - is it just you, or other facilitators too?\n   - Is it a feed or a deliberate collection?\n\n4. **Public by default or opt-in?**\n   - Your values say \"thinking happens in public (when you want)\"\n   - So: write the response → choose to share to gallery?\n   - Or: auto-shared but you can keep private?\n\n5. **Hospitality as craft means what technically?**\n   - You're not just clicking \"feature\" \n   - You're writing a note about WHY you featured it?\n   - Like a gallery curator's wall text?\n\n## The Metaphor That Actually Fits\n\nThis isn't \"Twitter for thinking\" - it's **a salon**. \n\nBilal poses a question → people retire to their studies to think → they return to share → you (the host) highlight beautiful thinking → everyone learns from each other.\n\nThe product is **hosting-as-a-service**. You're showing people how to host well, then letting them host their own salons.\n\n## What This Changes About the Build\n\nInstead of building abstract \"books and cohorts,\" you're building:\n\n1. **The Question** (today's prompt for everyone)\n2. **Your Study** (where you respond - the frame view)\n3. **The Gallery** (curated responses)\n4. **The Salon** (your profile of all your responses over time)\n5. **Host Console** (for you/facilitators to pose questions & curate)\n\nThen later: \"Create your own salon\" = custom books/cohorts\n\n**The build order should be:** Landing → Gallery → Response UI → Host console → Then let others host\n\nDoes this feel true?

Interintellect hosts live evening-length conversations (salons)\n9. Historical salons had hosts (salonnières) who curated guest lists and guided conversations\n\nThe key tension for online adaptation:\n- Weekly is too frequent for modern attention spans\n- Monthly is working for modern equivalents\n- But need a graduated path: start light, build to deeperExcellent instinct. Let me synthesize what I found into a design framework for Cursive.\n\n## **The Historical Models: What Actually Worked**\n\n### **Benjamin Franklin's Junto (1727-1765)**\n\n**Frequency & Structure:**\n- Met WEEKLY on Friday evenings for 38 years\n- 12 members from diverse trades: printers, surveyors, cabinetmakers, clerks\n- Every member in turn had to produce 1+ questions on morals, politics, or natural philosophy\n- Once in three months, each member had to read an essay they wrote\n\n**The 24 Standing Questions (read at EVERY meeting):**\n\nThe questions fell into distinct categories that reveal their purpose:\n\n**Learning & Sharing Knowledge:**\n- Have you met with anything remarkable in the author you last read, suitable to be communicated?\n- What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?\n\n**Community Service:**\n- Do you think of anything at present, in which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind? to their country, to their friends, or to themselves?\n- Hath any deserving stranger arrived in town since last meeting? What have you heard or observed of his character?\n- Do you know of any deserving young beginner lately set up, whom it lies in the power of the Junto any way to encourage?\n\n**Mutual Aid:**\n- Hath any body attacked your reputation lately? and what can the Junto do towards securing it?\n- Hath any man injured you, from whom it is in the power of the Junto to procure redress?\n- Have you any weighty affair in hand, in which you think the advice of the Junto may be of service?\n\n**Critical Thinking:**\n- What unhappy effects of intemperance have you lately observed or heard? of imprudence? of passion? or of any other vice or folly?\n- Is there any difficulty in matters of opinion, of justice, and injustice, which you would gladly have discussed at this time?\n\n**Meta-Reflection:**\n- Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?\n\n**The Four Core Commitments (for membership):**\n\nAll members had to affirm:\n1. Do you sincerely declare that you love mankind in general, of what profession or religion soever?\n2. Do you think any person ought to be harmed in his body, name or goods, for mere speculative opinions?\n3. Do you love truth for truth's sake, and will you endeavour impartially to find and receive it yourself and communicate it to others?\n4. Have you any particular disrespect to any present members?\n\n**Critical Rules:**\n- Debates conducted \"in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory\"\n- Franklin forbid himself \"the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly\" and adopted instead \"I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine\"\n\n### **French Salons (1600s-1700s)**\n\nSalons typically began with a reading from a new novel, essay, or philosophical text, followed by discussion led by the salonnière (hostess)\n\n**Key difference from Junto:**\n- Salonnières curated guest lists and guided conversations, playing crucial roles as regulators who selected guests and decided meeting subjects\n- More flexible structure, less formal rules\n- Focus on witty conversation, culture, ideas\n\n### **Modern Equivalents That Work**\n\n**Ben Franklin Circles (launched 2014):**\n- Meet MONTHLY rather than weekly, acknowledging busy 21st century lives\n- Discussions focus on people's lives—their aspirations and concerns—and how to bolster them through personal improvement and mutual support\n- Essential caveat: debates must be civil and respectful, reflecting Franklin's spirit of \"inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute\"\n\n**Interintellect:**\n- Hosts live, informal, unrecorded, evening-length conversations on interesting topics\n- Conversations are wide-ranging, focused on an interesting topic, with people from many walks of life\n- Emphasizes \"fearless conversations with friendly people\"\n\n## **What Made Them Work: The Pattern**\n\nThe successful models share:\n1. **Regular cadence** (weekly historically, monthly modern)\n2. **Structured prompts** (questions, readings)\n3. **Mutual obligation** (everyone contributes, not just consumes)\n4. **Shared commitments** (respect, truth-seeking, generosity)\n5. **Small scale** (12-20 people max)\n6. **Hospitable curation** (someone guides, but doesn't dominate)\n\n## **Design Recommendations for Cursive**\n\n### **The Graduated Path (Addressing Modern Attention)**\n\n**Level 1: Daily Light Touch (Public Commons)**\n- One question from you, 5-10 minutes to respond\n- Like a morning meditation practice\n- **Questions style:** \"What are you grateful for today?\" \"What surprised you?\" \"What are you avoiding?\"\n\n**Level 2: Weekly Depth (Cohort)**\n- Muscular questions requiring 30-60 minutes\n- **Questions style:** \"What truth are you avoiding?\" \"What are you building toward?\" \"Where is your thinking stuck?\"\n- Members commit to responding + reading 3-5 others' responses\n\n**Level 3: Monthly Essays (Advanced)**\n- Following Franklin's model: once a month, produce a longer piece\n- Gallery/Commons features the best\n- This is where facilitators curate\n\n**Level 4: Live Salons (Intimate)**\n- Synchronous video/voice discussions\n- Like Interintellect, but grounded in the written work\n- \"Let's discuss what emerged in this week's responses\"\n\n### **Your Question Rhythms - Three Options:**\n\n**Option A: Daily + Weekly**\n- Daily: Light prompt (5-10 min response) for everyone\n- Weekly: Muscular question (30-60 min) for committed members\n- Facilitators curate from weekly\n\n**Option B: Weekly Only**\n- One muscular question per week\n- Sunday: Question drops\n- People have until Friday to respond\n- Saturday: Featured responses published\n- More sustainable, higher quality\n\n**Option C: Franklin's Full Model (Intense)**\n- Weekly questions for all\n- Monthly essay requirement for cohort members\n- Only for serious mutual improvement societies\n\n**My recommendation: Start with Option B (weekly), add daily later if energy emerges**\n\n### **Facilitator Practices (The Salonnière Role)**\n\nBased on historical models, you as facilitator should:\n\n1. **Ask the right questions** (like Franklin's 24)\n2. **Curate who joins** (not everyone, but \"ingenious men\" seeking truth)\n3. **Feature responses** (like salon hostesses guided conversation)\n4. **Protect the tone** (inquiry not debate, \"I imagine\" not \"certainly\")\n5. **Model vulnerability** (share your own responses first)\n\n### **The Commitments (Modern Version of Franklin's Four)**\n\nEveryone who joins \"Questions from Bilal\" affirms:\n1. **I'm here to think, not perform** (no virtue signaling)\n2. **I respect others' perspectives** (even when I disagree)\n3. **I value truth over being right** (willing to change my mind)\n4. **I'll contribute, not just consume** (respond before reading others)\n\n### **Technical Implementation**\n\n**Sunday evening:**\n- Question drops in everyone's notebook\n- Notification: \"This week's question is ready\"\n\n**Monday-Friday:**\n- People work on responses in private\n- Can see \"23 people are working on this\" but not content yet\n\n**Saturday morning:**\n- All responses become visible simultaneously\n- You + facilitators review and feature 5-10\n- Featured responses go to public gallery\n- Gallery has: Featured (curated) / Recent (all) / Most Read tabs\n\n**The Beautiful Part:**\n- No comments initially (to prevent performative discourse)\n- Only \"Thanks\" button with optional note\n- After 1 week, discussion opens in anchored threads\n\nThis prevents the Twitter problem of hot takes and lets people think first.\n\n### **What Would Make This YOUR Twitter**\n\nThe magic isn't in the questions alone—it's in:\n1. **Your voice** (Bilal asking \"What are you building toward?\" hits different than generic prompts)\n2. **Cumulative wisdom** (seeing how your thinking evolved over 30 weeks)\n3. **Curated excellence** (featuring responses teaches what good thinking looks like)\n4. **Witnessing** (knowing others are wrestling with the same questions)\n\n## **Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Which rhythm feels sustainable for you?** (Daily light + weekly deep? Just weekly deep? Monthly essays?)\n\n2. **What's your first question?** (Should be something you genuinely want to know people's answers to)\n\n3. **How do you want to curate?** (Feature 5 responses? 10? Write notes on why you featured them? Just highlight?)\n\n4. **Who else can facilitate with you?** (Like salonnières, you'll need co-hosts as it grows)\n\n5. **What's the graduation path?** (After 12 weeks of \"Questions from Bilal,\" can people start their own salon on Cursive?)\n\nThis is much richer than I initially understood—you're not just building a platform, you're reviving a 300-year-old practice of mutual improvement for the internet age.\n\nWhat feels true? What needs adjusting?",

In the fall of 1727 Benjamin Franklin and a group of friends founded the Junto Club also known as the Leather Apron Club. The 12 members were tradesmen and artisans who met Friday evenings to discuss issues of morals, politics or natural philosophy. The club lasted 38 years. Franklin proposed that the group be formed of “ingenious men –a physician, a mathematician, a geographer, a natural philosopher, a botanist, a chemist, and a mechanician (engineer)”. The American Philosophical Society was founded in 1743, “to promote useful knowledge“. Today it is known for its excellence in scholarly research and publications. A branch of the Junto Cub was the American Philosophical Society created in 1743 and which still exists.

Franklin was influenced by two predecessor organizations in particular. One was an English group called the “Dry Club,” which had philosopher John Locke, William Popple, and Benjamin Furly among its members during the 1690s (and was itself partially inspired by Furly's “heretics of the Lantern” society). It met one evening a week for two hours at a time and required that its members reply affirmatively to the following questions: Whether he loves all Men, of what Profession or Religion soever? Whether he thinks no person ought to be harmed in his Body, Name, or Goods, for mere speculative Opinions, or his external way of Worship?\n\nThe Junto's Friday evening meetings were organized around a series of questions that Franklin devised, covering a range of intellectual, personal, business, and community topics. These questions were used as a springboard for discussion and community action. Through the Junto, Franklin promoted such concepts as volunteer fire-fighting clubs, improved security (night watchmen), and a public hospital. The questions are included in Franklin's papers, dated 1728, and some editions of his autobiography. As printed in Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces, the questions are: Have you met with any thing in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto? particularly in history, morality, poetry, physic, travels, mechanic arts, or other parts of knowledge. What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?\n\nAt just 21, he oversaw five men, including Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb, who were soon to form the core of the Junto. Franklin was an outgoing, social individual and had become acquainted with these businessmen. This gathering included prominent merchants who met informally to drink and discuss the business of the day. Franklin's congenial ways attracted many unique and learned individuals, and from these, he selected the members for the Junto. All members lived in Philadelphia and came from diverse areas of interest and business. Along with Meredith, Potts, and Webb, they included Joseph Breintnall, merchant and scrivener, who also loved poetry and natural history. Thomas Godfrey was a glazier, mathematician, and inventor; and Nicholas Scull II and William Parsons were both surveyors. Scull was also a bibliophile and Parsons a cobbler and astrologer.\n\nWilliam Maugridge was a cabinetmaker, William Coleman a merchant's clerk, and Robert Grace a gentleman. Grace's wealth meant he did not have to work, but apparently he brought an intellectual element to the group and a fine library. The twelfth member of the Junto remained a mystery until 2007, when Professor George Boudreau of Pennsylvania State University discovered a long-forgotten account of the club's refreshments and verified that shoemaker John Jones Jr. was an original member. Jones was a Philadelphia Quaker, a neighbor of Franklin's, and later a founding member of the Library Company of Philadelphia. The club met Friday nights, first in a tavern and later in a house, to discuss moral, political, and scientific topics of the day. Franklin describes the formation and purpose of the Junto in his autobiography: I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, [1727] I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we",

The club was initially composed of twelve members who met on Friday evenings, first in a tavern and later in a house, to discuss morals, politics, or natural philosophy to improve themselves and their community. A diverse group included printers, surveyors, a cabinetmaker, a clerk, and a bartender. The club led to innovations such as volunteer fire-fighting organizations, improved security through night watchmen, a public hospital, and the first public library. Our debates were to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory. ... Franklin put together a provocative set of questions to stimulate the conversations during the club’s meetings.

The idea for these questions probably owes something to Mather’s ...\n\nFranklin’s draft was admittedly incomplete and imperfect. In the margin opposite the Standing Queries, for example, he wrote: “Memo these Queries are not plac’d in the order I design ’em.”5 The order and phrasing as printed by Vaughan are both improved. The same is true of the Qualifications, the order in Vaughan ascending logically from love of the Junto to love of truth. Vaughan’s version is printed here as being more nearly the final product of the author’s thought. In his edition Duane added to these Queries a list of questions which he said had been discussed at meetings of the Junto. These questions Duane took from the Eulogium on Benjamin Franklin by Provost William Smith, who found them in a manuscript book of Junto minutes.6 The questions are omitted here, however, because Franklin had nothing to do with them: he was in England when they were discussed in the so-called “young Junto” in 1758–59.\n\n2. Draft reads: “Hath any remarkable Stranger arriv’d in Town since last Meeting that you know of; and what have you heard or observ’d of his Character or Merits? And wherein think you the Junto can oblige him or encourage him as he deserves?” ... 4. In the draft the Qualifications are in the form of indirect questions, as: “Whether he loves all Men of What Profession or Religion soever.” ... 7. Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) translated these queries into German, adding comments, and presented them to the Friday Club of Weimar, July 5, 1791, to serve as the basis for the club’s procedure. J. G. Herder, Briefe zu Beförderung der Humanität (Riga, 1793), pp. 10–34; Bernhard Suphan, ed., Herders Sämmtliche Werke (Berlin, 1877–1913), XVI, 43n; XVII, 10–16; see also Beatrice Marguerite Victory, Benjamin Franklin and Germany (Phila., 1915), p.\n\n“The Rules I drew up,” Franklin continued in his autobiography, “requir’d that every Member in his Turn should produce one or more Queries on any Point of Morals, Politics or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss’d by the Company, and once in three Months pronounce and read an Essay of his own Writing on any Subject he pleased.” Except as partial drafts, these rules do not survive. There does exist, however, a part of the Junto’s ritual—the twenty-four “Standing Queries” which were read and answered at every meeting and the four qualifications which every candidate for admission was required to meet. The idea for these questions probably owes something to Mather’s proposed order of business, with its ten “Points of Consideration,” which were to be read “from time to time” at the meetings, “with a due Pause upon each of them, for any one to offer what he please upon it.” ·\n\nDo you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended? Any person to be qualified, to stand up, and lay his hand on his breast, and be asked these questions; viz.4 · 1. Have you any particular disrespect to any present members? Answer. I have not. 2.

                "text": "Then: Franklin developed a set of questions for the Junto meetings, touching on topics like self-improvement, moral conduct, and social responsibility. These questions sparked meaningful conversations, encouraged critical thinking, and helped members to learn from each other’s experiences. Now: Structured prompts or agendas help modern mastermind groups maintain focus and extract more value from each session. Franklin’s model encourages groups to design questions or themes that align with their goals, making discussions both relevant and enriching. Then: The Junto members shared practical knowledge and professional insights, offering support and advice on each other’s challenges. Franklin’s group emphasized a culture of sharing and openness, aiming to advance each member’s skills. Now: Modern mastermind groups benefit greatly from a collaborative culture.\n\nNow: Accountability remains a cornerstone of effective mastermind groups. Setting actionable goals and following up on progress transforms ideas into tangible outcomes. A structured approach to accountability ensures that members remain committed to their development. One of the most enduring aspects of Franklin’s Junto was his list of 24 guiding questions. These questions encouraged members to think critically, reflect on their values, and engage in honest self-assessment. Here are a few examples that can inspire thoughtful discussion in modern mastermind groups: Have you met with any success since our last meeting? Do you have anything to ask the advice of the group about? Has any member of the group been wronged in any business transaction? What new knowledge or information have you gained recently? Are there any public matters in which our group could offer a benefit?\n\nFor those looking to start or enhance their own mastermind group, Franklin’s Junto offers valuable lessons: Emphasize a shared purpose. Introduce structured questions to guide discussions. Encourage knowledge sharing across different backgrounds. Hold members accountable for taking action. Benjamin Franklin’s Junto reminds us that the right environment for shared learning and support can catalyze personal and societal change. By embracing these timeless principles, modern mastermind groups can become powerful tools for both personal achievement and social impact.\n\nBenjamin Franklin collaborative learning collective wisdom group accountability group dynamics historical mastermind intellectual curiosity Junto knowledge sharing mastermind group questions Mastermind Groups mastermind principles Personal Growth Self-Improvement social responsibility structured questions",

                "text": "As social isolation spreads, a new movement looks to early American history for a solution.\n\nThe eighteenth century in America saw the rise of an ambitious young man who, at the start of his career, invented a congenial way to exchange wisdom and support with fellow citizens as they made their way in a changing society. The young man was Benjamin Franklin, later destined to become the inventor of much else, including new technological devices, creative scientific insights, and the foundations of an improbable democratic republic. At age 21, young Ben devised a way to foster his early ambitions: a “mutual improvement society” that he called the “Junto” (pronounced June-Toe), derived from the Latin for “to join.” · Franklin’s group of twelve Philadelphians met Friday nights at a local tavern they called the “merchant’s Every-night club,” where they discussed business, morality, politics, philosophy, and whatever else interested them.\n\nSince its mid-January launch, almost two dozen Ben Franklin Circles have sprouted up in states like New York, North Carolina, Washington, Utah, and Colorado, with circles in California and elsewhere currently in formation. Acknowledging the realities of busy twenty-first century working lives, today’s Circles meet monthly rather than weekly. Discussions focus on people’s lives—their aspirations and concerns—and how to bolster them through personal improvement and mutual support. Also central are concerns about how members can contribute to their communities and the civic society. The ages, vocations, and ideological persuasions in the Circles are diverse, with the essential caveat that debates be civil and respectful. This reflects the spirit of Ben, who wrote that his Junto was “to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory.” The rules of engagement for Ben Franklin Circles, as detailed on the Circles’ website, guide pa\n\nOne of them, for example, was Giving Tuesday, which was one of the most productive charitable initiatives of recent times. Now 92Y, in collaboration with the Citizen University in Seattle and Stanford’s Hoover Institution, has launched a twenty-first century version of Franklin’s Junto, called Ben Franklin Circles. Its website went live in January around Ben’s birthday and its motto is: “Transform your life, transform your world.” · The driving idea behind its “transform your world” tagline is the idea of new power, which was presented in a groundbreaking 2014 article in the Harvard Business Review by tech entrepreneur Jeremy Heimans and 92Y executive director Henry Timms. “New power” is a grassroots, bottom-up approach to social change. It relies on peer collaborations carried out by ordinary citizens rather than hierarchically organized assignments by command structures.\n\nThe membership was vocationally diverse, with businessmen, a clerk, a mathematician, a shoemaker, a surveyor, and a mechanic. Members of the Junto did a great deal of what we today would call “networking,” promoting each other’s advancement and keeping an eye out for useful connections with others beyond their group. The underlying agenda was to help one another become successful in their careers and good citizens. They discussed the role that virtues—such as prudence, diligence, and humility—play in building a successful life. Later in life, Franklin reflected on the role the Junto played in society: “the club continued (for forty years), and was the best school of philosophy, morality, and politics as then existed in the province.” The Junto also took on civic and charitable causes, such as establishing a public library by asking members to donate some of their own books.",

In 1727, at the age of 21, Franklin cajoled some friends to hold a weekly gathering with the purpose of mutual improvement. The cohort selected a name, the Junto Club, from the Spanish word for “together,” and intended their newfound organization to drive both personal and societal improvement. The group, also known as the Leather Apron Club, convened avid readers, scholarly intellectuals, and curious thinkers. Meeting on Friday evenings, they discussed issues of morals, politics, and natural philosophy. In turn, the ideas that emerged during these sessions sparked many public projects, including the first lending library, the University of Pennsylvania, the volunteer militia, and the Pennsylvania Hospital. When it came to membership, Franklin included people from a variety of backgrounds.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s Junto Club would meet for an astonishing 38 years. Inspired by this organization, groups dedicated to mutual improvement have since taken various forms. From author Napoleon Hill’s “master mind alliance” to the somewhat unconventionally named “ Vagabonds” group, which included members like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, peer advisory groups have continually brought together thought leaders to help make critical decisions, face challenges, and explore opportunities. So next time you head out to a “meeting of the minds” — whatever form your chosen organization happens to take — rest assured, you are standing on the shoulders of giants.

Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and, to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.

Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good order, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets, with strong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), which were to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together, in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subject of fires, as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions.",

But this can be avoided if people are asked to concentrate on active listening instead of thinking about what they will say next. A small group should be able to support real dialogue. Utne Reader and New Society Publishers have since published Salons: The Joy of Conversation, a guide to setting up and running a salon.

Community-wide study circles Sometimes local government or a community foundation will organize a large number of study circles to deal with a difficult community problem or public policy issue. A community-wide study circles project requires funding for promotion, a paid organizer, and paid facilitators. Each circle meets for two-hour sessions at least three times.\n\nKitchen-table discussion groups A kitchen-table discussion group is a small group of people, often neighbors, who get together in someone's home to talk, listen, and share ideas on subjects of mutual interest. The host encourages people to listen, to ask clarifying questions, and to avoid arguing or interrupting. The host also points out that there are no right or wrong ideas. Kitchen-table discussion groups are close relatives of reading and study circles. Reading circles and Book clubs Reading circles resemble college seminar groups except they are organized by participants. The circle agrees on a book worth reading, which everyone reads, then gets together to discuss. If the task of reading is difficult, the group might break the book into chunks, then meet to discuss each chunk. For a more interesting discussion, half of the group might read one book while the other half reads a contrasting book.\n\n*Edited from Living Room Revolution, a Handbook for Conversation, Community and the Common Good, by Cecile Andrews published by New Society Publishers in 2013. Andrew’s fine book contains a more complete discussion of study circles. Salons Salons are small groups of people who gather together primarily for conversation. Since their origins in the Enlightenment of the 18th century and in 19th-century France, salons have been associated with social change. In the past, well-connected aristocratic women would organize a salon, deciding who to invite and taking care to ensure a mix of the brightest and wittiest people. The salonieres' first job was to compose the salon for the best result. The right mix of people and perspectives was and still is necessary for a lively conversation. A small number of people works best for salons, just as it does for other forms of community.\n\nCommunity-wide study circles provide an opportunity for public education and public deliberation and help to bridge the gap between public policy and public attitudes. Participants spend time on what Daniel Yankelovich in Coming to Public Judgement calls \"working through,\" where they examine the consequences of taking different stands on an issue in order to come to a relatively stable point of view.

                "text": "At that time, women had powerful ... discussions. Salons were an informal form of education where women were able to exchange ideas, receive and give criticism, read their own works, and hear about the works and ideas of other intellectuals.......\n\nSalons helped facilitate the breaking down of social barriers which made the development of the enlightenment salon possible. In the 18th century, under the guidance of Madame Geoffrin, Mlle de Lespinasse, and Madame Necker, the salon was transformed into an institution of Enlightenment. The enlightenment salon brought together Parisian society, the progressive philosophes who were producing the Encyclopédie, the Bluestockings and other intellectuals to discuss a variety of topics. At that time, women had powerful influence over salons, where they carried very important roles as regulators who could select their guests and decide the subjects of their meetings, which could be social, literary, or political topics of the time. They also served as mediators by directing discussions. Salons were an informal form of education where women were able to exchange ideas, receive and give criticism, read their own works, and hear about the works and ideas of other intellectuals.\n\nRecent historiography has been dominated by Jürgen Habermas' work, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (triggered largely by its translation into French in 1978, and then English in 1989), which argued that the salons were of great historical importance. Theaters of conversation and exchange – such as the salons and the coffeehouses in England – played a critical role in the emergence of what Habermas termed the public sphere, which emerged in cultural-political contrast to court society. Thus, while women retained a dominant role in the historiography of the salons, the salons received increasing amounts of study, much of it in direct response to or heavily influenced by Habermas' theory. The most prominent defense of salons as part of the public sphere comes from Dena Goodman's The Republic of Letters, which claims that the \"public sphere was structured by the salon, the press and other institutions of sociability\".\n\nJoan Landes agrees, stating that, \"to some extent, the salon was merely an extension of the institutionalized court\" and that rather than being part of the public sphere, salons were in fact in conflict with it. Erica Harth concurs, pointing to the fact that the state \"appropriated the informal academy and not the salon\" due to the academies' \"tradition of dissent\" – something that lacked in the salon. But Landes' view of the salons as a whole is independent of both Elias' and Habermas' school of thought, insofar that she views the salons as a \"unique institution\" that cannot be adequately described as part of the public sphere or court society. Others, such as Steven Kale, compromise by declaring that the public and private spheres overlapped in the salons. Antoine Lilti ascribes to a similar viewpoint, describing the salons as simply \"institutions within Parisian high society\". Historians have traditionally focused upon the role of women within salons.\n\nHistorians tended to focus on individual salonnières, creating almost a \"great woman\" version of history that ran parallel to the Whiggish, male-dominated history identified by Herbert Butterfield. Even in 1970, works were still being produced that concentrated only on individual stories without analysing the effects of the salonnières' unique position. The integral role that women played within salons as salonnières began to receive greater – and more serious – study in latter parts of the 20th century, with the emergence of a distinctly feminist historiography. The salons, according to Carolyn Lougee, were distinguished by \"the very visible identification of women with salons\" and the fact that they played a positive public role in French society. General texts on the Enlightenment, such as Daniel Roche's France in the Enlightenment, tend to agree that women were dominant within the salons, but that their influence did not extend far outside of such venues.\n\nMore recently, \"society hostesses\" such as Perle Mesta have done so as well. The Stettheimer sisters, including the artist Florine Stettheimer, hosted gatherings at their New York City home in the 1920s and '30s. During the Harlem Renaissance, Ruth Logan Roberts, Georgia Douglas Johnson and Zora Neale Hurston hosted salons that brought together leading figures in African-American literature, and in the culture and politics of Harlem at the time. Modern-day versions of the traditional salon (some with a literary focus, and others exploring other disciplines in the arts and sciences) are held throughout the world, in private homes and public venues. Sally Quinn and her husband Ben Bradlee hosted influential salons in Washington DC from the 1970s until the 2000s. \"An invitation to the couple’s historic Georgetown home was one of the most coveted status symbols in the nation’s capital, an entry to an elite salon of the powerful, talented and witty.\"",

Home&#x27;s circle typified those private companies that cultivated mutual pleasure, conversation, and artistry in early America while pursuing the enrichment of society....\n\nMary-le-Bow in London), the Bachelor's Hall Club in Philadelphia (the hall was a wooden clubhouse on the banks of the Schuylkill River). Some were more informal in their structures, confessing a name, perhaps, and a common passion, but little else in the way of regulation, such as the poetic Swains of the Schuylkill, who gathered around Provost William Smith in Pennsylvania, or the country party wits who satirized the politics of Governors Cornbury and Cosby of New York, or the Scots Club of “clamorous malcontents” in Savannah that roiled Georgia's civil peace with verse satires dropped in the street for citizens to read. Some of these societies were all-male enclaves, others all-female gatherings, such as Maryland's Syllabub Club or Madam Sarah Kemble Knight's tea table. Early America boasted an ambitious group of salonieres, women who gathered about themselves the cultivated men and women of their neighborhoods to enjoy mutual edification and entertainment.\n\nAmong the wealth of newly discovered poetry from the colonial era printed in the collection, a substantial portion derives from the manuscripts generated by a constellation of tavern circles, clubs, tea tables, salons, and coteries that graced the major cities of the Atlantic seaboard. This NEH-supported collection brings to light a society of poets whose work dominated nonreligious writing from 1690 to 1776. The great ambition of these writers was to bring into America something more than liberty, salvation, and material wealth. They wished to establish a public culture in which civility and its most pleasurable expressions, the fine arts, flourished. From Bridgetown, Barbados, to Kittery, Maine, clusters of people gathered together to experience the pleasure that arises when play, wit, singing, social reading, and impromptu versification elevate talk above routine reports on weather, travel, and business.\n\nHome, though he was the “Wonder Joy and Fame” of the New World in 1744, slipped into that general amnesia about the literature and culture of colonial America that afflicted the United States in the early nineteenth century. Then—when being in print and being well reviewed became the signs of literary merit—all the writers who trafficked in manuscript fell into neglect. Yet the ideals that animated Home and his contemporaries in the sociable world of early America did not and do not deserve contempt. Civility, learning, friendship, and mutual enrichment are necessary to build a community that stands for something other than custom, coincidental interest, or religious orthodoxy. Home's circle typified those private companies that cultivated mutual pleasure, conversation, and artistry in early America while pursuing the enrichment of society.\n\nAside from this common desire for enrichment, the ambitions and accomplishments of the groups differed widely. Some-Franklin's Junto for instance or the King's College Club in New York City—sought to improve the skills of the members in thinking and speaking as preparation for public life. Others sought to deepen friendship through the cultivation of good humor, such as the Ugly Club of Charleston (a gentlemen's club for those with no pretenses to grace, face, or fashionability). Some cultivated sense and learning, such as the Winyah Indigo Society in South Carolina. But the most ambitious sought to create art from their interactions. At one time or another at least one of these aspiring companies operated in every city in early America. To grasp what some of these circles accomplished artistically, we should take a look at the doings of one circle, the coterie that formed around the young secretary of colonial New Jersey, Archibald Home.",

Voltaire is shown ordering coffee. The salons also had their male equivalents. One of these was the cercles sociaux (‘social circles’), or simply cercles. Unlike the salons, which were dominated by aristocrats and the wealthy, membership of the cercles was largely bourgeois. There was wide variation between the cercles. Some were little more than gentlemen’s clubs, where the discussion was interposed with drinking and gambling. Others were more overtly political and not dissimilar from the political clubs of the 1790s. The largest cercle sociaux was founded in Paris in 1790 and came to boast thousands of members. Formally called the ‘Society of the Friends of Truth’, it published its own newspaper called Bouche de Fer (‘Mouth of Iron’) and was dominated by men of the Girondin faction.\n\nSalons were usually assembled in a reception room, such as a lounge, library or parlour, though smaller gatherings were occasionally held in the host’s bedroom. Most began with a reading of some kind, usually from a new or newly discovered novel, essay or philosophical text. Discussion proceeded from there, often led or encouraged by the salonnière. Madame Roland, the hostess of one of Paris’ best known salons · Paris and Versailles boasted dozens of fashionable salons by the 1780s. Most were dominated by women of the nobility and the haute bourgeoisie. Some salonnières became celebrities in their own right. One was Suzanne Curchod, the wife of Jacques Necker, who ran a popular society salon in Paris in the 1770s. Some of the regulars at Madame Necker’s salon supported her husband’s elevation into the king’s ministry. Sophie de Condorcet, the wife of the Marquis de Condorcet, ran a well-patronised salon attended by several philosophes and, at various times, Anne-Robert Turgot, Thomas J\n\nMost were educated, well read and informed about politics, current affairs and intellectual debates. By the last quarter of the 18th century, the salons had become de facto universities or tutorial groups, specialising in Enlightenment ideas and philosophy. Many salons focused on an item of literature, such as a text by one of the philosophes or a recent essay or pamphlet. The salons and their male-oriented counterparts, the cercles and cafés, were social gatherings rather than cohesive revolutionary groups or parties. Nevertheless, they served as distributors of revolutionary ideas and sentiment. The salons provided a venue for floating, sharing and discussing liberal ideas and criticisms of the Ancien Régime. They served as a precursor to the political clubs that emerged in the early 1790s. The earliest salons date back to the early 1600s, to a literary circle hosted by the Marquess de Rambouillet, an Italian-born French aristocrat.\n\n5. The male equivalent of the salons were the ‘social circles’ and informal gatherings in the cafés, where criticisms of the old order, Enlightenment philosophy and revolutionary ideas were discussed.

Several modern concepts can be viewed as direct descendants of the historical salon: Creative Salons: Gathering of artists, writers, and musicians for collaborative projects and peer critique. These events are analogous to hackathons or collaborative coding sessions where participants share their expertise and build upon each other’s work. Business Salons: Professional networking events facilitating discussions about industry trends and opportunities. These gatherings function as real-world implementations of professional social networks like LinkedIn, offering opportunities for face-to-face interactions and relationship building. Wellness Salons: Gatherings focused on health, wellness, and self-care, reflecting a growing emphasis on personal well-being and holistic development.\n\nThe influence of salons extended beyond mere discussion. They played a vital role in shaping intellectual and artistic movements, including the Enlightenment, Romanticism, and, indirectly, the French Revolution. The free exchange of ideas, even those critical of the established order, was tolerated, albeit within carefully managed social boundaries. This tolerance, albeit limited by societal constraints, allowed for the development of groundbreaking concepts that would ultimately transform European society. The emphasis on reasoned debate and empirical observation within salons mirrors the scientific method’s core principles. While not explicitly scientific, salons fostered a culture of inquiry and critical thinking, providing fertile ground for scientific advancements and their subsequent popularization. Notable Salonnières: Architects of Intellectual Exchange ·\n\nThe initial implementations were highly dependent on the salonnière’s social capital and network. This presented both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it guaranteed a certain level of sophistication and intellectual preparedness. On the other, it inherently created barriers to entry for those outside the established social circles. This dynamic echoes contemporary discussions surrounding filter bubbles and echo chambers in online communities. ... The 18th century witnessed the zenith of salons, becoming pivotal hubs for intellectual ferment and artistic innovation. Prominent figures like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot frequented these gatherings, contributing to the dissemination of Enlightenment ideals.

                "text": "Secondly, conversation was only one of the many activities that took place in a salon, which also included music, theatrical performances, eating, gambling, and so on. Salons, then, were not so much literary circles as leisure venues where literature played an important role: providing high society with a justification for its social and cultural dominance. The main “literary” activities in Parisian salons were poetry, witty games (jeux d’esprit), and theatrical performances known as “theatre de société.” Men of letters were welcomed for their abilities to improvise verses, write comedies and \n\nMore generally, salons were important stepping-stones in authors’ careers, not as literary institutions, but rather because they made it possible for men of letters to gain access to the resources of aristocratic and royal patronage.[21] Women played the role that had traditionally always been theirs in court society: to protect and intervene in favor of particular people and to mobilize ministers and courtiers. When he began to attend Parisian salons, Marmontel explained his goals in the following terms: “protectors and some means towards a fortune.”[22] In practice, authors without considerable personal fortunes and their own social status faced considerable dangers, and it was indispensable for them to be firmly integrated within the networks of Parisian elites. Most of the sources of revenue to which writers could aspire (pensions, a post as private tutor, a position as a secretary or a reader, etc.) could only be acquired if they were recommended and protected by powerful people w\n\nLong associated with military valor, and subsequently with noble birth, aristocratic prestige rested increasingly on the manners of the man of the world (l’homme du monde) and on the cultural practices of polite society, like reading, theater, or poetry. Sociability was an instrument of this redefinition, thanks to the writers who participated in it and celebrated it. This process took place over a long period and definitively made salons a commonplace in the French cultural imaginary. Already under Louis XIII, writers like Guez de Balzac and Jean Chapelain attended the salons of polite society and contributed to publicizing their reputation.[5] Almost three centuries later, Marcel Proust wrote worldly chronicles in the Figaro, and deployed the Parisian salons as the backdrop for The Remembrance of Things Past.[6] In the cultural history of France, mondanité and literature are intimately linked, and the second half of the eighteenth century is a crucial moment in this process, during w\n\nThe ideal which guided the writers who attended these salons—Morellet, Thomas, Marmontel, and many others—was not the Republic of Letters, but Parisian high society (le monde), where some men of letters, polite and successful, were welcomed because they conformed to aristocratic norms. In other words, they were dreaming about the kingdom of politesse rather than the Republic of Letters.[3] Salons are too often considered as literary institutions, whose function was to bring together writers and to allow them to meet, discuss literature and debate their ideas. They are indeed often referred to as “literary salons” and this has played a huge part in confusing salons with the Republic of Letters. In fact, this image is entirely anachronistic, originating at the beginning of the twentieth century, as I have shown elsewhere.[4] Actually, what are known as salons—and what were designated during the eighteenth century by the terms “houses,” “circles,” and above all “societies”—was an institut\n\nAll around Europe, academies were the underpinnings of the eighteenth-century Republic of Letters, and they encouraged the circulation of knowledge.[29] In France, provincial academies were essential venues where local elites could join scholars in order to improve collective knowledge and add to the king’s glory.[30] But personal relations, either through letters or journeys, still played a key role in the formation of the networks devoted to knowledge that some refer to as the Republic of Letters. The case of Esprit Calvet, well studied by Laurence Brockliss, illustrates the persistence of such networks.[31] But Calvet’s web was very different from the Parisian salons attended by the philosophes and was scarcely connected to the main foyers of the Enlightenment. If one wants to understand why so many writers in the eighteenth century, and especially many encyclopedists, sought eagerly to be received in the salons, the Republic of Letters is not a helpful notion.  · Certainly, not eve",

Some African American societies were exclusively male or restricted to upper-class members.\n\nWhile women's literary societies grew in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so did African American literary societies. African American reading groups grew out of the mutual improvement societies that free blacks formed in the 1770s. Throughout the early nineteenth century, these groups met to discuss literature and politics. Unlike other literary societies, these groups turned \"reading\" into community events by having the works for discussion read out loud so that even people who were illiterate could join discussion. Some African American societies were exclusively male or restricted to upper-class members. By the late nineteenth century, however, African American reading groups such as the Bethel Historical and Literary Association in Washington, D.C., and the Boston Literary and Historical Association had hundreds of people attending their meetings.\n\nWhile critics of middlebrow believed it marked the end of serious, noncommercial culture, the most important change that new, commercial middlebrow institutions such as the Book-of-the-Month-Club (BOMC) created was the shift from clubs that met for self-improvement toward clubs that never met. In the late nineteenth century, those literary societies that felt somewhat insecure about their own tastes could invest in a number of different commercially available programs. In 1878, for example, after successfully starting the Chautauqua movement, John Heyl Vincent created a set of readers and guides for study groups in the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle (CLSC). These guides were available by mail and encouraged recipients to read and study together. The BOMC, founded in 1926, on the other hand, sent books directly to subscribers' homes. Earlier literary societies formed libraries and reading rooms.\n\nAttitudes toward literary societies in the early twenty-first century remained similar to those of the eighteenth century. As a leisure activity, they reinforce American ideas that leisure should be \"well spent.\" Literary societies offer social interaction, mental development, and cultural status.

Based on a thorough study of archival sources and using methodology derived from cultural history, social history, and the history of literature, The World of Salons proposes a completely new reading of salons' sociability in eighteenth-century Paris. It challenges the commonly accepted vision of salons as literary circles that were part of the Republic of Letters. It argues, instead, that salons were institutions of worldly sociability, had helped shape 'the world' (le monde) and high society. They have been essential places where the aristocratic elites of the capital met and interacted with literary figures. These interactions based on the mastery of the codes of polite conversation but also on the circulation of news and of personal reputations are the subject of this book.\n\nabbé ambassadors amusement ancien régime anecdote Archives nationales aristocratic August baron baron d'Holbach Beauvau Bibliothèque Bombelles Choiseul circulation Collé comte comtesse de Boufflers Contrôle des étrangers conversation Correspondance littéraire court cultural d'Alembert d'Holbach Dictionnaire Diderot dinners diplomats duchesse de Choiseul eighteenth century elites Enlightenment fashionable Ferté-Imbault française France French frequented friends Galiani Genlis Grimm guests Gustav III Helvétius high society homme hostess inédite Julie de Lespinasse La Ferté-Imbault letter to Madame literary livres Luxembourg Madame d'Épinay Madame de Staël Madame Du Boccage Madame Du Deffand Madame Geoffrin Madame Necker maréchale de Luxembourg Marmontel marquise Mémoires minister Mme Geoffrin monde Monsieur Morellet opinion Paris Parisian high society philosophes play police political praise prince received reputation Reynière ridicule role Rousseau salons social société Suard suppers ti",

Members of learned societies and others interested in literature and learning discussed their ideas orally or in letters, and by the late seventeenth century circulated them in printed journals, such as Pierre Bayle’s News from the Republic of Letters (1684). The English journals The Tatler (1709–11) and The Spectator (1711–12), edited by the playwright Richard Steele and the poet Joseph Addison, had circulations in the tens of thousands, which meant they were read by far more people than just a small elite. They included essays by their editors, commentary on theatrical productions, and a skillful mixture of society news and social criticism. Readers were encouraged to respond, and their letters were printed, so that the circle of authors as well as readers expanded.\n\nEnlightenment ideas did not simply fl ow east to west across the Atlantic, argue several scholars, but west to east. Historians of the Caribbean such as Laurent Dubois have analyzed the ways in which debates about slavery and universal rights going on in the islands of the French Caribbean shaped political discussions in Europe, and postcolonial historians trace lines of infl uence in all directions. Israel and Dubois have affi rmed the focus on ideas that was at the core of Gay’s study, but the Enlightenment today has a very different shape than it did half a century ago. Though rulers and church leaders were still important shapers of culture, the institutions of the “public sphere” – learned societies, salons, clubs, literary journals, and newspapers – helped create what we now call “public opinion,” a force that became more powerful as the eighteenth century progressed.\n\nMany artists, writers, and composers continued to get commissions from aristocratic patrons, but others depended on selling their work to a middle-class public through galleries, art shops, book stores, or subscriptions. Middle-class urban households often had more disposable income in the eighteenth century than they had had in the sixteenth, and the consumer goods they purchased included books, engravings, paintings, musical instruments, and music to play on them. The men and women who gathered in societies, academies, clubs, and salons embraced science as well as other interests. Like Pope – who was a favorite of discussion groups in London – they saw new developments in science as a proper basis for all knowledge and something that all educated people should understand. They regularly purchased popularizations of scientifi c works, which sought to explain both the basis and the impact of new ways of understanding the world. ...

From mid‐century there were increasing numbers of nonconformist societies until by around the last quarter of the century almost every chapel in the North and the Midlands had such a group. The chapel societies seem to have been largely radical liberal in nature and by the 1890s individuals and entire societies were turning to socialism. Their decline began around 1900, and like so many Victorian institutions they largely passed away with the coming of the First World War.

The Interintellect artifact shows people having a wide-ranging conversation focused on an interesting topic (Antigone). If you find group conversations on interesting topics interesting, you may explore more.\n\nI dropped by this @interintellect_ Salon by @tommycollison and @dmcdougall — we’re discussing Sophocles’s Antigone — but also Nussbaum and @AgnesCallard, power and CEOs, fear and rebellion, religion and parents, courage and women, Shamsie and Ivanka Trump, Oedipus and Vietnam… pic.twitter.com/JTzEWNtire— Anna Gát 🧭 in New York (@TheAnnaGat) March 14, 2021 · Both of these artifacts provide ways for members to share the community with the wider world. You can’t capture an entire experience in a single post. This makes it difficult for members to share a community because the content for that community is not made to be shared. Providing a framework encourages members to share more, which they already want to do (signaling). Artifacts exist where information is shared. Social media, articles, messages, and communities can all be sources.",

            "text": "Excellent instinct. Let me synthesize what I found into a design framework for Cursive.\n\n## **The Historical Models: What Actually Worked**\n\n### **Benjamin Franklin's Junto (1727-1765)**\n\n**Frequency & Structure:**\n- Met WEEKLY on Friday evenings for 38 years\n- 12 members from diverse trades: printers, surveyors, cabinetmakers, clerks\n- Every member in turn had to produce 1+ questions on morals, politics, or natural philosophy\n- Once in three months, each member had to read an essay they wrote\n\n**The 24 Standing Questions (read at EVERY meeting):**\n\nThe questions fell into distinct categories that reveal their purpose:\n\n**Learning & Sharing Knowledge:**\n- Have you met with anything remarkable in the author you last read, suitable to be communicated?\n- What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?\n\n**Community Service:**\n- Do you think of anything at present, in which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind? to their country, to their friends, or to themselves?\n- Hath any deserving stranger arrived in town since last meeting? What have you heard or observed of his character?\n- Do you know of any deserving young beginner lately set up, whom it lies in the power of the Junto any way to encourage?\n\n**Mutual Aid:**\n- Hath any body attacked your reputation lately? and what can the Junto do towards securing it?\n- Hath any man injured you, from whom it is in the power of the Junto to procure redress?\n- Have you any weighty affair in hand, in which you think the advice of the Junto may be of service?\n\n**Critical Thinking:**\n- What unhappy effects of intemperance have you lately observed or heard? of imprudence? of passion? or of any other vice or folly?\n- Is there any difficulty in matters of opinion, of justice, and injustice, which you would gladly have discussed at this time?\n\n**Meta-Reflection:**\n- Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?\n\n**The Four Core Commitments (for membership):**\n\nAll members had to affirm:\n1. Do you sincerely declare that you love mankind in general, of what profession or religion soever?\n2. Do you think any person ought to be harmed in his body, name or goods, for mere speculative opinions?\n3. Do you love truth for truth's sake, and will you endeavour impartially to find and receive it yourself and communicate it to others?\n4. Have you any particular disrespect to any present members?\n\n**Critical Rules:**\n- Debates conducted \"in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory\"\n- Franklin forbid himself \"the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly\" and adopted instead \"I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine\"\n\n### **French Salons (1600s-1700s)**\n\nSalons typically began with a reading from a new novel, essay, or philosophical text, followed by discussion led by the salonnière (hostess)\n\n**Key difference from Junto:**\n- Salonnières curated guest lists and guided conversations, playing crucial roles as regulators who selected guests and decided meeting subjects\n- More flexible structure, less formal rules\n- Focus on witty conversation, culture, ideas\n\n### **Modern Equivalents That Work**\n\n**Ben Franklin Circles (launched 2014):**\n- Meet MONTHLY rather than weekly, acknowledging busy 21st century lives\n- Discussions focus on people's lives—their aspirations and concerns—and how to bolster them through personal improvement and mutual support\n- Essential caveat: debates must be civil and respectful, reflecting Franklin's spirit of \"inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute\"\n\n**Interintellect:**\n- Hosts live, informal, unrecorded, evening-length conversations on interesting topics\n- Conversations are wide-ranging, focused on an interesting topic, with people from many walks of life\n- Emphasizes \"fearless conversations with friendly people\"\n\n## **What Made Them Work: The Pattern**\n\nThe successful models share:\n1. **Regular cadence** (weekly historically, monthly modern)\n2. **Structured prompts** (questions, readings)\n3. **Mutual obligation** (everyone contributes, not just consumes)\n4. **Shared commitments** (respect, truth-seeking, generosity)\n5. **Small scale** (12-20 people max)\n6. **Hospitable curation** (someone guides, but doesn't dominate)\n\n## **Design Recommendations for Cursive**\n\n### **The Graduated Path (Addressing Modern Attention)**\n\n**Level 1: Daily Light Touch (Public Commons)**\n- One question from you, 5-10 minutes to respond\n- Like a morning meditation practice\n- **Questions style:** \"What are you grateful for today?\" \"What surprised you?\" \"What are you avoiding?\"\n\n**Level 2: Weekly Depth (Cohort)**\n- Muscular questions requiring 30-60 minutes\n- **Questions style:** \"What truth are you avoiding?\" \"What are you building toward?\" \"Where is your thinking stuck?\"\n- Members commit to responding + reading 3-5 others' responses\n\n**Level 3: Monthly Essays (Advanced)**\n- Following Franklin's model: once a month, produce a longer piece\n- Gallery/Commons features the best\n- This is where facilitators curate\n\n**Level 4: Live Salons (Intimate)**\n- Synchronous video/voice discussions\n- Like Interintellect, but grounded in the written work\n- \"Let's discuss what emerged in this week's responses\"\n\n### **Your Question Rhythms - Three Options:**\n\n**Option A: Daily + Weekly**\n- Daily: Light prompt (5-10 min response) for everyone\n- Weekly: Muscular question (30-60 min) for committed members\n- Facilitators curate from weekly\n\n**Option B: Weekly Only**\n- One muscular question per week\n- Sunday: Question drops\n- People have until Friday to respond\n- Saturday: Featured responses published\n- More sustainable, higher quality\n\n**Option C: Franklin's Full Model (Intense)**\n- Weekly questions for all\n- Monthly essay requirement for cohort members\n- Only for serious mutual improvement societies\n\n**My recommendation: Start with Option B (weekly), add daily later if energy emerges**\n\n### **Facilitator Practices (The Salonnière Role)**\n\nBased on historical models, you as facilitator should:\n\n1. **Ask the right questions** (like Franklin's 24)\n2. **Curate who joins** (not everyone, but \"ingenious men\" seeking truth)\n3. **Feature responses** (like salon hostesses guided conversation)\n4. **Protect the tone** (inquiry not debate, \"I imagine\" not \"certainly\")\n5. **Model vulnerability** (share your own responses first)\n\n### **The Commitments (Modern Version of Franklin's Four)**\n\nEveryone who joins \"Questions from Bilal\" affirms:\n1. **I'm here to think, not perform** (no virtue signaling)\n2. **I respect others' perspectives** (even when I disagree)\n3. **I value truth over being right** (willing to change my mind)\n4. **I'll contribute, not just consume** (respond before reading others)\n\n### **Technical Implementation**\n\n**Sunday evening:**\n- Question drops in everyone's notebook\n- Notification: \"This week's question is ready\"\n\n**Monday-Friday:**\n- People work on responses in private\n- Can see \"23 people are working on this\" but not content yet\n\n**Saturday morning:**\n- All responses become visible simultaneously\n- You + facilitators review and feature 5-10\n- Featured responses go to public gallery\n- Gallery has: Featured (curated) / Recent (all) / Most Read tabs\n\n**The Beautiful Part:**\n- No comments initially (to prevent performative discourse)\n- Only \"Thanks\" button with optional note\n- After 1 week, discussion opens in anchored threads\n\nThis prevents the Twitter problem of hot takes and lets people think first.\n\n### **What Would Make This YOUR Twitter**\n\nThe magic isn't in the questions alone—it's in:\n1. **Your voice** (Bilal asking \"What are you building toward?\" hits different than generic prompts)\n2. **Cumulative wisdom** (seeing how your thinking evolved over 30 weeks)\n3. **Curated excellence** (featuring responses teaches what good thinking looks like)\n4. **Witnessing** (knowing others are wrestling with the same questions)\n\n## **Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Which rhythm feels sustainable for you?** (Daily light + weekly deep? Just weekly deep? Monthly essays?)\n\n2. **What's your first question?** (Should be something you genuinely want to know people's answers to)\n\n3. **How do you want to curate?** (Feature 5 responses? 10? Write notes on why you featured them? Just highlight?)\n\n4. **Who else can facilitate with you?** (Like salonnières, you'll need co-hosts as it grows)\n\n5. **What's the graduation path?** (After 12 weeks of \"Questions from Bilal,\" can people start their own salon on Cursive?)\n\nThis is much richer than I initially understood—you're not just building a platform, you're reviving a 300-year-old practice of mutual improvement for the internet age.\n\nWhat feels true? What needs adjusting?",

Here’s the crisp download—what Franklin’s Junto actually did, what modern “serious salons” look like, and a ready-to-run cohort blueprint you can use tomorrow (tuned for short attention spans without dumbing anything down).\n\nJunto, fact-checked (the bits that matter)\n\nCadence & venue: met weekly on Friday evenings, first at a tavern, later in a member’s house. \nanthologydev.lib.virginia.edu\n+2\nEncyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia\n+2\n\nSize & makeup: ~12 tradespeople/artisans (diverse skills, same hunger for improvement). \nbenjamin-franklin-history.org\n\nFormat: members brought queries (questions) for discussion; every three months each member read an original essay. \nanthologydev.lib.virginia.edu\n\nStanding queries: Franklin kept a canonical set—e.g., what useful knowledge have you found; who needs help; what public improvement could we attempt; have you observed any errors in our reasoning? (paraphrasing).

The traces (stops, edits, sketches) reassure the circle that a human wrestled here—and that’s what makes discussion fertile. Franklin’s crew didn’t grade essays; they witnessed each other’s efforts every Friday. You’re restoring that norm with modern scaffolding. \nanthologydev.lib.virginia.edu\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a one-pager “Cohort Starter Kit” (agenda, emails, prompts, witness checklist) you can drop straight into your app.\n\nYou said:\nalso maybe people can propose questions and we can have common questions - although if we do it like that we might need a cap where we make different groups, i can only host as many as i can and we're at limit till we get another host which the first host has to validate with somehow the initial person so the culture and maybe the person who runs it can see the questions being shared and picks up on a sense of who might be a good delegate for the next cirlce, we can't just have initinite scrolls a thousand people answering the same question - maybe the question is the same for all and the hosts all get together and pick the question the day ebfore it's launched that gets aggregated from all the circles - sort of like a liberating sructure 1 2 4 all \nChatGPT said:\nThought\n\nlove this. here’s a tight, hostable design that lets questions emerge from everyone, scales without chaos, and keeps the vibe intimate—using a 1-2-4-All–style pipeline.\n\nThe shape (simple, finite, human)\n\nCircle = 8–12 people + 1 host (max 3 circles per host).\n\nQuestion of the Day = 1 prompt across all circles (or 1 per track).\n\nHost Guild = small council of hosts who pick tomorrow’s prompt.\n\nQuestion Commons = pool of proposed questions (not a feed).\n\nNo infinite scroll.

Now I have:\n- 24 Standing Queries read and answered at EVERY meeting (confirmed)\n- Essay requirement was \"once in three months\" \n- Membership was \"capped at twelve\"\n- Met for 38-40 years\n- Started at tavern, moved to Robert Grace's house for privacy\n- No specific info on enforcement or expulsions found\n\nThe user's questions are excellent:\n1. Were all 24 questions strict? -> Yes, they were \"Standing Queries\" read at every meeting\n2. 3 month essay - enforcement? -> Not clear from sources\n3. Updates for networked age for stranger/beginner questions\n4. Live vs async\n5. Membership turnover\n6. Using liberating structures\n\nLet me provide a comprehensive answer addressing all these.Perfect questions! You're thinking like Franklin - asking \"what's amiss in our proceedings?\" Let me answer with what we actually know:\n\n## **How Strictly They Held It**\n\nThe 24 \"Standing Queries\" were read and answered at EVERY meeting - this is confirmed in the historical record. So yes, strict cadence.\n\nBUT - and this is important - Franklin himself wrote in the margin of his draft: \"Memo these Queries are not plac'd in the order I design 'em\" - meaning he kept iterating on the format. Not dogmatic.\n\n**The 3-Month Essay:**\nEvery member was required \"in his turn, should produce one or more queries\" AND \"once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing on any subject he pleased\"\n\n**Enforcement?** The sources don't say anyone got kicked out for missing essays. But here's the clever part: Membership was capped at twelve, and Franklin carefully selected \"ingenious acquaintances\" - so self-selection and social pressure did the work.\n\n**The genius:** Instead of punishment, they had Question #24: \"Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?\" - built-in meta-reflection!\n\n## **Membership Over 38 Years**\n\nThis is frustrating - the historical record is sparse. We know:\n- Started with 12 original members (1727)\n- Robert Grace was the only \"gentleman\" with no craft or profession\n- The 12th member remained a mystery until 2007 when it was discovered to be John Jones Jr., a shoemaker\n- By 1743, many Junto members \"grew successful businessmen\" and it evolved into the American Philosophical Society\n\nBut no clear record of: how many left, how many joined, turnover rate. This is actually helpful for you - **you get to pioneer the digital version with visible dynamics**.\n\n## **Updated Questions for the Networked Age**\n\nYour instinct is perfect. Let me translate Franklin's questions:\n\n**Original:** \"Hath any deserving stranger arrived in town since last meeting?\"\n\n**Networked Age:**\n- \"Who did you discover online this week worth introducing to this circle?\"\n- \"What account/creator surprised you with their depth?\"\n- \"Who's doing interesting work we should witness?\"\n\n**Original:** \"Do you know of any deserving young beginner lately set up, whom it lies in the power of the Junto any way to encourage?\"\n\n**Networked Age:**\n- \"Who's just starting something brave that we could amplify?\"\n- \"What early-stage project deserves more eyes?\"\n- \"Who needs a signal boost or introduction?\"\n\nThe **principle** stays the same: *Use our collective network to help people*.\n\n## **Live vs Async: A Hybrid Model**\n\nThis is where you can improve on Franklin. They had no choice - everything was synchronous. You have both.\n\n**The Best Model (Based on Modern Experiments):**\n\n```\nASYNC (Daily/Weekly):\n- Questions drop at same time for everyone\n- Everyone responds in their notebook (private)\n- Responses become visible simultaneously (Saturday)\n- This prevents performative hot-takes\n\nLIVE (Weekly or Monthly):\n- Synchronous discussion of what emerged\n- \"What surprised you in others' responses?\"\n- Real-time depth on sticky points\n- Like Franklin's Friday nights, but builds on written work\n\nThe Rhythm:\nSunday: Question drops\nMon-Fri: Private thinking/writing\nSaturday: Responses visible, async reading\nSunday evening: Optional live salon (60-90 min)\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Async = depth, time to think (Franklin's 3-month essays)\n- Live = connection, improvisation (Franklin's Friday nights)\n- You get both without forcing everyone into one timezone\n\n## **The 1-2-4-All Question Generation Genius**\n\nYES. This is brilliant. Here's how to make it work:\n\nFranklin's Question #24 was \"Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?\"\n\nYou're **implementing** this as a system:\n\n```\nQUESTION PERCOLATION (Weekly Cycle):\n\nMonday 9am: Proposal Window Opens\n- Anyone can propose a question (1-2 sentences max)\n- \"What are you avoiding?\"\n- \"Where does your work touch the world?\"\n\nMonday 9pm: Pair Phase (1→2)\n- System auto-pairs neighbors\n- \"Merge these two questions into one sharper version\"\n- Each pair produces 1 refined question\n\nTuesday 9am: Quad Phase (2→4) \n- Two pairs merge their questions\n- Each group of 4 produces 1 question\n- Circle now has ~3 finalist questions\n\nTuesday 9pm: Circle Decision (4→All)\n- Host reviews the 3 finalists\n- Members vote with \"why this, why now?\"\n- 1 question per circle goes to Host Guild\n\nWednesday 9am: Guild Synthesis\n- All host-circle questions arrive\n- Hosts cluster similar ones\n- Merge into 1-3 platform questions\n- Add context: \"Why this question now?\"\n\nThursday 7am: Question Launches\n- Everyone gets the same prompt\n- (Or Track A/B/C if you have thematic circles)\n```\n\n**This preserves Franklin's spirit:** Everyone can propose improvements, but there's a synthesis process that maintains quality.\n\n## **Live Notebooks: The Synchronous Possibility**\n\nYou asked about shared live notebooks - this is interesting but risky:\n\n**DON'T do this:**\n- Live collaborative doc where everyone types at once (chaos)\n- Watching someone else type in real-time (creepy)\n\n**DO consider this:**\n- Live \"read-aloud\" sessions: someone shares screen, reads their work, others see it\n- Paired witnessing: two people in a breakout room, read each other's work, discuss\n- Host-led close reading: \"Let's all open Sarah's response and I'll walk through what's working\"\n\n**The metaphor:** Franklin's Junto gathered physically to READ THEIR ESSAYS ALOUD. The live moment was the reading, not the writing.\n\nSo for you:\n- Write async (private notebook)\n- Present synchronously (read-aloud, screenshare, or pre-published)\n- Discuss live (what questions does this raise?)\n\n## **Making It New for the Internet Age**\n\nHere's what Franklin COULDN'T do that you CAN:\n\n1. **Graduated Attention Spans:**\n```\nLevel 1: Daily micro-question (5 min response)\nLevel 2: Weekly essay (30-60 min response)  \nLevel 3: Monthly long-form (3-month Franklin essay)\nLevel 4: Live salon (90 min synchronous)\n\nUsers can START at Level 1, build capacity for Level 2-4\n```\n\n2. **Visible Process:**\n- Franklin's essays were finished before Friday\n- You can show: saves, revisions, thinking time\n- Proof of human effort vs AI generation\n\n3. **Multi-Circle Dynamics:**\n- Franklin had ONE Junto\n- You can have many circles with cross-pollination\n- Question synthesis across circles (the 1-2-4-all)\n\n4. **Cumulative Commons:**\n- Junto discussions disappeared into memory\n- You create permanent, searchable archive\n- \"What did we think about X in 2025 vs 2026?\"\n\n5. **Witness Network at Scale:**\n- Junto = 12 mutual witnesses\n- You = \"witness your circle of 12, but read the featured 10 from other circles\"\n- Maintains intimacy while enabling discovery\n\n## **The Liberating Structures Connection**\n\nYou're exactly right - Franklin invented a liberating structure! The 24 Standing Queries ARE a structure for generative conversation.\n\n**Other Liberating Structures That Could Work:**\n\n**Troika Consulting (1-2-3):**\n- Person A shares a challenge (5 min)\n- Persons B & C consult, A listens (5 min)\n- A reflects what was useful (2 min)\n→ Could be async: \"Post your stuck point, two circle members respond, you synthesize\"\n\n**25/10 Crowd Sourcing:**\n- Everyone proposes a bold idea (2 min each)\n- Vote on which to pursue\n- Top ideas get resourced\n→ This is basically your question generation system!\n\n**TRIZ (Eliminate Contradictions):**\n- \"What are we doing that creates the problem we're trying to solve?\"\n- Perfect for Franklin's Q24: \"What's amiss in our proceedings?\"\n\n**Critical Uncertainties:**\n- \"What do we not know that matters most?\"\n- Great for surfacing questions to research\n\n**Your Innovation:** Making 1-2-4-All work ASYNCHRONOUSLY with question generation is genuinely new.\n\n## **My Recommendations for Cursive:**\n\n1. **Start Strict Like Franklin:**\n   - All 24 questions → Your \"Mandatory Weekly Questions\" (maybe 12?)\n   - 3-month essay → Your \"Monthly Long-Form\"\n   - Use his structure for first 6 months\n\n2. **Built-in Meta-Reflection:**\n   - Last question always: \"What should we change about this process?\"\n   - Monthly: vote on proposed changes\n   - The system evolves via its own questions\n\n3. **Hybrid Cadence:**\n   ```\n   Daily: 5-min micro-question (optional, low stakes)\n   Weekly: 30-min essay (required for circle membership)\n   Monthly: 90-min live salon (synchronous)\n   Quarterly: 3-hour deep dive (Franklin's long essay)\n   ```\n\n4. **Question Generation:**\n   - Use 1-2-4-All every Monday\n   - Questions launch Thursday\n   - Responses due by Saturday\n   - Featured responses published Sunday\n\n5. **Visible Membership Dynamics:**\n   - Show \"Circle Health\": % participating, avg time spent\n   - If someone misses 3 weeks → \"On sabbatical\" status\n   - If 4 weeks → graceful exit to \"Audit\" status\n   - Can rejoin when ready\n   - NO shame, just rhythms\n\n6. **The Essay Requirement:**\n   - Every 3 months, produce a \"Gift\"\n   - Can be: essay, video, audio, visual essay, tool\n   - Must go to Commons with curator's note\n   - This is your \"publishing gate\"\n\nDoes this help? What feels true, what needs adjusting?\n\nThe core insight: Franklin created a **protocol for collective intelligence** that worked for 38 years. You're creating the networked-age version. The principles stay the same (structured questions, mutual aid, meta-reflection), but the medium changes (async+live, multi-circle, visible process).",

In the margin opposite the Standing Queries, for example, he wrote: “Memo these Queries are not plac’d in the order I design ’em.”5 The order and phrasing as printed by Vaughan are both improved. The same is true of the Qualifications, the order in Vaughan ascending logically from love of the Junto to love of truth. Vaughan’s version is printed here as being more nearly the final product of the author’s thought. In his edition Duane added to these Queries a list of questions which he said had been discussed at meetings of the Junto. These questions Duane took from the Eulogium on Benjamin Franklin by Provost William Smith, who found them in a manuscript book of Junto minutes.6 The questions are omitted here, however, because Franklin had nothing to do with them: he was in England when they were discussed in the so-called “young Junto” in 1758–59.\n\n2. Draft reads: “Hath any remarkable Stranger arriv’d in Town since last Meeting that you know of; and what have you heard or observ’d of his Character or Merits? And wherein think you the Junto can oblige him or encourage him as he deserves?” ... 4. In the draft the Qualifications are in the form of indirect questions, as: “Whether he loves all Men of What Profession or Religion soever.” ... 7. Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) translated these queries into German, adding comments, and presented them to the Friday Club of Weimar, July 5, 1791, to serve as the basis for the club’s procedure. J. G. Herder, Briefe zu Beförderung der Humanität (Riga, 1793), pp. 10–34; Bernhard Suphan, ed., Herders Sämmtliche Werke (Berlin, 1877–1913), XVI, 43n; XVII, 10–16; see also Beatrice Marguerite Victory, Benjamin Franklin and Germany (Phila., 1915), p.\n\n24.

Yes.7 · [Note numbering follows the Franklin Papers source.] 2.

There does exist, however, a part of the Junto’s ritual—the twenty-four “Standing Queries” which were read and answered at every meeting and the four qualifications which every candidate for admission was required to meet. The idea for these questions probably owes something to Mather’s proposed order of business, with its ten “Points of Consideration,” which were to be read “from time to time” at the meetings, “with a due Pause upon each of them, for any one to offer what he please upon it.” ·",

Franklin proposed that the group be formed of “ingenious men –a physician, a mathematician, a geographer, a natural philosopher, a botanist, a chemist, and a mechanician (engineer)”. The American Philosophical Society was founded in 1743, “to promote useful knowledge“. Today it is known for its excellence in scholarly research and publications.

One was an English group called the “Dry Club,” which had philosopher John Locke, William Popple, and Benjamin Furly among its members during the 1690s (and was itself partially inspired by Furly's “heretics of the Lantern” society). It met one evening a week for two hours at a time and required that its members reply affirmatively to the following questions: Whether he loves all Men, of what Profession or Religion soever? Whether he thinks no person ought to be harmed in his Body, Name, or Goods, for mere speculative Opinions, or his external way of Worship? Whether he loves and seeks Truth for Truth's sake; and will endeavour impartially to find and receive it himself, and to communicate it to others? Each member of the club would take turns proposing topics for discussion and moderating these discussions.\n\nThe Junto's Friday evening meetings were organized around a series of questions that Franklin devised, covering a range of intellectual, personal, business, and community topics. These questions were used as a springboard for discussion and community action. Through the Junto, Franklin promoted such concepts as volunteer fire-fighting clubs, improved security (night watchmen), and a public hospital. The questions are included in Franklin's papers, dated 1728, and some editions of his autobiography. As printed in Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces, the questions are: Have you met with any thing in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto? particularly in history, morality, poetry, physic, travels, mechanic arts, or other parts of knowledge. What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?\n\nThe other important predecessors were the \"neighborhood benefit societies” and “reforming societies” proposed in Massachusetts by Cotton Mather. Cotton Mather described the neighborhood societies as being composed of a dozen married couples who would meet at one another's homes in succession for prayer and other religious exercises, and also to consider questions like the following: Who are in any peculiar adversity; and what may be done to comfort them? What contention or variance may there be among our neighbours; and what may be done for healing it? In what open transgressions do any live? and who shall be desired to carry faithful admonitions to them? The similar reforming societies would entertain questions like these: Can any further methods be devised that ignorance and wickedness may be more chased from our people in general; and that domestic piety, in particular, may flourish among them?\n\nAt just 21, he oversaw five men, including Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb, who were soon to form the core of the Junto. Franklin was an outgoing, social individual and had become acquainted with these businessmen. This gathering included prominent merchants who met informally to drink and discuss the business of the day. Franklin's congenial ways attracted many unique and learned individuals, and from these, he selected the members for the Junto. All members lived in Philadelphia and came from diverse areas of interest and business. Along with Meredith, Potts, and Webb, they included Joseph Breintnall, merchant and scrivener, who also loved poetry and natural history. Thomas Godfrey was a glazier, mathematician, and inventor; and Nicholas Scull II and William Parsons were both surveyors. Scull was also a bibliophile and Parsons a cobbler and astrologer.",

Executives will likely find at least the following three questions are still applicable—and may even wish to pose them to their own peer council: Have you any weighty affair in hand, in which you think the advice of the Junto may be of service? Do you think of anything at present, in which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind? To their country, to their friends, or to themselves? In what manner can the Junto, or any of them, assist you in any of your honorable designs? How encouraging it is to see the origins of modern “issue processing” at the heart of these questions offering service, discussing opportunities, and providing support to peers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Franklin placed a great deal of importance on self-improvement.\n\nWell known as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Benjamin Franklin was also the trailblazer behind peer advisory groups. In 1727, at the age of 21, Franklin cajoled some friends to hold a weekly gathering with the purpose of mutual improvement. The cohort selected a name, the Junto Club, from the Spanish word for “together,” and intended their newfound organization to drive both personal and societal improvement. The group, also known as the Leather Apron Club, convened avid readers, scholarly intellectuals, and curious thinkers. Meeting on Friday evenings, they discussed issues of morals, politics, and natural philosophy. In turn, the ideas that emerged during these sessions sparked many public projects, including the first lending library, the University of Pennsylvania, the volunteer militia, and the Pennsylvania Hospital. When it came to membership, Franklin included people from a variety of backgrounds.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s Junto Club would meet for an astonishing 38 years. Inspired by this organization, groups dedicated to mutual improvement have since taken various forms. From author Napoleon Hill’s “master mind alliance” to the somewhat unconventionally named “ Vagabonds” group, which included members like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, peer advisory groups have continually brought together thought leaders to help make critical decisions, face challenges, and explore opportunities. So next time you head out to a “meeting of the minds” — whatever form your chosen organization happens to take — rest assured, you are standing on the shoulders of giants. You can expect to reap tremendous benefits from this age-old approach to personal and professional growth. ... 🗸 Improved business results for founder-led B2B and GovCon firms & 🗸 Increased career success for Second in Commands/COOs 8mo ...",

                "text": "One of the most enduring aspects of Franklin’s Junto was his list of 24 guiding questions. These questions encouraged members to think critically, reflect on their values, and engage in honest self-assessment. Here are a few examples that can inspire thoughtful discussion in modern mastermind groups: Have you met with any success since our last meeting? Do you have anything to ask the advice of the group about? Has any member of the group been wronged in any business transaction? What new knowledge or information have you gained recently? Are there any public matters in which our group could offer a benefit? These questions serve as timeless prompts, prompting members to engage in self-reflection and group accountability. Adapting Franklin’s questions or creating similar ones can be a powerful tool for today’s groups, helping them unlock deeper insights and build stronger bonds.\n\nThen: Franklin developed a set of questions for the Junto meetings, touching on topics like self-improvement, moral conduct, and social responsibility. These questions sparked meaningful conversations, encouraged critical thinking, and helped members to learn from each other’s experiences. Now: Structured prompts or agendas help modern mastermind groups maintain focus and extract more value from each session. Franklin’s model encourages groups to design questions or themes that align with their goals, making discussions both relevant and enriching. Then: The Junto members shared practical knowledge and professional insights, offering support and advice on each other’s challenges. Franklin’s group emphasized a culture of sharing and openness, aiming to advance each member’s skills. Now: Modern mastermind groups benefit greatly from a collaborative culture.\n\nFor those looking to start or enhance their own mastermind group, Franklin’s Junto offers valuable lessons: Emphasize a shared purpose. Introduce structured questions to guide discussions. Encourage knowledge sharing across different backgrounds. Hold members accountable for taking action. Benjamin Franklin’s Junto reminds us that the right environment for shared learning and support can catalyze personal and societal change. By embracing these timeless principles, modern mastermind groups can become powerful tools for both personal achievement and social impact.\n\nBenjamin Franklin collaborative learning collective wisdom group accountability group dynamics historical mastermind intellectual curiosity Junto knowledge sharing mastermind group questions Mastermind Groups mastermind principles Personal Growth Self-Improvement social responsibility structured questions",

Executives will likely find at least the following three questions are still applicable—and may even wish to pose them to their own peer council: Have you any weighty affair in hand, in which you think the advice of the Junto may be of service? Do you think of anything at present, in which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind? To their country, to their friends, or to themselves? In what manner can the Junto, or any of them, assist you in any of your honorable designs? How encouraging it is to see the origins of modern “issue processing” at the heart of these questions offering service, discussing opportunities, and providing support to peers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Franklin placed a great deal of importance on self-improvement.\n\nWell known as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Benjamin Franklin was also the trailblazer behind peer advisory groups. In 1727, at the age of 21, Franklin cajoled some friends to hold a weekly gathering with the purpose of mutual improvement. The cohort selected a name, the Junto Club, from the Spanish word for “together,” and intended their newfound organization to drive both personal and societal improvement. The group, also known as the Leather Apron Club, convened avid readers, scholarly intellectuals, and curious thinkers. Meeting on Friday evenings, they discussed issues of morals, politics, and natural philosophy. In turn, the ideas that emerged during these sessions sparked many public projects, including the first lending library, the University of Pennsylvania, the volunteer militia, and the Pennsylvania Hospital. When it came to membership, Franklin included people from a variety of backgrounds.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s Junto Club would meet for an astonishing 38 years. Inspired by this organization, groups dedicated to mutual improvement have since taken various forms. From author Napoleon Hill’s “master mind alliance” to the somewhat unconventionally named “​​Vagabonds” group, which included members like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, peer advisory groups have continually brought together thought leaders to help make critical decisions, face challenges, and explore opportunities. So next time you head out to a “meeting of the minds” — whatever form your chosen organization happens to take — rest assured, you are standing on the shoulders of giants. You can expect to reap tremendous benefits from this age-old approach to personal and professional growth. ... Vistage facilitates confidential peer advisory groups for CEOs and other senior leaders, focusing on solving challenges, accelerating growth and improving business performance.",

A branch of the Junto Cub was the American Philosophical Society created in 1743 and which still exists. Members of the Junto club were avid readers and intellectuals involved in their individual improvement and that of society.\n\nThe Junto was a launching pad for many public projects. Out of the meetings came proposals for the creation of the first lending library, the Union Fire Company, the University of Pennsylvania, volunteer militia, Pennsylvania Hospital among other public project. The first public affair of the Junto club was the regulation and improvement of the city watch. They proposed taxing land owners in proportion to their property. Although the plan was not immediately executed it prepared the minds of the people and paved the way for the law that was adopted years later. Franklin devised a group of questions to guide discussions at meetings and to provide a structure: Have you met with anything in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto?

                "text": "The Junto, also known as the Leather Apron Club, was a club for mutual improvement established in 1727 by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia. The Leather Apron Club&#x27;s purpose was to debate questions of morals, politics, and natural philosophy, and to exchange knowledge of business affairs. Benjamin Franklin organized a group of friends to provide a structured form of mutual improvement. The group, initially composed of 12 members, called itself the Junto, derived from the Spanish word junta, or assembly. The members of the Junto were drawn from diverse occupations and backgrounds, but they all \n\nFranklin was influenced by two predecessor organizations in particular. One was an English group called the “Dry Club,” which had philosopher John Locke, William Popple, and Benjamin Furly among its members during the 1690s (and was itself partially inspired by Furly's “heretics of the Lantern” society). It met one evening a week for two hours at a time and required that its members reply affirmatively to the following questions: Whether he loves all Men, of what Profession or Religion soever? Whether he thinks no person ought to be harmed in his Body, Name, or Goods, for mere speculative Opinions, or his external way of Worship? Whether he loves and seeks Truth for Truth's sake; and will endeavour impartially to find and receive it himself, and to communicate it to others? Each member of the club would take turns proposing topics for discussion and moderating these discussions.\n\nAt just 21, he oversaw five men, including Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb, who were soon to form the core of the Junto. Franklin was an outgoing, social individual and had become acquainted with these businessmen. This gathering included prominent merchants who met informally to drink and discuss the business of the day. Franklin's congenial ways attracted many unique and learned individuals, and from these, he selected the members for the Junto. All members lived in Philadelphia and came from diverse areas of interest and business. Along with Meredith, Potts, and Webb, they included Joseph Breintnall, merchant and scrivener, who also loved poetry and natural history. Thomas Godfrey was a glazier, mathematician, and inventor; and Nicholas Scull II and William Parsons were both surveyors. Scull was also a bibliophile and Parsons a cobbler and astrologer.\n\nGrace's wealth meant he did not have to work, but apparently he brought an intellectual element to the group and a fine library. The twelfth member of the Junto remained a mystery until 2007, when Professor George Boudreau of Pennsylvania State University discovered a long-forgotten account of the club's refreshments and verified that shoemaker John Jones Jr. was an original member. Jones was a Philadelphia Quaker, a neighbor of Franklin's, and later a founding member of the Library Company of Philadelphia. The club met Friday nights, first in a tavern and later in a house, to discuss moral, political, and scientific topics of the day. Franklin describes the formation and purpose of the Junto in his autobiography: I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, [1727] I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday evenings.\n\nThe Junto's Friday evening meetings were organized around a series of questions that Franklin devised, covering a range of intellectual, personal, business, and community topics. These questions were used as a springboard for discussion and community action. Through the Junto, Franklin promoted such concepts as volunteer fire-fighting clubs, improved security (night watchmen), and a public hospital. The questions are included in Franklin's papers, dated 1728, and some editions of his autobiography. As printed in Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces, the questions are: Have you met with any thing in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto? particularly in history, morality, poetry, physic, travels, mechanic arts, or other parts of knowledge. What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?",

Fifth Street, Philadelphia.\n\n“Do you love truth for truth’s sake?” If the answer is yes, you are one-fourth of the way through the initiation ceremony of the Junto, which Benjamin Franklin (1706-90) founded in 1727 in Philadelphia. The 21-year-old Franklin, according to his autobiography, established the Junto as a club for “mutual improvement,” inviting acquaintances to meet weekly to discuss intellectual and moral issues. From these discussions emerged inspiration for many Philadelphia institutions including the American Philosophical Society, the Library Company of Philadelphia, a fire company, and the University of Pennsylvania. The name and concept for the Junto came from Franklin’s experiences working as a typesetter for several years in London. Not only was “Junto” used to describe a particularly select and powerful group of liberal Whig parliamentarians of the time, but also London was crammed with gentleman’s clubs aimed at encouraging the exchange of knowledge and strengthening of ties between businessme\n\nWith tolerance at the base of operation, Franklin presided over the club’s discussions on morality, politics, natural philosophy, and local gossip. Membership was capped at twelve, and members worked in diverse trades (scrivener, glazier, cobbler, surveyor, cabinetmaker, clerk) with diverse tastes (poetry, astrology, natural history, mathematics, scientific invention). They met every Friday night, in early years at the Indian Head Tavern but for privacy later changing the location to Robert Grace’s house on Market near Second Street. Grace was the only early member of the Junto considered a “gentleman,” with no craft or profession. In his biography of Franklin, University of Delaware scholar Leo LeMay (1935-2008) described the Junto as the “incubation chamber” for projects that greatly improved life in greater Philadelphia.

                "text": "As social isolation spreads, a new movement looks to early American history for a solution.\n\nThe eighteenth century in America saw the rise of an ambitious young man who, at the start of his career, invented a congenial way to exchange wisdom and support with fellow citizens as they made their way in a changing society. The young man was Benjamin Franklin, later destined to become the inventor of much else, including new technological devices, creative scientific insights, and the foundations of an improbable democratic republic. At age 21, young Ben devised a way to foster his early ambitions: a “mutual improvement society” that he called the “Junto” (pronounced June-Toe), derived from the Latin for “to join.” · Franklin’s group of twelve Philadelphians met Friday nights at a local tavern they called the “merchant’s Every-night club,” where they discussed business, morality, politics, philosophy, and whatever else interested them.\n\nThe membership was vocationally diverse, with businessmen, a clerk, a mathematician, a shoemaker, a surveyor, and a mechanic. Members of the Junto did a great deal of what we today would call “networking,” promoting each other’s advancement and keeping an eye out for useful connections with others beyond their group. The underlying agenda was to help one another become successful in their careers and good citizens. They discussed the role that virtues—such as prudence, diligence, and humility—play in building a successful life. Later in life, Franklin reflected on the role the Junto played in society: “the club continued (for forty years), and was the best school of philosophy, morality, and politics as then existed in the province.” The Junto also took on civic and charitable causes, such as establishing a public library by asking members to donate some of their own books.\n\nMight establishing this kind of mutual improvement society be possible today? In our world of solitary TV and digital device gazing, distrust across cultural and political groups, and increasing social isolation, such a community seems more needed now than ever. This is one reason why the folks at New York City’s 92nd Street Y have taken it upon themselves to recreate a community much like Franklin’s Junto. 92Y is a community center with a global platform, and it is dedicated to a number of civic ventures that are meant to enrich society and the lives of its members. One of them, for example, was Giving Tuesday, which was one of the most productive charitable initiatives of recent times. Now 92Y, in collaboration with the Citizen University in Seattle and Stanford’s Hoover Institution, has launched a twenty-first century version of Franklin’s Junto, called Ben Franklin Circles.\n\nAcknowledging the realities of busy twenty-first century working lives, today’s Circles meet monthly rather than weekly. Discussions focus on people’s lives—their aspirations and concerns—and how to bolster them through personal improvement and mutual support. Also central are concerns about how members can contribute to their communities and the civic society. The ages, vocations, and ideological persuasions in the Circles are diverse, with the essential caveat that debates be civil and respectful. This reflects the spirit of Ben, who wrote that his Junto was “to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory.” The rules of engagement for Ben Franklin Circles, as detailed on the Circles’ website, guide participants to deep conversations that lead to informed personal and civic choices, new friendships, and sustained relations among members.",

                "text": "The American Philosophical Society, founded by Benjamin Franklin\n\nThe Junto met weekly Over time, Franklin and many of his compatriots in the Junto grew successful businessmen. Franklin, in particular, could turn his attention away, to some degree, from moneymaking to scientific study. Other Americans had already been devoted to science. In fact, by 1743, nineteen Americans had already been elected to the Royal Society of London, a scientific organization. In 1739, John Bartram, a Philadelphia farmer and botanist who was also interested in natural history, proposed \"that a society or academy of the most ingenious and curious men' be established in America to promote inquiries into `natural secrets, arts & syances.' It should have a house of its own, sponsor lectures, and underwrite expeditions. Bartram, while a singular scientist, did not have the force of personality or circle of friends to carry his idea out to completion. But Benjamin Franklin did.\n\nThus, Benjamin Franklin, and a group of learned individuals came together on May 25, 1743 to from The American Philosophical Society. The informal Junto would give way to a group of learned scientists. The early membership concerned themselves with the study of the \"useful\" sciences. They sought to improve farm production, animal husbandry, and import new grain. They also wanted to make a beer better. Improved mining technique and figuring out better ways of assaying ore were also on the agenda. Better mapmaking, surveying and charting was important to the group. Fossils were of interest. Geology was of interest. Improving mechanical equipment was important. \"And all philosophical Experiments that let Light into the Nature of Things, tend to increase the Power of Man over Matter, and multiply the Conveniences of Pleasure of Life.\" The early membership included naturalists, mathematicians \"electricians\" — those who experimented with electricity.\n\nFranklin, naturally could not look for these answers on the Internet nor discuss them in college classes as he never went to college. Instead, in 1727 Franklin gathered together a group of his acquaintances and formed the Junto, a young men's association devoted to examining \"queries on any Point of Morals, Politics or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the Company...\" These queries, a mixture of the scientific, social, and philosophical, were posed by Franklin. For Franklin, these were questions that, if answered, would improve society. Franklin described the Junto this way in his Autobiography · I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, [1727] I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we me on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy [physics], to be \n\nPopularly, Benjamin Franklin gets pegged as a sybaritic sort of fellow, a man given to lusty appetites. That Franklin did indeed enjoy eating and drinking we can gauge by looking at portraits painted of him, reading his letters, or considering the gout which afflicted him later in life. Whether his lusty appetite extended to the boudoirs of French socialites or the trysting nature of late-night dalliances, is a matter of conjecture that historians are divided over. Regardless, Franklin carefully considered most everything he did — including eating and drinking — and could serve as a posterboy for the Platonic notion that \"the life which is unexamined is not worth living.\" Whether it came to questions of philosophy or norms of social behavior, Franklin carefully examined pros and cons, costs and benefits. Often, added into the balance of a question was whether its consequence would have any positive public upshot, and further, to consider how the public perceived his response to said qu",

But here's the clever part: Membership was capped at twelve, and Franklin carefully selected \"ingenious acquaintances\" - so self-selection and social pressure did the work.\n\n**The genius:** Instead of punishment, they had Question #24: \"Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?\" - built-in meta-reflection!\n\n## **Membership Over 38 Years**\n\nThis is frustrating - the historical record is sparse. We know:\n- Started with 12 original members (1727)\n- Robert Grace was the only \"gentleman\" with no craft or profession\n- The 12th member remained a mystery until 2007 when it was discovered to be John Jones Jr., a shoemaker\n- By 1743, many Junto members \"grew successful businessmen\" and it evolved into the American Philosophical Society\n\nBut no clear record of: how many left, how many joined, turnover rate. This is actually helpful for you - **you get to pioneer the digital version with visible dynamics**.\n\n## **Updated Questions for the Networked Age**\n\nYour instinct is perfect. Let me translate Franklin's questions:\n\n**Original:** \"Hath any deserving stranger arrived in town since last meeting?\"\n\n**Networked Age:**\n- \"Who did you discover online this week worth introducing to this circle?\"\n- \"What account/creator surprised you with their depth?\"\n- \"Who's doing interesting work we should witness?\"\n\n**Original:** \"Do you know of any deserving young beginner lately set up, whom it lies in the power of the Junto any way to encourage?\"\n\n**Networked Age:**\n- \"Who's just starting something brave that we could amplify?\"\n- \"What early-stage project deserves more eyes?\"\n- \"Who needs a signal boost or introduction?\"\n\nThe **principle** stays the same: *Use our collective network to help people*.\n\n## **Live vs Async: A Hybrid Model**\n\nThis is where you can improve on Franklin. They had no choice - everything was synchronous. You have both.\n\n**The Best Model (Based on Modern Experiments):**\n\n```\nASYNC (Daily/Weekly):\n- Questions drop at same time for everyone\n- Everyone responds in their notebook (private)\n- Responses become visible simultaneously (Saturday)\n- This prevents performative hot-takes\n\nLIVE (Weekly or Monthly):\n- Synchronous discussion of what emerged\n- \"What surprised you in others' responses?\"\n- Real-time depth on sticky points\n- Like Franklin's Friday nights, but builds on written work\n\nThe Rhythm:\nSunday: Question drops\nMon-Fri: Private thinking/writing\nSaturday: Responses visible, async reading\nSunday evening: Optional live salon (60-90 min)\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Async = depth, time to think (Franklin's 3-month essays)\n- Live = connection, improvisation (Franklin's Friday nights)\n- You get both without forcing everyone into one timezone\n\n## **The 1-2-4-All Question Generation Genius**\n\nYES. This is brilliant. Here's how to make it work:\n\nFranklin's Question #24 was \"Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?\"\n\nYou're **implementing** this as a system:\n\n```\nQUESTION PERCOLATION (Weekly Cycle):\n\nMonday 9am: Proposal Window Opens\n- Anyone can propose a question (1-2 sentences max)\n- \"What are you avoiding?\"\n- \"Where does your work touch the world?\"\n\nMonday 9pm: Pair Phase (1→2)\n- System auto-pairs neighbors\n- \"Merge these two questions into one sharper version\"\n- Each pair produces 1 refined question\n\nTuesday 9am: Quad Phase (2→4) \n- Two pairs merge their questions\n- Each group of 4 produces 1 question\n- Circle now has ~3 finalist questions\n\nTuesday 9pm: Circle Decision (4→All)\n- Host reviews the 3 finalists\n- Members vote with \"why this, why now?\"\n- 1 question per circle goes to Host Guild\n\nWednesday 9am: Guild Synthesis\n- All host-circle questions arrive\n- Hosts cluster similar ones\n- Merge into 1-3 platform questions\n- Add context: \"Why this question now?\"\n\nThursday 7am: Question Launches\n- Everyone gets the same prompt\n- (Or Track A/B/C if you have thematic circles)\n```\n\n**This preserves Franklin's spirit:** Everyone can propose improvements, but there's a synthesis process that maintains quality.\n\n## **Live Notebooks: The Synchronous Possibility**\n\nYou asked about shared live notebooks - this is interesting but risky:\n\n**DON'T do this:**\n- Live collaborative doc where everyone types at once (chaos)\n- Watching someone else type in real-time (creepy)\n\n**DO consider this:**\n- Live \"read-aloud\" sessions: someone shares screen, reads their work, others see it\n- Paired witnessing: two people in a breakout room, read each other's work, discuss\n- Host-led close reading: \"Let's all open Sarah's response and I'll walk through what's working\"\n\n**The metaphor:** Franklin's Junto gathered physically to READ THEIR ESSAYS ALOUD. The live moment was the reading, not the writing.\n\nSo for you:\n- Write async (private notebook)\n- Present synchronously (read-aloud, screenshare, or pre-published)\n- Discuss live (what questions does this raise?)\n\n## **Making It New for the Internet Age**\n\nHere's what Franklin COULDN'T do that you CAN:\n\n1. **Graduated Attention Spans:**\n```\nLevel 1: Daily micro-question (5 min response)\nLevel 2: Weekly essay (30-60 min response)  \nLevel 3: Monthly long-form (3-month Franklin essay)\nLevel 4: Live salon (90 min synchronous)\n\nUsers can START at Level 1, build capacity for Level 2-4\n```\n\n2. **Visible Process:**\n- Franklin's essays were finished before Friday\n- You can show: saves, revisions, thinking time\n- Proof of human effort vs AI generation\n\n3. **Multi-Circle Dynamics:**\n- Franklin had ONE Junto\n- You can have many circles with cross-pollination\n- Question synthesis across circles (the 1-2-4-all)\n\n4. **Cumulative Commons:**\n- Junto discussions disappeared into memory\n- You create permanent, searchable archive\n- \"What did we think about X in 2025 vs 2026?\"\n\n5. **Witness Network at Scale:**\n- Junto = 12 mutual witnesses\n- You = \"witness your circle of 12, but read the featured 10 from other circles\"\n- Maintains intimacy while enabling discovery\n\n## **The Liberating Structures Connection**\n\nYou're exactly right - Franklin invented a liberating structure! The 24 Standing Queries ARE a structure for generative conversation.\n\n**Other Liberating Structures That Could Work:**\n\n**Troika Consulting (1-2-3):**\n- Person A shares a challenge (5 min)\n- Persons B & C consult, A listens (5 min)\n- A reflects what was useful (2 min)\n→ Could be async: \"Post your stuck point, two circle members respond, you synthesize\"\n\n**25/10 Crowd Sourcing:**\n- Everyone proposes a bold idea (2 min each)\n- Vote on which to pursue\n- Top ideas get resourced\n→ This is basically your question generation system!\n\n**TRIZ (Eliminate Contradictions):**\n- \"What are we doing that creates the problem we're trying to solve?\"\n- Perfect for Franklin's Q24: \"What's amiss in our proceedings?\"\n\n**Critical Uncertainties:**\n- \"What do we not know that matters most?\"\n- Great for surfacing questions to research\n\n**Your Innovation:** Making 1-2-4-All work ASYNCHRONOUSLY with question generation is genuinely new.\n\n## **My Recommendations for Cursive:**\n\n1. **Start Strict Like Franklin:**\n   - All 24 questions → Your \"Mandatory Weekly Questions\" (maybe 12?)\n   - 3-month essay → Your \"Monthly Long-Form\"\n   - Use his structure for first 6 months\n\n2. **Built-in Meta-Reflection:**\n   - Last question always: \"What should we change about this process?\"\n   - Monthly: vote on proposed changes\n   - The system evolves via its own questions\n\n3. **Hybrid Cadence:**\n   ```\n   Daily: 5-min micro-question (optional, low stakes)\n   Weekly: 30-min essay (required for circle membership)\n   Monthly: 90-min live salon (synchronous)\n   Quarterly: 3-hour deep dive (Franklin's long essay)\n   ```\n\n4. **Question Generation:**\n   - Use 1-2-4-All every Monday\n   - Questions launch Thursday\n   - Responses due by Saturday\n   - Featured responses published Sunday\n\n5. **Visible Membership Dynamics:**\n   - Show \"Circle Health\": % participating, avg time spent\n   - If someone misses 3 weeks → \"On sabbatical\" status\n   - If 4 weeks → graceful exit to \"Audit\" status\n   - Can rejoin when ready\n   - NO shame, just rhythms\n\n6. **The Essay Requirement:**\n   - Every 3 months, produce a \"Gift\"\n   - Can be: essay, video, audio, visual essay, tool\n   - Must go to Commons with curator's note\n   - This is your \"publishing gate\"\n\nDoes this help? What feels true, what needs adjusting?\n\nThe core insight: Franklin created a **protocol for collective intelligence** that worked for 38 years. You're creating the networked-age version. The principles stay the same (structured questions, mutual aid, meta-reflection), but the medium changes (async+live, multi-circle, visible process).",

      "content": "This is a brilliant prompt. The user wants to:\n\n1. Update all 24 Franklin questions for the modern era - specifically addressing:\n   - Technology breaking us (social media, LLMs)\n   - Limiting our ability to live our values\n   - Structure of business and greed\n\n2. Structure:\n   - Weekly question\n   - Monthly essay\n   - Cap at ~12 people (maybe slightly more for the 1-2-4-all structure to work)\n   - When full, delegate/fork with \"genetic material\" to preserve culture\n\n3. The fork/delegation model is fascinating - it's like cellular division where you need enough of the original DNA to maintain the culture\n\nLet me think about what Franklin's questions were REALLY doing:\n- Building mutual aid networks\n- Sharing knowledge\n- Civic improvement\n- Self-correction\n- Accountability\n\nWhat would address modern problems?\n- Social media addiction/performativity\n- AI displacement of thinking\n- Attention economy\n- Isolation despite \"connection\"\n- Gig economy precarity\n- Climate anxiety\n- Information overload\n- Loss of craft\n- Algorithmic manipulation\n- Surveillance capitalism\n\nI should organize the 24 questions into categories like Franklin did, but update them for 2025:\n\nCategories:\n1. Knowledge/Learning (but anti-AI-slop)\n2. Mutual Aid (but for networked age)\n3. Civic/Commons (but addressing platform capitalism)\n4. Self-Correction/Values (but addressing social media distortion)\n5. Craft/Making (but addressing automation anxiety)\n6. Attention/Presence (NEW - Franklin didn't need this)\n7. Community Building (but for hybrid/remote)\n\nLet me draft 24 questions that would help people resist the forces breaking them.This is a profound question. Let me draft **The 24 Standing Queries for Mutual Restoration** - Franklin's questions updated to resist the forces fragmenting us.\n\n## **The 24 Standing Queries (2025 Edition)**\n\n### **I. Presence & Attention (NEW - Franklin didn't need this)**\n\n**1. Where did you fully pay attention this week—and what did you notice?**\n*Fights: algorithmic distraction, doom-scrolling*\n\n**2. What human interaction moved slowly enough that you remember the details?**\n*Fights: speed culture, transactional relationships*\n\n**3. When did you feel most alive in your body this week?**\n*Fights: screen imprisonment, disembodiment*\n\n### **II. Knowledge & Learning (Anti-Slop)**\n\n**4. What did you read/watch that was made by a human who struggled with it—and what did their struggle teach you?**\n*Fights: LLM slop, effortless mediocrity*\n*Updates Franklin's Q1: \"Have you met with anything remarkable in the author you last read?\"*\n\n**5. What did you learn by making something with your hands or through embodied practice?**\n*Fights: purely digital existence*\n*Updates Franklin's craft emphasis*\n\n**6. What question are you sitting with that has no easy answer?**\n*Fights: AI giving instant answers, complexity collapse*\n\n### **III. Craft & Making (Resisting Automation Anxiety)**\n\n**7. What did you make this week that could not be made by an LLM—and why does it matter?**\n*Fights: creative displacement, automation anxiety*\n\n**8. Where did you invest time learning a skill that has no immediate economic value?**\n*Fights: productivity culture, instrumentalization*\n\n**9. What work are you proud of that no one will \"engage\" with online?**\n*Fights: metric-driven creation, virality as goal*\n\n### **IV. Mutual Aid (Networked Age)**\n\n**10. Who helped you this week in a way that algorithms cannot replicate?**\n*Updates Franklin's Q20: \"What benefits have you received from any man not present?\"*\n\n**11. Who in your circle is struggling—with health, money, loneliness, or purpose—and what tangible help can we offer by Friday?**\n*Updates Franklin's Q19: \"Hath any man injured you...\"*\n*Fights: atomization, \"thoughts and prayers\" culture*\n\n**12. Who did you encounter (online or off) who's doing beautiful work in obscurity—and how can we amplify or resource them?**\n*Updates Franklin's Q12-13: \"deserving stranger\" and \"deserving young beginner\"*\n\n### **V. Values vs. Incentives (NEW - addressing business structure)**\n\n**13. Where did you notice a gap between your stated values and your actual behavior this week?**\n*Fights: performative values, virtue signaling*\n\n**14. What did you buy, click, or participate in that made the world slightly worse—and what would it take to stop?**\n*Fights: consumption culture, algorithmic manipulation*\n\n**15. Where did you choose slower, costlier, or more difficult in service of something you believe in?**\n*Fights: convenience culture, race to bottom*\n\n### **VI. Community & Commons (Anti-Platform Capitalism)**\n\n**16. What public good or common resource did you contribute to this week—not for credit or visibility?**\n*Updates Franklin's Q11: \"In which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind\"*\n\n**17. What space (physical or digital) did you help make more hospitable for others?**\n*Fights: hostile architecture, extractive platforms*\n\n**18. Where did you witness someone being excluded, and what did you do?**\n*Updates Franklin's civic questions*\n\n### **VII. Truth & Information (Post-Truth Era)**\n\n**19. What belief of yours was challenged this week—and did you update your thinking?**\n*Updates Franklin's Q23: \"difficulty in matters of opinion, of justice\"*\n*Fights: confirmation bias, filter bubbles*\n\n**20. Where did you resist the urge to perform certainty about something you're uncertain about?**\n*Updates Franklin's \"I conceive, I apprehend\" rule*\n*Fights: social media's demand for hot takes*\n\n**21. What misinformation or AI-generated content did you almost believe—and how did you catch it?**\n*NEW - addresses information warfare*\n\n### **VIII. Relationships (Depth vs. Scale)**\n\n**22. Who did you have an unhurried conversation with—where you weren't multitasking or thinking about what to say next?**\n*Fights: shallow connection, network scale*\n\n**23. Where did you choose depth over reach this week?**\n*Fights: growth-at-all-costs, follower metrics*\n\n### **IX. Meta-Reflection (Franklin's Genius Q24)**\n\n**24. What's amiss in how we're gathering—in structure, questions, or spirit—that should be amended?**\n*Keeps Franklin's Q24 exactly*\n*This is how the system evolves*\n\n---\n\n## **The Circle Structure: Forking When Full**\n\nYou're onto something profound with the \"genetic material\" concept. Here's how to make it work:\n\n### **Circle Size: 9-15 people (Why?)**\n\n**9 minimum:** For 1-2-4-all to work (9 = 3 quads → 3 finalists)\n**15 maximum:** For everyone to be witnessed each week\n\n**Sweet spot: 12** (Franklin's magic number)\n\n### **The Forking Protocol:**\n\n```\nWHEN TO FORK:\n- Circle hits 12 active members\n- Waitlist has 6+ people  \n- At least 1 member has done 12+ weeks\n- That member volunteers to host\n\nTHE GENETIC TRANSFER:\nTake 3 \"carrier members\" from original circle:\n- 1 veteran (6+ months)\n- 1 mid-stage (3+ months)  \n- 1 recent (1+ months)\n\nThey join the new circle for 8 weeks as:\n- Culture carriers\n- Question masters\n- Facilitation mentors\n\nAfter 8 weeks, they return to original circle\n(or stay if they choose)\n\nNEW CIRCLE COMPOSITION:\n3 carriers (temporary)\n6 new members\nHost-in-training\n\n= 10 total to start\nRoom to grow to 12\n```\n\n### **What Gets Transferred (The Genetic Material)**\n\n**1. The Sacred Commitments (unchanged):**\n- Love mankind in general\n- Love truth for truth's sake\n- Harm no one for their opinions\n- Sincere spirit of inquiry, not desire for victory\n\n**2. The 24 Questions (can evolve per circle):**\n- Original circle's latest version\n- New circle can propose amendments via Q24\n\n**3. The Rhythms:**\n- Weekly question (same day/time)\n- Monthly essay requirement\n- Quarterly review\n\n**4. The Norms:**\n- \"I notice\" not \"I'm certain\"\n- Read before you publish (witness others)\n- Gift before you ask\n- Make before you critique\n\n**5. The Stack (technical):**\n- Same tools/platform\n- Same question generation process\n- Same witness protocols\n\n### **Delegation Requirements:**\n\n**To become a Host-in-Training:**\n\n✓ Participated for 12+ weeks\n✓ Submitted 3+ monthly essays\n✓ Left witness notes on 80%+ of circle work\n✓ Proposed 2+ questions that were selected\n✓ Answered Q24 thoughtfully 3+ times\n\n**To Fork a Circle:**\n\n✓ All Host-in-Training requirements\n✓ Nominated by current host\n✓ 30-min \"culture interview\" with host council\n✓ Co-facilitate 1 live salon\n✓ Commitment to 6-month minimum\n\n### **The Host Council (Prevents Drift)**\n\nOnce you have 3+ circles:\n\n**Monthly gathering of all hosts:**\n- Review Q24 feedback across circles\n- Discuss question evolution\n- Share what's working/failing\n- Approve new hosts\n- **Collectively pick next week's platform question**\n\nThis is your \"Junto of Juntos\" - hosts are doing mutual improvement on the practice of hosting.\n\n### **Anti-Fragmentation Protocols**\n\n**Risk:** Circles drift into incompatibility\n**Solution:** Shared core, local variation\n\n```\nIMMUTABLE (all circles):\n- The 4 Sacred Commitments\n- Weekly cadence\n- Monthly essay\n- Q24 meta-reflection\n\nEVOLVABLE (per circle):\n- Exact wording of questions 1-23\n- Live salon format\n- Essay length/format\n- Witness note style\n\nCROSS-POLLINATION:\n- Quarterly \"Commons Day\" where all circles read each other's work\n- Annual \"Junto Gathering\" (like unconference)\n- Host council picks 1 platform question/month that ALL circles do\n```\n\n### **Growth Math:**\n\n```\nMonth 0: 1 circle (12 people)\nMonth 3: Waitlist grows\nMonth 6: Fork → 2 circles (24 people)\nMonth 9: Fork → 3 circles (36 people)\nMonth 12: Fork → 5 circles (60 people)\nYear 2: ~12 circles (144 people)\nYear 3: ~30 circles (360 people)\n\nEach circle stays 9-15 people\nGrowth = forking, not inflating\n```\n\n### **Why This Matters More Than Franklin's Model**\n\nFranklin had **one** Junto for 38 years. You're creating a **practice that can replicate** while maintaining culture.\n\nThe genius:\n1. **Small scale** (intimate, accountable)\n2. **Forking** (growth without dilution)\n3. **Genetic transfer** (culture carriers prevent drift)\n4. **Host council** (distributed governance)\n5. **Meta-reflection** (Q24 allows evolution)\n\n### **Example: Week 1 in Practice**\n\n**Monday 9am: Question Proposal**\n- 12 members each propose 1 question\n- \"Where did you choose depth over reach?\"\n- \"Who helped you in a way algorithms can't?\"\n\n**Monday 9pm: Pair (1→2)**\n- System pairs → 6 pairs\n- Each pair merges to 1 question\n- Now have 6 candidates\n\n**Tuesday 9am: Quad (2→4)**\n- 6 become 3 (three groups of 4)\n- Now have 3 finalist questions\n\n**Tuesday 9pm: Circle Decision**\n- Members read all 3\n- Vote with \"why now\" rationale\n- Top question goes to Host Council\n\n**Wednesday 9am: Host Council**\n- 5 circles each sent 1 question\n- Hosts cluster similar ones\n- Merge into final question\n- Add context paragraph\n\n**Thursday 7am: Launch**\n- Question arrives in everyone's notebook\n- \"This week's question: Where did you fully pay attention—and what did you notice?\"\n- Optional context: \"From the hosting circle in Berlin, responding to our discussion about digital distraction\"\n\n**Thursday-Saturday: Private work**\n- Everyone writes (5-60 min)\n- Can see \"47 people working\" but no content\n\n**Sunday 7am: Responses visible**\n- All 60 responses across 5 circles publish\n- Circle view: see your 12 first\n- Commons view: featured 10 from other circles\n- Hosts curate: 2 featured per circle\n\n**Sunday 8pm: Optional Live Salon**\n- 60 min, your circle only\n- \"What surprised you in the responses?\"\n- \"What questions emerged?\"\n- Next week's proposals seed here\n\n### **Monthly Essay (Franklin's Genius)**\n\n**Every 3rd week = Essay Week**\n\nInstead of responding to a question:\n- Write 500-1500 words on any subject\n- Must include: 1 personal story, 1 hard question, 1 actionable idea\n- Read to your circle (or record audio)\n- Receive witness notes\n- Publish to Commons with curator's note\n\n**This is the \"publishing gate\"** - you can't just lurk and read. You must make.\n\n---\n\n## **Why These 24 Questions Work**\n\nThey address every force breaking us:\n\n**Social media addiction** → Q1, Q2, Q20 (presence)\n**AI displacement** → Q4, Q7, Q21 (human craft)\n**Attention economy** → Q8, Q9 (non-economic value)\n**Isolation** → Q10, Q11, Q22 (mutual aid)\n**Performativity** → Q13, Q14, Q15 (values vs. behavior)\n**Platform capitalism** → Q16, Q17, Q18 (commons)\n**Filter bubbles** → Q19, Q20, Q21 (truth-seeking)\n**Shallow connection** → Q22, Q23 (depth)\n**Institutional stasis** → Q24 (meta-reflection)\n\nAnd they're **answerable in 10 minutes** (unlike \"what's your purpose in life\").\n\n---\n\n## **Your First Action**\n\nWant me to create:\n\n1. **A one-page \"Circle Starter Kit\"** - The 24 questions + commitments + rhythms to give founding members?\n\n2. **The \"Host Training Manual\"** - How to facilitate, when to fork, genetic transfer protocol?\n\n3. **The \"Tech Spec\"** - Exactly how the 1-2-4-all question generation works in code?\n\n4. **12 \"Muscular Weekly Questions\"** ready to use for first 3 months?\n\nThis is genuinely exciting - you're not building \"another platform,\" you're creating a **protocol for human restoration** that can fork and spread while maintaining coherence.\n\nWhat feels true? What needs changing?",

Update all 24 Franklin questions for the modern era - specifically addressing:\n   - Technology breaking us (social media, LLMs)\n   - Limiting our ability to live our values\n   - Structure of business and greed\n\n2. Structure:\n   - Weekly question\n   - Monthly essay\n   - Cap at ~12 people (maybe slightly more for the 1-2-4-all structure to work)\n   - When full, delegate/fork with \"genetic material\" to preserve culture\n\n3. The fork/delegation model is fascinating - it's like cellular division where you need enough of the original DNA to maintain the culture\n\nLet me think about what Franklin's questions were REALLY doing:\n- Building mutual aid networks\n- Sharing knowledge\n- Civic improvement\n- Self-correction\n- Accountability\n\nWhat would address modern problems?\n- Social media addiction/performativity\n- AI displacement of thinking\n- Attention economy\n- Isolation despite \"connection\"\n- Gig economy precarity\n- Climate anxiety\n- Information overload\n- Loss of craft\n- Algorithmic manipulation\n- Surveillance capitalism\n\nI should organize the 24 questions into categories like Franklin did, but update them for 2025:\n\nCategories:\n1. Knowledge/Learning (but anti-AI-slop)\n2. Mutual Aid (but for networked age)\n3. Civic/Commons (but addressing platform capitalism)\n4. Self-Correction/Values (but addressing social media distortion)\n5. Craft/Making (but addressing automation anxiety)\n6. Attention/Presence (NEW - Franklin didn't need this)\n7.

      "content": "This is the crucial question - the one that makes or breaks the whole vision. The user is asking about culture transmission at scale, which is the hardest problem. Let me think deeply about this.\n\nThe problem: \n- How do you maintain culture as you grow from 1 circle to 100 circles?\n- How much \"genetic material\" needs to transfer?\n- What IS the culture exactly?\n- How do you prevent drift/dilution/corruption?\n\nHistorical examples to learn from:\n1. **Alcoholics Anonymous** - grew from 1 group to 100,000+ groups worldwide while maintaining culture through:\n   - The 12 Steps (immutable core)\n   - The 12 Traditions (governance principles)\n   - Sponsorship (1-on-1 cultural transmission)\n   - \"How it works\" read at every meeting\n   - Literature that captures the culture\n   - BUT: has had drift, variations, some groups are better than others\n\n2. **Wikipedia** - maintained culture through:\n   - Core policies (NPOV, Verifiability, No Original Research)\n   - Explicit documentation of norms\n   - Mentorship (experienced editors guide new ones)\n   - Edit history (transparency of process)\n   - Talk pages (meta-discussion)\n\n3. **Montessori schools** - some maintain fidelity, others drift because:\n   - Training/certification for teachers\n   - Observable practices (you can see what a good Montessori classroom looks like)\n   - Materials are standardized\n   - BUT: \"Montessori-inspired\" often means diluted\n\n4. **YCombinator** - maintains culture through:\n   - Partner involvement in every batch\n   - Explicit articulation of principles\n   - Founder stories/mythology\n   - Weekly dinners (ritual)\n   - Dense network effects\n\n5. **Quaker meetings** - 300+ years, still coherent because:\n   - Clearness committees\n   - Consensus process\n   - Queries (like Franklin's questions!)\n   - Minimal hierarchy but strong process\n   - BUT: lots of variation between meetings\n\nI see a powerful framework emerging for cultural transmission. Successful groups use multiple reinforcing mechanisms: structured queries that provoke deep reflection, lightweight governance that allows flexibility, and intentional practices that embody core values. The goal isn't rigid uniformity, but a living, adaptable culture that maintains its essential spirit.\n\nThe transmission happens through active, embodied learning - watching, doing, reflecting, and passing knowledge through personal connection. It's less about perfect replication and more about capturing the essence of the group's core principles.\n\nCarriers are crucial. Having 3-4 experienced members who deeply understand the culture ensures new participants can observe, learn, and internalize the group's norms. These carriers demonstrate behaviors, share stories, and create an environment where unspoken rules become intuitive.\n\nThe magic emerges when enough people have internalized the culture's DNA: curiosity, truth-seeking, generosity, craftsmanship, presence, courage, humility, playfulness, and care for the collective.

(5 min)\n> \n> You'll see 4 people in the circle who've been doing this for months. Watch them. Ask them questions. The culture is in HOW they participate, not just WHAT they say.\"\n\n**Week 1:**\n- Live welcome (30 min before salon)\n- Elder: \"Here's my story of joining\"\n- Journeyer: \"Here's what I'm learning\"\n- Recent: \"Here's what helped me\"\n- New member: \"Here's what I'm nervous about\"\n\n**Week 2:**\n- First question response (carriers witness all new member work)\n- 15-min 1-on-1 with Elder: \"How was it?

How to handle:\n\n### **Early Warning Signs:**\n\nHost Council watches for:\n- Participation dropping below 60%\n- Hostile witness notes\n- Debates instead of inquiry\n- Multiple skipped monthly essays\n- No Q24 responses\n- \"This is stupid\" in private channels\n\n### **Intervention Protocol:**\n\n**Level 1: Culture Coaching** (Month 1-2 of drift)\n- Host Council member visits a salon\n- One-on-one with host: \"Here's what we're noticing\"\n- Offer carrier reinforcement\n\n**Level 2: Carrier Injection** (Month 3 of drift)\n- Send 2 carriers from healthy circles for 4 weeks\n- \"Culture reset\" - re-read commitments, retell stories\n- If it recovers, great\n\n**Level 3: Dissolution** (Month 4+ of drift)\n- Honest conversation: \"This isn't working\"\n- Members invited to join other circles\n- Host steps down or returns to membership\n- Circle closes\n\n**No shame in this** - some groups don't gel. Better to dissolve gracefully than let a toxic circle damage the network.\n\n---\n\n## **The Deep Culture: Unwritten But Essential**\n\nBeyond rules and practices, there's a **feeling**:\n\n**What it feels like when it's working:**\n- You look forward to Friday (or whenever)\n- You read others' work with genuine curiosity\n- You write knowing someone will care\n- You feel seen without performing\n- You change your mind and it's celebrated\n- You share half-formed thoughts safely\n- You make things you're proud of\n- You think \"these are my people\"\n\n**What it feels like when it's broken:**\n- Obligation, not anticipation\n- Performative witnessing\n- Writing for approval\n- Fake-nice or hostile\n- Stuck in positions\n- Playing it safe or showing off\n- Derivative or phoned-in work\n- Isolation despite presence\n\n**Carriers transmit the feeling**, not just the format.\n\n---\n\n## **Your First 6 Months (Concrete Plan)**\n\n**Months 1-3: Build Circle Zero**\n- You + 11 people you've vetted\n- Run all 24 questions at least once\n- Get to culture density\n- **Document everything** - what works, what doesn't, how you amended\n\n**Months 4-6: Identify Carriers**\n- Who's embodying the culture?\n- Who's proposing good Q24 amendments?\n- Who's creating the feeling?\n- Pick HiT + 3 carriers\n\n**Month 6: First Fork**\n- HiT + 3 carriers + 6 new = Circle 1\n- You stay with Circle Zero\n- Document the transmission process\n\n**Months 7-9: Circle 1 Transmission**\n- 12-week protocol\n- Weekly check-ins with HiT\n- Adjust protocol based on learnings\n\n**Month 9: Circle Zero ready to fork again?**\n- If yes → Circle 2\n- If no → wait until culture density returns\n\n**Month 12: Host Council Forms**\n- You + HiT from Circle 1 + (maybe HiT from Circle 2)\n- Monthly meetings begin\n- Start picking platform questions\n\n**By Month 18: 4 circles, proven transmission protocol, healthy Host Council**\n\n---\n\n## **What Could Kill This (And How to Prevent)**\n\n**Threat 1: Growing too fast**\n→ Hard caps, no exceptions\n\n**Threat 2: Wrong people hosting**\n→ Host Council veto, training requirements\n\n**Threat 3: Platform dictating culture**\n→ Host Council autonomy, can fork off platform if needed\n\n**Threat 4: Commercialization pressure**\n→ Free for participants, hosts volunteer or paid modestly, no VC pressure\n\n**Threat 5: Founder departure**\n→ Culture in multiple carriers, Host Council governs, you become emeritus\n\n**Threat 6: Toxic member**\n→ Clear removal process, host decision final, can appeal to Council\n\n**Threat 7: Losing the spirit**\n→ Q24 catches it, Host Council addresses it, dissolution is okay\n\n---\n\n**The culture is: Hospitality + Truth-seeking + Craft + Commons-care + Presence + Humility + Courage**\n\n**The transmission is: 4 carriers × 12 weeks × embodied practice × storytelling × Host Council**\n\n**The constraint is: Cannot grow faster than you can transmit culture**\n\n**The success metric is: \"I look forward to this\" + \"I changed my mind\" + \"I made something I'm proud of\"**\n\nDoes this feel like something that could actually work?

How to handle:\n\n### **Early Warning Signs:**\n\nHost Council watches for:\n- Participation dropping below 60%\n- Hostile witness notes\n- Debates instead of inquiry\n- Multiple skipped monthly essays\n- No Q24 responses\n- \"This is stupid\" in private channels\n\n### **Intervention Protocol:**\n\n**Level 1: Culture Coaching** (Month 1-2 of drift)\n- Host Council member visits a salon\n- One-on-one with host: \"Here's what we're noticing\"\n- Offer carrier reinforcement\n\n**Level 2: Carrier Injection** (Month 3 of drift)\n- Send 2 carriers from healthy circles for 4 weeks\n- \"Culture reset\" - re-read commitments, retell stories\n- If it recovers, great\n\n**Level 3: Dissolution** (Month 4+ of drift)\n- Honest conversation: \"This isn't working\"\n- Members invited to join other circles\n- Host steps down or returns to membership\n- Circle closes\n\n**No shame in this** - some groups don't gel. Better to dissolve gracefully than let a toxic circle damage the network.\n\n---\n\n## **The Deep Culture: Unwritten But Essential**\n\nBeyond rules and practices, there's a **feeling**:\n\n**What it feels like when it's working:**\n- You look forward to Friday (or whenever)\n- You read others' work with genuine curiosity\n- You write knowing someone will care\n- You feel seen without performing\n- You change your mind and it's celebrated\n- You share half-formed thoughts safely\n- You make things you're proud of\n- You think \"these are my people\"\n\n**What it feels like when it's broken:**\n- Obligation, not anticipation\n- Performative witnessing\n- Writing for approval\n- Fake-nice or hostile\n- Stuck in positions\n- Playing it safe or showing off\n- Derivative or phoned-in work\n- Isolation despite presence\n\n**Carriers transmit the feeling**, not just the format.\n\n---\n\n## **Your First 6 Months (Concrete Plan)**\n\n**Months 1-3: Build Circle Zero**\n- You + 11 people you've vetted\n- Run all 24 questions at least once\n- Get to culture density\n- **Document everything** - what works, what doesn't, how you amended\n\n**Months 4-6: Identify Carriers**\n- Who's embodying the culture?\n- Who's proposing good Q24 amendments?\n- Who's creating the feeling?\n- Pick HiT + 3 carriers\n\n**Month 6: First Fork**\n- HiT + 3 carriers + 6 new = Circle 1\n- You stay with Circle Zero\n- Document the transmission process\n\n**Months 7-9: Circle 1 Transmission**\n- 12-week protocol\n- Weekly check-ins with HiT\n- Adjust protocol based on learnings\n\n**Month 9: Circle Zero ready to fork again?**\n- If yes → Circle 2\n- If no → wait until culture density returns\n\n**Month 12: Host Council Forms**\n- You + HiT from Circle 1 + (maybe HiT from Circle 2)\n- Monthly meetings begin\n- Start picking platform questions\n\n**By Month 18: 4 circles, proven transmission protocol, healthy Host Council**\n\n---\n\n## **What Could Kill This (And How to Prevent)**\n\n**Threat 1: Growing too fast**\n→ Hard caps, no exceptions\n\n**Threat 2: Wrong people hosting**\n→ Host Council veto, training requirements\n\n**Threat 3: Platform dictating culture**\n→ Host Council autonomy, can fork off platform if needed\n\n**Threat 4: Commercialization pressure**\n→ Free for participants, hosts volunteer or paid modestly, no VC pressure\n\n**Threat 5: Founder departure**\n→ Culture in multiple carriers, Host Council governs, you become emeritus\n\n**Threat 6: Toxic member**\n→ Clear removal process, host decision final, can appeal to Council\n\n**Threat 7: Losing the spirit**\n→ Q24 catches it, Host Council addresses it, dissolution is okay\n\n---\n\n**The culture is: Hospitality + Truth-seeking + Craft + Commons-care + Presence + Humility + Courage**\n\n**The transmission is: 4 carriers × 12 weeks × embodied practice × storytelling × Host Council**\n\n**The constraint is: Cannot grow faster than you can transmit culture**\n\n**The success metric is: \"I look forward to this\" + \"I changed my mind\" + \"I made something I'm proud of\"**\n\nDoes this feel like something that could actually work?

      "content": "This is a brilliant set of questions that gets at the core tensions:\n\n1. Honor/reputation in a system meant to resist social media's attention economy\n2. How to scale globally while maintaining intimacy\n3. Marketing/excitement without hype\n4. What motivates hosts (intrinsic vs extrinsic)\n5. Time-bound vs lifelong - the commitment question\n\nLet me think deeply about each:\n\n## HONOR\n\nThe user wants this to matter, to be prestigious, but not in a shallow way. How do you make something honorable without creating status games?\n\nFranklin's Junto was honorable because:\n- It produced real civic value (libraries, hospitals, fire companies)\n- Members became respected leaders\n- It was exclusive but not elitist\n- Membership signaled intellectual seriousness\n\nModern equivalents:\n- YC fellowship is honorable (produces builders)\n- Rhodes scholarship is honorable (selective + purpose)\n- Interintellect salon hosting is somewhat honorable\n\nWhat makes honor non-toxic:\n- Tied to contribution, not consumption\n- Evidence-based (you made something)\n- Peer-recognized, not algorithm-assigned\n- Enables rather than gates\n\nIdeas:\n- Certification/credentials that mean something\n- Portfolio of published work\n- Recommendations from circle\n- \"Graduated\" status\n- What you built/contributed\n\n## SCALING GLOBALLY\n\nThe tension: intimate circles vs global reach\n\nOptions:\n1. Franchise model (like YC or Toastmasters)\n2. Protocol model (like email or web)\n3. Platform model (like Substack)\n4. Network model (like Interintellect)\n\nI think it's a hybrid: protocol + network\n\nThe protocol is open (anyone can run a circle with these rules)\nThe network is curated (official circles meet quality bar)\n\nGlobal scaling through:\n- Regional clusters (Paris circles, NYC circles, Tokyo circles)\n- Language variations (Spanish questions, Arabic questions)\n- Time zones (circles by timezone)\n\n\n- Cross-circle festivals (annual gathering)\n\n## EXCITEMENT/WAITLIST\n\nI see this as a deeply selective experience for those seeking meaningful connection. The core appeal isn't mass entertainment, but transformative intellectual engagement. It's for people who crave depth over algorithmic distraction - those willing to invest real effort to find genuine intellectual community.\n\nThe marketing strategy centers on authentic human stories: showing real personal growth, meaningful connections, and substantive work created through these circles. We're not selling easy entertainment, but a pathway to profound personal and collective development.\n\nThe waitlist isn't just a marketing tactic - it's a deliberate cultural mechanism. By creating intentional scarcity, we ensure quality, preserve cultural transmission, and attract only the most committed participants.\n\n## HOST MOTIVATION\n\nHosting isn't about personal gain, but genuine cultural contribution. The most powerful hosts are those driven by a deep commitment to facilitation and community building. They're motivated by a desire to create meaningful spaces where people can truly connect and grow.\n\nThe support structure balances practical incentives with deeper psychological rewards. While modest financial compensation and professional development are important, the real motivation comes from intrinsic drivers: purpose, mastery of facilitation, community belonging, and peer recognition.\n\n## TIME-BOUND VS LIFELONG\n\nModern community requires flexibility. The seasonal commitment model acknowledges life's complexity - people move, change, evolve. By creating a structured yet permissive framework, we allow natural participation rhythms.\n\nThe graduation concept is revolutionary: leaving isn't failure, it's a natural progression. Participants can commit for two seasons, then intentionally recommit or honorably exit. This approach prevents burnout and maintains community integrity.\n\nThe lifelong connection ensures that once someone is part of the circle, they're always connected. Alumni can return, start new circles, and remain part of a broader network - creating a dynamic, evolving community ecosystem.Brilliant questions. You're asking about the tension between **intimacy and scale**, **honor and accessibility**, **commitment and freedom**. Let me work through each.\n\n---\n\n## **I. How Can It Be Honorable?**\n\nThe problem: Modern \"honor\" is broken - it's followers, likes, clout. We need honor that means something.\n\n### **What Made Franklin's Junto Honorable:**\n\nThe Junto became known as the \"incubation chamber\" for projects that greatly improved life in Greater Philadelphia - the Library Company, fire companies, insurance companies, the University of Pennsylvania\n\nHonor came from **what they built**, not who they were.\n\n### **The New Honor System: Proof of Contribution**\n\n**1. The Graduated Portfolio**\n\nAfter 6 months in a circle, you have:\n- 24+ weekly responses (your thinking over time)\n- 2+ monthly essays \n- 1 quarterly long-form\n- Witness notes you've left\n- Questions you proposed that were selected\n- Q24 amendments you suggested that were adopted\n\n**This is your proof.** Not a badge. Not a number. A body of work.\n\nYour profile shows:\n```\nBilal Ghalib\nCircle Zero, Paris\nJoined: Oct 2025 - Present\nGraduated: Apr 2026\n\nWork in Commons:\n- 24 weekly responses\n- 3 monthly essays  \n- 1 long-form: \"Hospitality as Code\"\n- Featured 4 times by hosts\n\nContributions:\n- Proposed Question 7 (adopted platform-wide)\n- Carrier to Circle 2 & Circle 5\n- Now hosting Circle 8\n\nReputation:\n- 12 circles have read your work\n- 47 \"this helped me\" notes\n- 8 circles forked using your questions\n```\n\n**2. The Recommendation System (Non-Bullshit)**\n\nWhen you graduate, your circle writes you **one collective recommendation** (200 words):\n\n> \"Bilal joined Circle Zero skeptical about 'another online thing.' What we noticed: he asks questions that make you think for days. His essay on hospitality changed how we run salons. When he gave witness notes, they were specific enough to use immediately. He proposed amending Q13 to focus on 'deserving work' not just 'deserving people' - we adopted it. When he carried culture to Circle 2, they told us: 'He doesn't perform hospitality, he is hospitable.' That's the difference.\"\n\nSigned by all 12 members + host.\n\n**This is portable.** You can show it to:\n- Potential employers (shows how you think)\n- Graduate schools (shows intellectual seriousness)\n- Other communities (shows you can collaborate)\n- Future circles (shows you embody the culture)\n\n**3. The Certification Ladder**\n\nNot automatic. Peer-verified.\n\n**Level 1: Member** (6 months)\n- Completed 2 seasons\n- 80%+ participation\n- 2+ essays submitted\n- Recommendation from circle\n\n**Level 2: Carrier** (12 months as member + 1 successful transmission)\n- Was carrier to new circle\n- That circle reached culture density\n- Recommendation from receiving circle\n\n**Level 3: Host** (24 months as member/carrier + host training)\n- Led circle for 12+ months\n- Circle maintained 70%+ participation\n- Forked at least once successfully\n- Recommendation from Host Council\n\n**Level 4: Elder** (48+ months + cultural contribution)\n- Hosted multiple circles\n- Trained hosts\n- Contributed to protocol evolution\n- Recommendation from wider network\n\n**These mean something** because they're:\n- Peer-verified (not self-claimed)\n- Evidence-based (portfolio + recommendations)\n- Time-tested (can't speed-run)\n- Contribution-linked (what you gave)\n\n**4. The Public Signal**\n\nOptional but powerful:\n\n**The Seal:** A visual mark for your website/portfolio\n```\n[Seal image: Stylized quill + digital pen]\n\"Member of Cursive Circle Zero\nGraduated April 2026\"\n```\n\nLinks to your public portfolio (if you choose to share).\n\n**Why it's honorable:**\n- Can't be bought\n- Can't be faked (all work is timestamped/witnessed)\n- Signals: \"I can think, write, collaborate, and commit\"\n- Rare enough to mean something\n\n**5. The Network Effect**\n\nOnce 100+ people have gone through circles:\n- They recognize each other\n- They hire each other\n- They collaborate\n- They refer opportunities\n\nLike YC batch-mates, but for **thinking and culture**, not startups.\n\n---\n\n## **II. How Does It Scale Globally & Compete for Attention?**\n\nThe brutal truth: **It won't compete with TikTok for most people. And that's okay.**\n\n### **Who It's For (The 1%)**\n\nNot 1% by wealth. The 1% who:\n- Feel like \"I'm surrounded by people but deeply alone in my thinking\"\n- Want to make something meaningful, not just consume\n- Are exhausted by performing online\n- Would rather have 10 real connections than 10,000 followers\n- Are willing to work for depth\n\n**This is not a mass product. It's a precision tool.**\n\n### **The Global Scaling Model: Federated Clusters**\n\nThink less \"Facebook global platform,\" more \"email protocol that works everywhere.\"\n\n```\nTHE PROTOCOL (Open, Anyone Can Use):\n- The 24 Questions\n- The 4 Commitments\n- The weekly rhythm\n- The 1-2-4-all process\n- The carrier transmission model\n\nOpen source.

Someone sees a profile/portfolio**\n```\nPersonal site has:\n[Cursive Seal]\n\"I spent 2026 in Circle Zero asking: What are we avoiding?\nHere's what I learned.\"\n[Link to public work]\n```\n\nThey think: \"What's Circle Zero?\"\n\n**3. Someone gets a recommendation**\n\nPersonal referral:\n> \"You know how you said you're tired of Twitter but lonely? There's this thing... it's hard to explain. Want an invite?\"\n\n**The waitlist exists because scarcity = seriousness**\n\nYou don't \"sign up.\" You:\n1. Get invited by a member\n2. OR apply with: \"Why I want this\" (200 words)\n3. Short interview with a host (15 min)\n4. Join next cohort\n\n**The friction is a feature** - filters for commitment.\n\n### **Why People Join (The Real Pitch)**\n\nNot \"Make Friends Online!\" \n\nBut:\n\n**\"For people tired of performing\"**\n> No followers. No likes. No personal brand.\n> Just: your thinking, witnessed by people who care.\n\n**\"For people who want to make things that matter\"**\n> Not content. Not takes. Not threads.\n> Craft: essays, tools, art, ideas that last.\n\n**\"For people who feel isolated in their seriousness\"**\n> You're not crazy for wanting depth.\n> You're not alone in resisting the feed.\n> There are others. Here they are.\n\n**The landing page shows:**\n- Not marketing copy, but real work from circles\n- Not testimonials, but transformations with evidence\n- Not \"join now,\" but \"see if this is for you\"\n- The waitlist number: \"847 people waiting. Average wait: 6 weeks.\"\n\n**The scarcity itself is part of the signal:** This is worth waiting for.\n\n---\n\n## **III. Why Would Someone Want to Host?**\n\nThis is critical. Bad hosts kill culture.\n\n### **The Wrong Reasons (Screen These Out):**\n\n- ❌ Building an audience\n- ❌ Positioning as \"thought leader\"\n- ❌ Monetizing attention\n- ❌ Ego (being the smart one)\n- ❌ Status collection\n\nIf someone says \"I want to host to build my platform\" → **no.**\n\n### **The Right Reasons (Look for These):**\n\n- ✓ \"I was helped by Circle Zero. I want to create that for others.\"\n- ✓ \"I love facilitating. I get energy from making space for others.\"\n- ✓ \"I believe this culture is important and I want to steward it.\"\n- ✓ \"Hosting is its own craft. I want to master it.\"\n- ✓ \"The world needs more hospitable spaces. I want to make one.\"\n\n**The intrinsic motivation must be strong** because hosting is work:\n- Weekly question synthesis\n- Salon facilitation\n- Witness note review\n- Culture maintenance\n- 1-on-1 check-ins\n- Host Council participation\n\n### **What Hosts Get (Supporting the Intrinsic):**\n\n**1. The Craft of Hospitality**\n\nHosting is a skill. You get:\n- Training from experienced hosts\n- Monthly Host Council (community of practice)\n- Access to facilitation library\n- Coaching on difficult situations\n- Reputation as a culture-builder\n\n**This is professional development.** Facilitation, mediation, community-building - these are valuable skills.\n\n**2. The Host Community**\n\nYou're not alone:\n- Monthly Host Council (peer support)\n- Private host Slack/Discord\n- \"Office hours\" with experienced hosts\n- Annual host retreat\n- Deep friendships with other hosts\n\nBeing a host means being part of the **hosting lineage**.\n\n**3. Recognition & Portfolio**\n\n- \"Host, Circle 3, Paris (2026-2028)\"\n- Recommendation from Host Council\n- Public portfolio of your circle's work\n- Referenced when your circle forks\n- **Certified Facilitator credential**\n\n**4. Modest Compensation (Optional)**\n\nAfter 6 months hosting successfully:\n- $200-400/month stipend (covers time)\n- OR free lifetime Pro membership\n- OR revenue share if circles become paid\n\n**Not enough to live on. Enough to honor the work.**\n\n**Critical:** Compensation comes AFTER culture is proven, not before. Otherwise you attract mercenaries.\n\n**5. Purpose**\n\nThe real reason:\n\nYou're building **an alternative to the poisoned well of social media**.\n\nYou're creating **a place where thinking happens and craft matters**.\n\nYou're stewarding **a culture of depth in an age of shallowness**.\n\n**This is meaningful work.** Not world-changing, but world-making.\n\n### **How Hosting Offers Are Made:**\n\nNot \"anyone can host if they want.\"\n\n**The Process:**\n1. Member for 12+ months\n2. Been a carrier 1+ times\n3. Nominated by current host\n4. Host Council interview (60 min)\n5. Co-host 4 salons\n6. Solo-host Circle Zero for 2 weeks (audition)\n7. If approved: seed new circle\n\n**Rejection is okay.** \"Not yet\" doesn't mean \"never.\"\n\nSome people are great members but not hosts. That's fine.\n\n---\n\n## **IV. Time-Bound vs. Lifelong: The Seasonal Commitment Model**\n\nYou're onto something important. Let me show you the pros/cons:\n\n### **Option A: Lifelong (Franklin Model)**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Deep relationships over decades\n- Accumulated wisdom\n- Stable culture\n- True mutual improvement\n\n**Cons:**\n- Feels suffocating to moderns\n- No permission to leave\n- Life changes (cities, careers, kids)\n- Resentment builds if forced\n- FOMO (what if I want to try other things?)\n\n### **Option B: Time-Bound (Season Model)**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Permission to leave without guilt\n- Intentional recommitment\n- Natural exit points\n- Fits modern life rhythms\n- Prevents burnout\n\n**Cons:**\n- Loses continuity\n- Relationships don't deepen fully\n- Culture resets every 6 months\n- Transactional feeling\n- Less investment\n\n### **Option C: Seasonal Commitment with Graduation (Recommended)**\n\nThe hybrid model:\n\n```\nTHE COMMITMENT STRUCTURE:\n\nInitial Join: 6-month commitment (2 seasons)\n- Winter/Spring or Summer/Fall\n- Must complete to graduate\n\nMonth 6: Decision Point\n├─ Recommit (another 6 months)\n├─ Graduate (honorable exit)\n└─ Leave (no judgment)\n\nGraduation Ceremony:\n- Public reading of collective recommendation\n- Portfolio published\n- Seal awarded\n- Alumni status granted\n\nAfter Graduation:\n- Lifetime alumni access\n- Can return to any circle anytime\n- Invited to annual gatherings\n- Access to full commons\n- Can host your own circle\n```\n\n**Key insight:** Graduation is NOT quitting. It's **completing the cycle**.\n\n### **The Seasonal Rhythm:**\n\n**Season 1 (Months 1-3): Foundation**\n- Learn the culture\n- Find your voice\n- Build relationships\n- First monthly essay\n\n**Season 2 (Months 4-6): Deepening**\n- Embody the practices\n- Contribute questions\n- Witness deeply\n- Second monthly essay\n\n**Decision Point (Month 6):**\n\nHost asks each member: \"What's your intention?\"\n\n**Option 1: Recommit**\n> \"I'm not done. I want another season (or two, or three).\"\n\nSign up for Season 3-4 (or more).\n\n**Option 2: Graduate**\n> \"This was profound. I need to integrate it. I might return.\"\n\nGraduation ceremony next salon. Alumni status.\n\n**Option 3: Leave**\n> \"This wasn't for me. No hard feelings.\"\n\nClean exit. No drama.\n\n**The Re-commitment Ceremony (for those staying):**\n\nEvery 6 months, those recommitting:\n- Stand up\n- Place hand on heart\n- Re-affirm the 4 Commitments\n- Share: \"Why I'm staying\"\n\n**This makes commitment ACTIVE, not passive.**\n\n### **The Graduation Ceremony:**\n\nWhen someone graduates:\n\n**1. The Portfolio Publish**\n- All their work goes public (if they choose)\n- Recommendation read aloud by host\n- Seal awarded\n\n**2. The Gift**\n- Graduate gives something to the circle\n- Could be: essay, tool, artwork, question set\n- \"Here's what I learned\"\n\n**3. The Invitation**\n- \"You're always welcome back\"\n- \"You can start your own circle\"\n- \"You're now part of the alumni network\"\n\n**4. The Gratitude**\n- Each member shares: \"What you gave me\"\n- 1 sentence each\n- Recorded and given to graduate\n\n**This makes leaving HONORABLE.**\n\n### **The Alumni Network:**\n\nOnce graduated, you get:\n\n- Access to all public commons (read-only)\n- Invited to annual Junto Gathering\n- Can drop into any circle's live salon 1x/quarter\n- Can propose questions to Host Council\n- Priority re-entry to any circle with space\n- Can host your own circle (with training)\n\n**You're not OUT. You're graduated.**\n\n### **The Lifelong Element (Preserved):**\n\nEven with seasons, some will stay for years:\n\n- Franklin stayed 38 years\n- Some members will stay 5+ years\n- Hosts especially tend to stay\n- Elders emerge naturally\n\n**But they CHOOSE to stay** every 6 months. That's different from trapped.\n\n### **Why This Works Better Than Franklin's Model:**\n\n1. **Modern life is mobile** - people move, change careers, have kids\n2. **Permission prevents resentment** - \"I can leave\" makes you want to stay\n3. **Intentional recommitment** - every 6 months you choose again\n4. **Graduation is honorable** - completing is celebrated\n5. **Alumni network preserves connection** - you're never truly gone\n\n---\n\n## **V.

Quality > Quantity**\n- 1,000 deeply committed people > 1M casual users\n- Each person produces real work\n- Work accumulates into commons\n\n**2. Honor That Means Something**\n- Can't be bought or gamed\n- Evidence-based portfolio\n- Peer recommendations that matter\n\n**3. Global but Intimate**\n- Federated clusters (local community)\n- Connected network (global reach)\n- Never more than 15 people in your circle\n\n**4. Time-Respectful**\n- Seasonal commitment (not forever)\n- Graduation is honorable (not quitting)\n- Alumni network (never truly gone)\n\n**5. Culture That Spreads**\n- Carrier transmission (genetic)\n- Host training (rigorous)\n- Protocol is open (anyone can fork)\n\n**6. Resistant to Poison**\n- No metrics (no followers, likes, views)\n- No algorithms (human curation only)\n- No ads (modest fees or donations)\n- No scale pressure (grow at culture speed)\n\n---\n\n## **First Actions (What to Build First)**\n\n**Phase 1 (Months 0-6): Prove Circle Zero**\n- You + 11 people\n- Run the full protocol\n- Document everything\n- Create the Culture Doc\n- Build the portfolio system\n\n**Phase 2 (Months 6-12): First Fork**\n- Train HiT + 3 carriers\n- Transmit to Circle 1\n- Document transmission\n- Refine protocol\n\n**Phase 3 (Months 12-18): Host Council**\n- Circle Zero + Circle 1 hosts\n- Monthly meetings\n- Pick platform questions\n- Approve next hosts\n\n**Phase 4 (Months 18-24): Open Invites**\n- Public landing page\n- Application system\n- Waitlist management\n- Start growing deliberately\n\n**Phase 5 (Year 2+): Regional Clusters**\n- NYC, SF, London, Tokyo\n- Regional host councils\n- Annual gathering\n- Protocol v2\n\n---\n\n**The answer to \"how does it scale\" is: It doesn't scale like Facebook. It scales like monasteries.**\n\nEach one is small, intimate, local.\nBut the practice spreads.\nAnd those who've been through it recognize each other.\nAnd gradually, there's a network of people who know how to think together.\n\n**That's how you compete with TikTok: You don't. You offer the alternative for the 1% who are looking for it.**\n\nWhat feels right? What's missing?",

            "thinking": "This is a brilliant set of questions that gets at the core tensions:\n\n1. Honor/reputation in a system meant to resist social media's attention economy\n2. How to scale globally while maintaining intimacy\n3. Marketing/excitement without hype\n4. What motivates hosts (intrinsic vs extrinsic)\n5. Time-bound vs lifelong - the commitment question\n\nLet me think deeply about each:\n\n## HONOR\n\nThe user wants this to matter, to be prestigious, but not in a shallow way. How do you make something honorable without creating status games?\n\nFranklin's Junto was honorable because:\n- It produced real civic value (libraries, hospitals, fire companies)\n- Members became respected leaders\n- It was exclusive but not elitist\n- Membership signaled intellectual seriousness\n\nModern equivalents:\n- YC fellowship is honorable (produces builders)\n- Rhodes scholarship is honorable (selective + purpose)\n- Interintellect salon hosting is somewhat honorable\n\nWhat makes honor non-toxic:\n- Tied to contribution, not consumption\n- Evidence-based (you made something)\n- Peer-recognized, not algorithm-assigned\n- Enables rather than gates\n\nIdeas:\n- Certification/credentials that mean something\n- Portfolio of published work\n- Recommendations from circle\n- \"Graduated\" status\n- What you built/contributed\n\n## SCALING GLOBALLY\n\nThe tension: intimate circles vs global reach\n\nOptions:\n1. Franchise model (like YC or Toastmasters)\n2. Protocol model (like email or web)\n3. Platform model (like Substack)\n4. Network model (like Interintellect)\n\nI think it's a hybrid: protocol + network\n\nThe protocol is open (anyone can run a circle with these rules)\nThe network is curated (official circles meet quality bar)\n\nGlobal scaling through:\n- Regional clusters (Paris circles, NYC circles, Tokyo circles)\n- Language variations (Spanish questions, Arabic questions)\n- Time zones (circles by timezone)\n\n\n- Cross-circle festivals (annual gathering)\n\n## EXCITEMENT/WAITLIST\n\nI see this as a deeply selective experience for those seeking meaningful connection. The core appeal isn't mass entertainment, but transformative intellectual engagement. It's for people who crave depth over algorithmic distraction - those willing to invest real effort to find genuine intellectual community.\n\nThe marketing strategy centers on authentic human stories: showing real personal growth, meaningful connections, and substantive work created through these circles. We're not selling easy entertainment, but a pathway to profound personal and collective development.\n\nThe waitlist isn't just a marketing tactic - it's a deliberate cultural mechanism. By creating intentional scarcity, we ensure quality, preserve cultural transmission, and attract only the most committed participants.\n\n## HOST MOTIVATION\n\nHosting isn't about personal gain, but genuine cultural contribution. The most powerful hosts are those driven by a deep commitment to facilitation and community building. They're motivated by a desire to create meaningful spaces where people can truly connect and grow.\n\nThe support structure balances practical incentives with deeper psychological rewards. While modest financial compensation and professional development are important, the real motivation comes from intrinsic drivers: purpose, mastery of facilitation, community belonging, and peer recognition.\n\n## TIME-BOUND VS LIFELONG\n\nModern community requires flexibility. The seasonal commitment model acknowledges life's complexity - people move, change, evolve. By creating a structured yet permissive framework, we allow natural participation rhythms.\n\nThe graduation concept is revolutionary: leaving isn't failure, it's a natural progression. Participants can commit for two seasons, then intentionally recommit or honorably exit. This approach prevents burnout and maintains community integrity.\n\nThe lifelong connection ensures that once someone is part of the circle, they're always connected. Alumni can return, start new circles, and remain part of a broader network - creating a dynamic, evolving community ecosystem.",

            "text": "Brilliant questions. You're asking about the tension between **intimacy and scale**, **honor and accessibility**, **commitment and freedom**. Let me work through each.\n\n---\n\n## **I. How Can It Be Honorable?**\n\nThe problem: Modern \"honor\" is broken - it's followers, likes, clout. We need honor that means something.\n\n### **What Made Franklin's Junto Honorable:**\n\nThe Junto became known as the \"incubation chamber\" for projects that greatly improved life in Greater Philadelphia - the Library Company, fire companies, insurance companies, the University of Pennsylvania\n\nHonor came from **what they built**, not who they were.\n\n### **The New Honor System: Proof of Contribution**\n\n**1. The Graduated Portfolio**\n\nAfter 6 months in a circle, you have:\n- 24+ weekly responses (your thinking over time)\n- 2+ monthly essays \n- 1 quarterly long-form\n- Witness notes you've left\n- Questions you proposed that were selected\n- Q24 amendments you suggested that were adopted\n\n**This is your proof.** Not a badge. Not a number. A body of work.\n\nYour profile shows:\n```\nBilal Ghalib\nCircle Zero, Paris\nJoined: Oct 2025 - Present\nGraduated: Apr 2026\n\nWork in Commons:\n- 24 weekly responses\n- 3 monthly essays  \n- 1 long-form: \"Hospitality as Code\"\n- Featured 4 times by hosts\n\nContributions:\n- Proposed Question 7 (adopted platform-wide)\n- Carrier to Circle 2 & Circle 5\n- Now hosting Circle 8\n\nReputation:\n- 12 circles have read your work\n- 47 \"this helped me\" notes\n- 8 circles forked using your questions\n```\n\n**2. The Recommendation System (Non-Bullshit)**\n\nWhen you graduate, your circle writes you **one collective recommendation** (200 words):\n\n> \"Bilal joined Circle Zero skeptical about 'another online thing.' What we noticed: he asks questions that make you think for days. His essay on hospitality changed how we run salons. When he gave witness notes, they were specific enough to use immediately. He proposed amending Q13 to focus on 'deserving work' not just 'deserving people' - we adopted it. When he carried culture to Circle 2, they told us: 'He doesn't perform hospitality, he is hospitable.' That's the difference.\"\n\nSigned by all 12 members + host.\n\n**This is portable.** You can show it to:\n- Potential employers (shows how you think)\n- Graduate schools (shows intellectual seriousness)\n- Other communities (shows you can collaborate)\n- Future circles (shows you embody the culture)\n\n**3. The Certification Ladder**\n\nNot automatic. Peer-verified.\n\n**Level 1: Member** (6 months)\n- Completed 2 seasons\n- 80%+ participation\n- 2+ essays submitted\n- Recommendation from circle\n\n**Level 2: Carrier** (12 months as member + 1 successful transmission)\n- Was carrier to new circle\n- That circle reached culture density\n- Recommendation from receiving circle\n\n**Level 3: Host** (24 months as member/carrier + host training)\n- Led circle for 12+ months\n- Circle maintained 70%+ participation\n- Forked at least once successfully\n- Recommendation from Host Council\n\n**Level 4: Elder** (48+ months + cultural contribution)\n- Hosted multiple circles\n- Trained hosts\n- Contributed to protocol evolution\n- Recommendation from wider network\n\n**These mean something** because they're:\n- Peer-verified (not self-claimed)\n- Evidence-based (portfolio + recommendations)\n- Time-tested (can't speed-run)\n- Contribution-linked (what you gave)\n\n**4. The Public Signal**\n\nOptional but powerful:\n\n**The Seal:** A visual mark for your website/portfolio\n```\n[Seal image: Stylized quill + digital pen]\n\"Member of Cursive Circle Zero\nGraduated April 2026\"\n```\n\nLinks to your public portfolio (if you choose to share).\n\n**Why it's honorable:**\n- Can't be bought\n- Can't be faked (all work is timestamped/witnessed)\n- Signals: \"I can think, write, collaborate, and commit\"\n- Rare enough to mean something\n\n**5. The Network Effect**\n\nOnce 100+ people have gone through circles:\n- They recognize each other\n- They hire each other\n- They collaborate\n- They refer opportunities\n\nLike YC batch-mates, but for **thinking and culture**, not startups.\n\n---\n\n## **II. How Does It Scale Globally & Compete for Attention?**\n\nThe brutal truth: **It won't compete with TikTok for most people. And that's okay.**\n\n### **Who It's For (The 1%)**\n\nNot 1% by wealth. The 1% who:\n- Feel like \"I'm surrounded by people but deeply alone in my thinking\"\n- Want to make something meaningful, not just consume\n- Are exhausted by performing online\n- Would rather have 10 real connections than 10,000 followers\n- Are willing to work for depth\n\n**This is not a mass product. It's a precision tool.**\n\n### **The Global Scaling Model: Federated Clusters**\n\nThink less \"Facebook global platform,\" more \"email protocol that works everywhere.\"\n\n```\nTHE PROTOCOL (Open, Anyone Can Use):\n- The 24 Questions\n- The 4 Commitments\n- The weekly rhythm\n- The 1-2-4-all process\n- The carrier transmission model\n\nOpen source. Anyone can fork it.\n\nTHE NETWORK (Curated, Quality-Controlled):\n- Official \"Cursive Circles\" meet quality bar\n- Verified on cursive.app\n- Listed in directory\n- Access to platform tools\n- Part of Host Council network\n\nYou can run circles outside the network.\nBut network circles have the seal.\n```\n\n### **Regional Clusters (How It Actually Spreads)**\n\n**Paris Cluster:**\n- 5 circles (60 people)\n- Monthly Paris Host Council\n- Quarterly Paris Gathering (all circles)\n- Shared questions in French/English\n\n**NYC Cluster:**\n- 8 circles (96 people)\n- Twice-monthly NYC Host Council  \n- Different time zones → different salon times\n- Annual \"Junto Fest NYC\"\n\n**Tokyo Cluster:**\n- 3 circles (36 people)\n- Questions translated/adapted\n- Cultural variations (tea ceremony aesthetic)\n- Connected to global network via Host Council\n\n**Cross-Cluster Pollination:**\n- Quarterly: All Host Councils meet (virtual)\n- Annually: Global Junto Gathering (rotating cities)\n- Platform: Featured work from all clusters\n- Carriers can move between clusters\n\n**Scale = Depth × Replication, not Width**\n\n100 clusters of 12 = 1,200 deeply connected people\n> \n> 10,000 shallow subscribers\n\n### **How People Discover It (The Invitation Chain)**\n\n**Not through ads.

Not threads.\n> Craft: essays, tools, art, ideas that last.\n\n**\"For people who feel isolated in their seriousness\"**\n> You're not crazy for wanting depth.\n> You're not alone in resisting the feed.\n> There are others. Here they are.\n\n**The landing page shows:**\n- Not marketing copy, but real work from circles\n- Not testimonials, but transformations with evidence\n- Not \"join now,\" but \"see if this is for you\"\n- The waitlist number: \"847 people waiting. Average wait: 6 weeks.\"\n\n**The scarcity itself is part of the signal:** This is worth waiting for.\n\n---\n\n## **III. Why Would Someone Want to Host?**\n\nThis is critical. Bad hosts kill culture.\n\n### **The Wrong Reasons (Screen These Out):**\n\n- ❌ Building an audience\n- ❌ Positioning as \"thought leader\"\n- ❌ Monetizing attention\n- ❌ Ego (being the smart one)\n- ❌ Status collection\n\nIf someone says \"I want to host to build my platform\" → **no.**\n\n### **The Right Reasons (Look for These):**\n\n- ✓ \"I was helped by Circle Zero. I want to create that for others.\"\n- ✓ \"I love facilitating. I get energy from making space for others.\"\n- ✓ \"I believe this culture is important and I want to steward it.\"\n- ✓ \"Hosting is its own craft. I want to master it.\"\n- ✓ \"The world needs more hospitable spaces. I want to make one.\"\n\n**The intrinsic motivation must be strong** because hosting is work:\n- Weekly question synthesis\n- Salon facilitation\n- Witness note review\n- Culture maintenance\n- 1-on-1 check-ins\n- Host Council participation\n\n### **What Hosts Get (Supporting the Intrinsic):**\n\n**1. The Craft of Hospitality**\n\nHosting is a skill. You get:\n- Training from experienced hosts\n- Monthly Host Council (community of practice)\n- Access to facilitation library\n- Coaching on difficult situations\n- Reputation as a culture-builder\n\n**This is professional development.** Facilitation, mediation, community-building - these are valuable skills.\n\n**2. The Host Community**\n\nYou're not alone:\n- Monthly Host Council (peer support)\n- Private host Slack/Discord\n- \"Office hours\" with experienced hosts\n- Annual host retreat\n- Deep friendships with other hosts\n\nBeing a host means being part of the **hosting lineage**.\n\n**3. Recognition & Portfolio**\n\n- \"Host, Circle 3, Paris (2026-2028)\"\n- Recommendation from Host Council\n- Public portfolio of your circle's work\n- Referenced when your circle forks\n- **Certified Facilitator credential**\n\n**4. Modest Compensation (Optional)**\n\nAfter 6 months hosting successfully:\n- $200-400/month stipend (covers time)\n- OR free lifetime Pro membership\n- OR revenue share if circles become paid\n\n**Not enough to live on. Enough to honor the work.**\n\n**Critical:** Compensation comes AFTER culture is proven, not before. Otherwise you attract mercenaries.\n\n**5. Purpose**\n\nThe real reason:\n\nYou're building **an alternative to the poisoned well of social media**.\n\nYou're creating **a place where thinking happens and craft matters**.\n\nYou're stewarding **a culture of depth in an age of shallowness**.\n\n**This is meaningful work.** Not world-changing, but world-making.\n\n### **How Hosting Offers Are Made:**\n\nNot \"anyone can host if they want.\"\n\n**The Process:**\n1. Member for 12+ months\n2. Been a carrier 1+ times\n3. Nominated by current host\n4. Host Council interview (60 min)\n5. Co-host 4 salons\n6. Solo-host Circle Zero for 2 weeks (audition)\n7. If approved: seed new circle\n\n**Rejection is okay.** \"Not yet\" doesn't mean \"never.\"\n\nSome people are great members but not hosts. That's fine.\n\n---\n\n## **IV. Time-Bound vs. Lifelong: The Seasonal Commitment Model**\n\nYou're onto something important. Let me show you the pros/cons:\n\n### **Option A: Lifelong (Franklin Model)**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Deep relationships over decades\n- Accumulated wisdom\n- Stable culture\n- True mutual improvement\n\n**Cons:**\n- Feels suffocating to moderns\n- No permission to leave\n- Life changes (cities, careers, kids)\n- Resentment builds if forced\n- FOMO (what if I want to try other things?)\n\n### **Option B: Time-Bound (Season Model)**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Permission to leave without guilt\n- Intentional recommitment\n- Natural exit points\n- Fits modern life rhythms\n- Prevents burnout\n\n**Cons:**\n- Loses continuity\n- Relationships don't deepen fully\n- Culture resets every 6 months\n- Transactional feeling\n- Less investment\n\n### **Option C: Seasonal Commitment with Graduation (Recommended)**\n\nThe hybrid model:\n\n```\nTHE COMMITMENT STRUCTURE:\n\nInitial Join: 6-month commitment (2 seasons)\n- Winter/Spring or Summer/Fall\n- Must complete to graduate\n\nMonth 6: Decision Point\n├─ Recommit (another 6 months)\n├─ Graduate (honorable exit)\n└─ Leave (no judgment)\n\nGraduation Ceremony:\n- Public reading of collective recommendation\n- Portfolio published\n- Seal awarded\n- Alumni status granted\n\nAfter Graduation:\n- Lifetime alumni access\n- Can return to any circle anytime\n- Invited to annual gatherings\n- Access to full commons\n- Can host your own circle\n```\n\n**Key insight:** Graduation is NOT quitting. It's **completing the cycle**.\n\n### **The Seasonal Rhythm:**\n\n**Season 1 (Months 1-3): Foundation**\n- Learn the culture\n- Find your voice\n- Build relationships\n- First monthly essay\n\n**Season 2 (Months 4-6): Deepening**\n- Embody the practices\n- Contribute questions\n- Witness deeply\n- Second monthly essay\n\n**Decision Point (Month 6):**\n\nHost asks each member: \"What's your intention?\"\n\n**Option 1: Recommit**\n> \"I'm not done. I want another season (or two, or three).\"\n\nSign up for Season 3-4 (or more).\n\n**Option 2: Graduate**\n> \"This was profound. I need to integrate it. I might return.\"\n\nGraduation ceremony next salon. Alumni status.\n\n**Option 3: Leave**\n> \"This wasn't for me. No hard feelings.\"\n\nClean exit. No drama.\n\n**The Re-commitment Ceremony (for those staying):**\n\nEvery 6 months, those recommitting:\n- Stand up\n- Place hand on heart\n- Re-affirm the 4 Commitments\n- Share: \"Why I'm staying\"\n\n**This makes commitment ACTIVE, not passive.**\n\n### **The Graduation Ceremony:**\n\nWhen someone graduates:\n\n**1. The Portfolio Publish**\n- All their work goes public (if they choose)\n- Recommendation read aloud by host\n- Seal awarded\n\n**2. The Gift**\n- Graduate gives something to the circle\n- Could be: essay, tool, artwork, question set\n- \"Here's what I learned\"\n\n**3. The Invitation**\n- \"You're always welcome back\"\n- \"You can start your own circle\"\n- \"You're now part of the alumni network\"\n\n**4. The Gratitude**\n- Each member shares: \"What you gave me\"\n- 1 sentence each\n- Recorded and given to graduate\n\n**This makes leaving HONORABLE.**\n\n### **The Alumni Network:**\n\nOnce graduated, you get:\n\n- Access to all public commons (read-only)\n- Invited to annual Junto Gathering\n- Can drop into any circle's live salon 1x/quarter\n- Can propose questions to Host Council\n- Priority re-entry to any circle with space\n- Can host your own circle (with training)\n\n**You're not OUT. You're graduated.**\n\n### **The Lifelong Element (Preserved):**\n\nEven with seasons, some will stay for years:\n\n- Franklin stayed 38 years\n- Some members will stay 5+ years\n- Hosts especially tend to stay\n- Elders emerge naturally\n\n**But they CHOOSE to stay** every 6 months. That's different from trapped.\n\n### **Why This Works Better Than Franklin's Model:**\n\n1. **Modern life is mobile** - people move, change careers, have kids\n2. **Permission prevents resentment** - \"I can leave\" makes you want to stay\n3. **Intentional recommitment** - every 6 months you choose again\n4. **Graduation is honorable** - completing is celebrated\n5. **Alumni network preserves connection** - you're never truly gone\n\n---\n\n## **V. How It All Fits Together (The Full System)**\n\n**The Journey:**\n\n```\nMonth 0: Waitlist\n├─ Application: \"Why this?\"\n├─ Interview with host\n└─ Invited to next cohort\n\nMonths 1-6: Season 1-2 (Member)\n├─ Learn culture via carriers\n├─ Submit 2 monthly essays\n├─ Leave witness notes\n├─ Propose questions\n└─ Decision point\n\nMonth 6: Choose\n├─ Recommit → Seasons 3-4\n├─ Graduate → Alumni status\n└─ Leave → Gracefully\n\nMonths 7-12: Season 3-4 (if recommit)\n├─ Deeper practice\n├─ Eligible to be carrier\n├─ Might co-host salon\n└─ Decision point again\n\nMonth 12+: Paths diverge\n├─ Keep recommitting (lifelong member)\n├─ Become carrier (transmit culture)\n├─ Become host (start new circle)\n└─ Graduate (alumni)\n```\n\n**The Honor Flow:**\n\n```\nMember (6 months) → Portfolio + Recommendation\n↓\nCarrier (12 months) → Transmission credential\n↓\nHost (24 months) → Certified facilitator\n↓\nElder (48 months) → Cultural steward\n```\n\n**The Scale Flow:**\n\n```\nCircle Zero (12 people)\n├─ Reaches density\n└─ Forks → Circle 1\n\nCircle 1 (10→12 people)\n├─ 4 carriers from Circle Zero\n├─ 12-week transmission\n└─ Reaches density → Forks\n\nRepeat exponentially\n└─ BUT: Only as fast as culture transmits\n```\n\n**The Global Flow:**\n\n```\nParis Cluster (5 circles)\nNYC Cluster (8 circles)\nTokyo Cluster (3 circles)\n...\n\nEach cluster:\n├─ Regional Host Council\n├─ Quarterly gathering\n└─ Annual global connection\n```\n\n---\n\n## **The Competitive Advantages (Why This Wins)**\n\nNot \"wins\" like \"beats Twitter.\"\n\nWins like: **Becomes the place for serious people to think together.**\n\n**1. Quality > Quantity**\n- 1,000 deeply committed people > 1M casual users\n- Each person produces real work\n- Work accumulates into commons\n\n**2. Honor That Means Something**\n- Can't be bought or gamed\n- Evidence-based portfolio\n- Peer recommendations that matter\n\n**3. Global but Intimate**\n- Federated clusters (local community)\n- Connected network (global reach)\n- Never more than 15 people in your circle\n\n**4. Time-Respectful**\n- Seasonal commitment (not forever)\n- Graduation is honorable (not quitting)\n- Alumni network (never truly gone)\n\n**5. Culture That Spreads**\n- Carrier transmission (genetic)\n- Host training (rigorous)\n- Protocol is open (anyone can fork)\n\n**6. Resistant to Poison**\n- No metrics (no followers, likes, views)\n- No algorithms (human curation only)\n- No ads (modest fees or donations)\n- No scale pressure (grow at culture speed)\n\n---\n\n## **First Actions (What to Build First)**\n\n**Phase 1 (Months 0-6): Prove Circle Zero**\n- You + 11 people\n- Run the full protocol\n- Document everything\n- Create the Culture Doc\n- Build the portfolio system\n\n**Phase 2 (Months 6-12): First Fork**\n- Train HiT + 3 carriers\n- Transmit to Circle 1\n- Document transmission\n- Refine protocol\n\n**Phase 3 (Months 12-18): Host Council**\n- Circle Zero + Circle 1 hosts\n- Monthly meetings\n- Pick platform questions\n- Approve next hosts\n\n**Phase 4 (Months 18-24): Open Invites**\n- Public landing page\n- Application system\n- Waitlist management\n- Start growing deliberately\n\n**Phase 5 (Year 2+): Regional Clusters**\n- NYC, SF, London, Tokyo\n- Regional host councils\n- Annual gathering\n- Protocol v2\n\n---\n\n**The answer to \"how does it scale\" is: It doesn't scale like Facebook. It scales like monasteries.**\n\nEach one is small, intimate, local.\nBut the practice spreads.\nAnd those who've been through it recognize each other.\nAnd gradually, there's a network of people who know how to think together.\n\n**That's how you compete with TikTok: You don't. You offer the alternative for the 1% who are looking for it.**\n\nWhat feels right? What's missing?",

This socialisation is a vestige of agrarian peoples as a hedge against the crop failures of individuals. Socialisation presupposes a community population with which individuals empathise and concomitantly, have a vested interest in its collective prosperity. Urbanisation and the aggregation of people into an abstract and bureaucratic state undermines this empathy. African intellectual historians like Michael Onyebuchi Eze have argued, however, that this idea of \"collective responsibility\" must not be understood as absolute in which the community's good is prior to the individual's good. On this view, ubuntu it is argued, is a communitarian philosophy that is widely differentiated from the Western notion of communitarian socialism. In fact, ubuntu induces an ideal of shared human subjectivity that promotes a community's good through an unconditional recognition and appreciation of ind\n\nA collection of values and practices that people of Africa or of African origin view as making people authentic human beings. While the nuances of these values and practices vary across different ethnic groups, they all point to one thing – an authentic individual human being is part of a larger and more significant relational, communal, societal, environmental and spiritual world · There are many different (and not always compatible) definitions of what Ubuntu is. Even with the various definitions, Ubuntu encompasses the interdependence of humans on one another and the acknowledgment of one's responsibility to their fellow humans and the world around them. It is a philosophy that supports collectivism over individualism. Ubuntu asserts that society gives human beings their humanity. An example is a Zulu-speaking person who when commanding to speak in Zulu would say \"khuluma isintu\", which means \"speak the language of people\".\n\nIt is up to the community, as a whole, to use the fire of experience and the wheel of social control to mould him into a pot that may contribute to society. Any imperfections should be borne by the community and the community should always seek to redeem man. An example of this is the statement by the African National Congress (in South Africa) that it does not throw out its own but rather redeems. Other scholars such as Mboti (2015) argue that the normative definition of Ubuntu, notwithstanding its intuitive appeal, is still open to doubt. The definition of Ubuntu, contends Mboti, has remained consistently and purposely fuzzy, inadequate and inconsistent. Mboti rejects the interpretation that Africans are \"naturally\" interdependent and harmony-seeking, and that humanity is given to a person by and through other persons. He sees a philosophical trap in attempts to elevate harmony to a moral duty – a sort of categorical imperative – that Africans must simply uphold.\n\nIn South Africa, it has come to be used as a contested term for a kind of humanist philosophy, ethic, or ideology, also known as Ubuntuism propagated in the Africanisation (transition to majority rule) process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s. New research has begun to question the exclusive \"humanism\" framing, and thus to suggest that ubuntu can have a \"militaristic\" angle – an ubuntu for warriors. In Uganda the term is used in people's everyday language as a way to relate to one another and call for community. The term can also be used to criticize another's actions if one states that they have lost \"Obuuntu\" (their humanity). Since the transition to democracy in South Africa with the Nelson Mandela presidency in 1994, the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularised to English-language readers through the ubuntu theology of Desmond Tutu.\n\nUbuntu (Zulu pronunciation: [ùɓúntʼù]; meaning 'humanity' in some Bantu languages, such as Zulu) describes a set of closely related Bantu African-origin value systems that emphasize the interconnectedness of individuals with their surrounding societal and physical worlds. \"Ubuntu\" is sometimes translated as \"I am because we are\". In Xhosa, the latter term is used, but is often meant in a more philosophical sense to mean \"the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity\". Although the most popular term referring to the philosophy today is \"Ubuntu\", the philosophy stretches back to the beginning of proto-Bantu language and has many other names in other African languages. Angola (gimuntu); Botswana (muthu, batho); Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Gambia Liberia, Sierra Leonne and Mali (maaya); Burundi (ubuntu); Cameroon (bato); Congo ...",

Ubuntu, an Nguni Bantu term meaning \"humanity,\" embodies a philosophy that emphasizes communalism, shared values, and interconnectedness within African societies. This concept is central to African thought, reflecting the idea that an individual's identity is inherently tied to their community and relationships. This paper explores the philosophy of Ubuntu, delving into its historical roots, cultural significance, and its role in fostering collective identity and social harmony. By examining Ubuntu's application in various aspects of African life, such as governance, conflict resolution, and social justice, this study highlights its enduring relevance in contemporary society. Furthermore, the paper discusses how Ubuntu contrasts with Western individualistic paradigms, offering an alternative perspective on community and ethical living.",

Some communities and ethnic groups in Angola call it gimuntu, Botswana (muthu), Burki...\n\nSo, if an African student or practitioner provides an argument based on their knowledge of community it should be respected as such. Described as ‘ubuntugogy’ (Bangura, Citation2005), the art and science of teaching and learning undergirded by humanity toward others, the Ubuntu pedagogical approach encourages learning and teaching focused on real life situations of learners and teachers (Bangura, Citation2005). Bangura (Citation2005, p. 13) went further to argue that ‘ubuntugogy transcends pedagogy (art and science of teaching and learning), andragogy (art and science of helping adults to learn), “ergonargy” (art and science of helping people learn to work), and heutagogy (the study of self-determined learning)’. If utilized in the classroom, Ubuntu shapes teaching philosophies, that is, ways of thinking about, and practising teaching. It helps shape the teacher’s delivery methods, techniques and values. For example, ‘collectivity’ and reciprocity can be values used in teaching, where \n\nSamkange & Samkange (Citation1980) defined Ubuntu as indigenous African philosophy whose three aspects are humanity, the sanctity of life and people-centered status. Mbigi (Citation2005, p. 75) contended that ‘Although African cultures display awesome “diversity”, they also show remarkable similarities. Community is the cornerstone in African thought and life’. Community is the most important aspect of Ubuntu (Mbigi, Citation1997, Citation2000). A more recent definition posits that Ubuntu is a collection of knowledges, values and practices that Black people of Africa view as making people more human (J. R. Mugumbate & A.

While the nuances of these knowledges, values and practices vary across different ethnic groups, they all point to one aspect—an authentic individual human being is part of a larger and more significant relational, communal, societal, environmental and spiritual world.\n\nUbuntu’s origin is attributable to Black Africans in all regions of the continent—North, West, Central, East and South. Different communities may emphasize its different aspects but they are common knowledges, values and practices. The article begins with a discussion of the philosophy of Ubuntu and its application at the micro (individual and family), meso (communal), macro (societal, environmental and spiritual) levels. The roles of Ubuntu in social work education are then discussed with a focus on Africa. These roles are offering a philosophical foundation; being a source of ethics and values; being a source of knowledge including theories; offering a history of African social work; shaping social work methods; building the confidence of educators, learners and communities; shaping research; being a pedagogical approach; enriching fieldwork education; and indigenizing and decolonizing.",

Consider the African philosophy of “ubuntu” — a concept in which your sense of self is shaped by your relationships with other people.\n\nIn practice, ubuntu means believing the common bonds within a group are more important than any individual arguments and divisions within it. \"People will debate, people will disagree; it's not like there are no tensions,\" said Ogude. \"It is about coming together and building a consensus around what affects the community. And once you have debated, then it is understood what is best for the community, and then you have to buy into that.\" Archbishop Desmond Tutu drew on the concept of ubuntu when he led South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which helped South Africa reckon with its history of apartheid. Ubuntu promotes restorative justice and a community-centric ethos. \"We have the ability, as people, to dig into our human values, to go for the best of them, in order to bring about healing and to bridge the gap,\" Ogude said. This idea also extends to our relationships with the non-human world of rivers, plants and animals.\n\nJames Ogude: There's a sense in which ubuntu as a concept, and the African communitarian ethos, imposes a sense of moral obligation regarding your responsibility for others even before you think of yourself. You must, as the Russian critic Bakhtin would say, look into another person’s eyes and have that person return the gaze. When the gaze is returned, that recognition is what humanizes you. SP: There's empathy built into it. JO: An empathy, yes, there's empathy, there's trust, that is built in this process. That, for me, is the moral obligation that sometimes is absent when undue emphasis is placed on individualism and the self, when it’s “all about me,” and everybody else comes second. Yet, even the West is haunted by other, competing, values such as human rights. There have always been movements in the West that have prioritized the other over the self.\n\nRene Descartes is often called the first modern philosopher, and his famous saying, “I think, therefore I am,” laid the groundwork for how we conceptualize our sense of self. But what if there’s an entirely different way to think about personal identity — a non-Western philosophy that rejects this emphasis on individuality? Consider the African philosophy of “ubuntu” — a concept in which your sense of self is shaped by your relationships with other people. It’s a way of living that begins with the premise that “I am” only because “we are.” The Kenyan literary scholar James Ogude believes ubuntu might serve as a counterweight to the rampant individualism that’s so pervasive in the contemporary world. \"Ubuntu is rooted in what I call a relational form of personhood, basically meaning that you are because of the others,\" said Ogude, speaking to Steve Paulson and Anne Strainchamps in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",

Ubuntu promotes the idea that our well-being is intrinsically linked to the well-being of others. The practice encourages individuals to prioritize communal values over individualistic pursuits, thereby fostering environments where mutual respect and cooperation thrive. This philosophy has been influential in post-apartheid South Africa, shaping policies aimed at reconciliation and nation-building. Nelson Mandela's leadership, deeply rooted in Ubuntu, focused on reconciliation and uniting people in post-apartheid South Africa. His approach emphasized forgiveness, inclusion, and the collective good. Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission showcased Ubuntu by fostering healing through truth-telling and collective forgiveness.\n\nUbuntu, originating from various African cultures, is a profound philosophy centered on the interconnectedness of humanity. At its core lies the belief that individuals exist within a web of relationships and are defined by their interactions with others. This philosophy rejects individualism in favor of communal well-being, stressing the importance of empathy, compassion, and collective responsibility. Ubuntu is sometimes expressed as \"a person is a person through other persons.\" This recognizes that our identity and our existence are shaped by our relationships with others. Ubuntu encourages individuals to recognize the humanity in others and to prioritize communal welfare over personal gain. It promotes reconciliation, forgiveness, and restorative justice as means to resolve conflicts and heal societal wounds. Through Ubuntu, communities strive for harmony, equity, and inclusivity, valuing every member's contributions and honoring their dignity.\n\nSource: The Ubuntu philosophy is rooted in various African cultures and traditions, particularly those of the Nguni Bantu peoples of Southern Africa. ...

                "text": "From the above definition, we can pick two important points: The first point is ethno-philosophy as a “system of thought” and the second point is “the collective world views of diverse African people” and that they are a unified form of knowledge. This means that the diversity that characterise African people, in terms of geographical location, history and ethnicity, does not take away the fact that Africans have “a unified form of knowledge” that is based on group identity or community. Now, this is what qualifies Ubuntu as an important aspect of ethno-philosophy. This section defines Ubuntu as well as tracing its historical roots in Southern African cultures. To begin with, the term Ubuntu comes from a group of sub-Saharan languages known as Bantu (Battle, 2009: 2). It is a term used to describe the quality or essence of being a person amongst many sub-Saharan tribes of the Bantu language family (Onyebuchi Eze, 2008: 107).\n\nFor instance, if a community chooses to ignore the warnings of the spirit world regarding an impending danger such as a calamity resulting from failure by that community to enact an important ritual that will protect members of that community from say, flooding or famine; then the community will face the consequences. What is epistemology? In the Western sense of the word, epistemology deals with the meaning, source and nature of knowledge. Western philosophers differ when it comes to the sources of knowledge with some arguing that reason is the source of knowledge while others view experience or the use of the senses as the gateway to knowledge. This article will not delve much into these arguments since they have found an audience, instead it focuses on hunhu/ubuntu epistemology. However, one cannot define and characterise hunhu/ubuntu traditional epistemology without first defining and demarcating the province of African epistemology as opposed to Western epistemology.\n\nAccording to Michael Battle (2009: 135), “African epistemology begins with community and moves to individuality.” Thus, the idea of knowledge in Africa resides in the community and not in the individuals that make up the community. Inherent in the powerful wisdom of Africa is the ontological need of the individual to know self and community (2009: 135) and discourses on hunhu/ubuntu traditional epistemology stems from this wisdom. As Mogobe Ramose (1999) puts it, “the African tree of knowledge stems from ubuntu philosophy. Thus, ubuntu is a well spring that flows within African notions of existence and epistemology in which the two constitute a wholeness and oneness.” Just like, hunhu/ubuntu ontology, hunhu/ubuntu epistemology is experiential. In Shona society, for instance, the idea of knowledge is expressed through listening to elders telling stories of their experiences as youths and how such experiences can be relevant to the lives of the youths of today.\n\nWe also have second generation scholars of Ubuntu such as Michael Onyebuchi Eze (2010), who is credited for his critical historicisation of the term Ubuntu, Michael Battle (2009) who is credited for some deep insights on the linguistic meaning of the term Ubuntu as well as his famous claim that Ubuntu is a gift to the Western world; Fainos Mangena (2012a and 2012b) who is credited for defining Hunhu/Ubuntu and extracting from it the idea of the Common Moral Position (CMP) and Thaddeus Metz (2007) whose search for a basic principle that would define African ethics has attracted a lot of academic attention; Christian BN Gade (2011; 2012 and 2013) who has taken the discourse of Hunhu/Ubuntu to another level by looking at the historical development of discourses on Ubuntu as well as the meaning of Ubuntu among South Africans of African Descent (SAADs). Finally, we have Martin H Prozesky who has outlined some of the distinctive qualities/features of Hunhu/Ubuntu philosophy that are importan",

Additionally, the study recommends comprehensive in-service training for teachers prior to the introduction of HBC to ensure effective implementation. Engaging parents as stakeholders can further enhance deep learning by promoting inquiry-based approaches [5]. Ultimately, the study concludes that HBC holds significant potential to cultivate patriotism and reinforce the Zimbabwean philosophy of ubuntu/unhu/vumunhu, thereby contributing to the decolonization of the curriculum. ... Campus Pride: Promoting the Inclusion of Comprehensive Sexuality Education into University Programmes ... Higher education institutions in South Africa serve as community centres that attract and welcome students\n\nThe ongoing challenges faced by the LGBTQIA+ community suggest a broken promise of democracy in the country and a lost sense of Ubuntu. Such challenges are more prominent in institutions of higher learning where the majority of diverse identities meet, critically reflect and explore themselves and the wider society. This chapter explores the injustices of heterosexualised university cultures, whose manifestations range from subtle expressions of prejudice to bodily harm. In discussing the silence surrounding sexual diversity in higher education from an African perspective, it’s essential to delve into the principles of Ubuntu, particularly focusing on humanisation and interdependence, while considering cultural and legal factors. By adopting a philosophy of Ubuntu, the chapter uncovers strategies for inclusive higher education environments for LGBTQIA+ students.\n\nUbuntu is actually regarded as the soul force that drives almost every facet of societal life in African societies and that create the relationship between the African community .In this paper I will be mostly focusing on Ubuntu in education or rather in South African schools. This paper seeks to understand how Ubuntu impacts on discipline in South African schools. Ubuntu in the South African context or society is seen as the act of being human, caring, sympathy, empathy, forgiveness or any values of humanness towards others. Ubuntu is a capacity in South African culture that expresses compassion, reciprocity, dignity, harmony and humanity in the interests of building and maintaining a community with justice and mutual caring. The consequences of failure to embrace Ubuntu in South African Schools manifest itself through learner’s indiscipline and staff not respecting each other. The purpose of this paper is to place the reader in South African society and introduce the concept of Ubunt",

The nuance of subtle energy created from using this respectful approach to talking with others provides a sense of communion and interconnectedness that is not often present in the common methods of communicating in the classroom. When everyone has their turn to speak, when all voices are heard in a respectful and attentive way, the learning atmosphere becomes a rich source of information, identity, and interaction. Talking Circles originated with First Nations leaders - the process was used to ensure that all leaders in the tribal council were heard, and that those who were speaking were not interrupted. Usually the Chief would initiate the conversation, with other members responding and sharing their perceptions and opinions of the topic under\n\nOnline course management systems provide several applications that can be used to apply the talking circle process within the virtual learning environment. Although presence is a key ingredient of effective talking circles, the teacher or guide can facilitate at least a semblance of web presence within the activity. Some common applications that could be used to facilitate online talking circles include: ... Although any of the above applications could be used to organize an online talking circle, there are some critical considerations that the teacher or facilitator must keep in mind. To quote David Osborn: (2003) In her discussion of talking circles, Baldwin (1994) suggests the use of three principles concerning power questions: rotating leadership, shared responsibility, and reliance on the spirit. She also encourages individuals to practice speaking with intention, listening with attention and self-monitoring the impact of his or her contributions.\n\nPranis et al. (2000), in keeping with the First Nations tradition, place strong responsibility on the elder or gatekeeper of the circle and refer to the gatekeeper as the servant of the circle process. They suggest that the gatekeepers qualities should include community respect, knowledge of the community, a reputation for fairness and integrity, understanding of the practices and principles of peacekeeping (talking) circles, skill in facilitating difficult conversations, empathy and respect for others, and humility (p. 35). Discussions and Forums are commonly used in online education. The standard format includes a stem question or statement which then prompts the learner to comment or answer the question. Often, students are encouraged to respond to one another's discussion entry, and perhaps add further discussion to continue the dialogue.\n\nDiabetes Wellness: American Indian Talking Circles Facilitator's Manual by Felicia Schanche Hodge et al, Center for American Indian Research and Education. https://www.seva.org/site/DocServer/DTC_Facilitator_Manual.pdf?docID=343 · Talking Circles as a Metaphor and Pedagogy for Learning by David A.

This usually depends on the Indigenous territory that you are in: If you are in Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) territory, your circle will most likely go counter-clockwise with the moon. If you are in Anishinaabek territory, your circle will most likely go clockwise with the sun. Participants will enter the circle single file by walking the perimeter in the established direction and not across the middle. It is not acceptable to bring any material objects with you into the circle. Your focus is on listening and learning.

Whoever is holding the talking piece is encouraged to speak freely about personal feelings and opinions.\n\nIndigenous ways of knowing use and interpret the circle in many different ways but with the same good intentions.

The circle is whole and doesn't end; the circle can be unbalanced depending on what is in it or not in it. But in general, a circle is impartial, fair and representative of inter-connectivity and equality. Elementary talking circle teachings use the circle for communicating the importance of our differences and to look at each other's strengths as an indicator of equality. For example, a primary age sharing circle may begin with the participants expressing something that they are good at (math, sports, art). A second round of the circle will then ask the participants to admit that they aren't good at something.\n\nListeners are encouraged not to judge but be open to learning from each speaker and accept differences of opinion as valuable. Participants do not have to speak and can pass the talking piece to the next participant. Outside of the circle, participants are not permitted to repeat what is shared by other participants. What is said in the circle, stays in the circle. Often at this time the facilitator or helper will walk around the circle with a bowl of medicines so that each participant has an opportunity to smudge. This may be repeated at the end of the circle before closing comments. If there is a fire in the middle of the circle, participants may offer medicines such as tobacco or cedar to the fire from each of the four directions. During the sharing circle process, a participant may choose not to speak and can pass the talking piece to the next participant.\n\nRestorative justice circle practices are safe, controlled environments that focus on the effects that the behaviour has on the community or classroom.

The person holding the stick, and only that person, is designated as having the right to speak and all others must listen quietly and respectfully. Talking sticks are most frequently used in council circles, ceremonies and at the beginning of cultural events such as potlatches, and in storytelling circles. Some cultures do not use a Talking Stick per se but use an eagle feather, wampum belt, peace pipe or sacred shell. A great many schools have adopted the Talking Stick principles in their classrooms as a way to teach children patience, self-discipline and to respect the speaker and his/her words.

                "text": "Talking circles, also known as sharing circles, have long been used by Indigenous peoples in Canada, the US, and around the world. They are used to ensure each individual who has gathered in a place has a voice and is fully heard.\n\nThe good news is that many Indigenous peoples have generously shared talking circles with non-Indigenous peoples, knowing the potential they hold. The bad news is that talking circles are often misused and misunderstood by non-Indigenous peoples. This blog has been written to help clarify the sacred nature of this tool and ensure it is used in a respectful and helpful way. We apologize for any generalizations or statements that are harmful in any way – this is certainly not our intention. Note: The italicized text offers wisdom about the Indigenous peoples practice by Shannon Perez, member of the Sayisi Dene First Nation. It need not be complicated. You need a “talking piece” and a circle of chairs in an open place to sit. It is also helpful to ensure your space is quiet, so everyone can hear each other, and that it radiates a feeling of calm.\n\nIf non-Indigenous people use a talking/sharing circle it is important to honor the origin of this cultural practice so as to avoid cultural appropriation. Below is some suggested language to share before starting: “In a few minutes we are going to participate in a sharing circle. This is an ancient cultural practice of Indigenous people of this land and has been gifted to non-Indigenous peoples. It is used to ensure all people in a circle have an equal and honored voice. It is also meant to help each person speak from the heart and speak truth. Today I have selected an [object] as our talking piece. In a minute, I will pass this talking piece to the person to my left to begin. Whoever holds the talking piece is the only person who can speak. Everyone else is asked to listen deeply and receive all that is shared. This is a time to speak from the heart and listen with the heart.\n\nWe will go around the circle one time. However, this practice often goes until everyone’s heart is empty.” · There are a variety of reasons to use a talking circle. Sometimes a decision needs to be made and you want input from a variety of voices, other times healing is needed, and other times you want to invite personal sharing on a common topic. Whatever the reason, state it for the group – see this video for how it can be used in the classroom. To focus sharing, it can be helpful to offer a question or statement clarifying the purpose of the circle. For example: “What has our learning today taught you about yourself? Why is this important?” · The talking piece can be passed to the left or right of the holder of the space. Indigenous peoples may use similar words to those above, which are often spoken by an elder. Here is another version I (Shannon) use with colleagues.\n\nWhen a talking circle is needed, Indigenous peoples know to make space and time, especially if a group agrees to go around the circle until there is nothing left to say. Everyone knows it may take hours. Prepare yourself. Your calm and peaceful presence will help the group be fully present with each other and in the circle. Turn your phone off, take time to be rooted and speak with authenticity. Prepare the space. Move out unnecessary clutter, arrange a circle of chairs for the number of people expected, and create a center of the circle for the talking piece to be placed. Some find it helpful to place a lit candle in the center as well. Prepare the group. Don’t start until the group is calm and ready, and cellphones are turned off. Take time to describe what will happen, how and why, and the origin of this practice. You set the tempo and intention.",

We believe these SACRED THINGS to be our HIGHER SELVES; they help us listen; they aid in our learning. Within the SACRED CIRCLE, we are encouraged to speak not only from the MIND, but from the HEART. We are free to SHARE our inner most FEELING if we choose. Regardless of whether one brings a TRADITIONAL TEACHING or personal PROBLEM to the circle, all persons are valued, respected, and listened to. There is an INDIAN belief of the RIGHT TIME/RIGHT PLACE/RIGHT PEOPLE hearing RIGHT THINGS and we rely on the belief within that circle. When “ALL HAVE SPOKEN” anyone may request that this be a “CLOSED CIRCLE” that all that has been said and the identities of the participants shall be confidential.\n\nIf no one requests a closed circles, all may freely share what they have learned. The CIRCLE meeting is closed with PRAYER; so … in this OLD WAY, we have come TOGETHER again to TEACH, to LEARN, to TOUCH each other’s spirit; that we may find strength to live these TWO WORLDS ... SPECIAL NOTE: It is always a feeling of healing if an Indian Spiritual leader is present to say PRAYERS before the “TALKING --- CIRCLE” begins. But, if there is no spiritual leader present, then anyone may be asked to lead the circle starting with a prayer in whichever language they know how. Also, the leader should light a candle and place it in the middle of the circle to represent the light as a way to communicate with their HIGHER POWER they choose to speak to while talking. Then too, always have an EAGLE FEATHER ready to past to the next person to hold in their hands while they talk.\n\nAlso, make sure to smudge yourselves with SWEET-GRASS, CEDAR, or SAGE before a circle meeting is to begin. The “TALKING CIRCLE” or “HEALING THROUGH FEELING” is a similar to an A.A. meeting only that the “TALKING CIRCLE” is based on a way of INDIAN MIND HEALING.",

Do not consider your work “youth work” only. “Young Muslims is not youth work, but youth doing the real work!” as Imam Khalid Griggs once advised us. Our work should be linked with activities in the actual Muslim community and the society at large. 14. “The Leader of a Nation is its servant,” said the Prophet (pbuh) in a Hadith. This is the purpose of a Halaqah and it’s leader, in a nutshell! Therefore, in order for you to be a real leader, you have to be an Islamic worker first! [Note: Refer to Part IV of this package to read more on the expectations of a Halaqah Coordinator.] ... Following is a list of few ideas and practices that we, as leaders of Halaqas or youth groups, may try to implement gradually to improve ourselves and our work for Allah’s sake. ... · A Coordinator or any Muslim at leadership level should strengthen his/her relationship with Allah, through improving his/her personal Ibadah (worship) and re\n\nWe need to think, plan, and work like the great intellectuals and revolutionaries of Islam. Our focus should be to work to establish Islam in this part of the world, according to the means available in this society, rather than developing hatred for this society in the hearts of Muslim youth and asking them to go back home to study or to establish Islam there. We should try to remove this ‘back-home’ approach toward the Islamic work, and should live as the ambassadors of Islam in this part of the world, spreading Allah’s message using any tools or media available. However, we should not act as ‘Rejectionists’ or ‘extremists’ either, I.e. at the same time we should learn how to respect the valid traditions of Muslim countries and implement them in our lives and the Islamic work here. · All the Islamic knowledge that we gain from Halaqas should be reinforced and complemented by Islamic activism in any field possible.\n\n– FREE TUTORING: The Halaqah members can tutor each other in any course or profession they may be good at, for e.g. math, biology, web-designing…etc. – SLEEPOVERS: Serve to strengthen the brotherhood/sisterhood and train the members to become better Islamic workers. Sleepovers should be held at a local Masjid, and may also include some interactive Islamic study sessions, as well as collective voluntary prayers, called Qiyam-al-layl, or Night-vigil prayers. – PRAYING AT A NEARBY MASJID: Brothers may carpool to a local Masjid to pray together, at least once a week. – ISLAMIC AUDIO/VISUAL SESSIONS: Halaqah members may watch or listen to an Islamic lecture/documentary and have a discussion on its message. ... 2. Make sure every member / participant knows about the time, place, topic of the meeting, 2 days in advance. 3. Stay in front. Never dwindle into the background during a meeting.\n\n8. Try to make the other Halaqah participants your true friends and brothers/sisters in Islam · 9. Avoid being disagreeable – “Disagree without being disagreeable.” ... Following is a list of few ideas and practices that we, as leaders of Halaqas or youth groups, may try to implement gradually to improve ourselves and our work for Allah’s sake. ... 1. Be as patient as possible with the participants of your Halaqah. Do not be pushy or critical with any member, unless the member is not conforming to the Halaqah policies. Allah tells us in the Quran, “Indeed, Allah is with those who are Patient (Sabireen).” · 2. Try to be as humble as possible, in your character. There was no one more humble than our own Prophet (peace be upon him), and yet there was no leader greater than him! At the same time you must be firm when it comes to following the concepts of leadership, Shura’ (making decision with consensus), or Ihtisab (accountability).",

The Majlis, singular of Majalis, literally means “space where we sit”, an assembly or a council. This traditional practice, widespread in the Arabian Peninsula, consists in gathering a group of people in a host’s Majlis. In that region, the Majlis is fully part of social life, a manifestation of solidarity and hospitality between hosts and visitors. Within communities, it is a privileged place of discussion, transmission of knowledge and familial stories, receptions for happy or sa\n\nThe diversity of the Majalis, depending on the environment and function, is evidence of local adaptation of an ancient practice that is common in the Peninsula. Today, as a result of a joint initiative of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar, the Majlis is listed as an intangible world heritage in the UNESCO’s list, symbolizing intercultural dialogue. The leaders of communities pay a specific attention to the construction, furnishing of the Majlis, in their palace, house or tent for nomads. In the last case, the Majlis can be built in the shadows of Acacia trees and surrounded by leaves from three sides to protect the visitors from wind and sand. The participants usually sit in the open air around the fire, coffee jars and pots. In the Majalis of tribe leaders and merchants, the furniture is much more luxurious. In an important Majlis, one person is charged of preparing the Arabic coffee, the Muqahwi, helped by the youngest members to serve coffee to the guests.\n\nWidespread in the Arabian Peninsula, the Majlis takes different forms and functions depending on the environment and the usage of the gathering place. First, there are three types of Majalis in the region. For instance, there are Majalis for people in costal areas. Those ones are traditionally made of plaster and mud, and sometimes a boat can play the role of the Majlis. The communities are gathering there to discuss fishing, diving and pearl trade. In the desert, the Majlis takes two forms: either an open air gathering around a fire or a Bayt Al She’r, that takes place in a tent made of goat hair. The Bedouins usually exchange on their daily life matters and stories. In mountains, the Majlis is generally organized around a water source and holds discussions on the community share of resources such as water and pastures. Furthermore, the diversity of the Majalis reflects the different functions they can be used for.\n\nThe Majlis tradition has been existing in the Arabian Peninsula societies for centuries. Nowadays, several countries give a common value to this heritage of the Arab world even though they name this tradition in different ways: the Diwaniya in Koweït, Majlis in Saudi Arabia, the Barza in the UAE, al Sabla in Oman and al Mayles in Qatar. Given that common interest, an international initiative led by the last 4 countries mentioned above proposed to recognize the Majlis as a social and cultural space and a heritage to preserve. This suggestion paved the way for the official designation of the Majlis as a UNESCO world heritage in 2015. In 2018, the UNESCO hosted an exhibition about the Majlis, perceived as a showcase of the intercultural dialogue and the crossed influence of the Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Buddhist cultures. With the official designation as UNESCO world heritage, the international community gave a specific recognition of the Majlis’s value.\n\n“Al Majalis Madaris” says the Arab proverb, meaning “the Majalis are schools”.

                "text": "While the majlis al-shura tradition in Islam is primarily about forms of consultation and semi-public gatherings and discussion, we argue that it is sufficiently central to Islamic governance to be considered a “macro” religious effect on public administration in its widest sense. We agree with Peters (2021) that the majlis al-shura encourages communal participation and acts as a limited check on hierarchy. Majlis, in particular (as simply a custom of gathering and discussion), are granular and constant mechanisms of discussion (and complaint) and provide possible discursive spaces in Arab and Islamic states. The chapter begins with a discussion of early Quranic and Islamic traditions regarding al-shura. The next section considers majlis and al-shura, which are distinct as practices, but often combined in formal and informal modes. The third and fourth sections of the chapter consider two case studies drawn from the Qatar experience – the Municipal Central Council in Doha, and the Majl\n\nThe other part of the context — and the background to both Mohammad's polity and its continuation by his successors — is pre-Islamic Arab society. … Thanks to its aridity, Arabia was mostly a wilderness. This meant that its population was thin, dispersed, and poor in resources; it accordingly tended to be rather flat in its social structure, strongly tribal in its organisation, and generally stateless. In such a society the tendency is for every adult male to be a politician in his own right; hence the level of political participation was undoubtedly higher than we are accustomed to in modern democracies, let alone in pre-modern states based on taxing peasant agriculture. (Cook 2014, 323) As we note below, while the two concepts of majlis and shura are usually connected, they are distinct practices. The majlis is broader and denotes sitting or gathering, and so can be applied in various contexts.\n\nIn the Gulf states, for example, most homes have a room for majlis or relaxed discussions (usually, p. 150but not always, among men, see Asmi 2016) on almost any topic. The term is used universally to refer to consultation or gatherings that involve some deliberation. But this does not equate to democratic decision-making. It is both a looser and broader concept of discussion and exchange, without a formal voting or deliberative mechanism. Moreover, they take place frequently and are embedded in Arabic (Islamic) culture. The chapter proceeds in three sections. First, we discuss the early Quranic and Islamic traditions regarding al-shura. The next section considers the concepts and practice of majlis and al-shura, which are distinct as practices, but often combined in formal and informal modes. However, both concepts share the common element of collective decision-making among Muslims, particularly in the Gulf region.\n\nOn the other hand, the various reform movements within Islam, starting in the 19th century and culminating in the Arab Spring, have been inspired by concepts such as shura, which open a pathway to thinking about distinct approaches to parliamentary governance consistent with Islamic principles (Mendel 2021). “Modern reformers in the twentieth century began to reinterpret key traditional Islamic concepts and institutions — rulers’ consultation (shura) with those ruled, consensus (ijma) of the community, reinterpretation (ijtihad) and legal principles such as community welfare (maslaha) — to develop Islamic forms of parliamentary governance, representative elections, and religious reform” (Abou El Fadl et al. 2004, 96). The concept of majlis is often joined to shura, as in majlis al-shura, but the two are slightly different. Herb distinguishes four meanings of majlis: 1) In its most basic sense a majlis is simply an informal social gathering of men, often held weekly in a special room bu",

In the past, it was often a simple setup in the tented homes of Bedouins, with rugs and cushions arranged around a fire. The Majlis was a place of governance, diplomacy, and education, hosting poetry recitations, storytelling, and intellectual debates. In Islamic culture, it became a hub for religious and philosophical discourse, often located near mosques or community centers. Over the centuries, the Majlis has evolved, blending functionality with aesthetic appeal while preserving its essence of hospitality.

                "text": "Discover the rich tradition of the Arabic majlis a cultural gathering space that fosters community, hospitality, and meaningful conversations across generations\n\nThe Arabic term “majlis” translates to “a place of sitting.” It refers to both the physical space and the social practice where people gather to converse and share ideas. Traditionally, the majlis serves multiple purposes, such as facilitating discussions about community issues, providing a platform for resolving conflicts, and fostering connections among members. In essence, the majlis is an embodiment of community spirit and social interaction, where individuals come together to discuss matters of importance, engage in storytelling, and uphold cultural traditions. The majlis has deep historical roots, dating back to pre-Islamic Arabian societies. Initially, it functioned as a tribal assembly where leaders convened to make decisions affecting their clans. Over time, as Arab societies evolved, the majlis adapted to include broader community participation.\n\nThe majlis represents the heart of Arab social life, embodying values such as hospitality, respect, and community cohesion. In this setting, guests are treated with utmost honor, reflecting the cultural importance of generosity. The majlis acts as a venue for open dialogue, where ideas and experiences are shared, reinforcing social bonds. It also plays a critical role in decision-making processes, often serving as a forum for discussing important community issues. Through these gatherings, traditions are maintained, and cultural heritage is passed down through generations, ensuring continuity in social practices. Architecturally, a majlis is designed to foster conversation and connection. Typically characterized by low seating arrangements, plush cushions, and decorative carpets, the environment encourages relaxation and openness. Traditional majlis often feature intricate designs, including decorative tiles, wooden carvings, and vibrant textiles that reflect regional aesthetics.\n\nIn many cases, majlis are positioned near the home’s entrance, emphasizing the importance of hospitality. The layout is designed to facilitate interaction, with a focus on creating an inviting atmosphere for both formal discussions and casual gatherings. Majlis can be categorized into formal and informal types, each serving distinct purposes. Formal majlis are often associated with governmental or tribal meetings, where important decisions are made and policies discussed. Informal majlis, on the other hand, are more relaxed settings for family and friends to gather, share stories, and enjoy each other’s company. Additionally, there are variations based on social context, such as family majlis for intimate gatherings and community majlis for broader discussions. Each type reinforces the importance of social ties and collective decision-making. Etiquette in the majlis is paramount, with established protocols governing interactions.\n\nIn contemporary society, the majlis tradition has adapted to reflect changing social norms and technological advancements. While traditional values remain central, modern majlis often incorporate technology, such as digital platforms for discussions and virtual gatherings. This evolution allows for broader participation, especially among younger generations. Despite these changes, the essence of the majlis—community engagement and cultural exchange—remains intact. Many families continue to host majlis in their homes, preserving the tradition while adapting to modern lifestyles, ensuring its relevance in today’s fast-paced world. The majlis plays a crucial role in significant life events and celebrations within the Arab community. During weddings, funerals, and religious occasions, the majlis serves as a central gathering space for family and friends.",
