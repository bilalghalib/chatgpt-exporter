We work by helping people identify their values, their purpose and use the unlocked energy and capacity for committed learning and development of soft/universal skills in groups with accountability. Can you help us write an introduction statement that talks about how we have lots of experience with startups and how the work is very similar and how we will be able to take our years of experience and work with hundreds of teams to benefit their business. If you are ready I'll paste some background on Bloom, our company which is looking to offer this corporate client work. The first step is to give me a summary what I've requested and describe why you think we might be doing this project and if you think it's a good idea. Either way, good or bad idea, tell me how to improve it.  ",

      "content": "Summary: You are looking to add an introduction to a proposal where your company, Bloom, is transitioning from running accelerator programs for early-stage startups to offering consulting services for corporations. The goal is to help corporate teams in a similar way you have helped startups by assisting them in identifying their values and purpose, unlocking their potential, and facilitating the development of soft/universal skills with accountability. You want the introduction to highlight your experience with startups and how it can benefit the corporate clients.\n\nReason for the project: With your extensive experience working with hundreds of startups and the successful track record in developing their teams, it makes sense to expand your offerings to corporate clients. This transition can help you leverage your expertise to create a positive impact on a broader scale and tap into a new market.\n\nOpinion on the idea: The idea of transitioning from working with startups to corporate clients is good, as you can utilize your years of experience and apply the same successful principles to a larger audience. It could potentially result in significant growth and diversification for Bloom.\n\nImprovement suggestions:\n1. To make the transition smoother, it would be helpful to identify the key differences between startups and corporate environments and adapt your approach accordingly, while still maintaining the core values of your programs.\n2. You can create case studies and success stories from your startup accelerator programs to showcase your expertise and demonstrate how your methodologies can be applied in a corporate setting.\n3. Partner with a few pilot corporate clients to refine your consulting services based on their feedback, as well as to build a track record and testimonials for the corporate segment.\n4. Continuously invest in research and development to stay updated on the latest trends and best practices in team development, soft skills training, and leadership coaching, which will ensure that your corporate clients receive top-notch service.\n\nHere's a draft of an introduction statement for your proposal:\n\nAt Bloom, we have spent years perfecting our approach to unlocking the potential of early-stage startups through accelerator programs. Our proven methodologies have enabled hundreds of teams to identify their values, embrace their purpose, and foster committed learning and development of essential soft and universal skills. Now, we are excited to bring our wealth of experience to corporations, empowering their teams to excel in a similar fashion.\n\nDrawing from our extensive experience working with startups, we understand the importance of nurturing innovation, collaboration, and accountability. As we transition to working with corporate clients, we are confident in our ability to adapt our expertise to the unique needs of established businesses, helping them to thrive in today's fast-paced and competitive landscape. By leveraging our years of experience and insights from working with hundreds of teams, we are poised to create a transformative impact on corporations, driving growth and success for their business.",

      "content": "Here's some additional background to make your work more specific: Bloom Company Profile \nSummer 2022 \nBloom is an affiliate of AltCity Impact, a non-profit organization legally registered in Lebanon in 2015. \nAt Bloom, we are working to leverage new methods and technologies to support skills development, entrepreneurship education and MSME development with a focus on building inclusive and impact-driven economies. \nWe do this through running programs (online and hybrid) for enterprises and accelerators to make high-quality entrepreneurship support available to everyone, everywhere, and through building online training tools for teams and program managers. \nWe also connect entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, partners, trainers and fellows to better educate and accelerate small to medium-sized businesses aimed at solving challenges across a variety of industries and sectors. \nWe run our programs through the Bloom platform, an in-house developed online platform designed for startups and entrepreneurship programs. \n\nBloom Present & Past Performance \nWe’ve worked with thousands of individuals and over 850 teams over the last eight years, focusing on early-stage startups, small businesses, and social enterprises, through our online, offline, and hybrid programs. \nOur teams have mobilized over $7m in next-stage funding, won prizes (national, regional, and global), and gained acceptance in top accelerators in Lebanon and worldwide. \nSo far in our Lebanon Growth Accelerator program (LGA ) alone, we have helped 50 startups create 224 jobs in total; 93 of them were full-time jobs. 45% of the jobs were filled by women and 10% were for refugees. The teams in our programs grow personally and professionally on average moving from one developmental stage to the next in our programs. You can find more information and charts on \nhttps://bloom.pm/impact-dashboard\n\nScenario 1: \nBloom runs online programs to expand access to high-quality entrepreneurship education and personal skill development. Our goal is to create sustainable, inclusive, values-driven enterprises and economies in MENA. Primary beneficiaries of our work are MENA-based developing entrepreneurs and leaders leading social change efforts in their communities. Secondary beneficiaries are Bloom’s trainers themselves, many of whom are MENA-rooted mentors with established careers looking to give back to their community. The growth and contribution of our trainers are critical to how we operate and create change. Further, a tertiary beneficiary of our work is the MENA communities at large, through which our entrepreneur graduates contribute to the innovation infrastructure of multi-industry growth. \n\nWhile most social enterprise accelerators measure critical facets of team success to support the growth and development of the organization, Bloom’s approach takes this a step further. We integrate leadership and character development into every aspect of the business model to drive progress towards impact. Character strengths have been proven to constitute well-being (Wagner et al., 2019), contribute to work performance and academic achievement ( Littman-Ovadia and Lavy, 2016), and build resilience to hardships, illness, and loss (Martínez-Martí and Ruch, 2017). Using this evidence to reinforce our hypothesis, we expect to see an increase in our partners’ social impact as a direct result of the work we do which can be described through 4 interlinked efforts: \n\nPrograms: Both programs for teams and programs for programs (supporting accelerators & communities of practice); we define our success by how much we can help others become successful. \n\nTechnology: Unique to our entrepreneur accelerator program is our methodology of operations and custom-developed software integration. The main innovation is a pedagogy integrated software, Bloom’s Enterprise Capacity Assessment Tool (ECAT). This program is leveraged as an active tool utilizing a Socratic method to skill-build. Individualized prompts and assessments occur based on the previous assessment results, so the system ultimately responds with learning modules prompting introspection from the entrepreneur while also providing resources for further exploration of key topics (mentorship, self-generated learning/introspection, etc. ) \n\n\nAssessments & Activities: We develop metrics-driven tools for individuals, teams and programs to create custom learning journeys and offer recommended learning activities, with all activities coded with both enterprise-development categories (from our Enterprise Capacity Assessment Tool) and Character Strengths (from VIA) to help people, teams and programs more effectively run character strength-based enterprise support programs. We develop tailored dashboards to visualize team impact and growth across a variety of dimensions including the sizes of projects, the number of new employees and organizations, as well as a detailed level view on organizational and personal development factors derived from our assessments.\n\nWorking in conflict zones, we’ve learned that creating a positive impact is not possible without constructive and resilient psychological training. So to support these enterprises, Bloom has built a system of assessments on understanding and delivering custom learning journeys by administering assessments to identify entrepreneurs’ growth areas to develop through our library of activities that enhance wellbeing and build personal and professional strengths.\n\nCommunity: We are strongly community-focused and design our programs, tools, and activities to engage and support the ecosystem and build toward collective scalable impact. \n\nOur primary work is focused on Lebanon, with expanding programs in the MENA/EuroMed regions and beyond. In recent years, AltCity was also the lead implementer of Bootcamp, a high-intensity early-stage startup program supported by the Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL) and AM Bank. AltCity also co-founded and managed to Elevate Impact Accelerator, in collaboration with UNICEF, focused on supporting innovation related to critical challenges facing young people in Lebanon and beyond. In addition, AltCity has worked with many local, regional, and international partners, including the Office of the Prime Minister (Lebanon), Google, Techstars, AM Bank, Beirut Digital District (BDD), Antwork, STEP Conference, Alfa (Orascom Telecom), touch (MTC / Zain Telecom), Middle East Venture Partners (MEVP), Cisco, Mercy Corps, the Netherlands Embassy in Lebanon, the UK Embassy in Lebanon, Arabnet, UK Lebanon Tech Hub, MIT Enterprise Forum of the Pan-Arab Region, Synergos, Canal France International (CFI), American University of Beirut (AUB) (and many other universities), Singularity University, and others. \n",

      "content": "Here's a writing sample from me, can you update the text so it sounds more like me? \"A few weeks ago, in Paris, I nearly got caught up with The Extinction Rebellion protestors getting teargassed right outside my doorstep. The country my family is from, Iraq, has been having protests have been going for months now with over 500 people killed. Lebanon’s Martyrs square, while full of protesters, has thankfully seen fewer killed. The Extinction Rebellion grows louder. It’s been about 10 years since the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring. In 2003, I remember being 18 years old and speaking in front of 3,000 people against the Iraqi invasion. Growing up in a college town, protests and demonstrations were commonplace, yet I’m wary of jumping into the crowd these days, especially when the crowd is angry.\n\nEach of these movements has so much history and potential positive action, yet somehow I find myself unable to understand my responsibility towards them. Make your voice heard is the idea. As Desmond Tutu once said, “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”\n\n“We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. The opposite of love is not hate, itâ€™s indifference.”\nâ€” Elie Wiesel\n\nThere’s a word I’ve been struggling to identify. It describes a situation where the more effort you put into something, the more tangled up you become in it. That somehow, when you’re caught in barbed wire, it’s best to stop moving, rather than struggle further and deepen the burrs. Perhaps this is the excuse I give myself to not act, not support, not back, not chant, not take to the streets. This fog has only grown thicker as the protests movements have moved closer and closer to home.\n\nIn response, I’ve recently become obsessed with learning about Gandhi. I’ve known he was an inspiration to Martin Luther King Junior and Mandela, who both led movements shifted the path of history towards one of greater justice. Yet, I never depend on my relationship with his thinking first hand. It surprised me to see how he was initially so keen on serving the British empire, how duty-bound he felt to support them in their time of need. How strict he was with himself to do what he believed was true.\n\nThe movie Gandhi which came out in 1982, paints him in a picture where he seemed to act for goodness or to support India’s liberation movement. What inspires me is that he saw his entire endeavor as seeking the truth. It’s still resolving for me, yet I’m beginning to understand the threads he makes between truth-seeking, seeing the other as the self, and nonviolent noncooperation.\n\nGandhi’s first experiments in communal living started after reading Unto This Last by Ruskin. which is essentially an economic and political argument the crux of which is equal pay for all work and free schooling for all people. It led him to make some conclusions about self-sufficiency and to start building what later became known as his first ashram in South Africa. I’m finding that proto villages, eco makerspaces, earth ships, hacker farms, rural co-living spaces, spiritual permaculture hubs and other similar type spaces have been inspiring me more in these last years. Although considering them as a social alternative seems to lead to a strange future where educated, upper-middle-class and tech-savvy people flee cities to take the place of the rural people who just left the farms for a better 20th-century life. The continuation of that trend seems to pave the way to a dystopian survivalist version of the future with micro governments (mobs?) rule principalities.\n\nGandhi was nationalistic, and he believed in an India ruled by its population. The injustice of the British empire was apparent to him. What are the fundamental injustices behind so many of our modern-day protest movements? Growing financial inequality, corruption — which to me can be seen as related to inequality in that it’s a sort of jealousy described as a call towards fairness and potential ecological collapse. To my mind, these are caught in a quagmire. It’s a bit like an escalating feud. Power leads to economic and political gain at the expense of people and environment. Then in the process of removing the offensive force, people desire the same power and economic gains at the expense – yet again – of the natural world and quite possibly abusing another class of people.\"",
