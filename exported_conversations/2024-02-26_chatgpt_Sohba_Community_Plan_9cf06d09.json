It's called the Suhba, S-U-H-B-A, for a Shaykh that I'm following, Shaykh Muhammad. I have been asked to help develop community around this group and to make it possible for us to utilize all of the skills and knowledge and talent in our group to make good things happen in the world. And I'm wondering if you can help me think through this and maybe listen to me think about the kind of principles of the community and the things that I'd like to implement and help me create some kind of proposal slash project plan slash outline. Are you ready to hear some more information?",

I don't know if it should be a proposal or a project plan or a timeline or an outline or a very simple one-pager or something. What's a very simple thing that has some principles maybe and some ideas about moving forward that makes it easier for people to collaborate and engage with and see things at a glance but not make it too long and cumbersome?

A good approach could be to create a one-page outline that includes the following elements:\n\n1. **Vision Statement**: Start with a brief statement defining the overall vision or goal of your community project. This sets the tone and direction.\n\n2. **Principles and Values**: List the core principles and values that guide your community. This ensures everyone is aligned on the ethos of the project.\n\n3. **Objectives**: Define specific, achievable objectives. These should be clear and measurable, helping to focus the community's efforts.\n\n4. **Action Plan**: Outline the key actions or steps to achieve these objectives. This can include roles, responsibilities, and a basic timeline.\n\n5. **Collaboration Tools**: Suggest tools or methods for collaboration. This could include regular meetings, online platforms, or other communication strategies.\n\n6. **Feedback and Adaptation**: Mention how the community will gather feedback and adapt the plan as needed. This shows that the plan is flexible and responsive.\n\nThis structure keeps it simple yet covers essential aspects. Each section should be succinct, focusing on the key points. Would you like to start fleshing out each section based on your community's specifics?",

There are many talented and busy people in the group. Some might be looking for jobs or wanting a change.\n\nSohba should be a place where we can see what's going on and meet others in different cities. We need an up-to-date map showing who is in the group. The map should be updated once a year. If you don't update, you're removed from the map. The map can show skills, needs, and projects.\n\nWe can also have a fundraising part. To join the community, you give one dollar a month. This money helps us do things. We need a team to decide how to use the funds.\n\nEvery quarter, we can have a meeting to see needs and resources. We try to help each other. The person organizing everything should get paid.",

      "content": "Yeah, I would like to add a few more things. I think that the community project is something that I'm following. We need to go slowly enough so that people can participate, but at a regular rhythm. Symbolize, and mimic, and set the rhythm and prayer in some tradition. And then, everything in this tradition happens in cycles. Once a year, it doesn't happen. It's a lifetime. It is time. Once a day, throughout the day, the sun is passing. There are moments of time. So, to add time to rhythms like that. I think it's about the principle of action and cooperation. And I hope you will think about how people do these sort of actions. Where we use people and ask a very simple question. But it should be, I was thinking of maybe the way of making everybody be part of interviewing rather than individual people in a sense of form, and fill out the form, and update the map. I feel like that should be a social way where a human part can communicate with another and listen for their needs. Helping people expose and express needs that they have. And I think that a community manager should be paid. I don't want to say non-profit. It's not even our business. We also need to strive for some structure. Because at some point, there should be some financial transactions that are going to be done. Where is the bank account? Who is going to own it? How are we going to make sure that people trust the people with the fundings? I was also thinking about how to have a subscription service. And at the very, very basic level, it would be zero dollars. And it could be a Patreon sort of thing, where we are each other's patrons. And it kind of reminds me of the Muslim Mirror for the Muslim. And also, the best of acting for those that are small, but consistent and continuous. And then, I'd like to find other things in the Muslim tradition that could be used to reference how to be doing and building stuff. And perhaps there are some things also about the Prophet's ability to create cohesive communities of action and engagement. And to make sure that we have agency unlocked for the people. And not just unlocked for the way it is. For the way it is. So we need to start with intent. At the beginning of the document, you definitely start with intent. Maybe start with a prayer. And maybe we have that in the beginning of every meeting. That way, we know what we're doing and why we're doing it. And we could even put that in people's calendars. And then there's the question we ask. Are there any technologies that we need to use to be able to have a community If we do not know what's up in the air, what's up in the sky, we just try to do as little as possible and use what we already do. Feel free to summarize this. Go through it step by step. Organize it into a meeting notes summary. And then, take it point by point and offer me your perspective on the best next steps to prepare this document.",

      "content": "Your vision for the Sohba community plan is rich in tradition, spiritual depth, and practicality. Integrating Islamic principles, establishing a rhythm that mimics prayer cycles, and focusing on human connection and community building are central to your approach. Let's organize these ideas into a structured plan.\n\n### Revised Sohba Community Plan Outline\n\n1. **Foundation of Intent and Tradition**\n   - **Opening with Intent and Prayer**: Begin the document and each meeting with a prayer or statement of intent, grounding activities in spiritual purpose.\n   - **Rhythmic Framework**: Align activities with the rhythms of daily prayers and annual cycles, symbolizing the natural flow of time and spiritual practice.\n\n2. **Community Building and Interaction**\n   - **Social Map Updating**: Transition the map update process into a social activity, encouraging human interaction and deeper understanding of each other’s needs.\n   - **Community Manager**: Appoint and compensate a community manager to facilitate these interactions and manage day-to-day operations.\n\n3. **Financial Structure and Transparency**\n   - **Varied Subscription Levels**: Implement a Patreon-like model with multiple subscription levels, starting from zero dollars.\n   - **Financial Oversight**: Establish clear guidelines for financial transactions, including bank account management and trust-building measures.\n\n4. **Technological Simplicity**\n   - **Minimalist Tech Approach**: Use existing technologies and minimize complexity, focusing on ease of use and accessibility for all members.\n\n5. **Incorporating Islamic Principles**\n   - **Prophetic Model**: Draw inspiration from the Prophet Muhammad’s methods of creating cohesive communities.\n   - **Continuous Small Acts**: Emphasize the value of small, consistent, and continuous actions, reflecting Islamic teachings.\n\n6. **Implementation and Adaptation**\n   - **Develop a Detailed Plan**: Incorporate these elements into a detailed project plan.\n   - **Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a process for regular feedback and adaptation, ensuring the plan evolves with the community's needs.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Detailing Each Section**: Flesh out each section with specifics, particularly focusing on the social aspects of map updates and the financial structure.\n2. **Consultation with Community Leaders**: Present the detailed plan to community leaders for initial feedback.\n3. **Finalizing the Plan**: Refine the plan based on feedback, ensuring it aligns with both practical needs and spiritual values.\n4. **Community Introduction**: Introduce the finalized plan to the community, focusing on its roots in Islamic tradition and its practical aspects.\n\n5. **Regular Review and Update**: Schedule periodic reviews of the plan to ensure it remains relevant and effective.\n\nThis outline balances spiritual principles with practical community needs, emphasizing human connection, financial transparency, and the importance of continuous small actions. It's a plan that seems to deeply reflect the values and aspirations of your community. What are your thoughts on this approach? Do you feel it captures the essence of what you're aiming for in Sohba?",

Let's explore a few that your project might be similar to:\n\n1. **Social Enterprises**: These are businesses that prioritize social good alongside profit. They operate like companies but reinvest profits back into their social missions. Social enterprises can effectively mobilize resources and people for community projects while maintaining financial sustainability.\n\n2. **Cooperatives**: Cooperatives are owned and run by their members, who could be employees, customers, or residents. They focus on serving the needs of their members rather than maximizing profits, often engaging in community-focused projects and resource sharing.\n\n3. **Community Interest Companies (CICs)**: In some countries, there are specific legal forms for social enterprises, like CICs in the UK, which use their profits and assets for public good. They can engage in various activities, from community development projects to providing essential services.\n\n4. **B Corporations**: B Corps are for-profit companies certified to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. They aim to solve social and environmental problems through business.\n\n5. **Crowdfunding Platforms**: Platforms like Kickstarter or GoFundMe allow individuals or groups to gather financial resources for specific projects or causes. While they are for-profit, they enable a wide range of community-focused and philanthropic projects.\n\n6. **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Initiatives**: Many for-profit companies run CSR programs that focus on contributing to societal goals, often by dedicating resources to community projects or sustainable development goals.\n\n7. **Innovation Hubs or Incubators**: These platforms support entrepreneurs and startups, often focusing on social innovation or community development projects. They provide resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities.\n\nYour idea can certainly be structured as a company rather than a non-profit, especially if you plan to generate revenue through services, memberships, or products. This structure might offer more flexibility and sustainability compared to a traditional non-profit, especially in terms of funding and scalability. However, the choice depends on your specific goals, the needs of your community, and how you envision the impact of your project.",

And is there a way of creating some idea, space, that is kind of small, and internal, that would be able to go and do all these other things that could contain the fundamental principles? So, in all of this, try to understand, what is the fundamental principle of your thinking, and maybe you can come up with that list, and then see if you can come up with a much more streamlined, kernel, key, DNA, of the idea.

You're also considering creating a focused, internal idea space that encapsulates the core principles of this project. Let's break this down into actionable steps:\n\n### Identifying Fundamental Principles\n\n1. **Core Vision**: What is the primary goal or vision of your project? This could be related to community organization, societal change, technological integration, etc.\n\n2. **Key Values**: What values are central to this project? These could include transparency, innovation, collaboration, empowerment, etc.\n\n3. **Strategic Objectives**: What specific objectives will guide the project? These should be aligned with your core vision and values.\n\n4. **Role of Technology**: How do you envision the role of advanced technologies like GPT-7 in your project? Consider both the opportunities and challenges they present.\n\n5. **Scope and Scale**: Are you focusing on a local, regional, or global scale? This will influence the nature and reach of your activities.\n\n### Streamlining the Core Idea\n\n1. **Simplification**: Distill the project down to its essence. What is the 'kernel' or 'DNA' of the idea? This helps in creating a focused and powerful concept.\n\n2. **Alignment**: Ensure all elements of your project align with the identified core vision and values.\n\n### Choosing the Right Format for Documentation\n\n1. **Document Type**: Depending on the nature of your project, this could be a strategic plan, a project proposal, a white paper, or even a manifesto.\n\n2. **Content Structure**: Outline the document to include an introduction to the vision, detailed discussion of the principles and objectives, the role of technology, and a strategic roadmap.\n\n3. **Engagement and Accessibility**: Consider how your document will engage its intended audience. It should be comprehensible, compelling, and accessible.\n\n### Collaborative Critique\n\n1. **Draft Creation**: Develop a first draft based on the above structure.\n\n2. **Feedback Loop**: Share the draft with trusted peers or advisors for feedback. Collaborative critique is crucial for refining and strengthening the document.\n\n3. **Revision and Finalization**: Incorporate feedback and refine the document until it clearly and effectively communicates your vision and plan.\n\nYour project appears to have a profound and potentially far-reaching impact. It's important to balance deep, philosophical or strategic thinking with practical, actionable steps. By starting with the fundamental principles and gradually building a structured document, you can effectively communicate and implement your vision.\n\nWould you like to start by fleshing out the core vision and key values, or do you have a different preference for beginning this process?",

      "content": "Well, I guess the current challenges are that people know the people that are in the community around them. The communities are not very well interconnected. People don't really know who is in Jamaica, for instance. And also, there isn't a lot of action. It seems like people like to gather. They have a need for connection. And that doesn't seem to be turning into any direct sort of action, or collaborations, or projects. And it might be that we need to do some interviews to learn more about why this is happening. Maybe people see this as a social space. But maybe it's because they don't know how, or if they have permission to be able to do things, or if they need to have more permission. Because the community is centered around the Sheikh. And the Sheikh is not very demanding, or very consistent on things. He kind of lets things be as they are, and is much more quiet. So the feeling is that maybe some people don't really know if they can do things together with others, or if they can ask for addresses. And maybe there's some privacy concerns, because it's a religious and spiritual community. And maybe people don't really want to put things out there so publicly. So maybe this is one of the reasons why we need to be able to create an app, or maybe anonymous profiles, where you can actually get in touch with people only after you request getting in touch, and if they accept it. But to still be able to see everybody on the map, but not exactly their public names, and personas, and profiles. And we need to be able to debug this challenge and find other ways of doing it. I'm sure there are other challenges I'm not thinking about right now. But I can ask people as I'm learning more about the project.",

      "content": "Yeah, although when you come up with challenges like this, I also prefer if you push back a little bit and give me some constructive criticism and suggest potentially not necessarily needing to make an app because I can imagine doing this on Airtable or on another system or even on pieces of paper and pencil and somehow making it much more easy to operate without building a whole app. So some of the other solutions for some of the different challenges could be letting things grow slowly, making it possible that people see and connect with trusted faces, and having trusted faces rotating or something. I'm not exactly sure, but I feel like there's a way where if someone is like king for life, it's kind of sketch, but when there's a rotation and like a training period and people actually are switching roles and there's like a coordinator, sure, and you can trust and build connection to it, but part of the problem with these types of communities is that let's say that the sheikh dies or let's say that any of the other people that are organizing or coordinating this thing pass on. Where is the leadership? So we do need to think about distributed leadership or distributing leadership in a way where there's actually some things that are consistent and then other places where things can change. For instance, there's definitely got to be somebody that is the touch point and maybe it's the email address, but also we need to learn from other organizations that have systematized and processized these things so that they aren't so personality driven, which is one of the big dangers of these spiritual communities. And so how does this thing, even the projects, I think needs to be less personality driven and more intention and motivation driven and to have it be a place where intentions can meet and resources can flow and be less dependent on attitudes. And of course, leader fluidity is super important, but there has to be a leader at all times, but the baton needs to be passed. So initiatives that don't have leaders that are willing to commit to showing up in person or online for a little bit will probably need to drop their initiatives from the map, you know, and it's just the people that are able to coordinate and commit. And if it's not them, there's idea people, but then there's like strategy and structure and like holding down the fort people. And we need to know who's a holding down the fort kind of person that has the capacity for being slow and intentional and opening space for people to speak and to contribute their ideas versus people that are just like, I have an idea, I want to do something. And then you can see some of my presentation from the project that I pitched at the Open Source Hardware Summit in 2016 for more information about making Open Source a hospitality platform for welcoming people. So can you summarize these ideas and be sure that when you respond back to the constructive and to have some criticism, but don't just accept what I say because I need someone to help me think, not just what I said.",

      "content": "You've raised several important points and considerations for the Sohbah community project. Here's a summary with some constructive feedback and potential alternatives:\n\n1. **Alternatives to Building an App**: While an app could offer customized features, there are simpler, cost-effective solutions. Using existing platforms like Airtable could facilitate data organization and sharing without the complexity and expense of app development. Paper and pencil, though more rudimentary, emphasize accessibility and simplicity. It's crucial to weigh the cost-benefit of developing a new tool versus adapting existing ones.\n\n2. **Growth and Connection**: Encouraging slow, organic growth and connections through trusted faces is a good approach. However, consider the scalability of this method. As the community grows, relying solely on personal connections might limit wider engagement.\n\n3. **Rotating Leadership**: The idea of rotating leadership to avoid over-dependence on specific individuals is insightful. It could democratize the community, encourage diverse perspectives, and ensure continuity. However, this requires clear guidelines and training to ensure each new leader is prepared.\n\n4. **Addressing Leadership Vacuum**: Planning for leadership succession is crucial. Your concern about the potential absence of key figures is valid. Establishing a distributed leadership model can help mitigate this risk. This involves identifying and nurturing potential leaders continuously.\n\n5. **Personality-Driven vs. Intention-Driven Approach**: Shifting from a personality-driven to an intention/motivation-driven approach is a significant move. It can make the community more inclusive and focused on shared goals rather than individual charisma. This requires setting clear community goals and values that transcend individual personalities.\n\n6. **Leader Fluidity with Consistency**: Balancing fluid leadership with the need for consistent direction is challenging. Having a permanent point of contact (like an email address) alongside rotating leaders might provide stability without stagnation.\n\n7. **Project Commitment**: Your idea to have initiative leaders commit to a certain level of involvement is crucial for accountability. This ensures that projects on the map are active and have reliable coordination.\n\n8. **Distinguishing Roles**: Identifying members who are \"idea people\" versus those who can \"hold down the fort\" is important for effective team dynamics. Understanding and leveraging these different capacities can enhance productivity and project success.\n\n9. **Learning from Other Organizations**: It's beneficial to study how other organizations have managed leadership and community dynamics, especially in the context of spiritual or volunteer-driven groups. This can provide insights into sustainable community building and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\n10. **Your Open Source Hardware Summit Presentation**: This could be a valuable resource. If it contains relevant principles or strategies, consider how they might be adapted to the current context.\n\nOverall, while your ideas have strong foundations, it's important to balance innovation with practicality. Leveraging existing tools and frameworks, clarifying roles and commitments, and ensuring leadership continuity without over-reliance on specific personalities are key. Each step should be evaluated for its feasibility and impact on the community's cohesion and effectiveness.\n\nWould you like to delve deeper into any of these areas, or is there another aspect of the project you'd like to explore next?",

That's the fundamental question and the intention i recommend putting at the top. I also recommend a suggestion to come up with a reminder of our intention and a prayer at the start of each meeting. And perhaps we meet on the white days, where the light is clearest so we can see clearly where we are and ask for Gods help to know where to go. I think we should also have a questions section where we have questions, and what the smallest first steps are. also a \"team\" section, right now it's just me and \"Sheikh Abdul Qadir\" ",

They serve as a guide for Muslims in various aspects of life, including being a force for positive change in the world. Here are some notable hadiths and teachings from the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that emphasize the importance of positive change, especially as a group:\n\n1. **Collective Responsibility**: \n   - \"The believers, in their love, mercy, and kindness to one another are like a body: if one part of it is in pain, the whole body joins it in staying awake and suffering fever.\" (Bukhari and Muslim)\n   - This hadith emphasizes the concept of collective responsibility and the importance of empathy and support within the community.\n\n2. **Promoting Good and Preventing Evil**: \n   - \"Whoever among you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand; if he is not able to do so, then [he must change it] with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart — and that is the weakest of faith.\" (Muslim)\n   - This teaching underscores the importance of actively working to promote good and prevent wrongdoing in society.\n\n3. **Importance of Unity and Cooperation**:\n   - \"A believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other.\" (Bukhari)\n   - The Prophet highlights the strength that comes from unity and cooperation among believers.\n\n4. **Encouragement to Seek Knowledge and Apply It for Benefit**:\n   - \"Seeking knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim.\" (Ibn Majah)\n   - Knowledge is viewed as a key component for positive change, and Muslims are encouraged to seek and use knowledge for the betterment of society.\n\n5. **Service to Others**:\n   - \"The best among you are those who bring greatest benefits to many others.\" (Hadith Qudsi)\n   - This hadith encourages Muslims to actively work for the benefit of others, reinforcing the idea of positive societal change.\n\n6. **Enjoining Patience and Perseverance**:\n   - \"How wonderful is the case of a believer; there is good for him in everything and this applies only to a believer. If prosperity attends him, he expresses gratitude to Allah and that is good for him; and if adversity befalls him, he endures it patiently and that is better for him.\" (Muslim)\n   - Patience and perseverance are key virtues in Islam, especially when working towards positive change which often requires overcoming challenges and obstacles.\n\nThese teachings collectively encourage Muslims to be proactive in their communities, to work together in unity, and to be persistent in their efforts to enact positive change. They highlight the importance of collective action, empathy, knowledge, and perseverance in the pursuit of a better world.",

      "content": "The phrase \"وَتَعَاوَنُوا\" (Wa Ta'awanu), which translates to \"and cooperate\" in English, is from Surah Al-Ma'idah (Chapter 5, Verse 2) of the Quran. This particular verse emphasizes the importance of cooperation in righteousness and piety, and it is often cited to encourage collaborative efforts in doing good and avoiding sin. The full verse is:\n\nوَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ\n\nTranslation: \"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.\"\n\nThis verse is a fundamental guiding principle in Islamic ethics, highlighting the importance of working together towards good and righteous deeds while avoiding collaboration in harmful or sinful actions. It serves as a foundational concept for communal harmony and mutual support in achieving collective and individual piety.",

He does not oppress him nor does he abandon him.\" This hadith emphasizes mutual support and solidarity among Muslims.\n   - **Hadith on Helping Others:** \"Whoever relieves a believer's distress of the distressful aspects of this world, Allah will rescue him from a difficulty of the difficulties of the Hereafter...\" (Sahih Muslim). This hadith underscores the importance of supporting each other in times of need.\n   - **Hadith on Cooperation:** The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said, \"The believers, in their mutual kindness, compassion, and sympathy, are just like one body. When any part of the body suffers, the whole body feels pain.\" This metaphor illustrates the concept of mutual support and empathy within the Muslim community.\n\nThese references from the Quran and Hadith collectively highlight the significance of cooperation, mutual support, and community spirit in Islam, emphasizing the importance of working together towards common goals, supporting each other in times of need, and maintaining unity and brotherhood.",

These teachings are derived from the Quran, Hadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad), and the broader Islamic ethos:\n\n1. **Being a Source of Benefit**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said, “The best of people are those that bring most benefit to the rest of mankind.” (Daraqutni, Hasan)\n\n2. **Social Responsibility and Community Service**: Islam places great emphasis on the importance of serving one’s community and helping those in need. The Quran states, “And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.” (Quran 2:195)\n\n3. **The Concept of Ummah**: The idea of Ummah in Islam is the concept of a global community of Muslims bound together by ties of religion. This concept encourages unity, mutual support, and responsibility towards each other.\n\n4. **Justice and Fairness**: The Quran says, “O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives.” (Quran 4:135) This highlights the importance of justice and fairness in all aspects of life.\n\n5. **Kindness and Compassion**: “And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.” (Quran 21:107) This verse highlights the Prophet’s role as a mercy to all, and Muslims are encouraged to emulate this characteristic in their daily lives.\n\n6. **Environmental Stewardship**: Islam teaches the importance of caring for the Earth and its resources. The Prophet Muhammad said, “The world is green and beautiful, and Allah has appointed you his stewards over it.” (Hadith)\n\n7. **Adaptability and Resilience**: Islamic teachings encourage resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges, akin to the metaphor of a plant thriving wherever it is planted.\n\n8. **Seeking Knowledge and Wisdom**: The pursuit of knowledge is highly regarded in Islam, with a famous hadith stating, “Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.” (Ibn Majah)\n\n9. **Cooperation in Righteousness and Piety**: The Quran encourages cooperation in acts of goodness and piety, “And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.” (Quran 5:2)\n\nThese principles and teachings collectively form an ethos that encourages Muslims to be proactive, beneficial, and constructive members of society, wherever they may find themselves.",

It refers to a kind of continuity of spiritual presence and revelation that begins with God and flows through that and those closest to God. This concept is often associated with using one’s time wisely and efficiently for good deeds, emphasizing the idea of not delaying or wasting time.\n\nThese teachings collectively encourage Muslims to act promptly and make the most of their time, emphasizing the unpredictability of life and the importance of seizing opportunities for good deeds when they arise.",

Let's start by highlighting five positive aspects (the \"good\") and five areas that could be improved (the \"bad\"), followed by suggestions for each.\n\n### Good Aspects:\n1. **Community Focus**: Your vision emphasizes the importance of community and mutual support, which is central to the ethos of the Shia community.\n2. **Spiritual Alignment**: You've incorporated spiritual and religious elements, like Quranic verses and Hadith, aligning the project with the community's faith and values.\n3. **Intention of Action**: The emphasis on moving from social gatherings to actionable projects is a practical approach to community development.\n4. **Leadership and Rotation**: The idea of rotating leadership and distributed responsibilities is innovative and can prevent dependence on single individuals.\n5. **Privacy and Anonymity**: Considering privacy in the community, especially for an app or digital platform, shows sensitivity to members' needs and cultural norms.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Lack of Clear Structure**: While the vision is spiritually and communally aligned, there seems to be a lack of clear structure in how the community will operationalize these ideas.\n2. **Risk of Over-Complexity**: The project could become overly complex with too many ideas and not enough focus.\n3. **Digital Platform Dependence**: Relying heavily on an app or digital solution might exclude those who are less tech-savvy or have limited access to technology.\n4. **Uncertainty in Member Engagement**: There's a concern about how to effectively engage members in active participation and leadership roles.\n5. **Balancing Spiritual and Practical Aspects**: While the project is spiritually grounded, there might be challenges in balancing the spiritual objectives with practical, actionable goals.\n\n### Mitigating the Bad:\n1. **Develop a Clear Roadmap**: Create a step-by-step plan or framework that outlines how the community can transition from ideas to action.\n2. **Prioritize and Simplify**: Focus on a few key initiatives first, to prevent over-complication.\n3. **Hybrid Solutions**: Combine digital and physical meeting platforms to include a broader range of community members.\n4. **Engagement Strategies**: Develop strategies to actively engage and motivate members, possibly through incentives or recognition of contributions.\n5. **Balance Workshops**: Organize workshops or discussions that help bridge the gap between spiritual intentions and practical execution.\n\n### Enhancing the Good:\n1. **Strengthen Community Connections**: Facilitate more opportunities for members to connect and collaborate, both online and offline.\n2. **Deepen Spiritual Integration**: Integrate more spiritual teachings and practices into the community's activities to reinforce its foundational values.\n3. **Transparent Communication**: Regularly update the community on projects and initiatives to foster a sense of ownership and participation.\n4. **Leadership Training**: Offer training for potential leaders to build confidence and skills for rotating leadership roles.\n5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a system for members to provide feedback and suggestions, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with community needs.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the project can better align with the community's needs and values while ensuring practical, actionable outcomes.",

It was related by al-Bukhari.\n\nعَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: \" إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ قَالَ: مَنْ عَادَى لِي وَلِيًّا، فَقَدْ آذَنْتُهُ بِالْحَرْبِ، وَمَا تَقَرَّبَ إِلَيَّ عَبْدِي بِشَيْءٍ أَحَبَّ إِلَيَّ مِمَّا افْتَرَضْتُ عَلَيْهِ، وَمَا يَزَالُ عَبْدِي يَتَقَرَّبُ إِلَيَّ بِالنَّوَافِلِ حَتَّى أُحِبَّهُ، فَإِذَا أَحْبَبْتُهُ، كُنْتُ سَمْعَهُ الَّذِي يَسْمَعُ بِهِ، وَبَصَرَهُ الَّذِي يُبْصِرُ بِهِ، وَيَدَهُ الَّتِي يَبْطِشُ بِهَا، وَرِجْلَهُ الَّتِي يَمْشِي بِهَا، وَإِنْ سَأَلَنِي لَأُعْطِيَنَّهُ، وَلَئِنْ اسْتَعَاذَنِي لَأُعِيذَنَّهُ، وَمَا تَرَدَّدْتُ عَنْ شَيْءٍ أَنَا فَاعِلُهُ تَرَدُّدِي عَنْ نَفْسِ عَبْدِي الْمُؤْمِنِ، يَكْرَهُ الْمَوْتَ وَأَنَا أَكْرَهُ مَسَاءَتَهُ\" \nرواه البخاري\nSo what are we commanded in terms of community?\n\nوَتَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلْبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ ۚ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ\n“Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.

Allah is at the back of a servant so long as the servant is at the back of his brother, and he who treads the path in search of knowledge, Allah would make that path easy, leading to Paradise for him and those persons who assemble in the house among the houses of Allah (mosques) and recite the Book of Allah and they learn and teach the Qur'an (among themselves) there would descend upon them tranquility and mercy would cover them and the angels would surround them and Allah mentions them in the presence of those near Him, and he who is slow-paced in doing good deeds, his (high) lineage does not make him go ahead.

We do this to fulfill the command of our Lord in the Quran and to follow our model, the best of creation who, through his life, demonstrated how the path of Islam-Iman-Ihsan leads us to relieve suffering and enhance goodness. \n\n\n\nVision\nOur vision is to enact mercy and goodness in our gatherings, holding fast to the rope of God, and seeking His guidance in all our endeavors. We aspire to create a space to collectively grow and support each other in positive and beautiful Ihsani action.\nRhythm of Meetings of the Community Team\nWe propose to meet monthly on the white days, where the light is clearest, symbolizing clarity and divine guidance in our discussions and decisions.\nStart With Prayer and Remembrance\nEach meeting will commence with a prayer and a reminder of our intention. This practice will help us stay focused on our purpose, seek blessings in our endeavors, and remain aligned with our intention\nFirst Steps:\n- Sheikh Abdul Qadir, please review this document and together determine a meeting to discuss next steps.\n- Agree on principles, questions and intentions document, then move on to strategy in the next meeting. \n- My guess for the first step is to find a few other organizers and work on designing the map-collecting process - and in this way, interview people to understand more about what the suhba community can be and what we can do/expect from each other. \nPrinciples\n- Ubuntu, going far by going together. 535 - يَدُ اللَّهِ مَعَ الجَماعَةِ\n- Patience\n- Do not rush\n- To be proactive\nSahih Muslim: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Hasten to do good deeds before you are overtaken by one of the seven afflictions.\" Then he listed: \"Are you waiting for such poverty which will make you unmindful of devotion, or prosperity which will make you corrupt, or a disease which will disable you, or such senility as will make you mentally unstable, or sudden death, or the Dajjal who is the worst expected, or the Hour; and the Hour will be most grievous and most bitter.\"\nالوقت كالسيف إن لم تقطعه قطعك\nIt means \"Manage your time wisely and don't waste it\"\nيستجاب لأحدكم ما لم يعجل‏:‏ يقول‏:‏ قد دعوت ربي، فلم يستجب لي\n“The Du’a of every one of you will be granted so long as he does not become hasty by saying: ‘I have made Du’a but it has not been answered’.”[11]\nقد كان مَن قبلَكم يُؤخَذُ الرجلُ فيُحفَرُ له في الأرض، فيُجعل فيها، ثم يؤتى بالمِنشار، فيوضعُ على رأسه، فيُجعَلُ نصفَيْنِ، ويمشَّطُ بأمشاط الحديد ما دون لحمِه وعظمِه، ما يصدُّه ذلك عن دينه، واللهِ ليُتمَّنَّ الله هذا الأمر حتى يسيرَ الراكبُ من صنعاءَ إلى حضرموتَ، لا يخافُ إلا اللهَ، والذئبَ على غنمه، ولكنكم تستعجلون\n“There were people before you who would be detained. Then, a pit would be dug for them, which they’d be placed in. Then, a saw would be placed in the middle of their heads and sawedinto two pieces. Their flesh would also be torn away from their bones using iron combs, and despite this, it would not deter them from their religion. By Allāh! Allāh will bring this religion to its completion until a rider will be able to travel from San’ā to Ḥaḍramawt (two cities in Yemen) fearing none except Allāh, and except the wolf for his sheep (i.e. Muslims will govern this region, hence no one will be feared but Allāh), but you are in a hurry.”[15]\n- Become trustworthy. Privacy, and anonymity/pseudonymity are important. \n- Reduce “bottlenecks” - a single point of failure—also, no cult of personality.\n- Help people find their agency and know the limits, obligations, expectations, and permissions. (goes into questions doc) \n- Do things mirroring the creation of God, balanced, and through the harmonies of nature (for instance moon/monthly/seasonal meetings, meeting at “asr” not at 4:30, etc. \n- Duplicate the good (do more of what is already working). \n- Connect personally to gather information > sending forms asking people to fill them out. We’ll get better quality information.\nMaybe: - We need people to be active members of the community. We will drop people if we don’t get updates in a year. \n- Encourage local meetups/gatherings\n- Ihsan/Professionalism. If you give your word, please do it. (know what you can do with Ihsan, and where you need resources/other people) \n- Rahma rahma rahma.\n\nTeam (so far)\n- Bilal, France\n- Sheikh Abdul Qadir, Garmany\n- Hana (UK) \nRoles we need\n- More facilitators\n- Someone project managing/coordination. \nQuestions\n- What key questions must we address in our gatherings?\n- Should we set up a bank account if we want to be able to receive donations and disbursements?\n- What if membership required a minimum 1$ a month donation for your membership to be active if you can afford it (free for those who request)? That way, we can have a regular monthly income to use for coordination efforts, saving, and building a waqf. \n- What are the smallest first steps we can take towards our vision?\n- Who is the “imam” of this project? Every group needs a leader (even temporarily, and if it will change) \n- Should we have a shura council to help with decisions? How will it be organized?\n- Should the funds be disbursed by competition, quarterly shura meetings, or other fundraising projects?\n- How can we benefit from each other’s skills? (jobs board? Teaching each other?) \n- How do we help people realize they have much to contribute and can?\n- How do we make it ok for people to set good intentions, do things, make mistakes, and then ask for forgiveness and make more mistakes?\n- Can we get people to teach each other about projects, actions, etc - should we also have a monthly educational video meeting? (I can do something on public speaking and pitching ideas or writing grants to the UN)\n- Maybe we should have an opportunities board for things to apply for?\n- Should we run an idea accelerator? (I run accelerator projects) \nOr do something like \n- Helping people find their agency and know the limits, obligations, expectations, and permissions it takes to do things with the suhba. How can we make it easy to collaborate, and fun, and resourced.\n- I think perhaps there should be one paid position for this initiative minimally, and perhaps more - dependant on fundraising. \n\nThe daily grant program from the https://thepollinationproject.org/apply\n- Should we help people with ideas learn about how to become more entrepreneurial and implement those ideas? Rather than just funding people, should we work earlier in the idea->project value chain?\n- What if we helped duplicate good idea that exist and fund them for people to clone, sort of like changex.org\n\n- How can we have a waqf established that will allow us to have a profit of about 365k a year to allow us to disburse 1000 a day?\n- if we start a waqf and fuel it with community fundraised funds what structure should it take. Who in our community knows about wuquf? Where is the bank, etc \n- What feedback mechanism is needed\n- Who can intervene if there is conflict? \nHow do we ensure clean handling of all aspects and funds?\n- How do we get the blessing in our time?\n",

      "content": "Reviewing the Sheikh Mohammed Suhba Community Activation Plan, here are some constructive criticisms and suggestions:\n\n### Positive Aspects:\n1. **Strong Spiritual Foundation**: The plan is deeply rooted in Islamic teachings, effectively using Quranic verses and Hadiths to guide its vision and principles.\n2. **Community-Centric Approach**: Focusing on community engagement and action for good is commendable and aligns well with Islamic values of mutual support.\n3. **Intention-Driven Framework**: Starting meetings with prayer and remembrance sets a spiritually focused tone, enhancing purposefulness.\n4. **Emphasis on Action and Participation**: Encouraging active participation and identifying roles within the community is a proactive approach.\n5. **Inclusion of Practical Questions**: Addressing practical matters like funding, leadership, and conflict resolution demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of organizational needs.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Structure and Clarity**: The plan could benefit from a more structured format, breaking down goals and strategies into clearer, more actionable steps.\n2. **Balancing Spiritual and Operational Aspects**: While the spiritual basis is strong, the plan needs a more detailed operational strategy to actualize its vision.\n3. **Engagement and Outreach Strategies**: Specific strategies for engaging community members and encouraging participation are not clearly outlined.\n4. **Risk of Over-Complication**: The wide range of ideas and questions might overwhelm members; prioritizing and simplifying them could be beneficial.\n5. **Long-Term Sustainability**: The plan should include more concrete steps for long-term sustainability, particularly regarding funding and project management.\n\n### Mitigating the Bad:\n1. **Develop a Clear Operational Plan**: Outline specific, achievable goals, and steps to realize the vision.\n2. **Streamline and Prioritize Initiatives**: Focus on a few key initiatives to avoid over-complication and gradually expand as the community develops.\n3. **Concrete Engagement Tactics**: Develop specific strategies for member recruitment, engagement, and retention.\n4. **Establish Clear Leadership and Roles**: Define roles and responsibilities more clearly to ensure effective governance and accountability.\n5. **Long-Term Funding Strategy**: Explore sustainable funding options, including a detailed plan for the proposed waqf.\n\n### Enhancing the Good:\n1. **Strengthen Community Collaboration**: Facilitate more collaborative projects and initiatives that align with community interests and skills.\n2. **Deepen Spiritual Integration**: Incorporate more structured spiritual activities and discussions into meetings and community events.\n3. **Leverage Digital Platforms for Engagement**: Use online tools for broader reach and engagement, such as virtual meetings, webinars, and collaborative platforms.\n4. **Skill Development and Knowledge Sharing**: Encourage and organize skill-sharing sessions and workshops to foster personal and community growth.\n5. **Transparent Communication and Feedback**: Establish regular communication channels and feedback mechanisms to ensure community voices are heard and acted upon.\n\nThis plan has the potential to significantly impact the Suhba community positively. With some structural adjustments and a focus on practical implementation strategies, it can effectively translate its spiritual vision into meaningful community action and development.",

      "content": "To improve the document effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step plan, prioritizing actions in a logical and efficient manner:\n\n1. **Clarify the Purpose and Audience**: Understanding the main goal of the document and who the intended audience is will guide all subsequent revisions. This comes first because it sets the direction for all other improvements. Are we addressing experts or laypeople? Is the goal to inform, persuade, or instruct?\n\n2. **Assess Structure and Organization**: Review the overall structure. Is the information presented in a logical order? Does the document flow smoothly from one point to the next? This step is crucial because a well-organized document is easier to understand and follow. Look for areas where the argument or narrative jumps around or gets lost.\n\n3. **Refine the Content for Clarity and Relevance**: Once the structure is solid, focus on the content within each section. Ensure that all information is relevant to the document's purpose and audience. This might involve removing superfluous details, elaborating on under-explained points, or rephrasing for clarity. This step is key to making the document informative and engaging.\n\n4. **Improve Readability**: Adjust the language, tone, and style to suit the audience. This includes simplifying jargon, adjusting sentence length, and ensuring consistency in voice. Readability is crucial for keeping the audience engaged and making sure the content is accessible to them.\n\n5. **Visual Elements and Formatting**: Review and enhance any visual elements like charts, graphs, or images. Ensure they are clear, relevant, and properly labeled. Also, check the formatting for consistency in font size, headings, and spacing. Good visual presentation supports the text and makes the document more appealing and easier to navigate.\n\n6. **Proofread for Grammar and Spelling**: This comes later in the process because it's more efficient to correct grammar and spelling errors after the major revisions are done. A document free of grammatical errors and typos is more credible and professional.\n\n7. **Feedback and Review**: Before finalizing, get feedback from others, preferably those who represent the document's target audience. They can provide valuable insights on how well the document achieves its purpose and how it might be further improved.\n\n8. **Final Revisions**: Incorporate the feedback and make final adjustments. This might involve revisiting earlier steps, but with the input from the review, these revisions should be more targeted and effective.\n\n9. **Final Proofread**: A final check for any overlooked errors in grammar, spelling, or formatting. This ensures that the document is polished and professional.\n\nThis plan follows a logical progression from the macro (purpose and structure) to the micro (language and grammar), ensuring that each step builds upon the previous one. By addressing the bigger issues first, we avoid wasting time perfecting details in sections that might later be revised or removed. Each step is essential for creating a clear, coherent, and effective document.",

      "content": "Certainly! To assist with step two, we'll focus on assessing and enhancing the structure and organization of your document to ensure it's logically presented and flows smoothly. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n### Step 2: Assess Structure and Organization\n\n#### 1. **Read Through for Initial Impressions**\n   - **Action**: Read the document from start to finish without making any changes. This helps in understanding the overall flow and identifying any obvious structural issues.\n   - **Focus**: Look for places where you feel lost, confused, or where the document seems to jump topics abruptly.\n\n#### 2. **Outline the Current Structure**\n   - **Action**: Create an outline of your current document. Break it down by sections or paragraphs.\n   - **Focus**: Note the main point or purpose of each section. This will reveal how each part contributes to the document's overall goal.\n\n#### 3. **Evaluate Logical Flow**\n   - **Action**: Assess if each section logically leads to the next. Check for logical progression in your argument or narrative.\n   - **Focus**: Look for gaps in logic or information, and note any sections that seem out of place.\n\n#### 4. **Identify Redundancies and Gaps**\n   - **Action**: Highlight any repetitive information or arguments. Similarly, identify areas that need more information or explanation.\n   - **Focus**: Ensure each section adds unique value and the document doesn’t circle back on itself without progressing.\n\n#### 5. **Consider Chronology and Causality (if applicable)**\n   - **Action**: If your document involves processes or timelines, ensure they are presented chronologically and causes lead to their effects logically.\n   - **Focus**: Watch for any deviations from the chronological order that might confuse the reader.\n\n#### 6. **Reorganize for Clarity and Flow**\n   - **Action**: Based on your findings, rearrange sections or paragraphs to improve logical flow. Sometimes, introducing subheadings can also help in organizing content.\n   - **Focus**: Aim for a structure that guides the reader naturally from one point to the next.\n\n#### 7. **Draft Transitions between Sections**\n   - **Action**: Write transition sentences between sections or paragraphs. These will help in guiding Shaykh Abdul Qader through the document smoothly.\n   - **Focus**: Ensure transitions are clear and indicate why the reader is moving from one point to the next.\n\n#### 8. **Seek Feedback on Structure**\n   - **Action**: If possible, have someone else read your document. They can offer insights on how effectively the document flows.\n   - **Focus**: Ask specifically about how easy it is to follow the logic and structure of the document.\n\n#### 9. **Revise as Needed**\n   - **Action**: Incorporate any feedback and make final adjustments to the structure.\n   - **Focus**: Keep in mind the purpose and ensure that each part aligns with this goal.\n\n#### 10. **Final Read-Through for Structure**\n   - **Action**: Do one more thorough read, focusing solely on the flow and structure.\n   - **Focus**: Confirm that the document now moves logically and smoothly from introduction to conclusion.\n\n### Notes:\n- **Patience and Iteration**: Remember that perfecting the structure may require several iterations. Be patient and open to rearranging content as needed.\n- **Alignment with Purpose**: Constantly relate changes back to your main purpose – aligning with Shaykh Abdul Qader on the way forward. Each section should serve this goal.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that your document is well-organized and logically coherent, making it more effective in achieving its purpose with Shaykh Abdul Qader.",

We do this, recognizing that this is a command from our lord. We know that we don’t get closer to God(SWT) with anything more beloved to him than his commandments. \n\nOn the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\nAllah (mighty and sublime be He) said: Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about [seizing] the soul of My faithful servant: he hates death and I hate hurting him. It was related by al-Bukhari.\n\nعَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: \" إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ قَالَ: مَنْ عَادَى لِي وَلِيًّا، فَقَدْ آذَنْتُهُ بِالْحَرْبِ، وَمَا تَقَرَّبَ إِلَيَّ عَبْدِي بِشَيْءٍ أَحَبَّ إِلَيَّ مِمَّا افْتَرَضْتُ عَلَيْهِ، وَمَا يَزَالُ عَبْدِي يَتَقَرَّبُ إِلَيَّ بِالنَّوَافِلِ حَتَّى أُحِبَّهُ، فَإِذَا أَحْبَبْتُهُ، كُنْتُ سَمْعَهُ الَّذِي يَسْمَعُ بِهِ، وَبَصَرَهُ الَّذِي يُبْصِرُ بِهِ، وَيَدَهُ الَّتِي يَبْطِشُ بِهَا، وَرِجْلَهُ الَّتِي يَمْشِي بِهَا، وَإِنْ سَأَلَنِي لَأُعْطِيَنَّهُ، وَلَئِنْ اسْتَعَاذَنِي لَأُعِيذَنَّهُ، وَمَا تَرَدَّدْتُ عَنْ شَيْءٍ أَنَا فَاعِلُهُ تَرَدُّدِي عَنْ نَفْسِ عَبْدِي الْمُؤْمِنِ، يَكْرَهُ الْمَوْتَ وَأَنَا أَكْرَهُ مَسَاءَتَهُ\" \nرواه البخاري\nSo what are we commanded in terms of community?\n\nوَتَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلْبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ ۚ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ\n“Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And be mindful of Allah.”\n\nكُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ ۗ وَلَوْ ءَامَنَ أَهْلُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ لَكَانَ خَيْرًۭا لَّهُم ۚ مِّنْهُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمُ ٱلْفَـٰسِقُونَ ١١٠\nYou are the best community ever raised for humanity—you encourage good, forbid evil, and believe in Allah. Had the People of the Book believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are faithful, but most are rebellious. 3-110\n\nإِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا۟ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ ٣\nexcept those who have faith, do good, and urge each other to the truth, and urge each other to perseverance. 103-3\n\nوَٱلَّذِينَ جَـٰهَدُوا۟ فِينَا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا ۚ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَمَعَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ ٦٩\nBut We shall be sure to guide to Our ways those who strive hard for Our cause: God is with those who do good.\n\nوَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا Quran 3:103\nAnd hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together\n\nوَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ” (Quran 103:3)\nExcept for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:\nHe who alleviates the suffering of a brother out of the sufferings of the world, Allah would alleviate his suffering from the sufferings of the Day of Resurrection, and he who finds relief for one who is hard-pressed, Allah would make things easy for him in the Hereafter, and he who conceals (the faults) of a Muslim, Allah would conceal his faults in the world and in the Hereafter. Allah is at the back of a servant so long as the servant is at the back of his brother, and he who treads the path in search of knowledge, Allah would make that path easy, leading to Paradise for him and those persons who assemble in the house among the houses of Allah (mosques) and recite the Book of Allah and they learn and teach the Qur'an (among themselves) there would descend upon them tranquility and mercy would cover them and the angels would surround them and Allah mentions them in the presence of those near Him, and he who is slow-paced in doing good deeds, his (high) lineage does not make him go ahead.  Sahih Muslim: Book 48, Hadith 48 \n\nحَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى بْنُ يَحْيَى التَّمِيمِيُّ، وَأَبُو بَكْرِ بْنُ أَبِي شَيْبَةَ وَمُحَمَّدُ بْنُ الْعَلاَءِ الْهَمْدَانِيُّ - وَاللَّفْظُ لِيَحْيَى - قَالَ يَحْيَى أَخْبَرَنَا وَقَالَ الآخَرَانِ، حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو مُعَاوِيَةَ، عَنِ الأَعْمَشِ، عَنْ أَبِي صَالِحٍ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ \"‏ مَنْ نَفَّسَ عَنْ مُؤْمِنٍ كُرْبَةً مِنْ كُرَبِ الدُّنْيَا نَفَّسَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ كُرْبَةً مِنْ كُرَبِ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ وَمَنْ يَسَّرَ عَلَى مُعْسِرٍ يَسَّرَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالآخِرَةِ وَمَنْ سَتَرَ مُسْلِمًا سَتَرَهُ اللَّهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالآخِرَةِ وَاللَّهُ فِي عَوْنِ الْعَبْدِ مَا كَانَ الْعَبْدُ فِي عَوْنِ أَخِيهِ وَمَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا يَلْتَمِسُ فِيهِ عِلْمًا سَهَّلَ اللَّهُ لَهُ بِهِ طَرِيقًا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَمَا اجْتَمَعَ قَوْمٌ فِي بَيْتٍ مِنْ بُيُوتِ اللَّهِ يَتْلُونَ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ وَيَتَدَارَسُونَهُ بَيْنَهُمْ إِلاَّ نَزَلَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّكِينَةُ وَغَشِيَتْهُمُ الرَّحْمَةُ وَحَفَّتْهُمُ الْمَلاَئِكَةُ وَذَكَرَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِيمَنْ عِنْدَهُ وَمَنْ بَطَّأَ بِهِ عَمَلُهُ لَمْ يُسْرِعْ بِهِ نَسَبُهُ ‏\"‏ ‏.‏\n\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"There is none amongst the Muslims who plants a tree or sows seeds, and then a bird, or a person or an animal eats from it but is regarded as a charitable gift for him.\" Sahih Bukhari: Book 41, Hadith 1 \n\nحَدَّثَنَا قُتَيْبَةُ بْنُ سَعِيدٍ، حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو عَوَانَةَ، ح وَحَدَّثَنِي عَبْدُ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنُ الْمُبَارَكِ، حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو عَوَانَةَ، عَنْ قَتَادَةَ، عَنْ أَنَسٍ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ \"‏ مَا مِنْ مُسْلِمٍ يَغْرِسُ غَرْسًا، أَوْ يَزْرَعُ زَرْعًا، فَيَأْكُلُ مِنْهُ طَيْرٌ أَوْ إِنْسَانٌ أَوْ بَهِيمَةٌ، إِلاَّ كَانَ لَهُ بِهِ صَدَقَةٌ ‏\"‏‏.‏ وَقَالَ لَنَا مُسْلِمٌ حَدَّثَنَا أَبَانُ، حَدَّثَنَا قَتَادَةُ، حَدَّثَنَا أَنَسٌ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم‏.‏\n\nOur prophet (S) was a mercy to all the words, so, following our guide, we seek to bring forth mercy and goodness together as a community. We do this to fulfill the command of our Lord in the Quran and to follow our model, the best of creation who, through his life, demonstrated how the path of Islam-Iman-Ihsan leads us to relieve suffering and enhance goodness. \n\n\n\nCommunity Building Project Planning:\nVision\nOur vision is to enact mercy and goodness in our gatherings, holding fast to the rope of God, and seeking His guidance in all our endeavors. We aspire to create a space to collectively grow and support each other in positive and beautiful Ihsani action.\nRhythm of Meetings of the Community Team\nWe propose to meet monthly on the white days, where the light is clearest, symbolizing clarity and divine guidance in our discussions and decisions.\nStart With Prayer and Remembrance\nEach meeting will commence with a prayer and a reminder of our intention. This practice will help us stay focused on our purpose, seek blessings in our endeavors, and remain aligned with our intention\nFirst Steps:\n- Sheikh Abdul Qadir, please review this document and together determine a meeting to discuss next steps.\n- Agree on principles, questions and intentions document, then move on to strategy in the next meeting. \n- My guess for the first step is to find a few other organizers and work on designing the map-collecting process - and in this way, interview people to understand more about what the suhba community can be and what we can do/expect from each other. \nPrinciples\n- Ubuntu, going far by going together. 535 - يَدُ اللَّهِ مَعَ الجَماعَةِ\n- Patience\n- Do not rush\n- To be proactive\nSahih Muslim: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Hasten to do good deeds before you are overtaken by one of the seven afflictions.\" Then he listed: \"Are you waiting for such poverty which will make you unmindful of devotion, or prosperity which will make you corrupt, or a disease which will disable you, or such senility as will make you mentally unstable, or sudden death, or the Dajjal who is the worst expected, or the Hour; and the Hour will be most grievous and most bitter.\"\nالوقت كالسيف إن لم تقطعه قطعك\nIt means \"Manage your time wisely and don't waste it\"\nيستجاب لأحدكم ما لم يعجل‏:‏ يقول‏:‏ قد دعوت ربي، فلم يستجب لي\n“The Du’a of every one of you will be granted so long as he does not become hasty by saying: ‘I have made Du’a but it has not been answered’.”[11]\nقد كان مَن قبلَكم يُؤخَذُ الرجلُ فيُحفَرُ له في الأرض، فيُجعل فيها، ثم يؤتى بالمِنشار، فيوضعُ على رأسه، فيُجعَلُ نصفَيْنِ، ويمشَّطُ بأمشاط الحديد ما دون لحمِه وعظمِه، ما يصدُّه ذلك عن دينه، واللهِ ليُتمَّنَّ الله هذا الأمر حتى يسيرَ الراكبُ من صنعاءَ إلى حضرموتَ، لا يخافُ إلا اللهَ، والذئبَ على غنمه، ولكنكم تستعجلون\n“There were people before you who would be detained. Then, a pit would be dug for them, which they’d be placed in. Then, a saw would be placed in the middle of their heads and sawedinto two pieces. Their flesh would also be torn away from their bones using iron combs, and despite this, it would not deter them from their religion. By Allāh! Allāh will bring this religion to its completion until a rider will be able to travel from San’ā to Ḥaḍramawt (two cities in Yemen) fearing none except Allāh, and except the wolf for his sheep (i.e. Muslims will govern this region, hence no one will be feared but Allāh), but you are in a hurry.”[15]\n- Become trustworthy. Privacy, and anonymity/pseudonymity are important. \n- Reduce “bottlenecks” - a single point of failure—also, no cult of personality.\n- Help people find their agency and know the limits, obligations, expectations, and permissions. (goes into questions doc) \n- Do things mirroring the creation of God, balanced, and through the harmonies of nature (for instance moon/monthly/seasonal meetings, meeting at “asr” not at 4:30, etc. \n- Duplicate the good (do more of what is already working). \n- Connect personally to gather information > sending forms asking people to fill them out. We’ll get better quality information.\nMaybe: - We need people to be active members of the community. We will drop people if we don’t get updates in a year. \n- Encourage local meetups/gatherings\n- Ihsan/Professionalism. If you give your word, please do it. (know what you can do with Ihsan, and where you need resources/other people) \n- Rahma rahma rahma.\n\nTeam (so far)\n- Bilal, France\n- Sheikh Abdul Qadir, Garmany\n- Hana (UK) \nRoles we need\n- More facilitators\n- Someone project managing/coordination. \nConflict Resolution\nQuestions\n- What key questions must we address in our gatherings?\n- Should we set up a bank account if we want to be able to receive donations and disbursements?\n- What if membership required a minimum 1$ a month donation for your membership to be active if you can afford it (free for those who request)? That way, we can have a regular monthly income to use for coordination efforts, saving, and building a waqf. \n- What are the smallest first steps we can take towards our vision?\n- Who is the “imam” of this project? Every group needs a leader (even temporarily, and if it will change) \n- Should we have a shura council to help with decisions? How will it be organized?\n- Should the funds be disbursed by competition, quarterly shura meetings, or other fundraising projects?\n- How can we benefit from each other’s skills? (jobs board? Teaching each other?) \n- How do we help people realize they have much to contribute and can?\n- How do we make it ok for people to set good intentions, do things, make mistakes, and then ask for forgiveness and make more mistakes?\n- Can we get people to teach each other about projects, actions, etc - should we also have a monthly educational video meeting? (I can do something on public speaking and pitching ideas or writing grants to the UN)\n- Maybe we should have an opportunities board for things to apply for?\n- Should we run an idea accelerator? (I run accelerator projects) \nOr do something like \n- Helping people find their agency and know the limits, obligations, expectations, and permissions it takes to do things with the suhba. How can we make it easy to collaborate, and fun, and resourced.\n- I think perhaps there should be one paid position for this initiative minimally, and perhaps more - dependant on fundraising. \n\nThe daily grant program from the https://thepollinationproject.org/apply\n- Should we help people with ideas learn about how to become more entrepreneurial and implement those ideas? Rather than just funding people, should we work earlier in the idea->project value chain?\n- What if we helped duplicate good idea that exist and fund them for people to clone, sort of like changex.org\n\n- How can we have a waqf established that will allow us to have a profit of about 365k a year to allow us to disburse 1000 a day?\n- if we start a waqf and fuel it with community fundraised funds what structure should it take. Who in our community knows about wuquf? Where is the bank, etc \n- What feedback mechanism is needed\n- Who can intervene if there is conflict? \nHow do we ensure clean handling of all aspects and funds?\n- How do we get the blessing in our time?\n\n\n",

      "content": "Reviewing the structure of your Sheikh Mohammed Suhba Community Activation Plan, let's focus on how the information is presented and whether it flows logically. Here's a detailed plan for reorganizing and improving the structure:\n\n### Current Structure Assessment:\n1. **Initial Sections (Intention of Document, Community Purpose)**: These sections establish the purpose well but could benefit from a brief overview or executive summary for immediate context.\n\n2. **Religious References and Teachings**: Placing these at the beginning sets a spiritual tone but may benefit from integration within relevant sections to directly link teachings with action plans.\n\n3. **Vision and Meeting Rhythm**: Well-placed after the foundational principles, but consider connecting these more explicitly to how they will drive the community's actions.\n\n4. **First Steps and Principles**: These are practical and essential but may need rearranging for clarity on immediate actions versus long-term principles.\n\n5. **Team and Roles Needed**: Good inclusion, but consider moving this towards the end, as it's more operational.\n\n6. **Questions Section**: Contains critical strategic considerations, but could be better placed after 'First Steps' for a smoother transition from vision to action.\n\n### Suggested Plan for Reorganization:\n\n#### 1. **Create an Executive Summary**:\n   - **Action**: Begin with a concise summary outlining the document's purpose, main objectives, and a brief overview of the plan. This provides immediate context.\n\n#### 2. **Integrate Religious Teachings with Actionable Sections**:\n   - **Action**: Instead of separate sections, integrate relevant teachings within the discussion of vision, principles, and actions. This directly links spiritual guidance with practical steps.\n\n#### 3. **Refine the Vision Section**:\n   - **Action**: Clearly articulate how the vision will be actualized through community activities. Ensure this section flows naturally from the spiritual foundation.\n\n#### 4. **Rearrange First Steps and Principles**:\n   - **Action**: Start with immediate 'First Steps' to emphasize action. Follow this with 'Principles' to guide these actions.\n\n#### 5. **Position Team and Roles Towards the End**:\n   - **Action**: Move the 'Team' and 'Roles Needed' sections towards the end. This section is operational and better suited after outlining the plan's strategic aspects.\n\n#### 6. **Reposition Questions Section**:\n   - **Action**: Place 'Questions' after 'First Steps' but before 'Principles.' This allows for a smooth transition from what needs to be done immediately to broader considerations and guiding principles.\n\n#### 7. **Add a Section for Implementation and Monitoring**:\n   - **Action**: Consider adding a section on how the plan will be implemented and monitored. This includes feedback mechanisms, conflict resolution, and the management of funds.\n\n#### 8. **Closing Remarks**:\n   - **Action**: End with a strong closing statement that reiterates the commitment to the vision and calls for collective action and involvement.\n\nBy reorganizing the document in this way, you create a clear and logical flow from spiritual foundations to practical actions and operational considerations. This structure will help Sheikh Abdul Qadir and yourself align more effectively on the way forward, ensuring that each part of the plan is understood and actionable.",
