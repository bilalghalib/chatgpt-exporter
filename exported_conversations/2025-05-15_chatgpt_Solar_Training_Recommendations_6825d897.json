into natural English; repeated greetings and filler have been lightly condensed for clarity.)\n\n---\n\nBILAL:\\\nHello, peace be upon you.\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nPeace be upon you, too.\n\nBILAL:\\\nHow are you, Hussam? Where are you calling from—your office or home?\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nI’m at the Oxfam office. My name’s Hussam Hassan. I’m an enterprise-development specialist. I’m originally from Babylon, living in Baghdad, and most of my work is in Anbar.\n\nBILAL:\\\nGreat. Let’s finish the introductions—then I’ll tell you why I reached out.\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nSure. By the way, I’ve done quite a bit of training. RENAC Academy (the German renewable-energy institute) ran a “train-the-trainer” program in Iraq in 2023. They selected 20 people nationwide; I was one of them. After we passed the online modules and exams, our names were posted on the Solar Iraq platform—that’s where Nilam found my contact and reached me on WhatsApp.\n\nBILAL:\\\nThat makes sense. Quick background on me: I’m Bilal, a curriculum-development consultant. I’ve been working across the Middle East since the Arab Spring—helping build creative spaces and skills programs. Right now I’m looking for trainers like you. Our goal in Mosul isn’t just to teach “green energy” theory; we want people to get jobs or launch businesses in solar. So we need a course that takes someone who already has some technical foundation—say an engineer or technician—and gives them the know-how and the business sense to earn a living in the sector.\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nPerfect—because I’m an electrical engineer myself. A while back I even tried to spin up a small solar start-up and work on a patent, then switched to an indoor vertical-farm idea.\n\nBILAL:\\\nExactly the type of profile we need! Could you walk me through the trainings you currently deliver? What topics, what structure? Do you keep a syllabus?\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nRENAC gave us a full training package. I also volunteer as a business adviser with ITC’s SABi program. I’ve delivered short courses—four-day blocks, usually 9 a.m. – 1 p.m. The problem with such short courses is that trainees often get too much theory, too little hands-on. For solar you really need to let people wire, assemble, test. We sometimes take them to the Renewable-Energy Center near Baghdad University, but even that’s limited.\n\nBILAL:\\\nIf you could design the ideal solar course that truly prepares people to start work straight after, what would it look like—duration, day-by-day focus?\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nOff the top of my head:\n\n- Day 1 – Load assessment: measure household loads, convert amperes to kW, understand customer needs.\n- Day 2 – System components: panel types, inverter sizing, battery capacity.\n- Day 3 – Safety: especially DC vs AC wiring, correct DC cables, breakers, fuses—people ignore this in Iraq.\n- Days 4-5 – Design & installation: shading analysis, array layout, mounting angles, using the “Solar Pathfinder” to see shadow lengths in winter vs summer; then hands-on assembly.\\\n  Trainees must physically build at least one string (ideally four panels so they can practice series/parallel).\n\nBILAL:\\\nGood. Everything you’re saying aligns with our draft schedule. What classroom techniques keep people engaged?\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nPeer teaching works well: give each student a small device—an irradiance meter, shadow meter, surge protector—let them research it for 15 minutes, then present on a flip-chart. It breaks the ice and everyone learns the devices.\n\nBILAL:\\\nI like that. I also want them to solve a real design challenge for a house and pitch it back.\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nExactly—on Day 5 give them a load profile and tell them: “Design the system, price it, choose components, justify it.” Then on Day 6 they present.\n\nBILAL:\\\nWhat are the biggest mistakes you see in the field?\n\nHUSSAM:\n\n1. No cleaning – Panels get dusty, output drops, customers lose faith in solar.\n2. Weak mounting – Cheap frames cannot handle wind; arrays shift or fall.\n3. Wrong cables/breakers – Using AC hardware on DC lines is unsafe.\n\nWe must drill maintenance and structural design into the course.\n\nBILAL:\\\nAgreed. How do we embed cleaning and wind-load lessons?\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nShow real-world examples—street-light panels that stopped working because no one washed them. Have trainees compare IV-curves of clean vs dirty panels. Build a business case for offering cleaning as a paid service.\n\nBILAL:\\\nGood point. Speaking of business: how do we blend technical and business training?\n\nHUSSAM:\n\n- Add a market-research field day—send trainees to interview 30 residents: generator costs, pain points, willingness to pay.\n- Teach basic bookkeeping and cash-flow—many small firms skip it.\n- Highlight after-sales services and warranties as a value proposition (rare in Iraq).\n\nBILAL:\\\nWe’ll incorporate that. Final questions: can you recommend other trainers across Iraq, and how do we verify a trainee truly gained competence?\n\nHUSSAM:\n\n- I’ll share contacts from RENAC and other programs (Erbil, Basra, etc.).\n- For assessment: let private companies host two-month internships; we subsidize stipends. Companies get free help, trainees get practice. On our side, require each trainee to complete and upload a design report generated by a solar-design tool—becomes their portfolio.\n\nBILAL:\\\nExcellent. I’ll send you our draft Google Sheet; feel free to add comments or voice notes. I’ll be in Mosul mid-July—hope we can meet.\n\nHUSSAM:\\\nLooking forward to it.

ITC is 100% \"Aid for Trade\", supporting trade that\ndelivers inclusive and sustainable development results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and\ntransition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and\nmarginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that\nprovide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation.\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent\nwork and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive\ninvestment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing\ncapacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climate\nsmart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these\ncomponents, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and\nlegislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building\namong social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating\nclimate change impacts in the housing sector.\nOutput 3.3 of the project is designed to enhance the capabilities of local businesses, particularly focusing\non young entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This includes a\ncomprehensive approach to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the\ndevelopment of sustainable and innovative capabilities, especially in sectors like climate-smart solutions\nand innovative construction technology.\nThe project plans to:\n1. Reinforce Business Development Services: Strengthening the portfolio of service providers to offer\ntraining, coaching, and mentoring in areas critical for sustainable and innovative business practices.\n2. Leverage Peer Learning: Facilitating learning from institutional and company-level peers to help\nentrepreneurs effectively understand and implement sustainable practices.\n3. Enhance TVET Alignment: Aligning Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs\nwith the needs of businesses to ensure practical and industry-relevant training.\n4. Cultivate Partnerships: Establishing collaborations with multinational corporations, training institutions\nand other industry stakeholders for knowledge transfer and skill development.\n5. Implement Targeted Activities:\n- 3.3.1: Designing and implementing modular training for professionals on sustainable construction,\nrepairs, resource efficiency, and financial literacy.\n- 3.3.2: Developing partnerships with construction material suppliers, universities, and innovators to\nCreated: 2025-04-14 05:14\nmainstream climate-smart solutions.\n- 3.3.3: Establishing pilot training sites and model houses showcasing affordable green techniques in\ncollaboration with UN-Habitat.\n- 3.3.4: Strengthening the capacities of organizations supporting MSMEs, with a focus on services in\nentrepreneurship and financial literacy.\n- 3.3.5: Creating a certified trainee system, a resource repository, regular networking events, and\nassociated marketing efforts in collaboration with local alliances.\nThis strategic focus on building capacities, fostering partnerships, and aligning educational programs with\nmarket needs aims to empower young entrepreneurs and small businesses to contribute to economic\nempowerment and job creation through sustainable and innovative practices.\nDescription of Duties/Responsibilities\nIn Q4 2024, a competency-based curriculum aimed at enhancing the skills of young people and women in\nsustainable construction has been developed. This curriculum focused on green and innovative practices. It\naligns with the BEIT project's objectives of fostering affordable housing, advancing climate-smart\nconstruction, and supporting trade-led private sector growth in Iraq.\nThe competency-based curriculum has been divided into four independent yet synergistic modules as\nfollows:\nModule 1: Energy and modelling assessment●\nModule 2: Solar energy and energy modelling●\n●\nModule 3: Insulation and ventilation\nModule 4: Innovation hackathon and design sprint●\nParticipants could opt to take any module individually or progress sequentially from Module One through\nModule Four, culminating in a Hackathon. Each has been designed to be completed over 1-3 days,\ndepending on available hours and they balance theoretical knowledge with practical learning experiences,\nensuring participants can apply what they learn in real-world contexts.\nTo ensure effectiveness, each module incorporates a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation\nframework.\nUnder the direct supervision of the Youth economic empowerment Expert and in close coordination with\nthe Senior Programme Officer, Youth and Trade, Green skills specialist the candidate will undertake the\nfollowing tasks:\n1/ Conduct focus group discussions with key stakeholders for curriculum validation and its certification.\n2/ Create additional teaching aids, improve curriculum based on the target beneficiaries’ and employers’\nneeds along with existing resources (e.g. form educational institutions\n3/ Conduct ToT with the implementing partner and other BSOs\n4/ Create a Resource Toolkit for Trainers: Develop comprehensive toolkits, including facilitator guides, case\nstudies that work, exercises, and multimedia resources that can be reused and adapted over time and with\ndifferent levels of education.\n5/Facilitate partnerships with private sector companies to create real-world learning opportunities like\ninternships, apprenticeships, or job shadowing for trainees.\n6/Recommend appropriate delivery mechanisms and work with the IP/SP to translate the design the\ncurriculum, ensuring accessibility for diverse learners.\nCreated: 2025-04-14 05:14\nCopyright\nThe Consultant has to ensure that s/he has obtained the necessary permissions with regard to intellectual\nproperty rights required to perform his/her services under this consultancy contract and for the subsequent\ndissemination by ITC in any form.

How many trainers or assistants are required for a 20-person cohort?\n8. Which calculation tools or software should trainees learn?\n9. What assessment technique keeps knowledge sticky?\n10. What critical topics are we still missing?\n\n(Every one of these appeared, in almost the same wording, in both transcripts.)\n\n---\n\n### How to use this table\n\n- Copy-paste the two new columns (“Hussam quote / Muayad quote / Alignment”) into your existing daily-programme spreadsheet to keep everything in one artefact.\n- Where both experts agree, you have immediate validation; where one adds a new angle, flag it as “NEW” so trainers know it still needs a learning activity.\n- Any “Difference” row is a perfect prompt for a class debate or for A/B-testing two teaching techniques.\n\nLet me know if you’d like the raw spreadsheet version or a deeper dive into any single theme.\n\n\nYou:\nCan you give me a full recommendation list where to integrate and why it matters how to implement that compiles both people's responses \nshow the minor edits to the six day outline \nand review my deliverables and see what we can make for it. \nMake a structured question (quantitative and qualitative) and export important information from both interviews to make an interesting object to include in my deliverables reports\nthis questions list: Quick list – Questions you asked both experts is a good start - i think i should ask things like how long have you been a trainer, how many years of experience do you have in solar (i think we can extract that) and other insights that are relevant for the deliverables - think and extract the information needed - remember the goals of the project \n\nChatGPT:\n\\[Unsupported Content]\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\\[Unsupported Content]\n\n\nChatGPT:\nBelow is a single, action-ready package that folds everything you learned from Hussam (H) and Muayad (M)\\*\\* into the BEIT project workflow.\\\nSkim the headings you need, copy-paste into your working docs, and tweak wording as you like.\n\n---\n\n## A.

(Y/N, size kWp)      | Y/N + number    | Role-model authenticity.                    |\n\n### 2 – Qualitative (open-ended)\n\n1. Describe the single biggest installation failure you have witnessed and how you would fix it.\n2. What convinces customers to choose solar when initial cash outlay is high?\n3. Which government or finance obstacles most block small installers?\n4. If you had to cut one topic from a 6-day course, what would it be and why?\n5. Give an example of how you turned a technical concept into a story students remember.\n6. How would you measure trainee competence three months after the course?\n7. What support do you still need to become (or remain) an effective trainer?\n\n---\n\n## E.

Copy R-1→R-10 into the facilitator guide draft; mark any that need budget lines.\n2. Attach the interview/survey instrument to the stakeholder-engagement plan (Output 1).\n3. Generate the new worksheets (torque log, cleaning ROI etc.) – shout if you’d like draft templates.\n\nPing me anytime for deeper dives or polished slide material.",

شوية بالتفاصيل اللي يخلي أو خليه نقول العلمية، آه غالبا آه هذا نوع من التريننغ لمن يكون لفترات آه يعني قصيرة، اللي هو خلي نقول أربع أيام، ثلاث أيام، فهو غالب ا يحتاج خبرة عملية تبرع عملية، أكثر ما تنهي نظرية أو فتشي إجاكيشن، أوكي كان موجود هالشي هذا، و آه دائما برأيي إنه يكون آه المتدرب موجود إلى ال الوقت إنه آه عفوا آه إنه يشتغل بإيده فعليا يجي ويربط بإيده كدائرة وكذا هالشي هذا شوي قليل بالنوع مال إللي نقدمها بالأرقام إن جنرال أوكي ممكن ياخده على فد مكان إنه شوف هذا هذا موجود كان بقلته أكو مركز مال طاقة متجددة موجود قريب على الجامعة ال آ جامعة بغداد أوكي؟ آ ياخذونا آ إله المتدربين. زين، بس ال المتدرب حتى يقدر يروح يشتغل ويحتاج شوية، يجرب بإيده، يشتغل، يفتح، يربط، يؤسس هذه التفاصيل، أوكي؟\n\n00:18:03 Bilal\nفشنو عندك؟ يعني إذا إنت كنت رح تسوي النموذج آ يعني ما رويكم إللي أني دا أشتغل عليها، بس إذا أنت تقدر تتخيل أحسن تدريب مال سولر إللي راح يقدر يساعد ناس ي يعني يبدون يشتغلون لمن يخلصون شنو المدة؟ وشنو ال شنو راح تركز يوم على يوم؟ يعني يعني يا؟\n\n00:18:29 Hussam Falih\nأوكي، أتوقع إنه. أحتاج يعني أفكر بالموضوع، حتى أقدر أقول مدة، أوكي، لكن آ حتى لمن واحد خلينا نقول فني هو بالضبط شنو الليفل مالت المترربين مثلك؟\n\n00:18:47 Bilal\n.فما لازم نبدء من صفر يعني عنا عندهم\n\n00:18:54 Hussam Falih\nأوكي آ، اليوم الأول ممكن يكون إللي هو فاضلة إنه إش لون يعرفون ال آ الاستهلاك؟ أبيات، والظابط الشوني حسبو لم تعرف إحنا عدنان أنه استهلاك البيئة تكون بالأنبير، يعني مثلا هذا الجهاز يسحب كذا أمبير، زين أنا شلون أعرف إيش كم جهاز أريده الشغل؟ إيش كم أمبير يسحبون، فبالتالي أحول الكيلوات من الألواح الشمسية بالكيلوات تقاس أوكي، فممكن هذه الحسابات يحتاجوها كلش ضرورية. آ ال آ خلي نقول ال مالت ال السولار يحتاجون يعرفوه، فهو ممكن يكون اليوم الثاني. شنو ال الأنواع مالت الألواح الشمسية الموجودة؟ شنو أنواع؟ شنو أقيس الحجم؟ مالت الأمبيرتر، الحجم مالت التحويل، وهذه الأمور؟ يوم ثالث ممكن يكون على السيفتي أني لاحظت. لاحظت أنه دائما توصل، أو خلينا نقول. تحديدا اللي يستخدموها بالعراق هي مالة أي. سي مو مالة أي سي، الموضوع كلش يختلف، وممكن يأثر كسيفتي إي آ ال هاي المسافة بين الإنفرتر، أو خلينا نقول من ال من السولار؟ هذه دي سي أوكي، فالمفروض ال ال الأسلاك المستخدمة هي أسلاك مخصصة للدي سي آرز أيضا مخصصة للدي سي، هذه التفاصيل مهمة وغالبا أني إللي شفته يعني بالسوق الناس ما تنتبه لهيتشي، لأن غالبا ما عندهم المعرفة وأبو المصلحة. ممكن يكون ما إلى خلق، أو ما عنده المعرفة الكافية، أو ما متوفر هالأشياء بالسوق، فبالتالي ما يعيرلها أهمية إم أوكي آه يوم رابع وحامس آه يكونون إنه شلون يسوي الديزاين مالة ال السيستم نفسه ال ال التفاصيل آ شقد لازم يبعد هذا ال تحديدا عن آ أي ظل شادي وزوا هالتفاصيل هذه آ هي كان أكو بوقتها أجهزة حتى نعرف إنه هذا الظل شقد ممكن يمتد بالشتاء أو الصيف، حتى أنا مثلا ممكن أجي أنصب السيستم أو البناص تحديدا، والصيف ممكن يدخل يوصل مترين، بينما بتغير المواسم ممكن يوصل 4 م صحيح، فلما يغطي جزء من ال هذا باعتبار ال شو اسمه ال السترن كله ما اشتغل لمن يكون عليه جزء من الظل مو\n\n00:21:37 Bilal\nع الكل، هذا الجهاز يعني ورقة هاهاها شنو؟ شنو هو الجهاز؟\n\n00:21:42 Hussam Falih\nالعفسة؟ شايف الفضل اللي يستخدمون المساحين تقريبا مثل الليفل بس يصير فوقه إي أ ورقة تتخلى أوكي وهو على شكل أكو قبة زجاجية. زين؟ فهذه القبة الزجاجية حتعكس ال. ال الظلال الموجودة أو الصور مالة الأشياء الموجودة سواء بنايات أو أعملة أو غيرها. تعكسها على هذه المنطقة أو هذه الورقة، ونقدر نحدد على ال. على الورقة. الورقة بيها تفاصيل، بحيث تعرف إنه بهذه النقطة، هذا الظل حيجي بالشهر الفلاني، أوكي، هذه تاخذها على أربعة أطراف ال آ. البنر أو السستم مالتك عالأربع أطراف الأربع، زوايا سواري، آه، حتى تعرف إنه إيش وقت آه حيكون ظل على هذه الزاوية، أو ظل على الزاوية الثانية بهالشكل هذا إم\n\n00:22:39 Bilal\nحلو، فهذا يوم رابع، وخامس آي نسيت إبدي أكتب ال الأول، والثاني هي أول، والثاني كان ال صح؟\n\n00:22:48 Hussam Falih\nآه ال ال طريقة الحساب مالت ال آ اليوم الأول الطريقة مال حساب ال إم الأحمال بالبيت نفسه، أها حتى لمن إي لمن أني أجي أقول لك أني حجهز لك مثلا آ سولار سيستم يطيك مثلا 25 كيلو وات أني إش لون حأفهمه. أو أني إش لون حأحكي لل للكوستمر أو. إش لون حيفهم ها الشي هذا؟\n\n00:23:14 Bilal\nإي ياخذ يوم كامل يعني تسوي 4 ساعات وكوفي بريك عن هذا الموضوع. لو آ شلون إش لون؟\n\n00:23:24 Hussam Falih\nممكن ممكن نتطرق لأمور ثانيه مثلا؟ شنو الألواح الشمسية الموجودة؟ شنو الأحمال اللي يحتاجوها؟ آه أنواع، ما هو ثلاث أنواع اللي هو يكون وهايبرد، و آ ممكن أيضا نتطرق لهذه نحكي بيها إنه آ هو أني إللي أعرفه هذه الأشياء ممكن تكون مفيدة بالمستقبل، لأن وزارة الكهرباء دا تشتغل على شي إنه في حال كان عندك أنت ااا كفاية أو فائض من ال ااا ال تقدر تغذيها. لمنظومة ال آه إنفاق الكهربائية، وبالتالي إما تأخذ فلوسها كاش أو ينزل من العداد الميزانية مالته، أوكي؟ آه أكو هالشي هذا فممكن نتطرق أيضا لل خلي نقول\n\n00:24:17 Bilal\nأني أعرف ال الفكرة إنه ت تتحاكم بال آ بالعداد، إش لون آ الفلوس إش لون تشتغل؟\n\n00:24:25 Hussam Falih\n.هم لا يشتغلون على الموضوع حقيقة هو الكبرينسبل موجود أم موجود؟ أتوقع كان شركة ربان السفينة سوت يعني مزرعة شمسية، زين، بس شلون الموضوع بالزبط؟ ما أعرفها حقيقة حتى أكون صريح، لأنه هو فد شي كلش جديد، يعني ممكن صار له سنة وعلى أساسها استغلت هالشي، هذا شركة ربان السفينة حلو. أو آ وسوت يعني مزرعة مالها الطاقة الشمسية حتى تغذي ال الشبكة الواحدة حلو\n\n00:24:56 Bilal\n.هذا بغداد لو بالعراق، لو\n\n00:25:00 Hussam Falih\n.إي بالعراق، شركة ربان السفينة بالعراق، حتى أكون صريحة ببغداد أو غير مكان، ما أعرف\n\n00:25:08 Bilal\nزين، فأول يوم إنه نسوي إحتياجاتها، شنو حجم ال ال الألواح اللي رح نحتاجها، آه و شلون نقدر إن نقنع الناس إنه هو أكو إحتمال هذا رح يفيدهم، شنو رح يصر مردود من عنده ريتشيرن أون إينفيستمينت، وبعدين يوم يوم الثاني ما أعرف، وبعدين ال وبعدين يوم الخامس وأكيد إي شنو كان اليوم الثاني؟\n\n00:25:37 Hussam Falih\n.اليوم الثاني عن مكونات مالت الممرومة، المكونات مالت، المنظومة إنو الإمبرتر أيضا ندخل بالتفاصيل مالته، هيك أمور، أوكي، فهو المكونات مالت المنظومة\n\n00:25:50 Bilal\nيا. زين دزاين وبعدين شنو وراها تتوقع ال صح؟\n\n00:25:59 Hussam Falih\nإي إي إي أكيد؟\n\n00:26:01 Bilal\nهاي أتوقع يعني تقريبا إحنا وصلنا نفس ال آه الإقتراح آه. بالنسبة لل للتدريب، آه و يعني عندي سويت ليست أسئلة، واحد من عندهم آه؟ يع، وشنو إنت شايف بالصف يكون أفضل شي للتعليم، يعني ناس مو ضايجين مو قاعدين بده يشوفون؟ يعني بال بالتدريبات اللي إنت مسويها بال أكو؟ إنت عجبك؟ إي شفتها إنه كل مفيدة إي والناس تونسوا بيها واستفادوا؟\n\n00:26:48 Hussam Falih\n.والله أفضل شي، يعني أنا سويته شخصي ا إنه بوقتها خليتهم إي اختاريت إي يعني خلينا نقول عدة مواضيع حتى لو توبكس صغيرة أو أجهزة نستخدمها، و أعطيهم وقت تقريبا 1/4 ساعة أو 1/3 ساعة يجهز ال مو شرط يكون بريزنتيشن لابتوب أو يجي شي أو إنما حتى لو يكذب على فليب كارت ويجي يقدمه بحيث شلون يوصل لنا فكرة عن هذا الجهاز، فبالتالي يكون أكو نكسر هذا الآيس ال، هذا ال الحاجز الموجود بين المدرب والمتدرب إي أوكي؟ آه كل واحد يختعر موضوع أوكي ونعطيهم الوقت، و آه كل واحد يقدم شي توبك إللي إللي اختاره، أو إللي طلع عليه حلو آ\n\n00:27:45 Bilal\n.زين، فا ال الفكرة إنه تنطيهم؟ challenge any. Requirements مالبيت. ولازم يروحون يسوون ديزاين تصميم يعني رسمي وبعدين يقترحوها الناس، هذه الفكرة\n\n00:28:00 Hussam Falih\n.هذه. هذه ممكن تكون بالأيام مثلا يوم خامس نعطيك هذا لود معين، أوكي، وروح سوي ال ال الحسابات مالته، وفعليا حتجي تربط عليه، يعني تختار مثلا تفاصيل هالأشياء هذا، بس لأ إللي صار إنه إحنا عدنا أج أكثر من جهاز، نحتاج آ نستخدمه، بال بال أوكي واحد من عدهم رخيص، مثلا هذا إللي حكيت عليه يقيس الظل، واحد يقيس آه قوة الأشعة مالت الشمس بالمنطقة المعينة، حتى أعرف إنه هذه الأشياء مناسبة ومناسبة، وأيضا آه أكو جهاز يحدد إيش قد إمتصاص آه لنفسه، فهذه الأجهزة إنه كل واحد مثلا ياخذ له جهاز أوكي آ، أو حتى لو أوكي إي أكو جهاز أيض ا مالة حماية إنه في حال بالشتاء ممكن يتعرض الصواعد إي صح يكون أكو إلى جهاز حماية كل وين ربط التوازي وإياه، هذه كل واحدة تطيل جهاز إنه هذا الجهاز مالتك أخذه، أوكي آه أقرأ عنه، نسوي اللي تريده عنه أوكي، والجهاز يمك تقدر تستخدمه وتجربه أرجع أا سويله ب1/5 دقايق أو 10 دقايق عن هذا الجهاز، وشنو فادته وشلون يستخدموه وشلون يشتغل، كأنما أنا ما أعرف الجهاز أوكي. حتى كل واحد يكون. آه دخل خلينا نقول بتفاصيل جهاز معين، بنفس الوقت، البقية كلهم سمعوا عن هذا الجهاز المعين، فهم صاروا ملمين يعني، آه بكل التفاصيل، مالت هذه الأجهزة إللي يحتاجوها، وبنفس الوقت إنهم يتلقوا الشرح، ممكن إي. إي، وإنما من الثني من عدهم، فالليفل إللي مالة الشرح حيجيهم من شخص. كلش قريب عليهم، أو هو واحد من عدهم، مو كلش قريب عليهم\n\n00:30:12 Bilal\n.صح. صح. إي آ ف آ، يعني هذا يعني البير ليرنينج واحد من أحلى ال بالشكل العام، إنه شنو هذاك السقراط؟ قال ما حد راح يقدر يعلمك شي، أنت لازم تفكر آ وتشوف العلم من نفسك، و إنه تشوف واحد كاميراية، وإذا واحد تفكر إنه هو عالي ومدرب، ويعني بعيد من عندك صعب إنه تاخذ من عندك، تقول أنا أقدر أفتهمها، بس لما الواحد مثلك بنفس المستوى، و هو ده يعلمك يكون شوي أكثر التواصل مع المعلومات أفضل. زين رح، رح، أش، أش أشير ال الس ال عندي آه أو بسيط يجوز هذا أشوف شنو آه رأيك عن ال آه؟ عن ال الأيام، فال مالتنا اللي أنا كنت أسوي الإقتراح، آه هي ال تتوقع؟ يكون أفضل؟ نفس الشي، component selection و يعني reading specifications نعرف كل components نلعب ويا الأجهزة نتعرف عنهم، وبعدين ال يوم ال والتدريب عن ال ف يعني مال مال. فهذا ال يعني اللي رح نسويها. وبعدين؟ بس اللي معناها إنه. لما نسوي ال من. شو راح نسوي آ in terms of the implementation بالنهاية trainees لازم يكون on your user only verified the system performance user is only documented system tests explain a system to the clients who could have an asia، وبعدين هي مثل margins shrunter so، if you. Slow that service offerings had، the واحد من الأسئلة واحد إذا عنده شركة سولر. بقيت يعني أماكن أخرى يقدرون يسوون، معناها أنا رح يجي كل ست أشهر أسوي يمين سنة أسوي وأنت تدفع لي بالسنة يعني 100 دولار لك أكو\n\n00:33:04 Hussam Falih\n.يضيفوها\n\n00:33:04 Bilal\n.على البزنس\n\n00:33:07 Hussam Falih\n.إي\n\n00:33:12 Bilal\nها ال ال الفكرة مال سيرفايس الإضافية، يعني واحد اللي يسوي ال يقدر يبيع شي ثاني ما بين آه؟\n\n00:33:25 Hussam Falih\n.والله أستاذ، هو اللي موجود عندنا حاليا، يعني هو ال للبيوت. ولل يعني للمطخات الزراعية أكثر شي يستخدم بالموصل تحت. يستخدم للمضخات الزراعية بالذات المناطق البعيدة، آه أكو شركة كيسك ما أعرف نسوي عليها. أي هذه كلش تشتغل على نفس التوبك إنه. هالأمور هذه؟ آ. ممكن إنه إذا كان أكو شخص يعني آ عنده الباشن إينف إنه يقدر يسوي؟ ما أعرف أي دائرة تحديدا، بس كان أكو دائرة تقدم قروض، آه لل شو إسمه للموظفين حتى قروض بدون فائدة، حتى يسوون ال مالتهم بالبيوت، فممكن هو يكون أكو بينهم وبين هذه الدائرة المعينة، أنا ما أتذكرها قارئ الموضوع يعني قاريتها باصية زين آ؟ يكون هذا ال بيناتهم. آه، حتى هو يقدم هذه السولار سيستمز آه ب ب خلينا نقول بأقصى أوكي، هو فعليا حياخذ ال ال شو اسمه القرض، يعني حتجيب فلوسه كاملة من الدولة، أوكي؟ و بالتالي هذا الكوستومر يسدد إله أو للدولة، آ هذا يسهل ع الكوستمر، يعني يسهل ع الكوستمر المراجعات والمعاملات وها الأمور هاي، وفي الوقت حيكون تقريبا نفس الفكرة مالة التسديد مالة ال آ خاص أو المواطنين للمولدة، هو ده يسدد فتشي قريب عليه لهذا الشخص، بالمقابل إنه هو مرتاح من الهوسة، مالة المولدة وتفاصيله الأمور هذه هي لن الأكبر حاجة تفضل\n\n00:35:27 Bilal\nامم. هذا إي اتذكرني بأسئله ثانيه، شنو الشي الأكثر يعني مقنعه للناس؟ أم إ لما تريد تقنعهم يروحون سولر هي إنه يتركون؟\n\n00:35:45 Hussam Falih\n.قريت، يعني كان مقالة إنه اقتصاديا خلي نقول يعتبر للبيوت، يعني إنت لما تيجي تبيع بيتي بسولار، السعر مالته يكون إضافي عن إنه بيت عادي، يعني هذا فد شي شلون فد شي إضافة للبيت، يعني حيضيف على السعر مالته، هذه نقطة العمر الطويل مالتها. آه يعني هواية تفاصيل ثانيه المولدة، موضوع المولدة مزعج، لكن الحاجز الوحيد اللي يواجه الناس إنه تتجه إتجاه ال سيستم، هو أنه مبلغ عفو مطلوب من عندي مبلغ، آه مالي، آه دفعة واحدة مثلا 10,000 دولار، أوكي، آه فالموضوع يكون هذا الحاجز دائم إللي يوقف قدامهم شي ثاني، إنه إحنا بواقع أو من واقع عملناه وخبرتنا لما نريد نقنع آ واتبركانو آ دائما نقول لهم فلان سوى كان من منطقتهم أو من. من؟ من مدينتهم، أي مثلا إحنا لما حاليا نشتغل ويا مثلا فلاحين أو فتشين. إنه فلان شخص سوى هيتشي، أو نجح عده، هو فعليا نجح، إحنا ما نحكي فد شي فيك أو فد شي محقق إنه فعليا شي نجح آ، زين إي هذا كلش يشجعها، صح؟ ايه؟ يعني موجود ببعض المناطق، و فلان سو اني ليش ما اسوي، فيصير هذا كلش موتيباشن عالي، عندهم نحن نشوفه، ممكن انا شخصيا اشوفه لا ليش ليش فلان سواه، اذا انا اسوي ممكن يكون الميز مالتها فلان تختلف عني، أو أني ما أحتاج فلان يسوي ها الشغلة هاي يلا أني أسويها أشوف أني احتاجتها، إذا أروح أسويها، بس هما لأ يعني بعضن أحيان، لأ أ كلش تشتغل بالعراق كلش تشتغل.

Ethiom ionلية تقريبا تستمر آه. تستمر عشر سنوات تقريبا. Ben benrah 15. إيه سوري بين بين ال ال1500. إلى 2000 دولار. هيك شي البطارية الوحدة، بس هو يبقى أكو فلكشويشن، آه كان أكو شركة كلش سائدة بال شركة صينية، ما أتذكر شنو اسمها؟\n\n00:39:22 Bilal\n.إي، وهلء

من عندهم لل للمشاريع اللي مشتغلين عليها، أوكي هذا الشي ممكن يصير فد شي مقارب، آه بس البرتوليو حيكون الروبورت مالة السيستيم اللي أنا مسمونه، كان عندي صور أو شنو الفكرة؟\n\n01:10:04 Bilal\nيعني وينه بسوون كل هاي ويسوون تصميم يسوون بوست على اللينكتين، زين لو بوست على الإنستجرام لو مكان، إذا هم صدقوا يفكرون يفتحون عمل هنا حتى ي الناس يشوفوها ويشوفون شغلهم، وأكو احتمال نقدر نسويها إي يعني نغير نقول

بدنا نحاول نسويها بهذا التدريب إنه. إيش؟ قد ما أقدر أحاول أرتب التدريب من قبل، بس بعدين حصر ال. وب واحد من ال إنه إنت لو الناس اللي يريدون يسوون للتدريب ياخدون ال. ويشتغلون عليها، ويكون مالتهم، مو إنه أنا بدي أعطيك، وسوي هذا ال. أني أعطيك باكاج إي، صح؟ يعني المعلومات والترتيب أني إذا أحاول أحشي وياه هواي ناس أحاول أرتب وآخذ أحسن الأفكار، آه ويكون واقعي، بس بالنهاية إنت لازم تحس إنه هي مالتك وإنت تعرفون تقدمها، ف المدرب، الفكرة إنه هو إنت تستعمل بواحد ثاني يستعمل يجوز برنامج ثاني، بس ال إنه يكون عنا وكل مدرب يقدر يكون شوية م يغيروها ب بطريقتهم، لأنه إذا واحد يروح يتعلم في شي جديد حد يقدمها، لأ، ليش ما يخالف إستعمل اللي تعرفها، ف آه شي ق عليها، أتوقع أخذت إي من وقتك إستفادت ونست هواية، أنا ما أعرف إذا إنت تونست، بس أنا تونست\n\n01:12:46 Hussam Falih\n.أكيد سعيد إنه التقيت. الشخص ممتاز،

فات هواية آه بديت كمهندس الله يتشوفوا آه وكمبيوتر ساينس و آه فلسفة، آه و لما تخرجت بديت شركات الإنسان الآلي كانت أ برمج الإنسان آلي لل معامل بميشيغان وبعدين بديت أفكر يعني إي ليش بس أني ليش بس أني أسوي هالأشياء هيك شي ف ام أسست فكرة ال أسمها all hands active إنه. الإبداع والإختراع والإلكترونيات والبرمجة وال. يعني يخربطون يعني يجمعون بين كل هذول الأشياء، وهذا من زمان ب2009 يعني كبير، وبعدين صار ال. الثورة العربية وآني إجتنت مولود وكبران وعايش طول عمري من ميشيغان، فقدت أساس، صار الوقت إنه نجيب، هذول الأفكار إنه إحنا ما نغير العالم بتغيير الحكماء، نغير العالم بإيدنا و نغيرها، عملي ا إنه إحنا نخترع ونبدع، نبدأ نسوي الأشياء، مال، مستقبل، ف الفكرة بدت إنه نيجي على الشرق الأوسط ونأسس إم. للإبداع، مثل إيي ساينس كامب في البصرة، فكرة سبيس ببغداد. التقيت ويا صالح من زمان، ب بداية موسال سباسي ب2014 زار ويايا، ويعني مع في ال ال التقينا آه وبس، مو بس بالعراق مصر بلبنان، أسسنا لمبا لابس مصر كايروس بالمغرب، آه برفايا هاكر سبيس، بنيجيريا، بكينيا بالهند، اشتغلت بهوايا أماكن إنه نأسس هدول. ت واحد من الأvisers يعني لما قبل ما بدو يتراسلون وياي يرادوني يشتغلوا وياهم. ما أعرف، أنا صار لي فترة بهل هذا المجال، إيش لون؟ إحنا ن ن نقدر نحلم المستقبل ونكون مجتمع وقابلية و نعمل اي إن حتنحقق أحلامنا، فهذا اللي ش يمكن اللي اشتغلوا عليه فترة طويلة، وبعدين بديت ب2019 لستطعش إي مؤسسة بلبنان يسوي. اللي يحاول يضيف شي ثاني، بالبداية ركزت على التكنيكية والبزنس، وبعدين لازم تفكر إنه هو، هو شخصية ال إي الإحساس ال ال يعني شلون واحد يقدر يكون مقنع، شلون يسوي بوبليك speaking، شلون يقدر يسوي it's high management؟ يكون عندها نية طيبة، كل هذول الأشياء ال الفي الداخل ال وبعدين سويت تدريب آه يعني ماجستير آه ب2020 عن آه فتشي إسمها بوست توماريك جروث، شلون بنقدر ما في، إذا تعرف فكرة أنتي فرجيلي بس ال يعني ينكسر صح؟ تضرب ما بتشاكوش ينكسر، أهلين معناها تضرب ويتحسن، ف أنا أشوف إنه العالم بيها هواي تغييرات، وهواية مشاكل، وإحنا لازم نسوي وواحد من هادول ال إسمها عادي، ا واحد لما صار عنده مشكلة يصير أسوء، بس أكو ناس يتحسنون ف سويت بحث عن شنو ال؟ environments by nasty يتحسنون ورا مصيبة. فهذا إسمها بوست تراث. وبعدين بديت أحاول أخذ هذول هذا البحث و فوتها بال فسويت عن شلون بنقدر نسوي كرا حتى ندخل بيها، هذول ال مع الواحد من عندهم، إنت بديت فيها هاليوم أول شي. إي. لما أحس إنه نحنا مو مفردين في العالم، إنه نحنا عنا هذول إي المجتمع اللي حوالينا لما يصل عنا مصيبة نكون أفضل. فالغريب الناس اللي بالعمل عاديا ما يبنون العمل بالطريقة حتى يكون هذا ال الإنفتاح، المشاعر وال آه القهوة والشاي مرات كلش صح، فلما يصير مصيبة كل واحد بعده مفرد، بس إذا واحد يفكر حتى يحسن ال ويحسن التدريب ويحسن ال لأنه العالم بيها، كل هدول المصائب يوم على يوم يكون أفضل، إذا إنه نكونهم بطريقة إنه ناس يقدرون يعشون مع بعض، ونكون هذا ال مع ال، فهذا واحد من ال وده أجيبها بالداخل، ال التدريب وال مشاريع عمالتي، فهذا شوي ال وآخر شي اللي أنا بدي أشتغل فيها، اللي أنا يعني مثل ما قلت ما أقدر أسأله هذا السؤال، ما أعرف إذا أقدر أحكي عن هذا الموضوع بس. راح أحشيها أني أتوقع واحد من المشاكل. مال هذا ال ال المفردية جاية من فلسفة آه من ال آه ال آه الغربية الويسترن آه بريسبكتيف، وهذا بدت من أيام ديك هارت، ما تعرف ديك كارت، هو قال وهذا بدء فتشي يسموها هو galileo من قبلها، قال إنه العالم كله بس أشياء ملموسة، ماكو أي شي حقيقية بال اي. اي الإحساس. بس إحنا نعرف لما نشوف آه ال الشمس، أو إذا يشرق لدى يضرب، نعرف إنه هو هي جميلة نعرفها مثل نظر عين، بس إذا واحد يسألك ليش جميل؟ شنو رح تكون؟ ها؟ لأنه هو الألوان حلو، لأنه شنو؟ لأ، لأنه هو إحنا عنا إحساس بالإنجليزي رح أقولها.

ABKAN\n.مثلا تعرف في أربيل خارج، خلينا نقول أربيل مصافي النفط، فهناك نسبة الغاز عالية إم و نسبة الحرارة تقرأ النفاير، لكنه لا يوجد فاير، أها فانحاول\n\nBILAL\nنطور الكمبيوتر يعني أعوذ بالله بس يعني. التراب والحر صح والجو يعني واحد يفوت، وإذا جبت واحد من مكان خارج دخلت العراق يقول نار هو ال فاز. هاهاها\n\nALI ABKAN\n.صح صح. فدائما فهي هاي هاي المشكلة إي فا جبنا يعني يولو إليفن فرجن إليفن إم أي أي

يعني إنه أوكي، أوكي فعلا أكو حريق، فصستهم يتخذوا القرار النهائي، البروتوكول ويطلع نتائج\n\nBILAL\nحلو هذا يعني فد شي تتوقع كلش مهم، شلون طلع عليك هذه الفكرة إنه تشتغل بيها؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.ما هي أنا المشكلة يعني درست هندسة حاسبات بالموصل كهارد وير، كملت صار لي سبع سنين منظمات دولية ووكالات عالمية، أشتغل، بعدين من جيت أربيل وشفت الوضع وهاي الأمور، ودرست أول سنة كان عنا أساتذة من الخارج، أجانب جايبين جامعة، كل سنة، هؤلاء نعم، ف. يعني تبلورت الفكرة. وعندي المشرف تبعي مخلصه بأمريكا الماستر والدكتوراه جديد جامعة كاليفورنيا، فهو يعني ساعدني\n\nBILAL\n.حلو، حلو آ. و. و\n\nALI ABKAN\n.زين، سولف لنا عن نفسك\n\nBILAL\n.زين فأني شو اسمه؟ إيش كنت أشتغل بال آ الإلكترونيات، يعني سينسرات بس آ أكثر شي السانسور فيوجن أوغريز إذا تعرفهم\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إم\n\nBILAL\nعندك تعرف بس تحتاج يعني آ تجمعهم مع بعض حتى تعرف فد شي آ يعني يشملهم كلهم ف عندهم هواية سنسرات يجدون يعرفون هذا، أنا أشتغل بيها لل آ معامل آ الفكرة عشان إنه نقدر نبدل هدول البالتات، تعرفهم كل مرة المعمل يريد يغير ال ال الإنتاج مالتها، لازم يشيلوا من كل البالطات وجبنوها من جديد، هذا يحتاج أشهر ويعني علم وخبرة وقابلية يعني كبيرة وكلفة كبيرة، فقلنا ليش ما نبرمجها؟ ليش ما نخلي هي يعني مو بس يقول مثل سيارة، هي تصير ولمن تريد تغير ال آ ال آ تنظيم المعمل تقدر تبرمجهم، فسيف درايفين كارد في آ يعني مشروعي من زمان آ بس بعدين ورا الثورة العربية أنا قلت يلا خلينا نيجي على الشرق الأوسط، نشتغل للشباب نشجعهم، هم يأسسون، هم يفكرون هم يسوون إبداع، ف راحت من مبرمج إلى معلم. يشبههم، يبدء بحرف الميم. يعني خلاص. هاهاها\n\nALI ABKAN\n.نبيهم learning\n\nBILAL\n.صح. آه ف. فبديت أشتغل بالشرق الأوسط، التقيت معاه صالح إنه هو كان بيشرب بنفس المجال بنسبة ال آ موصل سبيس، ع أساس إنه فكرة سباس بغداد وكايو هاكر سبيس بالمصر، و بلبنان أساس المكان\n\nALI ABKAN\n.اسمها ما شاء الله\n\nBILAL\nكل فكرة، إنه نشجع ناس، إنه يشوفون مشاكل ويفكرون حلول، يكونون يعني عندهم هذه العقلية وإنه إي هم اللي صنعون المستقبل الأفضل ويساعدون بعض ال المساعدة الإبداع. كل هدول الاشياء، فاشتغلت على هذا لمدة آه سنين، وبعدين بديت الاحظ انه آه المين ست هي اهم من القابلية من الاشياء التكنيكية والادوات وما ادري شنو آه ال والنية الصافية، وال آه العلم النفس، ويعني هواية اشياء إللي ناس مو كلش كاملة إي إي، فأني بالبداية كنت أفكر حلول تكنولوجية و آ، وأنا بس لمن واحد يفكر ب يفكر إيش لون يقدر يحل المشكلة إللي يحل المشكلة لإلي أنا أقدر أروح من البرمجة ال آ الإنسان الآلي، وأحل مشكلة مشكلة إلى أن أعلم ناس البرمجة\n\nALI ABKAN\n.وهم\n\nBILAL\nهواية مشاكل، لو يعني إن. إن. إن آ؟ نصمم مجتمع إللي عندها آ ال الثقافة، ال آ حلول المشاكل، و ي ف بدت يجي آ يشتغل ب مجالات مختلفين، ودرست آ تدريب آ ر رسمي سويت ماجستير بيها، وحسه أني يعني آ اشتغل مع الآي تي سي الإنترناشونال فيد سنتر كمستشار آم ديزاين هزا وصلنا ال آ\n\nALI ABKAN\n.خلصنا نتعرف\n\nBILAL\nأنت آ إذا أشوف إنه هو الأشياء إللي أنت تعرفها كلش، يعني إحنا نفكر إنه دا نحاول زين، أها، ما ما وصلت ال آ لمن لما عندك ديزاين السيستم، شو تسوي أول شي؟ أنت تعرف الهدف صح؟ إللي هي الكريكيوم هي سيستم إش لون نقدر نصمم فد صح؟ إكسبيرينس إللي راح يغير بال آ بالدنيا، فد طريقة نوعا ما حتى نوصل لنتيجة، النتيجة مالتنا بالآي تي سي هذا المشروع إنه نريد آ نكون أعمال آ للناس، آ يعني يلقون شغل، بس مو بس أي أعمال أعمال بمجال إللي راح يبني بيوت خضراء بالموصل، وراح يحل مشكلة الاستدامة، فكل هدول الأشياء مع بعض الشباب العاطلة الاستدامة، البيوت المتدمرة، كل هادول الأشياء مع بعض، بس الأساس لمن قاعد أسوي الديزاين لازم إنه مو بس معلومات، لازم أفكر شلون هذا راح يسوي هذا الشخص، هذا الشخص راح راح يقربه على أن يقدر يلقي شغله. شلون you know؟ لو إش لون؟ هذا؟ يعني ال بالنسبة لل آه ال ال دخلت الإستدامة واضحة يعني ما نحتاج نحشي بيها، آه ال آه ال ال فرص العمل أم هذا فد شي يجوز لازم شوية نركز عليها، يعني شنو القابليات إللي ناس يحتاجون يتعلموها بالداخل؟ حتى نساعدهم لما يتخرجون يقدرون يلقون شغل آ يشتغلون، وال ال مهم، لأنه ما بدنا نبدي من الصفر، لأنه بس عنا ستة أيام، فإحنا بنفكر إنه نشتغل وياه ناس خريجين مهندسين عندهم آ يعني دبلوما إلكترونيات له فد شي، وراح نطور نطور مهاراتهم ونشارك لهم، آه أنا أقدر أرويكي ال النموذج من الديزاين، بس أريد آخد من رأيك إذا إنت كنت\n\nALI ABKAN\n.عندك\n\nBILAL\n.ست أيام، تسوي؟ أعمال خضراء تفضل احشيلي هاي هي\n\nALI ABKAN\n.المشكلة إنه إحنا بالعراق، يعني إنت كنت فتم علينا. إنيرجي أو خلينا نقول جديد على المنطقة كلها إم. فأكو أمور شركات أو أشخاص ومن جيل قصيرة بقالة، كل من جاء يحاول ينصب ويشتغل، هذا يدمر أسلوب أنطيهم ك. كمثال أني أول ما بلشت بخ ب يعني الحمد لله بسبب خبرتي وأيضا الماستر إللي عدو سويه قدمت على شركة. You said sheddyka you. Said justin yeah ما موجودة من العراق. هذا وكيل حصري فأني مهندس دعم تقني للعراق كله مع شركة صينية على مستوى العالم خامسة أو سادس عالميا. تعرف دي وعندك هواوي وسولنز وكم اسم. بس جيساج بالمركز الرابع والخامس إي فهي فهي موجودة بأوروبا إي ألمانيا بولندا، هولندا بأفريقيا بالعراق. راح تبعت لك إياه إذا هاي الواتساب تشاي ساجد هما مختصين فقط في الإنفرترات والبطاريات، ما لهم علاقة بالواح الشمسية، ف أنت تعرف أنواع الشمسية فيه رئيزن. في ااا كندية أنواع في. يعني أوصلك هو بالحكي، فشركة نون هما وكيل عربي موجود في العراق، أصحاب أردنيين موجودة عراق سوريا، لبنان، مغرب خليج تركيا، هي الوكيلة حسنة منتجات نون، هما حاليا يدربون وكلاء في العراق، يعني مثلا فيه عندهم وكيل في السليمانية في وكيل في كركوك كركوك، هذولا الوكلاء بينهم أشخاص مهندسين تعرفي بدون يشترون بضاعة فيدربوهم يدربون كوادرهم، منو إللي يدربهم؟ أنا مهندس كرم. الرجل إللي هو زميلي خلص أنظمة طاقة بتركيا، أربع سنوات، إحنا صار حقبة داعش فهو كمل هناك كمل الماستر. فهو كان نفس منصفي، صار ال على المهندسين اللي بالعراق وبسوريا جيساج عندها في كل دولة مهندس دعم تقني فقط إم ف الموضوع إللي أريد أصأله إنه إحنا مشكلتنا بالعراق مثلا قبل وين؟ نتواصل مع شخص؟ منصب يصب ويكون وكيل، ف، قلت له أنت مهندس؟ قال له أني فني دش لي فيديو شوية نصب وأني أنصب هاي مع طماطة، يعني ما تق أصور لك وقت أصلا أني كمهندس تابع\n\nBILAL\n.لشركة سنية يعني بس قولي كم خطوة خطوة إي وخلص هاي\n\nALI ABKAN\n.هي رحم الله العظيم، وأيضا. إحنا ك مهندسين. يعني إحنا صعب نعرف إنه نصب وهاي الأمور، لكن كشغل أني على الأمور المزعجة والصعبة، يعني مثلا الزبون عنده مشكلة يرجع للوكيل ماله، المشتري منه مثلا بالموصل، خلينا نقول صالح وكيل إم صالح، ما قدر يرجع لشركة نون، شركة نون ما قدروا يحلوها، يرجعون، الجي ساج، تعرف أنت، ثم يقولوا عمي إحنا دائما نشرح للزبائن نقول له أنت من تشتري بيئة وتعطى للبيئة وتخابر شركة بي إم دبليو بألمانيا وتغلط عليهم، لو تروح ع الوكيل، البيئة من إللي بالعراق يحل لك المشكلة؟ أو تويوتا ف. أول شي إللي درجات لك إياه\n\nBILAL\nوبعدين؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إي إي صح صح، فأنتوا أهم شي إذا تريدون ادربون أشخاص كصدتي، يعني أول شي لازم تجيبوا لهم أشخاص من أماكن يعني حقيقية، يعني مثلا في شخص من الناس ممكن صالح يعرفك عليه شخص، هو حر ينصب إي يعرف، لكن هذا ما عنده الباك جراوند الحقيقي أو الخبرة الرسمية إللي تأهله تأهله، إي يعني إحنا حاليا كل خبرتنا الحمد لله الأسبوع الجاي جايين الصينيين من الصين، مهندسين إثنين راح يدربون أني وكرم أيضا يسوي الصيانة على إندربرات، يعني، يعني حاليا نعرف نصلح نعرف نبدل البوردات، نعرف نسوي أبديت سيستيم، أبديت، و كثير مو قالوا لأ، نريد بعد، شنو بعد تلحم وتفتح السوالف، إي يعني أدفان 11 إي إي درامزسترات، والبورد، وتفحص وتلقي الخلل، وين بال آ بالدباقين، أنت مهندس، فالحمد لله دتم عليا سوي ديباقينج بالكودينج وتفوت على أبتومايزيشن ف شي جميل جدا. أها فأني شنو؟ قصدي؟ قلت لك إنه أنت دا تريد ادرب، كانت تريكلوم لأن أني أحكي أيضا كمنظمات دولية يمكن عملت فيها الأمم المتحدة إي أن يونامي، كنت اشتغلت مع بلوموندشيال ميدكال كوربس، سي آر أي. إس، أكيد تعرفون؟ وأكتد وتيرفوند وغيره. إش كم سبع من الظباط قال\n\nBILAL\nشنو هاي يعني؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nسبع منظمات دولية؟\n\nBILAL\n.كله من الشغل بكل الجهات يعني\n\nALI ABKAN\n.كل الجهات إي إي ف هي سبحان الله، يعني الحمد لله التوفيق من الله، الحمد لله، فمن أحكي لك أكركم، كنت آخر شي معاه سيارة، صممنا هاي الأمور، كان عنا مشروع أيضا آ مع يونيسيف، وصممنا كريكيولوم لتدريب الشباب، نفس المنهاج ذات ما له علاقة بالسؤال. ع الإيتشبرنيور شيب عنجب تريينينج إم. و ومع الآي لوت كان عنا مشروع هو اسمه دبليو بيل وورك بايست ليرنينج إي إي. اسمه وورك بايست ليرنيننج مع العيال هذا يعني كان تقريبا\n\nBILAL\nتدريب، لو أنت قدمت التدريب، إش كم من هذولا أنت تاخذ إش قد منهم؟ دا أنت دا ت دا تقدم؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إي إي مع الآية دربونا إي، وإحنا دربناه إي إي، فأنا يعني كنت خلي نقول أنطق تدريبات على ريادة الأعمال إي. اللي بعد على البزنس مع اليونيسيف احنا اخدنا تدريبات ورش في دهوك على كان عندهم اسمه المواطنة والتدريب، بس كان ال التينة ه\n\nBILAL\n.هاي جزء جدا مهم، لأنه إحنا واحد من الأشياء إللي دا نفكر بيها بالتدريب إنه هذا ال المشروع، إذا هو طرقين إنه نقدر نسوي فرص عمل واحد يأسس مش مشروع\n\nALI ABKAN\nمش نزل خاص؟\n\nBILAL\nيسوي؟ مشروعه يفتح محل آ يعني؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.يعني بيزنس ديفلومنت\n\nBILAL\n.بيزنس بس همينة يحتاج، يعرف ينصب حتى لمن يحكي ويا المهندسين، ويحشي ويا ال آ الفنانين يقدر ينطوهم\n\nALI ABKAN\n.المعلومات الصح، ما هو هنا مركز الكلام، إنتوا إذا تجيبون لازم تجيبون أشخاص على الأقل على الأقل عندهم خبرة بسيطة بمجال، خلي نمشي عربي، تعرف الطاقة الشمسية إي، لأن إذا تجيبوا من الصفر من الصفر ما ممكن حتى الناس تفق بيه، يعني يعطيك مثال حاليا، فشوك الكثير من الإمبراطورات مثلا. ممكن 300، 400 دولار يشترون 6 كيلو واط أو 8 كيلو واط. ممكن الجساج تبيعه بعشرة أوراق 1000 دولار أو 900 دولار. وفي سحب فظيع ليش بينطوا ضمان عشر سنين بينطوا دعم خلال 48 ساعة بينطون إستجابة للأعطال السيفر يعني ال مجاني ف بيعطيك ما يعني منو أفتر سيم إي خصائص ما بعد البعويض\n\nBILAL\n.وأ أني سامع أكو آ ناس. ما أعرف دا يصير أكو مشاكل بال بالسوق، إنه ناس يجون يقولون أكو آ عشر سنين، بس ورا سنتين الشركة يعني تختفي. يحطون اسم محلي يعني عراقي، لو فتشي عليها ويشتغلون سنة سنتين، ويقولون\n\nALI ABKAN\n.هاي شي مهم، أنت حاليا هسة بأربيل مثلا، لوين؟ بأربيل لبغداد يحكون مثلا؟ إي لا لا حنحكي الموسم مثلا، خلي نقول كزبائن، لكن مرة جانا مهندسين إحنا الورشة بيها غرفة كاملة سبير بارت إم تعبانه، فما ممكن الشركة تنهزم بيها تقريبا 1213 حاوية بالعراق وبغداد إم وعندهم مخزن بدبي، وأيضا شركة حقيقية بالكامل كوب سايت بتفوت وتسأل نتأكد، فهو أنا قلت لك قصدي شنو إذا بديتوا ك. Curriculum city حتى ال المتدربين يثقون بيهم، وأيضا أنا أفضل كلش إنه يكون مهندس حاس بعد كهرباء أو فني، يعني هذا الشخص من تفتهم معاه يعني مثل ما شاء الله حضرتك مهندس مثلا يقولوا لازم تربط توازي وتوالي أو 48 فول أو إي 51 فولتز\n\nBILAL\nالفولت ها إي يعني مثل ضغط الماي، ويعني مثل ابزي مناك هاهاها\n\nALI ABKAN\n.أشق هدومي إي احترمت الشام. إي فأنا من داومت مع هاي الشركة. أنا والدي مهندس كهرباء وأخويا إي ذاك السنة خلص، فإحنا من زمان نشتغل بقطاع الكهرباء إي يعني كمعامل وسنجل فيش، فإللي متعلم الأساسيات، فمن رحت ع الشركة لا إراديا إن كان فيه عطل تعرف العراق، نقول قعدت فتحت البورد ع الدفصي إي، ده هو هذا مهندس قديم مبين يعني إي تفهم عليه، بينما عينوا واحد شركة يعني نون وليست جيساج متدرج جديد. فإحنا عم نحكي يقولوا دير بالك الفري فاز، تعرف إذا واحد وبعد يطق إي فري فيس واحد سنجل كان 20 ثري فيز مو إثنين، هو سنجل فايز يعني واحد ثري فيز يعني عار وباردين، لأ، باردين بارد وحارين، هذا. هذا كفر، أنت تعرف. يزات وواحد مارد إي، فأهم. أهم نقطة إذا صممت لي كريكوولوم تعرفون ال المستهدف فيهم إي وأيضا أشخاص ممكن ممكن يعني على سبيل المثال فيه أشخاص هسة حيشتغلون مع شركات محلية إم أو مثلا على شركات شمسية يريدون يوسعون البزنس، الموصل فيها ضعف قوي، إي هسة فيه. فيه كركوك والسليمانية فيه تاجر اسمه بيشكو، هو مخلص. صيدلة وبيشتغل بالمجال سحب. تعلم س عنده مهندسين إثنين جوه يريدوا يتعلم كل شيء منهم، قبل أسبوع، سحب 100 بطارية البطارية على 1000 دولار، 100,000 دولار، سحب بذاعة ما شاء الله حيمشي، فقصدي إنه في تجار كركوك سليماني في أربيل، في شركة بيج باور، آ باور سولس، سان شركات قوية بالطاقة الشمسية في كردستان، لكن بالموصل يعني قصة حزينة جدا إم ضعيفة جدا لأبعد مدى. والناس تخاف. أنتوا أنا لازم تشتغلون على ال. يعني أعطيك مثال، الناس تحسب بالموصل بشكل عام. في منظومة طاقة شمسية 1,000,000 1,000,000 1/2 عمي، هذا حق الباتري 1,000,000 تعرف يعني 1,000,000 1/2 10,000 دولار يعني 1000 دولار بالعراق، و1,000,000. 1/2 إي ف، مثلا، بخابروني بسألوني عدنا، 20 لمبير بالنهار 10:00 بالليل، يا أخي بس لحظة أنت فاهم الأمور، لأ، أريد 20 بالنار أحسن، أقول هذا يكلفك مثلا 4800 دولار، 4700 دولار، شركة جساج، منظومات كاملة غالية. إي تقول لا لقيت واحد بالسوق قال لي أنصب لك 30 أمبير بالنهار و20 إمبير بالليل ب2,000,000، أنا يعني أريد أنتحر آ، فأنت هذا الموضوع\n\nBILAL\n.نفوت هذا بالداخل للتدريب زين، إي نقدر نسوي بالتدريب حتى نحكي على هدول المواضيع، لأنه هو الفكرة إنه لما الناس يروحون رخيص يدفعون غالي، بصدق، يعني بالنهاية انقطع الخط شوية\n\nALI ABKAN\n.العفو، تسمعني؟ أعتقد فصل الواي فاي؟ فتحت بيانات سمعت قصدك، آه عيد بالله واحد\n\nBILAL\nيفكر إنه يروح. يحاول يسوي أرخص شي، بالنهاية يدفع هواية أكثر من ما من ما إذا راح إشترى الغالي من البداية، آ؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nممكن بسنة يقع المنظومة، يعني إنت تعرف ممكن بسنة المنظومة تنهار ما تتحمل هذا ال الحكي ال الضغط أنت يعني؟\n\nBILAL\nإللي يصير بالمجتمع ال بالمص بالموصل الناس ما يقولون شي على ال إللي نصب له إياه، ولا يقول شي على الماركة الخايسة الخربانة إللي يستعملوها، يقول شي على ال ال آ الطاقة الشمسية\n\nALI ABKAN\n.الطاقة الشمسية\n\nBILAL\nتقول هذا ما يشتغل بالموصل. جر مجرب ابن عمي. ما أدري شنو؟ فا شو لازم تغير هذا؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.كامل صح؟ يعني هو السيستم أصلا لازم يشغل 80% من كفائته، يعني إذا من؟ طيب باتري ونقول هذا الباتري مثلا تريد 150 إمبير. Classy لازم 80% منكافات حتى لا يستعر الألواح مثلا، تعرف إحنا دايما نضربها مجموع مثلا يريدوا 20، فيعني ال ال الموضوع هنا شلون تنطي ثقافة؟ هذا الشي؟ ممكن أثناء القبول تاخدون أشخاص، فاهمين هاي أول نقطة يعني إي أو أو قبل لا أدخلوه مع هاي الدورة، ممكن ممكن مثلا فد ورشة آ توعوية يعني مجانية تقوم بإطلاق حملة إي من أسبوعين مجموعة ورش مجانية فقط للتوعية بهذا الموضوع، المجتمع ينراد تسوي له ز يعني الريز هسة أعطيك مثال السليمانية كلش واعين بها الموضوع مقارنة برميل، وموصل إي على أرض الواقع أني أريد أشتغل أشوف متواصلين معايا مثلا يقول نريد تحديث، أقول له التحديث. العفو، أعتقد فصل. تسمعني تمام ما مشكلة، فمثلا نحكي مع الزبائن، التحديث يخربط الفولتيه أو الإنفرتر، ممكن. مرات الشاشة السلبية يعني هو ما يؤثر على الفولتيه أو الكهربا أو شاحن. They thought in most of others. No this is most important thing. بس اشتري أريد أحقق يابا يا أخي افتهم ما له علاقة. بينما أنتو عارفين معانا جماعة السليمانية مثلا، أقول أنت جبت الفورطيك الكهرباء شيكت فلان، شي فاهم الشركات اللي هناك قاعد تشتغل، حتسوي توعية قوية، يعني حتى عندهم سكول سنتر، فتتواصل معاي الموظفة من كول سنتر أستاذ علي، بعد ما سوينا أوردر الإنفرتر، أعتقد دي مشكلة، دخلوا أنتوا نخليهم يربطون أونلاين وندخل، إحنا ع السيستم سوفتير، الريموتلي\n\nBILAL\n.هدف مالتنا أعمال تعرف شنو؟ أكو احتمال لازم نسوي درسين مدرس للناس. ترى يعني صوت درس؟ تعالوا توعية. تعالوا احكوا لنا مشاكل الطاقة الشمسية بالموصل يا ناس يحبون يحكون عن المشاكل مالتها وما يشتغل وشايفها وما ادري شنو المجربة ومادري. تعالوا جيبوا كل هذولا ونحل لكم إياه، نقطة نقطة ونقول لكم ليش؟ وبعدين خلينا نسوي آم شي واحد، يعني ال آ إللي نحتاج نسوي بال آ الدرسين. آ الفايننشالسي؟ يعني إنت رح تدفع شقد تتوقع؟ وهسا خن نضيف عليها الإحتماليات، زين ال خلينا نقول عنا آ مية شخص، كل واحد مشتري آ من ماركة ال آ ال آ البرابيلي مالتها إنه ينكسر كل سنة تزيد، آ خم 5% آ ف عندك ال آ. يعني ال ال عدد الخسارة بكل سنة، وبعدين تقول حنقول عنه هذا، وبها ال آ شن شنو يصير بال ريتورن أون إنفيستمنت لمن عندك الريل وورنتي، صح؟ إم إذا تقدر توثق إنه بعشر سنين راح يبقى وياك هذا الجهاز وراح يشتغل قارنها بناس، آم أكو احتمال لازم يشترون ثلاث أجهزة بنفس المدة، زين؟ ف لازم نسوي فد يعني كالكليشنز، حتى الناس يعرفون ليش الغالي رخيص\n\nALI ABKAN\nهو اكو ناس عرفوا في محافظتي عن طريق مثال، حاليا اكو زبائن مثلا يشترون يجي يقول اشو هذا؟ بيه مثلا احنا ال ال؟ تعرف فأكو مكان الإنترنت أكو 23 فارغين يجي يقول هذا ليش فارغ؟ يقولوا هذا بعد خمس سنين، خمس سنوات رح تيجي التقنية للعراق، راح نستعملها حاليا موجودة لاند ألمانيا، إي نستعملها إي، لكن العراق مثلا هسة ماكو سيل كده جريد عليها ماكو إي، وإللي يقول لك أكو كلاوشي مستقبلا ممكن يصير تعرف بالخارج إي أنت أول ما تشغل السولار السيستم عندك كتب سناب. تشارلز دابادري أور تودا هوم إي. فأكو ناس تعرف مثلا مثل ما نقول بخراء جدا في الغرب، أو هما هاكل يريد، أهم شي يخلص من الوطن والحكومة الغالي إي فسلته ذا جريد إي بيرجع وطني للحكومات، فهنا من؟ من نشرح لهم شنو الهايبرد فرقه عن الأوفقريد، أغلب إللي حنصبوني من صبونة ما أنت تعرف أوف جريد هذا يحسب أوف جريد ما يصبغ ع الوطني، لا أوف جريد هو ما يبيع وطني، إي هو يفيد. بس ممكن بعد خمس سنين الحكومة العراقية تقول إحنا راح نسوي. إم يعني بتعرف أنت تقول أنت تبيع الحكومة مكارم، عاد ما يطلع عليه كهرب، فهذا الثقافة 0% بالموصل، من الأخير أقول لك إي على حكم شغلي بينما أربيل سليمانية، لأ قوية دهوكة بمدينة منعزلة الوسط والجنوب بكثرة، لأن الكهربا عندهم تعبان إم، يعني هاي نقطة مهمة، الوطني تعبان جدا، فأنتوا إذا مثلا راح تش تسوين تدريبات بالموصل تدرس ال ال. إي، تعرف نحكي؟ تستهدفون فقط، مثلا مثلا التجار للمهندسين للشباب المتخلصين هسة وعنده طموح يدخل ال ال السؤال يا رنيرجي، فهاي الأمور لازم تفكرون بيها،\n\nBILAL\nشوية يعني آ مثل يجي تجربة. راح نختار الناس اللي إنت تحبهم مهندسين يعرفون الإلكترونيات ال ال ثري فيز ال، كل هذه يعرفوها، وعندك ست أيام وياه وياهم، والهدف إنه هو لمن يتخرجون، يعني راح ي يفتحون فرص عمل، لو يلقون فرص عمل شو؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.تسوي\n\nBILAL\nيعني ست أيام، خمس أيام، أنت قرر شنو أيام؟ شو تسوي؟ أول يوم ثاني؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nأول يوم، أول يوم. نتكلم عن ال عالميا إم وأنواع العالمية، يعني هي كل. إم يعني نت نتناقش مثلا ليش يساعد أحسن أو صالس أو ديا من حيث ال السايكل باتري التفاصيل، ننطيهم توعية قوية حتى لو ما مهندسين على هذا العالم، إم اليوم الثاني أبدي معاهم على الإنفرترات نفسخها بالعراق، تعرف سواء ال ال الأونجريد الأوف جريد إللي هايبرد إي الأنواع ال ال الكومبونيتس الداخلية، يعني أعطيك مثال فيرترات تفتحه حتى شركة داخلي لا ينجح، ما حاطين بيها، إذا يجي الكهربا إش عليه يقول له الله بالخير يفجره، يعني حتى صرت ماكو، بينما. في مثلا ما ناس جيساج في شركات قوية، الباتري باتري مانجمينت سيستيم هذا شو يسوي؟\n\nBILAL\n.منو في. في\n\nALI ABKAN\nباترييات بدون في باترييات بدون والله، و مثلا أكو أكو مثلا نقاط جدا مهمة، فثاني يوم عن الإنفرترات، ثالث يوم ع البطاريات، اليوم الرابع نصب نصب علني نعتبره عامل ينزل إنجنير، أنت مهندس صح؟ مثل كلام أبوي يقول\n\nBILAL\n.أول يوم ال. التاريخ والفيشنسي ثاني إي ثاني يوم ال آ\n\nALI ABKAN\nتخصخ؟\n\nBILAL\n.الإنفرترات، هسة، فصلنا ثالث يوم صح؟ أوكي زين ع بالي ضاع علي يوم تنصح\n\nALI ABKAN\n.البطاريات. لا، لا، هسة هيستوري، إنفرتر إي بعدين باتري إي ثالث يوم صار أه رابع يوم\n\nBILAL\n.نحتاج على الأقل يعني 34 إنفرترات من التعيسة إلى المرسيدس\n\nALI ABKAN\n.والجيدة\n\nBILAL\nالكل صح و فسخوها وقولوا لي ليش هذا زين؟ وهذا مو زين؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.أنا ما رح أقول لكم\n\nBILAL\nإنتوا قولولي وليش؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nنحتاج هاي؟\n\nBILAL\nالموسم، وبعدين يجوز شنو تأثيرها بال آه؟ حسابات المادية؟ مال إيه برنامج ككل هاي يكون في شي حلو؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.حلو، فسلمنا تستوري باتريز. وبعدين قلنا نصب يعني ينصب كامل، نبدأ يوم من الصبح للعسل نشرحلهم شلون يجيب الألواح وشلون ينصبها، و خلي نقول تعمل شنو؟ حساب ال السيستم الكلي، مال نظام الطاقة الشمسية، يعني مثلا تعرف إحنا نزل على مستوى المجتمع، جاهزة، لأ، لأ، حساب ال الإمبيرات إللي يريدها الزبون، والكلفة، يعني من تعمل؟ إش لون؟ أحكي لك إياها، وأنت صيغة إي، إحنا مجتمعنا جديد، جزء كبير. ويستي ديس إز بايسي community ف. ال يجي يجيبلك، أريد عشرة بالنهار 5:00 بالليل. شلون تحسبها أنت كمهندس؟ أريد 20 من الراك يوم هندس خابرني ما شاء الله يريد 50 أمبير بالنهار، اللغة والبيت والده و20 بالليل، فهو ما يمون فيرتار باتري ألواح، هو بده 50 بالنهار من 20 بالليل لازم كمهندس أخذ تدريب يعرف يحسب كم لوح كم واحد، تعرف أنت مثلا بالنهار يوجد ألواح. وعندك الكهرباء مثلا الوطنية تجري فأنت تاخذ منه الوح ماكو؟ ما أدري، بالله فقط ما أدري ماكو ألواح، فتحسب الوقت إللي تحتاجه بالنهار مع الواط إللي تحتاجه بالليل، وتسوي مجموعة حسابات تقريبا، ورقة كاملة، يعني إي كان كوليشنز فولتي إلى أن تطلع بنتيجة نهاية تقول له مثلا مثلا أنت تحتاج إنفيرتار 8 كيلو وباتري 10 كيلو و16 لوح إم، والإم سي فور، والكونيكشن وال. والكهربائي ها القد ياخذ وال. والحداد ينصب

بالليل، زين ن ننطيهم إياها كلهم وبس، بعدين نريد نعرف الأسعار، بس بعدين نريد نعرف الفرق بيناتهم شنو ال ش شنو رح يفرق بيناتهم آ مدة الاستهلاك البطارية بلا ال إيش معناها؟ إيش وقت رح يخلص آ ال الحياة مالتها، شو وقت رح يضعف آ، وهاي معناها إش وقت لازم يشتروها من جديد الحسابات لأربع ف فريقي، يع فرق فرق أربع آ يعني؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.تيمات أربع سنين\n\nBILAL\nو آ نقسمهم على نفس المشروع، إن آ تقريبا نفس الأرقام، و نسوي كل هدول أشياء نفسخ و نسوي أناليس نفسخ الإنفجر انفصخ ونسوي بطاريات، سمعنا إنه أكو مشاكل بالبطاريات سميناها إنه ناس يشتروها، ما يعرفون إنه\n\nALI ABKAN\n.هدول مستعملة لو\n\nBILAL\nبيها مشاكل من الداخل ب. و ف هذا إللي راح يسويها. راح يخلينا نشوف من الأربعة أكو احتمال أكو فتجين هذا مو الغالي ومو الرخيص بس. ويا واحد أني ما أعرف، بس أتوقع ما أتوقع أكو ناس يعرفون، لأنه لازم أكو فيريبلات هواية ومن هدول إيش لون واحد راح ي ي يعني لازم أني أفكر بيها وأعمق بيها، ما أقدر أسويها هسة، بس ال مال ومال؟ تي كل هذول ال آ حتى نسوي المعادلة مال مال الفايننشال وال؟ ايو لايف تايم أف ذا بورد، يعني شقد راح يرجع لي يوفر لي فلوس وإيش قد دفعتها، هذا ناقص هذا، راح لازم نسويها إللي كل واحد من هذولا ك، فإذا تقدر تقدر تقول لي الرخيص الشركة هذا، آه هذول أنواع الأشياء والأسعار ال الوسط شركة، هذا هذول أنواع الأشياء بداخلها، والأسعار والغالي الشركة هذا، وهذول أنواع هذه يكون فد شي كلش يفيدني، حتى أقدر أحاول أبدي أفكر بهذول ال آ الحسابات\n\nALI ABKAN\n.هسا أني ما أقدر أجاوبك عليهم بالظبط، لأن أني صار يعني خلينا نقول صراحة أنا أشتغل مع شركة جيساج، ممكن أعرف شركة صريحتين أحسن، لكن إذا أدورلك أرخص يعني أحكيلك صراحة مثلا ذاك اليوم طلب صديقي جمع أرادوا شي رخيص، قلي قلي أكو ما أعرف شو اسمه كوتس، ما أعرف آ آ نيكستيتش ما أذكر الاسم بالضبط، فقال لي ممكن يعني توفرها إذا يريدوه، فصراحة أنا من باب خلي نقول إخلاص العمل كنت مركز كلش على جيساج، ممكن باكر بعد أجيب لك إللي تريده، أجيب لك أدعس وحدة، والأحسن والأحسن والأحسن مثلا فد أربعة، إي أقول لك أول إثنين تعيسين هاي الزينة وهاي الراقية، وفيه فيه الغالي كلش كمان، بس قلت لك يعني أنا حاولت أتقن المجال إللي بيه ضمن الشركة إللي إي أنطوني فرصة إي، وأيضا متعاملين مع غير يعني مثلا أكو فينشي، زين هو هاي يقول ديا يعني جيساج ودية تقدر تتم عليهم هذولا. إي جيدين نوعا ما يعني نفس المستوى بيها. هذولا بكتوب و وأكو الأنواع الأرخص. راح أبلغك أكو\n\nBILAL\n.احتمال ما عندهم أسامي كرتونة آ أسوأ\n\nALI ABKAN\n.صحيح، أكو إي. إي لا، لا، هما. هو أكيد أكو اسم، بس أكو مثلا أعطيك مثال. أنا أعرف ناس راحوا على الصين، تجار فلوس، سمعوا مثلا اسمك على مثلا ستات بلال مثلا، راح عمل ماركة بلال بلال سولار وجاب البطارية، بلال سولار، والله والله بلال سورت سوى كاتريز إنفرترز وجاؤوا للواقع موجودة، تعرف رايز ولونجي إي وبيشتغل، فمرة خابرنا زبون تواصل معانا وشلع، قال ترجيساج منصب باتري. فما بي اسم؟ قلت له شنو؟ قال والله أستاذ هذا باتري جماعتنا مسويه ببغداد، شايلوا، قلت له لازم ما بي إم إس ما يعني لا يوجد بي إم. إس يكفر إنفلتر يكفر، لأن ما يقدر يتواصل معاه الإنفيرتر آ يتحازم إيثر. نيت كابل عنده. يعني أتوقع أكو بيها أكو أبشري نقول له بدري يوز، فما نقول له بدريوز الغيه البي إم إس إنه ليثيوم لا تتفاهم معاه كثير، قراءة بعد ما يقدر يقراها، يعني بالإنفرتر عنا شاشة تفوت على سكشن خاص بالبادري إي إي بالإنفر بالجريد، الجنرال تفوت ع البدري م ما. ما يعرف، ما ماكو كومينيكيشن و بي إم إس ينطيه ال. ال القراءات الفولتية، والماكس فولت، وال ديس تشارج. هاي التفاصيل معقدة كلها، فيعني قلت لك أني باكر إن شاء الله أو بعده، أبعث لك أنت أستاذ بلال ع الواتساب مالتك، إي مجموعة تسمع الشركات أصنف لك هي هاي الراقية هاي الوسط، إي هاي التعبانة\n\nBILAL\n.هاي يكون حلو، أتوقع ه، بعدين هذا راح يكون يعني وي وينسى، أتوقع أني همين أتونس لأنه هي مو مثل جايين نروح نسوي معلومات، وأني عندي معلومات، راح أنطيكم إياه، بس هي المعلومات إحنا راح نفتهمها مع بعض خلال هذا البحث. إحنا راح نكون مقنعين بال ال آ السيستم إللي يناسب الجو والمكان العراقي، وإنتوا راح تعرفون شلون تبيعوها للزبون، ف يعني راح يكونون بالنهاية\n\nALI ABKAN\n.Awareness قولهم\n\nBILAL\n.بها\n\nALI ABKAN\n.يعني أيضا مثلا شركة مسوية حملة قوية ضد الآي بي توينتي، ونعتقد، هم يعيشون على بتعرف العراق حتى يتحمل الغبار والحرارة والدستور بتاعك، فطلبوا مني أسبوع الجاي جهز لهم الكريكلون بسيط الورا، راح أنطي بالسليمانية وميتين شخص تدريب، شركة نون، يعني هي راح اضبط الوضع. وكذلك لكركوب 100 شخص، فأني ما أتابع شركة. شركة نون للطاقة الشمسية، إنه هم بيزنس يبيعون البلطرات، باترييات، مالجيساج وباتريات الفيرترات أخرى عندهم الناس\n\nBILAL\n.إنه هو، يشترون ال البضاعة الصح، صح؟ يعني توعية، شوف\n\nALI ABKAN\n.صح هما هما عيسوون توعية لكن خطة ذكية جدا من خلال التوعية يروجون لنفسهم إنه هما خليهم. يعني هم شي هيتشي بيروحون على السليمانية، أقوى تجار الطاقة الشمسية، والمهندسين المشهورين، بيدعوهم أقوى تجار الطاقة عشان شي بكركوك بيدعوهم وبنتون تدريبه مجانية إم. والمدربين منو، إحنا خلي نقول إنه الصينيين إللي ربونا، أنت تعرف من تجيب واحد، الصينيين دار بيه شهادة عنده مثلا آ من ينطي التدريب يكون ال ال الكلاينتج آس، وأهل. ناخذ دورترات معانا إن فيرترجي ساج والبطارية ونشغل قدامهم إي فهاي النقطة، قلت لك يعني العراقيين يعني دا يلقفون إي هاي أهم نقطة، إي يعني أنت ممكن تجيب له هسة. أشخاص مشتغلين بالطاقة الشمسية، لكن لا يعودون لجهات الرسمية. جماعتنا ما يثقون، يعني يعرف صالح مرة ثانيه تدريب سبيس عدادات وخذوا شهادات من الجايزات، وقتك، إنت أشتغل في وكالة دولية أمريكية، وكنت ميل مانيجر إم، فمن جيت لطيفة التدريب، وأني الحمد لله ف جائزة أبروف ذاتي سيرتيفيت إم فجو جو، يعني جاء عن كمية عدد معقول إي، لكن لو جابوا أي شخص. خلي نقول هو خبير في بداية إي وأنت تدريب، لكن ما تابع الجهة\n\nBILAL\nهذا واحد من الأسئلة، مال، مال، مال، شهادة، و يعني خلينا نقول فتنة بهذا التدريب، شلون رح يكون بيها معنى؟ يعني؟ شلون رح يقدرون يستعملوها، يلقون شغل، يعني هي يعني خل نقول الآي تي سي حطت اسمها وراها هذا بيها فائدة، يعني بال بالسوق العمل ولا لأ؟ يعني إيش لون راح؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.يفيدك؟ أحكي لك صراحة هو أني أحكي لك يعني. لكش فرانكلي، أنتوا إذا تنطوك، أكيد شيء رائع، لكن الشهادة لازم تكون مصدقة مثلا مثلا أو خلي نقول أنتوا تحكون سواء معدية أو هواوي أو جيساج، ال الموجودين بالعراق، يعني أعطيك مثال على سبيل ال يعني خلي نقول الجوك، أنت قلت لهم شهادة مع شركة تسلا تيسلا ما موجودة بالعراق. But. They want something in iraq. They want someone if you. Talk about it they. Know for example you. Told them this is gisaj certificate and ITC or for example because you. Know هواوي are working with شركات تجارية بس هما كعراقيين أحكي لك أنت هسة في ورشة تدريبية على مستوى البلد. إي إحنا هيان. ف راح نجيب ميتين شخص منتهن\n\nBILAL\n.توثيق من؟ شركة مثل جيساج لو شي حتى يعني يكون هذا مثل ما قلت بالبداية أول دفاع لمن يصير مشكلة، يجون الناس إللي عندهم الشهداء، وبعد يعني شهادة من جيساد صح؟ وبعدين الوكيل، وبعدين يروحون يخابرون ألمانيا وما أدري إيش. هاهاها\n\nALI ABKAN\n.صح فهي هاي الشغلة، يعني قلت لك مثلا إحنا في رمضان سووا جلسة صديقي فراس أخو صالح السيرجاع. في فندق روتانا سوى دعوة للتجار إللي ما مشتغلين مع جيسعد يشتغلون مع غير شركات إم، يعني خلينا نقول كومبتيتورز جابوهم بعد تشقت تنطون يعني شركاتكم مثلا أنت تتعامل مع فيلوسيتي، أنت تتعامل مع شركة بلال، عدك إيش؟ قد تنطرون للزبون؟ إحنا ننطي خمس سنين، قاعد إحنا ننطي عشرة خلال 48 ساعة استجابة لإعطاء كذا وكذا وكذا، وهاي عزيمة رمضان في فندق روتانا معروف بروستيج إم تقريبا ميتين شخص. من ها الميتين، إذا، إذا خمسة حولوا وصاروا، وكلاء منون وجيساتش، حققوا هدفهم، فأنتوا إذا بديتوا بالتدريب خلال الست أيام إم لازم مثل ما قلت لك على الأيام، بحيث من يطلع فعلا هو متمكن، وأنه يروح إما يفتح بزنس مالته أو يشتغل بهذا المجال، أو يقدم الشركات، يعني مثلا بيروح على شركة بالموصل، خلي نقول اسمه مثلا باور تيك أو. أو أكو آ، شركة على ما أذكر اسمه بالموصل، معروفة ها المسار الذهبي، مرة تواصلوا معايا. نقدم على المسار الذهبي، فيقولوا له جمعت المسار الذهبي، إحنا ليش بدنا نشغلك؟ يقولوا ماخذ تدريب من ال و مصدق لشركة هوايا و جساج أودية، و أني عندي خبرة، إي يعني اختبرني اسألني هينا، راح نشعر التاجر أو صاحب من المال، إي رئيس الشركة، يعني أنت تعرفهم هذولا ال ال ال ال أو أبو المال بالعراقي نسميه ما يهمه أبو المال، بس يريد الشخص، عنده شهادة وعنده خبرة، هسة، مثلا شركة نون لما طلبها مهندس لما جبناه له شخص كان يشتغل مع شركة بالموصل معروفة وبجنوب الموصل، ف شنو اختبره؟ خلاص قبلوه، فأني قصدي إنه الشهادة. لازم تكون من جهة ريلايتد\n\nBILAL\nتمام، فلازم يكون سامي من شركات ناس يعرفوها، آه اتوقع الشي اللي نحتاج نسويها حتى ما تكون مثل لازم نلقي، يعني فريق من الشركات كلهم يوثقون عن ال عن ال آ الدرس الد ال ال آ ال المعلومات وطريقة التعليم\n\nALI ABKAN\nصح؟ صح إي صح صح. وبعدين؟\n\nBILAL\n.بعد أخوة تصير يعني موثوقة\n\nALI ABKAN\nبعد أقوى شنو؟\n\nBILAL\nهذول الأربعة أه أه لاز يجوز نضيف عليها كم واحد، حتى كل الشركات، مو بس التعيسة والز وإثنين زينة،\n\nALI ABKAN\nخلاص يعني كولكشن حلوة وأهم نقطة نقدر\n\nBILAL\n.نروح على الشركات نسألهم. إحنا نريد نروي الناس ليش يشترون من عندكم؟ وراح نجيب المهندسين ونفسخها ونركبها من جديد حتى يعرفوها من أول للآخر إنه هذا ورح يقدرون يقولون الناس\n\nALI ABKAN\nليش؟\n\nBILAL\n.دعاية مجانية، فينطونا أجهزة بلاش. وبعدين ساعدونا بهذا ال حطوا اسمكم بيها هاي حلوة\n\nALI ABKAN\n.بس يرادوا جهد جبال. إنت تعرف شرطات تنافسية، شركاتكم تقبل، وكلها شركة واثقة من نفسها، ما يهمها، يقولك يا هلا الشركة المتخافة رح تنسحب، وأيضا اللي راح يدربوا لازم تختار قلتلك أشخاص أقوياء في المجال، لأن أهم نقطة قلت لك من يحكي؟ يحكي مستند على بانج جراند تابع لشركة قوية، فهاي الأمور جدا مهمة، آخر يوم يعني حسبت لك إياه، قلت لك تاريخ بطارية تركيب اليوم الخامس أنت حتشت على الفايننشال وتفسخ، وهاي اليوم الأخير اليوم الرابع بس تحكي له ع التركيب، اليوم الخامس يشتغلوا ورشة لأن التركيب يحتاج يحتاج يعني يوم كامل أني ماخد تدريب عليه وأحكي لك إي يوم كامل بس تشرح لي وكيف يناسب قطعة، قطعة، شغلة، شغلة، يربط ويسوي ويعير إي فولتيه، فقلت له غير يوم الرابع الخامس إللي هي أنتوا راح سخون وتحكون. اليوم السادس ممكن ممكن يكون إنه اجيبون آ كاتالوجات خاصة بالبطاريات. تقول تعال انت مو مهندس؟ اقرأ الكادالوج اشرح لي؟ كاتالوج. اهم شي الداتاشي. انتبه يمك يا تحب كاتالوك داتا شيت برمجة ال ال ال الانفرتر والر والباتري آخر أيام، لأن البرمجة بوحدها يعني أستاذ بلال، حاليا عنده الترات المتطورة، أحكي لك مثلا يكون مربوط أون لاين واي فاي بيه بتدخل عليه، إي تقدر تعدل بالقراءات، تقدر تسوي تقدر تسوي أبديت تقدر تسوي أمور مثلا مثلا يوجد مشاكل تعرف بالإيفونت، يطلع مثلا هاي بوست فولتج أو لو تشارجينج أو البادري سريع كلها تعالجها من ريموت، يعني ريموتني تعالجه مو مثل قبل تروح تفتح الدار النفيس وتشد وتحول وهاي تحلها، تطورت جدا\n\nBILAL\nمو ال آ تعبانة إللي ما أدري شنو؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nإي مو إللي تعبانة، فأنت راح أدربهم، أكيد ع الحديثة، أنت ما اتدربهم فيرطة قبل عشر سنين. إي\n\nBILAL\nزين زين ها، هاي أتوقع يعني خوش آ، شو اسمه؟ خمسة أيام، ستة أيام، آ نسوي مشروع، يعني إذا ردنا نسوي مشروع شو نسوي حتى يش يش ياخذون ويسوون فد شي عملية مع بعض\n\nALI ABKAN\n.ها ها ممكن تقدر تقول يعني تعرف شلون خلني أعطيك مكان، إذا شركة من هالشركات كان ما كل يوم راح عندهم ممكن شركة تاخدون منها إنفرتر وباتري وألواح وحالون ينصبوه بال سوا، يشتغلون كلهن إللي هي صعبة إنه تنصب البيت، وأيضا هي صعبة إنه يعني الموضوع مكلف، إلا إذا أنتوا تغطوه، أكيد يعني ما أعتقد الشركة تقبل تنطيكم، كل شي ببلاش، ممكن تنطيكم إنفرتر يعني أني أقول لك أغ أغلب الشركات ممكن الواحد يشتغل بيكمل ويرجعه، بس زي ما\n\nBILAL\n.يخالف بس آ\n\nALI ABKAN\n.بس شنو مثلا؟ عادي؟ عادي؟ أعتقد يقبلوني إي بس النقطة المهمة إنه إنت إذا تريد تربط لازم تمدلات. وقاطع، يعني هذا يكون\n\nBILAL\nهاي واحد من الأشياء إللي سامع نفس السؤال، س سأل الناس الثانيين آ، شنو يعني من أكبر المشاكل إللي دا شوفها بالسولر إللي يطلع من الناس إللي ما متعلمين زين؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.هسه؟ أقول لك ها، بس خليني أجاوبك، عالشغلة القديمة، آخر يوم تقدر تاخذين على ورشة مثلا شركة جساج في أربيل عندهم ورشة كاملة، أو مثلا شركة سولس أو مثلا مثلا شركة بلال باور في بغداد أو هواوي إي تاخدوهم جيبوهم المهندسين ال العدد إي، وبالورشة اشتغل، يلا انصبوا، فد شي يعني مو لا ينصب كاملة، خلي يربط الفوتر\n\nBILAL\n.مال هادول ال\n\nALI ABKAN\nآ طلع يعني ننطيك مثال هسة، شوف إحنا بشركة جيساج إي بشركة نون بأربيل بال بالورشة أكو غرفة بيها. ثلاثة بيرترات، وأربع بطاريات، وفوق بالعمارة، ألواح كاملة، تمام، كل ما يجي مثلا وكيل نشوفه، وإذا يريد يسوي تجربة قدام نسوي تجارب، فهمت؟ أعطيك هاي يعني أخلي بيناتنا يعني هذا أنا ما لعبنا شي بيه، عدنا غرفة كاملة تلحقل تجاربه، حاطين أيضا تفضل برتراد وبطاريات ونحدث ونشعل ونخرب ونسوي. ج جيسات الصينية من طين الصلاحية، أفجر القيقة، إي من نتعلم، نواجه المشاكل، يعني بيه. سيمولايد إيفي ف ممكن أنتوا تحكون دايركت مع الجساج أو غيرهم إي تي سي تجون تجيبوهم اشتغل. يعني هذا آخر اليوم؟\n\nBILAL\nفساح نتونس ونتعلم. إيه؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إحنا علمية هذا، خلينا نقول إحتمال\n\nBILAL\nيبدأ هذا يعني دايما أفكر شلون نلقي أع يعني عمل للشباب هذا بنى علاقة بينهم وبين شركة، إذا راح نزورهم؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nصح؟ أمس شي أنتوا تقولون تقولون إيه؟\n\nBILAL\nالبزنس كارد مالتي. تعال شنو نخليهم؟ كلهم بالداخل؟ التدريب مالتنا يسوون بزنس كاردز ما يخالف، أنت بعدك ما عندك عمل، بس حط بزنس ك اسمك إنه شنو تريد تسوي؟ أنت مهندس حلوة وزعهم؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إي. وأكيد أبسط شي أبسط شي أنتوا ك آي تي سي وتقولون النون أو جيسات في الحارة أنتوا مهندسين، هدول موجودين إم يعني هم مسون لهم دعاية، إذا أخذوا 12 منهم نعمة، أكيد غير شركات، ممكن أن يحتاجون مثلا مثلا تبلغون الشركات الأخرى إنه إحنا ننطيكم، يعني خلي نقول كونتاكت داتا عنهم، إي تروجون يمهم في حال تحتاجون عنا مهندسين اتدربوا ع ال تي. سي. قوية مثل ما قلت بيزنس كارد، أني أول ما دامت يعني أني منظمات، قلت لك بشركات، وكانت فمليت من البزنس كارد عندي كثير، أول ما داومت خلال أول أسبوع جابوا لي صرخة بزنس كارد تفضل إي، فقلت لهم إي حبيت يعني النظام إنه يوجد بوزنس كامل، ف آ، أنت فكرة حلوة أيضا، بوزنس كارد سي في آ، خد شوية خلال أيام التدريبات، يعني أكيد\n\nBILAL\nيا زين و آ أتوقع يعني آ أني أني بتشجع وأني عجبني هذه الفكرة، ود و آ هذه طريقة التفكير غيرناها بال آ بالتدريبات الآ الآخرين إنه من يجي، ويا الأجوبة نيجي ويا الأسئلة، وحتى الناس ما دا يتعلمون أشياء، يعني أي واحد يقدر يروح على جوجل وأشياء جي بي تي يطلع معلومات، يعني يقدر يقرء، بس لازم يكون عملي وبعدين واقعي بالسوق. وبعدين إنه هم يتعلموها بخلال التجارب، فهذه الفكرة إنه نحاول نفسر شنو أفضل. تركيب ل لل للاستدامة بالموصل حتى يعني بعشر سنين، يعني يا واحد أرخص شي أرخص الرخيص أرخص، لو الغالي أرخص، لو بالنص أرخص، شلون رح نعرف؟ وشنو نحتاج؟ ويا واحد نحتاج نركز عليها، نحتاج نركز على. رح نحتاج. نركز على يعني. مهم. ووين؟ ما خالد مستعمل. آ شي يعني من ال من الأرخص لو إللي ما عندها آ وورنتي فكل هذول ال آ ال لازم نشتغل بيها وراح يعرفوها من من آ أنت يعني شجعتني لما قلت خل نفسخ كل شي ونركبها i must، أنت فاكر المفسخ البطاريات ولا الأنفرتر؟ يعني عبالي يعني نحشيها كيف باكيت يجي ونستعملها ونصممها، بس آ إذا هم مو بس ال ال إللي يركبوها هذا التيفتس يعني الملصى وما أدري شنو هما إللي راح\n\nALI ABKAN\nيركضوا؟\n\nBILAL\nوالح الحديد وما أدري شو، بس إللي راح يجي له لما ينكسر أشياء واحد زعلان، وده يقول ما دي ما مو ما دي يسوى القيمة، ودا يريد يبيع آ ويقنع الناس على ال آ إنه راح يوفر هذا الواحد لازم يكون يعرف يفسخ ويعرف ال آ العمق مال آ تفاصيل كل شي آ بالطريقة إللي نحشيها ها اليوم بين ال والفايننشال ليدرسي والعمق التكنيكية فا آ ياه عجبني هذا ال آ ال الطريقة آ و الأسئلة إللي أنا يعني أنا يعني، بس هو عندي هواية أسأ أسئلة، بس واحد آ خليني أسأل أبسط واحد، أول، أنت مسوي تدريب قبل عن ال وكم مرة، و وش وقت آخر مرة مسويها؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nها؟ بصراحة كان تدريبات، يعني قلتلك تقريبا مرتين، بس كباي سيكس، لكن هذا رح أعطيه خلال الأسبوع الجاي تدريبين ممكن رح يكون بالشركة يعني أني ما أقدر أعلن عنه، لأن هو غايته بزنس، تعرف يعني إي هذولا الأسبوع الجاي راح نمثل تدريبات، يعني تقدر تقول أربع أو خمس تدريبات زين؟\n\nBILAL\nوكله يعني بها السنين، يعني أنت آ يعني بداخلها\n\nALI ABKAN\nشوفيها من؟\n\nBILAL\n.زمان. لأ. هاي هسة لا لا\n\nALI ABKAN\nأني أحكي لك شغلة مهمة، أني خلال خبرتي ثماني سنوات، منطي الكثير من التدريبات، بس أني قاعد أحكي لك فقط سولار إنيرجي. منطي أربعة خلال الفترة ضاعت خلال الشهر، يعني بعد هو هذولا يعني خلي نقول خلال كوارتوا، لكن إذا ترجع بالماضي، خلال السنوات إللي راحت لا منطي منطي كثير تدريبات، يعني بال بال مثلا بالإت تشربلانير شيب بالبزنس ماناجمت بال آ داتا انالسيز بال داتا كوليكشن بال ليدر شيب، لأن أني قلت لك مشتغل منظمات دولية بعدة عدة مناصب، يعني، يعني أنا كنت كا تيم لي دار رجل كوردنيتر سينيال مير أفيسر ميل مانيجر كنت. أن ينامي كوفرنوريت إلكترونيا، فكان شغلنا كله ليزن مع الحكومة. كان تدريبات كثيرة لجهات حكومية،\n\nBILAL\n.فسر لي علي شي يسوي، ما أعرفش أقول صدق، يعني أنت. ببصري، يقولون كنت طماطم، أنت طماطائية كبيرة\n\nALI ABKAN\n.طماطم. هاهاها. إي. الحمد لله. عاد. أكمل الماستر. مالي يعني عالم مختلف تماما، كان خلال السنوات. تعرف كانت شو بعيد، لكن أصلا حتى أنا لما حكيت مع الأستاذ مادي الأفكار كلش، عجبتوا، قلتلو ليش ما أجيب شوي من الصالة، مهمة علي البحث مع الماستر إي وإعجبوا الموضوع كلش، فشجعني عليه أيضا، ف قلت لك كتدريبات أني كلش يعني إي كفايبل، بس كسولر إنيرجي أنت ولا\n\nBILAL\nبسمي تقدم التدريب، يعني شنو؟ أ يعني ال ال التعامل مع الناس اليوم؟ إش لون تحب تسويها طويلة قصيرة لنشبيك كبيرة، تبدأ بويا سؤال؟ بالتدريب إنت شنو عندك؟ آه بالنسبة ل؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nآه؟\n\nBILAL\nالتفاعل مو المعلومات شلون شلون تحب اليوم حلو؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.أنا دائما أحب أبدي مثلا 99 ونص ما أبدي من الصبح، يعني عراقيين كسالة، تعرف، فأنا بدي 9، 1/2 مثلا خليني اتناعش ونص مثلا ممكن بريك بسيط فقط حتى يرتاحون لأن أني من النوع دايما يعني أنطي معلومات كثيرة، يعرف صالح تدريب أربعة أيام أو خمسة، كان بوقتها كان شفط العصر زي ما أبقى ف. آ، عندي سيناريو يعني أو إستراتيجية. إما أتفق مع الجماعة مثلا منطي من التسعة لي الثلاثة. أربعة ماكسيموم، حتى الناس تعرف هاتفر، أو مثلا ندي، من الثنتين إلى 8:00 بالليل في حالات يعني أحكيلك السيناريوين لأن مثلا في ناس تشتغل الصبح مناطق تيجي مثلا يشتغل بشركة عامل يشتغل فريور كار مثلا أو مهندس خطيرة بشتغل بشركة فهاي، النقطة مهمة لكن أحب مثل ما أنت مثلا تقول ست أيام آ أفضل زماتكم كلش من ورا بعض، ممكن أيضا ليش؟ حتى يسوي بروسيس للمعلومة، أنت إذا أنطيتوا ستة عقله، راح ينساها، لكن مثلا مثلا نسوي مثلا يعني نسميه مثال أربعاء وخلاص أو جمعة، وسبت العراقيين، تعرف تعرف جمعة ما عندهم شي، إي جمعة يوم فراغ، مدام خميس جمعة، والورا خميس جمعة، وصح رح يكون طويل طويل، لكن الطين ممتاز، أو فد شي فرو، أو مثلا الأسبوع الجاي من نلتقي، أريد أنتوا كسرتوا لكم، بحثوا على جوجل تكون جورني معاهم. هاي الجورني راح تخليه يتحفز أني من طيب كداتا نارز، جميل، وقت يعرف صالح صالح، إثنين من أخذوا التدريب، عندي عندي بنت لقت شغل بهاندي كاب وولد، لقى بمنظمة أخرى أخرى آ كميل أسيست بلشوا إي إي، ليش ليش كانت ر كانت رحلة؟ وبديت معاهم يعني خلينا نقول من البيت الوسط ما وصلني، لما كانوا يريدون، تعلمون بالعراق كان عنا. أغلب ماضية بس أجانب أو أكراد كلش ضعيفة يعني، وأيضا أحب أركز على موضوع اللانش بريك بريك من باب تقدير يعني لل لي أنت جايبه جايبه، لأن أنت تعرف العراقيين ياخذون هذا الموضوع بجدية، كلش كلش ليست الغاية الأكل، لكن أنت من توفر له مكان جيد، جيد، جيد، ومن توفر له أكيد جيد يعتبر نفسه، فانسي. كل ما يقدر، حتى أنا ما أعرف يعني أنت ممكن تدفع له أجور نقرأ ولا إحنا بسيارة إسم، كنا ندرب، كنا ندفع أجور، نقل بكرتاس، منشد دبلومن، كلنا ندفع عقولك يعني نعطيك مثال مثلا في كركوك إي كنا ن ندرب ميتين شاب وشابة على إنه إما يطور بيزنجو أو يفتح بزنز، فعنا تو باك همين، أما ريادة الأعمال أو بوزنس دفلوب مين؟ فنجيبهم منحة ويجا عليكم لأن كنا نروح على حويجة ونطيم تدريب، كان يقولون جيبونا على كركوك غارته، فنجيبهم منك الحويجة وجماعة كركوك. صور culture cross. ننطيهم تدريبات. يعني كانت تقريبا شهرين بالعلم وأنا كل واحد يستلم 2000 دولار إما يقطع مشروعه ويطور مشروعه. ف كان كهر. فمن كنا نجيبهم كان أكو أشخاص يدربون، إحنا نروح ننطي تدريبات يعني خلي نقول محددة الباقي عنا إستاف كامل بروجكت أوفيسر خمسة في داربون، فقصدي كان شنو نجيبهم في مكان قاعة مثلا بكركوك، أكو مركز خمس طوابق، بناية موال ومحلات الطابق الفوق فوق سنتر مال آ. إنجليزي نوديهم مثلا بربي نأخذهم بفندق مثلا بالموصل، ممكن تحججون أرتب فندق، يعني أعطيك مثال واقعي تجيبهم موصل سبيس وياك\n\nBILAL\nأحسن الأكل إي نجيبه ع الموصل سبيس؟ لازم صدق يعني طوزي؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إي هاهاها إي إي. زين أنا ما إلا قوزي يعني أقصد إنه أنت تعيشه ك أنت مثلا، كان يقول آي تي سي هواوي جيساج مثلا جايبه تخلي له إنه هو ي يعني يعتبر نفسه في مكان فعلا كلش حيقدره جاي يتعلم لأن أني أحكي لك بحكم خبرتي مج\n\nBILAL\n.الاختيار الأشخاص إللي حواليه. لازم كل واحد يشوف إثنان يقول هذا أحسن من عندي، أحسن من إللي قبله. وبالنهاية أحس إنه هو لازم ي ي يحسن نفسه حتى يكونون بمستوى أعلى مع بعض يا\n\nALI ABKAN\nصح. صح. صح. صح. حلو حلو. فأني وإياكم سبيس أكيد. لكن موضوع البريك اللانش السيرتيفيكيت إللي أنت راح تعطيهم بست أيام. إي إي\n\nBILAL\n.زين آنا، إذا أشوف إنه هو أكو إحتمال وصلنا الساعة، و آ أني يعني آ عنا هواية أفكار كلش حلوة، وأتوقع يعني الكلام الآخر إللي كنت أحشه، ويا ال آ ال بقية الناس إللي داحش وياهم على التدريب، ما التدريب يعني دا يركزون إنه على العملية على اليدوية، التصميم لازم يتجربون كم مرة، وعلى إنه يشتغلون مع بعض، وما أدري شنو بس الفكرة، مال هذا ال ال إنه نفسخ؟ ونحلل الفايننشال مال عمق الجهاز، حتى ناس يقدرون يبيعون ويقنعون المجتمع اللي ما تفتهم. هاي النتيجة هاي راح يوصل لنا إنه الواحد راح تأثر بالسوق، لازم نعلم\n\nALI ABKAN\nالناس تشيله، قلت لك أني أحكي لك بحكم عملي فلسفة شركة. إنه شو نجهز؟ أنا مهندس مثلا وأنت مهندس مسكك؟ سكت ثلاث أيام أضل أدرب بيك تصير وحش، لكن إش لون؟ أعلمك؟ فلسفة تروح تقنع الزبون وتبيع له؟ أنت منين؟ أنت تنتق؟ وشركة أو أنتوا ك آي. إي سي؟ تريدون؟ هذولا الشباب يروحون يشتغلون، يشتغلون سوني إنكم صح. لو لأ، فهي هين النقطة، إش لون؟ يجي يقول له جيساج أو هواوي أو مثلا ديا أفضل من الباقي؟ شلون يكون عنده الخبرة؟ شغلة النصب؟ راح ندربهم عليها، شغلة ال ال الفلتر، وهاي أنت أصلا أنت قلت لك راح يجي عند باقي الجراند، فأنا أريد أحكي لك فريكات إللي جاءت علامة من هذاك من شركة نون هسة رايحة أبو سليمانية حاجزة فندق، وماخذتني بسيارة بسيارة بسيارة، ودا يحطوني فندق ليلة كاملة، وأروح أنطي تدريب جايبين 201. ليش. ليش؟ لأن يقول لك إحنا نجيب أشخاص فاهمين؟ نشرح لهم بقوة نون قوة جيساج، هذا يصير مراسل مالنا بعد، هو يروح الحركة إم على شنو؟ على تدريب يومين أو ثلاثة قوي، وأيضا جابوا إحسان، دعدوش ممثل عراقي مشهور، سواءم دعاية، هسة هاي يتصرفون على غير بروستيجات، كل أسبوع، شركة نون داخل مكتبة بأربيل تنطي تدريب كل أسبوع، أسبوعين تلاتة، حملة خلال أسبوع راح أخده مهندس كرم إللي هو زميلي، وإثنين مهندسين. 70 الجيساد العفو تابعين النون، يعني إثنين تابعين النون وواحد تابع الجساج راحوا على ديالى فروها فر فسخوها 45 وكلاء، كل وكيل يجيبلهم 4050 مهندس تدريب، ليش يريدون يكتسحون ديالى؟ يسوون؟ موجود بزنس، فأني قلت لك ممكن الأشخاص إللي أنت حكيت معاهم قبلي يفكر بس يدربوا ويطلعوا وحش، وبعدين من يشغلوه؟ إي منو منو؟ ي؟ لأن أنت صعب شو صار؟ صعب كلش أيضا كل من. يدخل بالمجان، قصدي يعني احنا نحكي مرات مثلا مع أشخاص يخابرني قلتلك مثلا استاذ علي ال مثلا يقولي فد مشكلة مضحكة، مثلا هاي فولتج فروم جريد يقولون مبينة وطني جعب فولتيه عالية الانفرتر، فصل يحمي نفسه يقول لي لا انفرتركم بيه مشكلة يابا ما بيه مشكلة. وين؟\n\nBILAL\n.مكان ثاني فكر بيه\n\nALI ABKAN\n.والله قبل فترة واحد من الامبار تواصل معانا رجل قروي، فأول ما خابرني قلت لك اشرح لنا له هذا الموضوع، قلت له حبيبي أنت من تاخذ تويوتا بكب إي؟ قلت له على شركة تويوتا ب باليابان، لو تروح ع الوكيل، قال ع الوكيل إي، قلت له تروح ع الوكيل، ما لك بالأنبار؟ يقول لي والله روحوا طويلة، يعني ما يعبروا، قلت له أوكي شنو المطلوب؟ يقول الواي، فاي ما عليه مزق بال، ما عاد يتبرمج ع الفلتر حتى يكلمك دزيت الفيديو، إيش يقول لي فيديو خاص مع الشركة، شرح يعني إنيميشن إي إش لون يربط؟ والله هذا الفيديو كذب. بس دعاية مالكم عاد أني ما قدرت. يعني مهندس صديقي شوية أسلوبه قوي. خابروا رجلوا قالوا دروح على اللي شدلك. خلي يكنكوا أون لاين وإحنا منين نحدد، فأنت عندك المجتمع مصيبة المجتمع مصيبة. أنت لازم هاي النقطة تعالجها يعني باكر بعد أنتوا ست أيام تدريب ويطلعون يصدمون بالواقع بالموصل يا\n\nBILAL\nإي يعني نحتاجك، أنت تيجي تمثل هذاك الشخص، أنت تحكيه مثلها؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nوتقول هذا والله ما أدري، أشتغل الواي فاي ما أدري شنو؟\n\nBILAL\n.وهو لازم يبقى هيتشي مرتاح، يعبر إي هاي هاي هاي يفيد هاي لما آ وانسى، وحقيقة و آ صح\n\nALI ABKAN\n.وإن شاء\n\nBILAL\n.الله يعني مفيدة آ لإلهم، إن\n\nALI ABKAN\n.شاء الله أكيد\n\nBILAL\nعنا عن ال آ المشاكل إللي نشوفها بالس بال آ بالتصميمات، لما الواحد ما متعلم زين واحد راح، يعني ترينينج لو شاف يوتيوب فيديو، شنو المشاكل إللي يسوون من ورا هذا التعليم؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nأول مشكلة وأهم مشكلة، وإحنا دائما نقولها لا تتفق مع زبون، إذا ما تروح تشوف بيته السطح مع البيت والمكان تنصب بيه، يجوز ما يكفي، يجوز أني أجي على الأستاذ بلال وأستاذ بلال يرجع 40,000 ريال بالنهار. و20 إمبير بليل، وهاي دفتر ten thousand dollar. يلا انصب لي أنا أتفق معك أجي أطلع على السطح مالك 100 م عندك ميتين أو باقي 10 م شو؟ ما أقدر أنصب على بيت الجيران، الكشف، الموقع هاي مشكلة قوية، ما يطلعون يكتشفون، المشكلة الثانية ال. ال الجهل بالكمبابلتي، يعني التكامل، يعني مثلا يقول له زمن إي جيب باتري، فلانشي. وممكن ما يصير ت تكامل بيناتهم، النقطة ال ال، يعني هدول النقاط كلش مهمة، والشغلة الأخرى إنه إللي ينصبون، قلت لك هما ما مهندسين، يعني أعطيك مثال خابرنا زبون، كل ما ينزل، كل ما أني وقاعدة تضحكي، المهندس ديم يوقع يضحك، ما نقدر بعد نفسهم، قلت له بس لحظة منو نصب لك إي مواكيل؟ قال لي محمد وأني ما أعرفه، قلت له هذا يبيع طماطة. لو شنو؟ إش لون؟ ما يأرض لك؟ إش لون؟ قال والله قال لي ما بتحتاج تعريض وار إي ما يكلمك، قلت له يكلمك شنو؟ أسقط؟ 50؟ قال متى إللي بيكلف؟ قلت له مشتري إغراق 3000 دولار. تتصور. أتصور خابرنا الوكيل قاروني معد قارنا معه علني يقول والله؟ قلت له تريد أعرض لك ب100,000؟ قال ما أريد هو كل ما يمسك يمتل من نتل، يعني. يعني إنت تتصور إش لون؟ أكو جهل عند التجار؟ ترى هو ما مو عندك بيع طماطم؟\n\nBILAL\nبس آ بهذا المجال؟ لأ كان لازم يقول له لأ، جيب ال100,000 هاهاها\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إي لا لازم هاهاها إي كان لازم يقولوا لا. ومرة شغلة أيضا خابرني زبون عنده مشاكل، فقلت له بس صور لي مين؟ رواه بي أم بي تي تي واحدة من هنا وأم بي تي، فيعني خلي نقول تو سترينج، فأنت إذا تربط تربط أربعة هنا أربعة هنا هو رابط له الثمانية على سطرين وحدة على اليسار. السيستم ما يتحمل، لازم تقسمه، تعرف يعني على مود يختصر بالإم سي فور هاي طحنتيا إثنين الإم سي فور هاي صارت له الدولارات هاي الدولارات إي هاي المشاكل. والله والله إي. جديات هاي المشاكل\n\nBILAL\n.لأنه يريد أحطه بالسلايدات ك. ف. ك، لا تسو\n\nALI ABKAN\nكين موجودة؟\n\nBILAL\nإي إي لأ على 3 دولارات يعني هاهاها إي\n\nALI ABKAN\nفهاي الأمور. أنت لازم تفهم هذولا المهندسين إللي راح أتدربهم دائما، دائما أصعب المشاكل أبسطها وأسخفها. يا دائما أكو مشاكل صعبة، هي سخيفة جدا، هاي تعلمتها بحكم شغلي بهذا المجال والسنوات الماضية يعني. يعني مرات يخبرك الزبون يقول لك قامت القيامة. انضرب نووي يابا، أش أكو تعرف يمكن أرضي ماكو إي يعني يندرسان مين؟ إي فأنت رسالة شو إيش تحتاج تبلغني وأني حاضر، إن شاء الله مساعدتك إي يعني دوقتك أنت\n\nBILAL\nشو اسمه آ يعني آ دا دا تعلمت هواية وتوقع يعني التدريب راح تتحسن من ورا كلامنا إن شاء الله، وبشهر سبعة أني راح يجي آ نحاول نجمع ال مجموعة الناس إللي أكو احتمال يكونون مدربين ونشوف إذا يعني تريد تندمج ويانا، يعني أكو احتمال تكون مدرب ويانا بهذا المجال، آ والله نشوفك ب آ بشهر سبعة، وإذا لا أشوفك همين بشهر سبعة نروح نشرب\n\nALI ABKAN\nشايل نتشرف إني أكون مدرب، والله أتشرف، بس أهم شغلة أني أستاذ أحكي لك صراحة، إي إحنا دائما بالشركة من السبت للأربعاء خميس وجمعة عطنا تمام ف\n\nBILAL\nالأيام، يعني لا تخاف على التوقيت ولا ع. يعني أنت المدرب، أنت لازم آ أني دا أشتغل. تجمع المعلومات، وبالنهاية أنت راح. لازم تأخذها وتخليها تكون مالتك، فهذه الفكرة مال شهر سبعة، إنه نعرض ال التدريب، بس ال ال إنه كل واحد يسويها مالتهم يحدثوها، يغيروها ي يعني يعدلوها بطريقتهم وتفكيرهم آ و\n\nALI ABKAN\n.آ مجموعة أني مجموعة راح ننطي التدريب إللي هو شخص آ\n\nBILAL\n.لأ، لأنه هو أتوقع. راح نوصل على 150 شخص بخلال آ فترة قصيرة راح نحتاج مجموعة ف آ\n\nALI ABKAN\n.40\n\nBILAL\nكل واحد ياخذ آ 3040 شي هيتشي ما متأكد هذا ال آ التفاصيل راح يكون هي ال موصل سباس، هم راح ي يجي مثل أنت، ويا هدول إحنا نسوي دعاية أني ما راح أسوي دعاية، إنسى ما لازم نسوي دعاية، أنت عليك ال يعني ال المدرب عليه التدريب، وموسل فيصل عليه من الدعاية والمكان والتوزيع، الأعمال إن شاء الله\n\nALI ABKAN\n.ثمن فهمك إن شاء الله أني حاضر العيش تحتاجه، بس قلت لك ضمن يعني المجال. الجدول مع الشركات\n\nBILAL\nإي إي إي الأيام والأوقات، وإيش؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.وأكيد إنتوا إي يعني الخميس كله الجمعة كله نقدر مثلا إذا أنتوا اتفقتوا وراح يعني لاحقا مثلا خميس وجمعة، يعني ليش قد نحتاج خميس، جمعة، خميس، جمعة، خميس جمعة، يخلص التدريب، أبو ستة أيام إي\n\nBILAL\nأكو احتمال نقدر نلقي ال آ نلقي لهم أشياء يسوون ك يعني آ صح بالبيت بحوث تصميم ما أعرف ما متأكد بس\n\nALI ABKAN\nآ ما بساوي نقيم شي بسيط إنه يروحون مع أي شركة يشتغل ببلاش، يقولون نزلني أو فد شي هيك عادي يقول له يعني هو يروح عادي بين ال\n\nBILAL\n.إذا نسويها، ويا هذا الأسبوع بيناتهم نقدر نخليهم يسوون آ ال مالتهم يعدلوها نسوي يعني؟ نقدر نسوي كل التفصيلات وال الأجهزة والعلم صح ايه بس؟ يعني بيناتهم يقدرون يسوون هذا العمل، يروحون على الشركة، يقولون يعني دقيت البيبان على أربع شركات وانطيتهم اس اسمي، ودا اسألهم على، فنقدر نعطيهم هدول\n\nALI ABKAN\n.أو يسوون لي فد بحر بسيط إي خلال أسبوع مثلا، أول يومين خميس جمعة للخميس، الجمعة الجاي، أقول له أريد تسوي لي بحث عن أنواع ال ال آ. الألواح إي، والستة ميتوات، والسبعة متوات، والأفيشنسي الأسعار، سوي لي بحث مقارنة بين الفرتر، سوي لي بحث عن البطاريات، ليش الليثيوم أحسن من الجيل، روح إي ابحث، وجيب لي نتائج إي إي، أول ما نلتقي 1/2 ساعة بالأسبوع القادم نناقش هاي ال ال ريزلز ونكمل\n\nBILAL\nف أول أسبوع ال. التاريخ والإنفارجرز روحوا درسوا ال ثاني أسبوع، روحوا درسوا البطاريات. وثالث الأسبوع، آ. ال. وبعدين راح يكون عنا كل المعلومات بتوقيت النصب. والت تصميم ال آ الحسابات ال آ المادية وال بزنس وما أدري شنو، فهذا المال ثلاث أسابيع يسوى، يكون فد شي يعني يفيدنا آ هذا الوقت، إذا يسوون الشغل فهذا مهم، هذا على ال آ المدرب إنه يقنعهم ويتابع وإياهم واتس آب مدري شنو آ حتى\n\nALI ABKAN\nأكيد، أكيد المعلومات أكيد لا هم إذا أشخاص يعني راح يكونوا شغوفين مثلا أني أقول لهم أني مثلا أعطيك مثال، إي أنا عندي ولد، مع والدي وأخويا نشتغل كل النصر تقريبا 5060 منظومة جديد خريج شاطر، أعطيت السي في مالته الجساج، قلت لهم في حال يوم ردوك ستاند إسباند هذا أني أعرفه حتى يشتغل مع أبوي أخويا وصبردات، فقال أوكي خلي ع ال آ تعرف ع الكيو في حن نحتاج، فهما ذولا نفس الشي، هما راح يصيرون ولادي، إذا إذا اشتغلت معاهم أقول لهم من شاطر منكم أخلي ببالي. أي فرصة آ أدفعه عليها. صح؟ لو لا إم إي؟\n\nBILAL\nإي صح؟ صح. صح هاي هاي فد شي آ. حلو ومهم. وأتوقع آ حلو إنه واحد يبدأ اجتماع ويا هدف حتى لمن؟ دا نفكر، وإذا نصمم ال ال الأشياء ال ال آ بداخلها دائما نرجع لهدف وأتوقع لقينا فد فايكات حلوة. آه باللقاءات ب آه بال، آه هذا ما الأربع آه شركات وأربع طرق ها لمن حشيت، كان عندي سؤال هذا إنت قلت إنه مهم، إذا واحد يستعمل هذا الجهاز لازم يستعمل ال آ يصير كوهيرنس بين الستاك كلها، آ ليش مهم؟ يعني ليش ما واحد يشتري منه، آه ومنا بطارية ومنه ليش؟\n\nALI ABKAN\nلازم؟\n\nBILAL\nعلى نفس ال إذا كلهم كوالي، يعني ليش ماكو؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.مثلا؟ هو لا يمون تراب، البلوتي؟ هي مثلا شركة جيساج يشتغل مع ست أو سبع أنواع، بطاريات غيرها ما يقبل يشتغل أو ممكن يصير مشاكل، المهندس لازم يكون ملم بيها، كذلك أنت من تنصب إنفرتر إم. جيساج مع باتري جيساج، نفس الشركة هي ال ال الكومينيكيشن بناتهم يصير قوي، وال ال ال تصير قوية، نعم هو مثلا مع بايلونتك و وأعتقد آ ما عاد أتذكر أسماءهم لمن يعني 34 شركات فاتريات، أوكي على نفس الشي، إذا أنت تجيب مثلا مثلا انفرتار ديعة ممكن يشتغل مع بطالة جيسات وغيره، بس قصدي المهندس إذا يكون مهم بهاي الأمور يعرف إش لون، ينصح الزبون مثلا أنطيك مثال بس أني قبل فترة شخص أقاربي خابرني، حكيت له جساج غالية، قلت له طق تجيب المنظومة، يعني ال2/3 السعر وهاي ال3000 إي يعني بطيك أرقام، خلي نقول، قلت له 20 إمبيرنا 10:00 بالليل ت 2027 ورقة إي يعني 2700 دولار، جلسات تكلفك 48 ورقة إي إي، فقلت له طيق تاخد غير بدري؟ قال لي لأ، قال أني ما دام تاخد من غيرتر. وباطري خليهم يساوي أحسن. لأن هو مهندس أيضا. فموضوع ال. المهندس اللي يعرف يفتهم عشان يحاسبه من جيب إنت كرت الشاشة. من جمهور ماشية زين نجيبك 4 جيجا، ما يلحق التوجيجا فيديوهات، فنفس الشي إي فهاي أمور كلها يعني بيها يا طويل الحديث بيها هي\n\nBILAL\nيعني ب بس ب بأهلنا أحياء، أتوقع هاي يعني س ما بالإنجليزي بس، بس أعرف الكلمة صارو يعني؟ مو آ ليل نهار ليل نهار، يعني فرق آه نهار عصر\n\nALI ABKAN\nهو فرق بسيط، فرق بسيط على الموضوع، أكيد، بس أنا قلت لك قصدي أنت إذا تجيب مهندسين تدربهم، لازم تعلمهم جميع الفيكات،\n\nBILAL\n.بس هاي هاي مهمة\n\nALI ABKAN\nما؟\n\nBILAL\nبس إي صح آ وب و وحلو آ وكلش يعني تونست وياك وتعلمت هواية؟\n\nALI ABKAN\n.وتشجعت\n\nBILAL\n.آ يعني نرتب فد شي آ حلو ويسوى، ويعني ناس يستفادون من عندها، وهمين الموصل تستفاد من عندها، والبيئة تستفاد من عندها\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إن شاء الله، إن شاء الله. إن شاء الله. إي والله\n\nBILAL\n.للناس الآخرين إن شاء الله، فا شكرا لوقتك، وجمعة مبارك إن شاء الله، وأخذت يعني مهم من عندك، يعني ورا ما كنت طالع ويا العائلة وخجلتني شوية\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إحنا أهم شي ممكن خدمتنا في الموسم إن شاء الله إن شاء الله\n\nBILAL\n.مال آ مال خربطة ال آ الوايرات، أريد أشوف إن شاء الله. يلا الدنيا\n\nALI ABKAN\nما إن شاء الله، إيش تحتاج أستاذ تبلغني ونتواصل؟\n\nBILAL\n.آ، إذا عندك أي سؤال لإلي همينة دز لي واتساب، لو أي شي إن شاء الله\n\nALI ABKAN\n.إن شاء الله، أكيد أكيد فرصة سعيدة، السلام عليكم، مع السلامة، مع السلامة\n\n\n",

      "content": "OK, so I need a prompt that will be able to pass all of my interviews one at a time and I wanted to go sort of in depth and be sure to get all of the ideas and all of the moments of surprise and insights and all of the facilitation ideas the ways that we decided to structure the days And to compile those that information in a way that is reputable and reliable across all of the prompts so that I can have some kind of a insight library that I can use in place of the interview, which is very long and it has a lot of repeated information and irrelevant information. I wanna be sure to get some kind of like compressed version that is lost less so what are the things that I need to extract from the interview and what can I do to be sure that it is extracting everything in a format that is reliable and cross comparable across different interviews I wouldn’t be able to run just the prompt and the interview individually and a standalone prompt. This is for a six day solar training workshop and we are looking for facilitation techniques and information about the number of trainings. They’ve posted information about their ideas about what good facilitation is information about how to assess a training for quality and for how to do our monitoring an evaluation for the financial literacy components of the training and how to organize the days how to be sure that these trainings support people in creating jobs. This is a really important and big one. We want to make sure to collect all of the ideas for how to do that and How to get people to be able to not be bored how to make it a group facilitation kind of facilitation techniques that kind of make it more of a you know they answer questions rather than a teacher just gives some data how to help people learn to read data sheets, and use it to design a system. How to Assess a house design the system implement and practically put it forward so we want to get some ideas about the practical elements and how we can bring that into the training and be sure to have things be mostly practical unless visual so this prop needs to look into all these sort of dimensions and others and just be sure that we don’t miss anything from the interview so I can just send one prompt and the interview and get good quality results out to be able to then take it into the process of creating the facilitation guide and so we need all of their insights and recommendations and Insights to how to adapt the training and so maybe I need to send the initial training PowerPoint and the interview and ask it for the the insights document and then from there work on the facilitation guide does that make sense so can you please help me create this prompt? Tell me think through it maybe you can ask me five questions so that you can help me design a prompt or two or three depending on what you think is the best process to get to our goal of going from our initial solar design to a design that is improved it iteratively with every interview so I made a design for slides and I’m interviewing people. I’m getting all these good ideas and I’m saying out loud during the interview and I wanna make sure to capture that information and use it to update the slides and then use the slides to update the facilitation guide and the facilitation guide needs to be a very clear process for how a facilitator implements these things and so maybe we need to start with a facilitation guide actually and derive from the facilitation guide the slides rather than the other way around because the interview is gonna have a lot of information about the facilitation guys so I should make it the facilitation guide Then give it to the large language model along with the interview to create a new facilitation guide and then from the new facilitation guide use another prompt to make a new set of slides. What do you think?",

      "content": "Bilal, you’re thinking clearly and in the right direction: this is about turning raw, longform interviews into structured, reusable, evolving training assets. The key is to **create a reliable pipeline from raw interview → structured insights → updated facilitation guide → slide content.**\n\nLet me first ask **5 clarifying questions** to make the prompt architecture strong and future-proof:\n\n---\n\n### **1. What’s the structure of your current facilitation guide?**  \nIs it day-by-day with objectives, methods, materials, trainer instructions, and learning outcomes? If not, should we create that template first so the LLM can “slot in” new insights where they belong?\n\n---\n\n### **2. How flexible is your training design?**  \nDo you want to _accumulate_ all ideas from every trainer (even contradictory ones), or _selectively_ adapt based on which ones resonate best with your core goals? That affects whether we extract a full library or a filtered update.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What are the specific insight categories you want extracted?**  \nYou mentioned:\n- Facilitation techniques\n- Job-creation support strategies\n- M&E suggestions\n- Teaching data sheet reading\n- Practical assessment of a house\n- Day-by-day training structure\n- Methods to maintain engagement\nDo you want these to be distinct sections in the output? Should we add others like \"local constraints\", \"certification credibility\", \"partnership suggestions\", or \"adaptation advice\"?\n\n---\n\n### **4. Do you want the AI to **rewrite** your facilitation guide based on the interview, or to suggest **patches/updates**?  \nThis impacts whether we generate an “updated guide,” “delta list,” or “insight library.” Each use case benefits from a different prompt structure.\n\n---\n\n### **5. What’s your preferred format for the output?**  \n- A single markdown doc with nested sections?  \n- A table with columns like *topic | speaker insight | related slide | action suggestion*?  \n- A JSON or YAML object that you can feed back into a system?\n\n---\n\nOnce you answer these, I’ll write you:\n1. A **base prompt** for standalone interviews  \n2. An **iterative prompt** that combines the facilitation guide + interview  \n3. An **optional post-processing prompt** to generate slides from updated guide\n\nAlso, if you want, I’ll generate a reusable **template for your facilitation guide** that can be populated automatically.\n\nWould you like to start by answering the 5 questions above? Or jump straight into a draft prompt and improve from there?",
