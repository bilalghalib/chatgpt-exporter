Tomorrow insha'allah we'll have 20 mins to discuss your projects, your journey with Bloom in the ACSI program, and any advice you might want to share with the new ACSI teams. \n\nWe'll also encourage you to join us in the selection process and to watch the pitching at the end. It should be an exciting day. \n\nFeel free to share some instagram handles/project and life updates in this thread. See you all soon! \n\n+BG\"\"",

      "content": "Absolutely — here’s a light, meaningful 20-minute facilitation plan for your alumni panel with folks from ACSI1–3. The goal: foster connection, reflection, and shared wisdom in a short time window.\n\n---\n\n### 🎤 **ACSI Alumni Panel Facilitation (20 mins)**  \n**Title: “What’s Bloomed Since Bloom?”**\n\n**Facilitator Intro (1 min)**  \n“Salam everyone! It’s so good to see the ACSI family again — from cohort 1 to 3. I’d love for this to be more of a reflective and connective conversation than a formal panel. Just a chance to hear what’s grown, what’s shifted, and what you’d tell your past self or new teams today.”\n\n---\n\n### 🌱 Round 1: Quick Fire (7 mins total — ~2 mins per question)\n\n**Ask all panelists to briefly answer (1 sentence max) one of these.**  \nYou can either assign them randomly or let them choose.\n\n1. **“What’s one thing you started doing because of ACSI that you still do today?”**  \n2. **“What’s a win — small or big — since the program that you’re proud of?”**  \n3. **“What’s something you wish you knew back then that you know now?”**  \n\n(*Optional: Ask for reactions from the room or “raise hand if you relate” to keep it interactive.*)\n\n---\n\n### 🌻 Round 2: Deeper Share (8 mins — 2–3 panelists)  \n**Choose 2–3 people to go deeper on these questions (2–3 mins each):**\n\n- **“What changed in how you work, think, or lead after the ACSI experience?”**  \n- **“What advice would you give to the new cohort pitching today?”**\n\n(*Let them know in advance if you plan to choose them, or pick folks spontaneously if the group is relaxed.*)\n\n---\n\n### 💬 Round 3: Closing Call (3–4 mins)  \nFacilitator to all panelists:\n\n> “Last thing: If someone from ACSI4 wants to follow up or get advice, where can they find you?”  \n> (Instagram, email, or just a smile and ‘come say hi!’)\n\nThen thank them warmly:\n> “Your voices are part of what makes this program so special. Thanks for being here and for helping the next group bloom.”\n\n---\n\nWant me to turn that into a slide, doc, or handout? Or adapt it for a more informal or virtual setting?",
