Using actual Mosul pricing: generators cost ~12,000 IQD per amp monthly\n- For a 15-amp system: 12,000 × 15 = 180,000 IQD monthly = 2,160,000 IQD annually\n- Typical 3kW system costs ~6,000,000 IQD\n- Payback period is typically 3 years\n- Long-term savings are substantial (10+ million IQD over system life)\n- Battery replacement is the main ongoing cost (typically year 5-7)\n- These calculations make a compelling case for solar investment\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Day 1 Practical Activities\n\n1.

Economy (500-700K IQD): 2-4 year lifespan, 90-92% efficiency\n  - Mid-range (800-1200K IQD): 5-7 year lifespan, 94-96% efficiency\n  - Premium (1300-1800K IQD): 8-10+ year lifespan, 97-98% efficiency\n- Show examples of failed inverters from inadequate specifications\n-->\n\n---\n\n# DC vs. AC Electrical Systems\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class \"DC Characteristics\" {\n        +Continuous flow direction\n        +No zero-crossing\n        +Sustained arcs\n        +Special breakers required\n        +Thicker cable insulation\n    }\n    \n    class \"AC Characteristics\" {\n        +Alternating flow direction\n        +Regular zero-crossing\n        +Self-extinguishing arcs\n        +Standard breakers\n        +Standard insulation\n    }\n```\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Understanding DC vs. AC differences is literally a matter of life and death\n- DC can sustain arcs indefinitely, reaching temperatures over 3,000°C\n- AC naturally extinguishes arcs 100 times per second at zero-crossing\n- This is why solar requires special DC-rated components:\n  - DC-rated circuit breakers with arc suppression\n  - DC cables with thicker insulation and UV protection\n  - DC fuses and disconnects designed to break DC arcs safely\n- Show examples of AC components that failed in DC applications\n- Emphasize that this is an area where cutting costs is dangerous\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Proper System Protection\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Solar Array] --> B{DC Circuit<br>Breaker}\n    B --> C[DC Disconnect]\n    C --> D{SPD}\n    D --> E[Inverter]\n    E --> F{AC Circuit<br>Breaker}\n    F --> G[AC Disconnect]\n    G --> H{SPD}\n    H --> I[Main Panel]\n    J[Battery Bank] --> K{Battery<br>Fuse}\n    K --> L[Battery<br>Disconnect]\n    L --> E\n    \n    style A fill:#ffeb3b,stroke:#f57f17\n    style E fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#388e3c\n    style I fill:#ffe0b2,stroke:#f57c00\n    style J fill:#b39ddb,stroke:#512da8\n    style B fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style C fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style D fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style F fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style G fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style H fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style K fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style L fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n```\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Every solar system needs protection against:\n  -

Before continuing with the rest of Day 2 and Day 3, I'd like to ask three questions to help improve this process:\n\n1. How satisfied are you with the balance between technical detail and visual simplicity in the diagrams? Should I make them more detailed or more simplified?\n\n2. Are there specific topics from the facilitation guide that you'd like me to emphasize more in the remaining slides?\n\n3. Would you prefer that I include more cultural context specific to Mosul in the speaker notes, or should I focus more on the technical aspects?",

Economy (500-700K IQD): 2-4 year lifespan, 90-92% efficiency\n  - Mid-range (800-1200K IQD): 5-7 year lifespan, 94-96% efficiency\n  - Premium (1300-1800K IQD): 8-10+ year lifespan, 97-98% efficiency\n- Show examples of failed inverters from inadequate specifications\n-->\n\n---\n\n# DC vs. AC Electrical Systems\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class \"DC Characteristics\" {\n        +Continuous flow direction\n        +No zero-crossing\n        +Sustained arcs\n        +Special breakers required\n        +Thicker cable insulation\n    }\n    \n    class \"AC Characteristics\" {\n        +Alternating flow direction\n        +Regular zero-crossing\n        +Self-extinguishing arcs\n        +Standard breakers\n        +Standard insulation\n    }\n```\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Understanding DC vs. AC differences is literally a matter of life and death\n- DC can sustain arcs indefinitely, reaching temperatures over 3,000°C\n- AC naturally extinguishes arcs 100 times per second at zero-crossing\n- This is why solar requires special DC-rated components:\n  - DC-rated circuit breakers with arc suppression\n  - DC cables with thicker insulation and UV protection\n  - DC fuses and disconnects designed to break DC arcs safely\n- Show examples of AC components that failed in DC applications\n- Emphasize that this is an area where cutting costs is dangerous\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Proper System Protection\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Solar Array] --> B{DC Circuit<br>Breaker}\n    B --> C[DC Disconnect]\n    C --> D{SPD}\n    D --> E[Inverter]\n    E --> F{AC Circuit<br>Breaker}\n    F --> G[AC Disconnect]\n    G --> H{SPD}\n    H --> I[Main Panel]\n    J[Battery Bank] --> K{Battery<br>Fuse}\n    K --> L[Battery<br>Disconnect]\n    L --> E\n    \n    style A fill:#ffeb3b,stroke:#f57f17\n    style E fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#388e3c\n    style I fill:#ffe0b2,stroke:#f57c00\n    style J fill:#b39ddb,stroke:#512da8\n    style B fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style C fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style D fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style F fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style G fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style H fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style K fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n    style L fill:#ff7043,stroke:#e64a19\n```\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Every solar system needs protection against:\n  -

Start with maximum current (Isc of panel × number of parallel strings)\n  - Apply 125% safety factor\n  - Apply temperature derating (critical in Mosul's hot climate)\n  - Calculate voltage drop (should be less than 3% total)\n  - Select appropriate wire size based on these factors\n- Example calculation for a 9A string:\n  - 9A × 1.25 = 11.25A (safety factor)\n  - 11.25A ÷ 0.8 = 14.06A (temperature derating)\n  - For a 15m cable run: 4mm² provides acceptable voltage drop\n- Emphasize that undersizing to save money is dangerous false economy\n-->\n\n---\n\n# Battery Types Comparison\n\n```mermaid\nquadrantChart\n    title Battery Comparison for Mosul\n    x-axis Lower Cost → Higher Cost\n    y-axis Shorter Life → Longer Life\n    quadrant-1 High Cost, Low Performance\n    quadrant-2 High Cost, High Performance\n    quadrant-3 Low Cost, Low Performance\n    quadrant-4 Low Cost, High Performance\n    \"Lead-Acid\"[0.3, 0.2]\n    \"AGM\"[0.5, 0.4]\n    \"Lithium-Ion\"[0.9, 0.9]\n    \"Refurbished (Fake)\"[0.6, 0.1]\n```\n\n<!-- \nNOTES:\n- Batteries are often the most expensive component and most prone to failure\n- Lead-acid: traditional, lower upfront cost, shorter life (3-5 years), 50% DoD\n- AGM: improved lead-acid, maintenance-free, 4-7 years, 50-60% DoD\n- Lithium (LiFePO4): premium, long life (8-12 years), 80-90% DoD, better in heat\n- Refurbished: failed batteries with some cells replaced, sold as new\n- The Mosul market has many refurbished batteries sold as new\n- Show how to identify quality:\n  - Weight (counterfeits are lighter)\n  - Terminal construction quality\n  - Case materials and sealing\n  - Verification of serial numbers\n- For a 5kWh system, the 10-year cost comparison:\n  - Lead-acid: requires multiple replacements, ~4.8M IQD total\n  -

Before continuing with the rest of Day 2 and Day 3, I'd like to ask three questions to help improve this process:\n\n1. How satisfied are you with the balance between technical detail and visual simplicity in the diagrams? Should I make them more detailed or more simplified?\n\n2. Are there specific topics from the facilitation guide that you'd like me to emphasize more in the remaining slides?\n\n3. Would you prefer that I include more cultural context specific to Mosul in the speaker notes, or should I focus more on the technical aspects?",
