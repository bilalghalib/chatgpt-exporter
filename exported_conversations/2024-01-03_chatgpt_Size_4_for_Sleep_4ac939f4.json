      "content": "For a baby that weighs around seven kilos, they generally fit into a size 3 diaper. However, since you're looking for one size up to help with overnight sleeping, you might want to try size 4. It's always good to check the weight recommendations on the diaper package as brands can vary slightly. Would you like any tips on choosing diapers for better sleep?",

      "content": "Great! For better sleep, consider diapers that are specifically labeled as overnight or extra absorbent. They are designed to hold more liquid and keep moisture away from the baby's skin for longer periods. Also, make sure the diaper fits well to prevent leaks; it should be snug but not too tight. Lastly, establishing a good bedtime routine can help your baby sleep longer and more comfortably. Would you like more detailed advice on bedtime routines or anything else?",
