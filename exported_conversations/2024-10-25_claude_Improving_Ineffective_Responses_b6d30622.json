To do this, we must know ourselves, our abilities, our limits and finally we must know where we want to go and have some idea how to get there. This is the crux of the problem, in much of the world education is lackluster, and mentorship is lacking, and having a sense of where to go next is next to impossible without exposure and support. We believe generative AI can solve this problem, or make it worse.\n\nFor nearly a decade I’ve been building systems to help people learn about knowledge landscapes through educational assessments and offering learning activities based on results. While this is marginally better than giving someone access to wikipedia and suggestions they “google it” - it’s missing a crucial element. A database model of education doesn’t have the ability to support goal reflection and articulation, doesn’t know your blindspots, can’t explain things walking backward from where you want to go and making analogies to your your current level of knowledge. These new affordances, and many others, are now made possible with Large Language Models(LLMs).\n\nLLMs can transform education along the same vector previous technologies have, making it more accessable, personalized and relational. In the Middle Ages, a prince may have had a tutor, in the Industrial Era the printing press made books accessible to those with disposable income, later cultural innovations like the Public Library brought access to more people, the internet brought searchability with database queries, Wikipedia, Brilliant and youtube brought multi-modal and social learning to our pockets. LLMs can be the next step. Right now the internet is full of knowledge waiting to become relevant, except the person who needs it best might not know what to search for and no database will help. We need conversation and adaptive learning directionality, things LLMs can bring to the table.\n\nThe Ethics of LLMs and Agency - To have or to be\n{“role”: “system”, “content”: “You are a helpful assistant.”} is often seen as the first system prompt suggested, and has been said to be unneeded at this point as the machines have interanlized their helpful assistant role during the instruction fine tuning moment. The problem of bias in the datasets aside, there is a bias in the fundamental purpose of an LLM. This bias emerges from such subtle places as how you are first introduced to an LLM, how quickly they respond, the language they use in their responses, what prompting support they offer and many more. One way of seeing this assistant bias is to describe it as a “doing” bias. How could that be a problem if they help you?\nToo Much Help\nLet’s conduct a trial (June 2024) with the LLM on the top of the leaderboards, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Prompt: “Please write a letter to my grieving mother… I just lost my dad, she just lost her husband.” Response: “Dear Mom, I hope this letter finds you in a moment of peace… [one page of cringeworthy content] …I'm here for you, Mom. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. We'll get through this together, one day at a time.” \nIt feels weird to have an LLM use my pronouns to write a letter to my grieving mom. This is a context where doing might not be the right approach, perhaps the prompt was not appropriate. Yet what else are we to do?s \nWhat is a good response from an LLM? \nWe’ve hit a the language of normativity, what’s a good prompt? Usually developers of technology taking an iterative approach will say: “the user is always right” and find ways to get feedback from the user over time indicating the responses they liked better than others. Now that sounds like a reasonable approach - let’s consider how using this approach can backfire using the analogy of using an escalator. Using it once might be a thrill, especially if it’s your first time and you would definitely click “yes, would ride again” at the end of your trip. Yet given years of escalator riding and if it replaces taking the stairs at home and those four flights of stairs were a large part of your daily exercise as you go up and down multiple times a day, you might find that you rue the day you ever started taking the escalator.\nSo is an escalator good or bad? \nI think this is related to the idea by Erich Fromm of having, vs being. I have my response, I can use it to send to my mother and get the task out of the way. Or I can engage with the soul searching needed to say what is truely mine to say in this moment. I could engage in the process of becoming and sa something that might have never been said before, perhaps. Perhaps I’d add something that would be new to the collective embedding space, something that would touch my mothers heart, and give me a sense of grief soaked contentedness.\n\nThe Reality of Muses\nIt was missing what the muses would bring to me, and only me, in this moment - sure it can help us write a beautiful letter, yet should it have? How could the LLM know the context and know when to respond to a prompt, how could it know if it’s responding to a bad prompt given the context, or a good prompt given the context. What are the qualities of a good prompt? What makes an LLM respond in ways that make it more like an escalator than a flight of stairs, and how do we build a system that’s as fun to ride as an escalator, yet as supportive for health and who we want to be as stairs. Good questions that deserve some good answers. \n\nWhat the Telos\nIt seems that the LLM is able to get up to the understanding area from the trillions of datapoints entered as it’s training set, yet there is a moment of choice that connects to the steerability of the LLMs, the agency of a learner, the layer of wisdom where potentially we must guide a learner towards, bringing the information, explaining the knowledge, and bringing someone to the moment of their choosing. \n\nSoon LLMs will enter the pockets of 80% of the world’s population when they are integrated with our smart phones. They can either continue to be designed and marketed towards becoming your “assisstant” or they can be designed and marketed towards becoming your assistant and coach. They can help you do, or rather - they can help you do things you couldn’t even see as possible before.\n\nHypothesized Method: Prompts as Navigation LLMs as Compass\nLet’s explore a theory of good prompting.\nI believe that life is unique in the fact that it is anti-entropic. A healthy individual in a supportive environment develops and grows, as opposed to most things in the universe, living systems increase in complexity and cohesion. I tentatively posit that growth and learning is a good measure for a good session with good prompts. Learning is fun, so we should be able to measure positive states “did you like this session” and compete with sessions that primarily focus on assistance and task completion. \nAs educators at Bloom.pm, it has been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers directly. “GPT, make me a sandwich!”.  Through our interactions with our students and many hundreds of hours of LLM use we came to the conclusion that to use LLMs effectively for learning while doing we must how LLMs work, how learning works and to map between learning needs and the new affordances LLMs have made architecturally, and technically to interface with a large chunk of what is known to humanity today. \n\nWe are approaching this goal, practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nLearning is goal oriented behavior and in this pamflet we will describe emerging trends in research that demonstrates that LLMs are able to identify your goals without your explicitly stating them, developing an understanding of your Theory of Mind. Using this goal representing in the language of LLMs as an embedding in a vector space we can have geometric representation of our goals, beliefs, emotions and knowledge allowing us to use prompting like a compass to walk in into the dark spaces of our knowledge towards our goals, and perhaps modifying them along the way.\nWe believe that due to the biomimetic approaches computer scientists have taken to develop AI/LLMs there are leverageable structures within LLMs to support our learning journey. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \n\nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nI’ve personally spent hundreds of hours of GPT and have identified from my prompts the principles that led to better results with Large Language Models (LLMs), here I formalize them through the frames of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impoverishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nI believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nThis is why it’s so important to identify methods for using LLMs well and imbedding them into different touchpoints in society:\nTouchpoints:\nEducation: Develop material and courses on best prompting techniques and encouraging the ways of being that lead to good prompting.\nTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \nSystem Prompts: Share system prompts will support the LLM to supporting the principles in the frameworks.\nLLM Company Collaborations: Work with LLM companies to incorporate deeper into the training and feedback process. \n\nBe Sure To Create New Knowledge\nA danger we can fall into is believing that the LLM can know all possible blindspots. How can we ensure there’s a balane between scaffolding and a user identifying what is uniquely there’s to say, the analogy that only their mind would come to given the diversity of their life experience. This is ther person’s “zone of genius” - the thing that is not in the embedding space, the new inspiration. \n\nCan LLMs help us drive to the edge of the current knowledge and then make it possible for us to make our unique contributions? I think that’s a good outcome for a good seet of prompting practices. \nPerhaps a measure we can ask about a conversation that would help us when training LLMs is to build a dataset where people walk away from their conversation describing it as beautiful. As G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” \n\nSCRIBER - A First Attempt at Teaching LLM Prompting Principles\nTo begin this process let’s understand what might now be possible with LLMs by mapping their affordances to modern pedagogical principles.\n\nLLM Capability\nPedagogical Principle\nSCRIBER Element\nNatural Language Understanding\nSocial Interaction and Collaboration\nSeek, Critique, Broaden/Contract\nNatural Language Generation\nExperiential Learning and Reflection\nReflect, Explain\nContextual Understanding\nAuthentic, Real-World Problem-Solving\nInquire, Explain\nKnowledge Retrieval and Integration\nConnecting Learning to Prior Knowledge and Experiences\nBroaden/Contract, Explain\nAdaptive and Personalized Learning\nScaffolding and Self-Regulated Learning\nAll SCRIBER Elements\nLanguage Translation and Multilingual Support\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nSeek, Broaden/Contract\nTextual Analysis and Summarization\nCritical Thinking and Meaning-Making\nCritique, Reflect\n\n\nThe framework we developed after reverse engineering the principles from our LLM usage is called S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse). We’ve been teaching this model for a while and have seen people get better results from their LLM usage while building capacity and identifying unique contributions. \nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think for Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and teach yourself the things you don’t even know. By using this tool well, you can benefit yourself, your communities, and the world.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask what is around you that you “can’t see.”\n \nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\n●  \tSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\n●  \tCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\n●  \tReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools with which to think.\n●  \tInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\n●  \tBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps, ask the LLM for non-overlapping  options, and pick.\n●  \tExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\n●  \tRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you.\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts. \nPrinciples are ideas you keep in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n  Note: Do not memorize this list.\nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought.\nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n  📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n  🤲\nPrinciple\n 🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAfter giving the GPT as much context as possible, including your main goal, and questions, and all the knowledge you current have about your topic. Then you could ask questions like:\n “Who would know how to answer this question? What is their job?”\n\n “What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n “What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” Or pick someone complete irrelevant to your theme and ask them to respond from their perspective. \n(The more specific information you provide, the better.\nExploration:\nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. \nUse AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback, loving to be proved wrong.\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a person who will disagree.\nFOr a \n For instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a funding agency grant reviewer.\nIf you’re a PHD student, ask for a review from your advisor.\nIf you’re a chef, ask for a critique from a food reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\n Actively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines \n\nAFTER identifying the expert's domain.\nOnce you pick your template, ask it questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper.\nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious, rigorous and slow. \nDeep breaths.\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency:\nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. It will make mistakes, and you should intervene to improve the results. \n\nThis is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI for A number of diverse and non-overlapping options for your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nLLMs To Diversify and then LLMs to Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\n Ask it to help you find out where you need to correct something. Ask it to poke holes.\n Go step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it…\n A simple example is: “you’re a McKinsey consultant. This is our first session, and my business is running out of runway, so I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the help I need for my business.”\nLook at yourself from the third person:\n How can you ask questions to the AI so it asks questions, and you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about?\n\n\nWe have been developing other framework approaches in the appendix below:\n\nAppendix\nPedagogical View\nFramework Element\nDescription\nImpact Measurement\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nElement 1 \nSelf-Directed Learning\n\nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nDepth and complexity of inquiry by learners.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, and data analysis.\nElement 1 \n\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nThe connection between personal experiences and learning objectives.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nElement 1 \nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nConfidence in managing entrepreneurial challenges.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\nElement 1 \nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nProgress towards self-set learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nElement 2 \nLearning By Doing Relevant Activities\nZone of Proximal Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-solving skills and application of knowledge.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nElement 2 \nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nApplication of theoretical knowledge in practice.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nElement 3\nLearning Better By Learning Together\n\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative skills and interaction quality.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, and communication in group settings.\nElement 4\nStart With Why And Connect To Values\n\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nPerseverance in learning challenges.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\n\n\nExploring mapping to cognitive science mechanisms.\n#\nPrinciple\nActionable Prompt\nGoal/Desired Outcome\nTechnical Detail\nCognitive Science Mechanism\nInstructions\nFeedback and Iteration\nEvaluation Criteria\n1\nMap\n\"Identify the key concepts related to [topic] and map their relationships.

However, relying heavily on AI guidance may inadvertently limit the development of independent problem-solving skills. It's crucial to balance AI interaction with independent reflection to foster true autonomy and creativity.\"\n\nAddressing the Criticism\n\nTo mitigate this concern, the framework emphasizes transitioning from AI interaction to independent, offline activities at each step. By encouraging users to engage with the material away from the computer—using paper, pens, and personal reflection—we promote independent thinking and prevent over-reliance on AI.\n\nStep 5: Reflecting on Why TRANSFORM Didn't Work\nThe previous TRANSFORM framework may not have resonated because:\n\nLack of Practicality: It was more theoretical and less actionable.\nMisalignment with Passion: It didn't capture your focus on techniques that promote independent thinking and metacognition.\nOver-Complexity: It might have been too broad, diluting the key principles you value.\nInsufficient Emphasis on Offline Engagement: It didn't stress moving off the computer to deepen thought.\nStep 6: Asking You 10 Questions\nTo ensure this framework aligns with your vision, please consider the following:\n\nDoes this integrated framework capture the practical, actionable essence you were seeking?\n\nHow well does it align with your passion for promoting independent thinking and metacognition?\n\nAre the transitions from AI interaction to offline activities effective in encouraging deep reflection?\n\nDo the example prompts and techniques resonate with how you envision users interacting with LLMs?\n\nIs the inclusion of expert criticism and our response addressing potential concerns you might have?\n\nAre there elements from the NAVIGATE framework or the 17 principles you feel are still missing or need more emphasis?\n\nHow might your JavaScript canvas app be integrated into this framework to enhance offline engagement?\n\nDo you see any potential barriers users might face when applying this framework, and how might we overcome them?\n\nWould you like to include additional steps or modify existing ones to better suit your goals?\n\nHow can we ensure this framework not only helps users think critically but also empowers them to create unique, valuable contributions beyond what the AI provides?\n\nConclusion\nBy closely integrating SCRIBER, NAVIGATE, and the 17 Principles, we've crafted a practical framework that encourages users to leverage AI for deeper learning while promoting independent thinking and metacognition. This approach aligns with your passion for helping individuals use LLMs as tools to enhance their own cognitive processes, rather than relying on AI to do the thinking for them.\n\nI look forward to your feedback on this framework and your responses to the questions. Your insights will be invaluable in refining the framework to ensure it is both practical and aligned with your vision.\"\"\"\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 34 seconds\n\nRe-aligning SCRIBER, NAVIGATE, and the 17 Principles into a Practical Framework\n\nIntroduction\n\nThank you for your detailed feedback and for sharing your passion for creating practical, actionable frameworks that promote deep thinking, metacognition, and independent learning using LLMs. I understand that the previous attempt with the TRANSFORM framework didn't resonate with you because it lacked practicality and didn't effectively integrate the key elements you value.\n\nMy goal now is to:\n\nIdentify your passion and interests by reviewing your corrections.\nUnderstand why the TRANSFORM framework didn't work for you.\nReflect and redo the work, thinking step by step.\nAlign SCRIBER, NAVIGATE, and the 17 principles into a cohesive, practical framework.\nInclude criticism from a relevant expert to strengthen the framework.\nAsk you 10 questions to ensure the results are high quality and helpful.\nStep 1: Identifying Your Passion and Interests\nFrom your corrections and emphasis, it's clear that you are passionate about:\n\nPromoting independent thinking and metacognition: Encouraging users to think deeply and reflect on their own thought processes.\nPractical application: Providing actionable techniques that users can implement immediately.\nLeveraging LLMs as tools for thought: Using AI to enhance human cognition, not replace it.\nEncouraging offline engagement: Getting users off the computer and onto paper to solidify learning.\nUsing methods like antagonist personas and recursive questioning: Techniques that push users to explore different perspectives and uncover unknowns.\nStep 2: Understanding Why TRANSFORM Didn't Work\nThe TRANSFORM framework may not have worked for you because:\n\nIt was too theoretical: Lacked practical, actionable steps.\nDidn't emphasize metacognition and independent thinking: May have focused more on what the AI does rather than how the user can think more deeply.\nDidn't integrate your preferred techniques: Such as antagonist personas, recursive questioning, and prompting users to think offline.\nLacked alignment with your core principles: Didn't effectively merge SCRIBER, NAVIGATE, and the 17 principles into a unified, practical approach.\nStep 3: Reflecting and Redoing the Work\nI will now think step by step to create a new framework that aligns with your goals.\n\nStep 4: Aligning SCRIBER, NAVIGATE, and the 17 Principles\n1.
