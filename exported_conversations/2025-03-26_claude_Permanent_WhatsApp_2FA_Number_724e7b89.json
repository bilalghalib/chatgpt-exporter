      "content": " Getting a number that you can pay for once and keep forever specifically for WhatsApp 2FA texts is a smart approach. There are a few options available.\n\nBased on what I understand about your needs, I'd recommend looking into a Google Voice number. It's a one-time setup (free in the US), and you can keep the number indefinitely as long as you use it occasionally. It works well for receiving 2FA texts including for WhatsApp.\n\nIf you want more privacy or Google Voice isn't available in your region, you might consider a prepaid SIM with a minimal plan that you can top up very infrequently just to keep the number active.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about the best options that would work for WhatsApp 2FA texts?",
