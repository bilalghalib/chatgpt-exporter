We didn’t talk about the budget and right now we are already over budget for building the wrong thing and  I’m not willing to pay to do the initial task from scratch. Let me know what makes sense as this project is already over the cost I allocated for it. ",

      "content": "Dear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI trust this message finds you well. I recently had a discussion with Mr. Agha regarding the challenges we've encountered with the current project. It appears that there was a misunderstanding regarding the assignment's specifics, which has led to some deviations from our original plan.\n\nRegrettably, we did not have the opportunity to discuss the budgetary implications of this situation. As it stands, the project has already exceeded the financial allocation I had initially set aside for it due to the construction of an unintended product.\n\nGiven these circumstances, I am unable to accommodate additional costs associated with starting the initial task from scratch. I believe it is crucial for us to reassess our approach and find a solution that aligns with the project's original scope and budget.\n\nI would appreciate your input on how we can best navigate this situation. Your understanding and cooperation in this matter are greatly valued.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
