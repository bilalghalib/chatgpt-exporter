      "content": "As a professional UX/UI designer, embarking on the development of a social platform for small/medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and local communities involves a structured approach. The first steps in building your prototype would typically include:\n\n1. **Research and User Understanding**: Understand your target users (SMEs and locals) through research. This could include surveys, interviews, and analysis of competitors or similar platforms. The goal is to understand their needs, behaviors, and pain points.\n\n2. **Defining User Personas and Scenarios**: Based on your research, create user personas that represent your typical users. Also, define usage scenarios to understand how these personas will interact with your platform.\n\n3. **Information Architecture (IA) and User Flow**: Develop the IA, which is a plan of how the content will be organized on the platform. Then, map out user flows to visualize the steps users take to complete tasks within your platform.\n\n4. **Wireframing**: Create wireframes to layout the basic structure and components of your platform’s pages or screens without detailed design elements. This is a low-fidelity representation focusing on functionality and user experience.\n\n5. **Prototyping**: Develop a prototype, which is a more detailed and interactive representation of the final product. This could be a low-fidelity prototype (like paper prototypes) or a high-fidelity prototype using tools like Sketch, Adobe XD, or Figma.\n\n6. **Usability Testing**: Test your prototype with real users to gather feedback. This step is crucial to identify usability issues and understand user satisfaction with your product.\n\nRegarding documentation, here are five types of documents commonly used in this phase:\n\n| Document Type                | Purpose                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1. User Research Report      | Compiles the findings from user research. This includes user needs, behaviors, and pain points.   |\n| 2. Persona Profiles          | Detailed descriptions of user personas, representing different user types that will use the platform. These profiles help in",
