      "content": "in this document what might irritate Falah?\n \nMeeting Notes\nDate: 16 and 17, September 2024\nParticipants:  Steve, Nova, Saad, in Ann Arbor MI\nTopic: Medical City and Al-Zayut agreement\n\nFew changes to the agreement were discussed during our meetings on  16 and 17 of September 2024.  This is its summary:\nSecond Party will hire Omar Alani as  project manager for the period of three years (the duration of the project) to oversee the design activities and construction oversite activities and coordinate with the design consultant, the construction oversight engineer, the First Party and the Second Party.  His salary and compensation will be determined after negotiating it with Dr. Omar by WET. \nAgree the site oversite engineer and his team will be selected and contracted by the design engineer under their contract with Party One and.  Nova may recommend an oversite engineer to the design consultant during upcoming meeting in October.  This will be pending on Nova meeting and interviewing with the oversite engineer that WET recommended and the final decision between Nova/Steve on the design consultant.\nNova will provide secretarial and drafter and any other support such as office, stationary, internet service etc for both the project manager and oversite team YES\nNova will be providing contractor insurance for the whole project.  The design engineer will provide his design insurance.  There may need to have additional insurance to cover the concept design that needs to be secured in Turkey.  This topic should be discussed with the design consultant.  YES\nNova will sign a contract and be responsible for payment of the design consultant.  WET could be a cosigner if that is necessary or could represent the construction company as stated in the contract (we need to discuss internally which is more suitable for this project)\nThe design consultant will sign a contract and be responsible for payment of the independent QA/QC team.  \nWET, Falah and Steve discussed the project and got initial feedback from a couple of design consultants in Istanbul and Ankara.  Both companies agreed on the concept design that was presented to them by WET.  The final selection for the design consultant and the QAQC team will be completed by Nova and Steve during their visit to Turkey in October,  The QA/QC process and the contractual process  should be discussed with the selected design consultant.\nDiscussed Nova payment of travel and accommodation for the Second Party during their work on the project.  There were proposals presented but it is not satisfactory in my opinion to Falah since he think that he will be involved in many trips to Baghdad to act as a liaison between the team and the client.  I have not discussed this document or expenses arrangement with Falah yet but he need to be in agreement with it.\nThe total Second Party budget went from $12.5 M to $10.5 M by agreeing to eliminate few of the items and transferring the other to the First Party per the discussion above.   CORRECT\nIn General the meetings we have were very satisfactory and friendly and very productive.  The negotiations went vertysmoothly with the help of trust and cooperation between the parties involved in the negotiations. YES THANKYOU \nPending issues that were discussed but not resolved either we need to discuss with Steve or Falah \nThe agreement needs to define the project duration since the budget is set for a three year contact period and it cannot be open.   The Second Party cannot be expenses beyond the contract duration and end of the project.  Also we need to define clearly what constitutes the end of the project and the contract.\nResponsibilities for Firs and Second Parties presented in Appendix A and B need to be modified according to the discussion items above.\nExclusivity was not clear in our mind and we did not make clear decision at the time.  Nova want no compete until the two projects awarded since he is concern about other contractors get to bid using our system for the same municipality.  I discussed this with Falah many times and we have no reservation discussing any future projects with Nova and it is better to have one construction contractor on our team for the municipality but there might be situations that a contractor approaches the Second Party or limitation of Nova in working on many projects.  This need to be defined further and agree on one thing for the agreement.\nTravel expenses for the first year for Falah is not satisfactory in my opinion.  He spent a lot of effort going back and forth to Baghdad and asking for help to cover his expenses.  We need to move some of the payment to the Second Party and name it as expense for the Second Party.  \nAction Item to finish\nRevise the agreement based on what is stated above.\nFinalize the budget for the Second Party and approve it by Falah ahead of finalizing the agreement.  \nSaad to contact Omar to discuss his compensation package.\nNeed Steve input that Nova and I noted on the document that he revised yesterday,  Please Nova if you still have more updates on the agreement send Steve and I the final onePlease, if you see the need to make any changes or what is written here does not represent what we agreed about for the last two day meeting let me know and try to modify it and send it back.  Once we agree on the items in this meeting notes I will modify by removing few things that should be just between the three of us and send to Falah.  I need him to accept what we discussed before signing.\n\nBest Regards to all\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "There are several potential points of irritation for Falah in this document:\n\n1. **Travel and Accommodation Expenses**: It is mentioned that the proposals for covering travel and accommodation expenses for Falah are not satisfactory. Falah believes that he will be involved in many trips to Baghdad, acting as a liaison between the team and the client, and would likely expect proper coverage for these repeated expenses. The lack of clarity or satisfactory resolution on this front might cause frustration.\n\n2. **Unclear Agreement on Travel Expenses for the First Year**: It is specifically noted that travel expenses for the first year are unsatisfactory for Falah. He has spent significant time and effort traveling between Baghdad and requesting support for these expenses, which suggests a need for a more concrete and agreeable arrangement to prevent dissatisfaction.\n\n3. **Exclusivity and Non-Compete Clause**: The discussion around exclusivity and non-compete is described as being unclear, with Nova expressing concerns about other contractors potentially bidding on the same projects. Falah's view is different, as he believes in discussing future projects openly, but there are limitations to Nova’s ability to handle multiple projects. This difference in opinion might lead to further conflicts or frustration if not properly aligned.\n\n4. **Pending Issues on Responsibilities and Project Duration**: There are pending issues that need Falah’s agreement, such as defining the project duration and the responsibilities for the First and Second Parties. The lack of definition here might create anxiety for Falah, especially if he is expected to take on significant responsibilities without a clear end point.\n\n5. **Budget Adjustment**: The total budget of the Second Party was reduced from $12.5 million to $10.5 million by eliminating some items and transferring responsibilities to the First Party. If Falah was expecting a larger budget for effective project execution, this reduction might not align with his expectations and could be a point of concern.\n\n6. **Compensation of Omar Alani**: The compensation for the project manager, Omar Alani, is yet to be negotiated, and WET is responsible for it. Falah may want to ensure that this compensation is appropriate, and the uncertainty might cause worry if not addressed transparently.\n\n7. **Unresolved Action Items**: There are numerous pending action items involving budget finalization, responsibilities, and agreement revisions. If these remain unresolved or move slowly, it could lead to frustration for Falah, especially if they impact his ability to make informed decisions or plan accordingly.\n\nThese points collectively indicate areas where the document lacks clarity or proper agreement, which could lead to Falah feeling dissatisfied or irritated if his concerns are not adequately addressed.",
