  "notes": "MAJOR SYNTHESIS: Jan 2025 shows Bilal developing Islamic coaching framework integrating Sufi theology (Heart as Witnesser prism connecting divine source to individual meaning) with contemporary thought (Taylor, Edelman, Taoism). This is EVOLUTION beyond Dec 2024 Barakanomics - now synthesizing Islamic mysticism into practical coaching methodology. THEOLOGICAL DEPTH: Not just Islamic economics (Barakanomics) but Islamic PSYCHOLOGY/ONTOLOGY. The circuit model (Source → Heart → Attention → Witnessing) is sophisticated Sufi cosmology applied to human development. CROSS-VALIDATION: Joe Edelman still central reference 3 months after Dec 2024 Values Card Creation. TIMELINE: 3 weeks after Dec 2024 middle batch, rapid methodology evolution from values tools to full theological coaching framework."
