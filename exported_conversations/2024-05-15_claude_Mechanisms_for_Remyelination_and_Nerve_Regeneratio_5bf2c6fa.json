Recent observations in EAE \nprovide support\nfor this \nsuggestion. \nYao and collaborators have shown\nthat IGF-I \ntreatment of Lewis rats \nwith \ndemyelinating\nEAE \nreduces the size and number of \ndemyelinating\nlesions. \nAfter IGF-I \ntreatment, \nmore \nproliferating\noligodendroglia-like \ncells are \npresent \nin the \nlesions,\nthe \nrelative levels of \nmyelin-related protein \nmRNAs \nare\nhigher, \nand there are more \nregenerating myelin \nsheaths\nthan \nthere are in \nlesions \nof \nplacebo-treated \nrats.29\nHowever, \nit is \nimportant \nto note that \ngrowth \nfactor-\ninduced \nresponses \nof human and rodent \noligodendro-\nglia \ndiffer. In cultures \nderived from adult human \nCNS,\nArmstrong \nand collaborators \nhave shown that incuba-\ntion in \nIGF-I \npromoted \ndifferentiation of \npre-oligoden-\ndrocytes, \nthereby reducing \nratios of \npre-\noligodendrocytes \nto \noligodendrocytes. \nFGF had \nthe\nopposite \neffect; \nit increased the \nproportion \nof \npre-\noligodendrocytes \nin the cultures.49 In contrast to \neffects\nseen \nin \nrodent \ncultures, \nneither \nFGF, \nIGF-I nor \nPDGF\nincreased \nproliferation \nof human \noligodendroglia.49-5’\nMyelin regeneration \nalso \nrequires \nan \nappropriate\narray \nof molecular \n’myelin \nformation’ \nsignals \non\ndemyelinated \naxon surfaces. These axolemmal \nsignals\nare \nsynthesized \nin \nneuronal \nperikarya \nand \ninclude\nmitogens \nfor \noligodendrocyte precursors; \nrecent evi-\ndence \nsuggests \nthat \nthey may \ninclude bFGF and\nPDGF.52-55 Other \nimportant \naxon \nmembrane \nconstitu-\nents are those \nrequired \nfor the interactions \nthat \nproduce\naxon ensheathment \nby oligodendrocyte processes. \nIn\nMS \nlesions, \naxonal \nmitogens \nand \nsignalling \nmolecules\nmay \nbe \nrearranged \nor removed \nby cytokines \nand \nother\ntoxic molecules. \nIGF-I, \nwhich is \nsynthesized \nby \nneurons\nin \nvitro \nand \nduring development, promotes growth \nof\nneuronal \nprocesses.34.56-58 \nIt could also have effects on\ntransport \nand \nturnover \nof axolemmal \nmitogens. \nIf \nso,\nIGF-I, \nFGF \nand/or other \ngrowth \nfactors could \nhelp\ncreate an \narray \nof molecules on \ndemyelinated \naxon\nmembranes which will attract \noligodendroglia, promote\ntheir \nproliferation \nand induce \nmyelin regeneration.\nIGF-I \nhas \nangiogenic \neffects both in \nvitro \nand \nin\nvivo;59 \nthese actions could \nhelp promote myelin\nregeneration \nin MS lesions.

Hooijmans2, Martin Hlavica1, Florian A. F. schuler3,5, Nicolas Good1, Andrin Good1, Lisa Baumgartner1, Gianluca Galeno1, Marc p. schneider1, tarzis Jung4, Rob de Vries2 & Benjamin V. Ineichen1,4\nAn unmet but urgent medical need is the development of myelin repair promoting therapies for Multiple\nSclerosis (MS). Many such therapies have been pre-clinically tested using different models of toxic\ndemyelination such as cuprizone, ethidium bromide, or lysolecithin and some of the therapies already\nentered clinical trials. However, keeping track on all these possible new therapies and their efficacy has become difficult with the increasing number of studies. In this study, we aimed at summarizing the current evidence on such therapies through a systematic review and at providing an estimate of the effects of tested interventions by a meta-analysis. We show that 88 different therapies have been pre-clinically tested for remyelination. 25 of them (28%) entered clinical trials. Our meta-analysis also identifies 16 promising therapies which did not enter a clinical trial for MS so far, among them Pigment epithelium-derived factor, Plateled derived growth factor, and Tocopherol derivate TFA-12.We also show that failure in bench to bedside translation from certain therapies may in part be attributable to poor study quality. By addressing these problems, clinical translation might be smoother and possibly animal numbers could be reduced.\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease1. With the only exception of Ocrelizumab2, which has a modest impact on disease progression, none of the 16 FDA approved MS therapies are able to stop or at least to decelerate the progressively increasing disability of affected patients3. One well-acknowledged approach to prevent disease progression is via a boost of myelin repair. Remyelination not only restores efficient electric conduction along axons but, because the myelin sheaths have trophic functions for the axons4, also reduces neu- rodegeneration, which closely correlates with clinical disability5.\nThe intense search for strategies to enhance myelin regeneration to hinder further neurodegeneration and to increase clinical function of patients, is as well reflected by the large number of pre-clinical studies assessing potential remyelinating strategies. Commonly used experimental systems to study potential remyelinating ther- apies include neuro-inflammatory animal models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)6 or virus-induced demyelination/inflammation7 as well as toxin-induced demyelination models with cuprizone8, lysolecithin, ethidium bromide, and complement/anti-galactocerebroside antibodies9 being the most commonly used agents of the latter group10. All of these models have strengths and limitations; whereas neuro-inflammatory models reproduce well the disseminated and inflammatory features of MS, toxin-induced demyelination models are more suited to dissect specific mechanisms of myelin decline and regeneration with a clear temporal separa- tion of these processes and without concomitant inflammation10,11.\n1Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich and Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland. 2Systematic Review centre for Laboratory Animal experimentation (SYRcLe), Department of Health evidence, Radboud University Medical center, nijmegen, the netherlands. 3institute of neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and etH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. 4Waidspital Zurich, Department of Radiology, tiechestrasse 99, 8037, Zurich, Switzerland. 5Present address: Department of neurology, inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. carlijn R.

Duplicate references are references that are mentioned in multiple medical databases (e.g. same references in Embase and Pubmed) or studies published in duplicate (e.g. same study in multiple journals).\nCuprizone is a systemic copper-chelating agent. Upon feeding, it leads to demyelination of distinct brain regions, among them the corpus callosum. Cuprizone has a highly reproducible timeline of de- and remyeli- nation and enables long-term demyelination when fed for a prolonged time window. The exact mechanism of cuprizone-induced demyelination is unknown10,12. Compared to Cuprizone, lysolecithin has the disadvantage of needing an invasive injection to a pre-defined CNS-position. Nevertheless, it is also highly predictive under temporal aspects. Moreover, any CNS area can be targeted selectively with this detergent13. Ethidium bromide leads to much larger areas of demyelination and degrades all nucleated cells within the injection area (including astrocytes and microglia cells)9. The local injection of Anti-galactocerebroside antibodies/complement is rarely used as toxic demyelination model. The time to complete remyelination is shorter in this model but involves a greater demyelinating area than lysolecithin10.\nMany putative therapies have been identified using these toxic demyelination models, from which some already entered clinical trials. We aimed at summarizing all the already pre-clinically tested putative remyelinat- ing therapies via a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to assess which remyelinating therapies can be promising and could be tested in clinical trials. We also investigate the efficacy of the therapies in these experi- mental animal models that have already entered clinical trials. We focused our analysis on the four in vivo toxic demyelination models cuprizone, lysolecithin, ethidium bromide, and complement/anti-galactocerebroside anti- bodies. These models might be more suited to assess potential therapies aiming at halting disease progression of progressive MS in contrast to neuro-inflammatory models, in which potential immune-modulatory effects of therapies could confound efficacy11. The results of our review should provide a framework for future clinical trials investigating putative remyelinating interventions for MS, in particular during the chronic phase of the disease when remyelination failure determines disability progression.\nResults\nstudy characteristics. Study selection process. Figure 1 depicts the Quorum flow chart of the study selec- tion process14. Using 4 different search strings for anti-galactocerebroside antibodies, cuprizone, ethidium bro- mide, and lysolecithin, respectively (see Supplementary Information), a total of 6545 publications were retrieved from EMBASE, go3R, Medline, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences. After initial screening of titles and abstracts, 263 publications were included for full-text search. Out of these, 103 studies met our inclusion criteria (see supplementary reference list). The remainder were excluded according to the criteria listed in Fig. 1.\n    Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 2\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n Figure 2. Histogram depicting the number of included studies per year.\nFigure 3. Venn diagram illustrating how many of the 103 studies assessed one or more of the outcomes remyelination, oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) count, and oligodendrocyte count.\nPublication over time. The first reports using models of toxic demyelination in vivo were published in the sev- enties. Lysolecithin was the first model being published in 197115, followed by cuprizone in 197216, ethidium bro- mide in early 197917, and anti-galactocerebroside antibodies in mid 197918. The first reports using these models to assess a therapy for its remyelinating potential in vivo and meeting our inclusion criteria, however, was only in 199719. Thus, all studies included in the meta-analysis were published between 1997 and 2016 (Fig. 2).\nDescription of the included studies. The characteristics of the 103 included studies are shown in Supplementary Table 1. A total of 88 different therapies were tested in the included studies. 59 studies used cuprizone (58%), 30 studies used lysolecithin (29%), 14 studies used ethidium bromide (13%), and none of the included studies used anti-galactocerebroside antibodies as demyelination model. Only two different animal species have been used in the included studies: mice (72 studies, 70%) and rats (31 studies, 30%). Most studies used male animals (47, 45%), whereas females were less commonly used (28, 27%); 25 studies (24%) did not report which sex they used, and 3 studies (3%) combined female and male animals within the same experimental groups. Most of the studies used remyelination as an outcome measure (95, 93%), 54 of them (52%) investigated remyelination as the single outcome without using oligodendrocyte or OPC counts as outcome. 51 used oligodendrocyte cell counts (50%), and 33 used oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) counts as outcome (32%). Nine studies (9%) did not directly assess remyelination but assessed oligodendrocyte or OPC counts only. Seventeen studies (17%) assessed all three outcome measures remyelination, oligodendrocyte, and OPC count (Fig. 3).\nStudy quality and risk of bias. Figure 4 depicts the risk of bias assessment for the 103 included studies. For many items of the adapted SYRCLE risk of bias tool20, poor reporting regarding experimental details led overall to an unclear risk of bias. Assessment of selection bias showed that none of the included studies described whether or not they blinded the allocation of the animals to the experimental or groups or described the methods used for allocation sequence generation. Although only 5% of the papers reported any measure used to randomise the experiment, fortunately 68% of publications reported similar experimental groups at baseline. Regarding the risk\n        Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 3\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n Figure 4. Risk of bias assessment of the included studies. The first 8 items assess study quality by reporting “yes” indicating low risk of bias, “no” high risk of bias, and “unclear” as not reported20. The remaining 5 items score a “yes” if reported and a “no” if not reported.\n    Outcome\n Median/mean number (±SD) of animals in treatment group\n  Median/mean number (±SD) of animals in control group\n Range\n Remyelination 5.5/6.7 (±3.7)\nTable 1. Sample sizes of the included studies, Abbreviations: SD, standard deviation; OPC, oligodendrocyte precursor cells.\nof performance bias, none of the publications reported whether the animals were randomly housed across cages and rooms during the experiment. 38% of the publications reported that staff was blinded during the experi- ments. Concerning the risk of detection bias, none of the publications reported on random outcome assessment whereas in 13% of the studies, the outcome assessor had been blinded for animal allocation. Measures to reduce attrition bias were reported in 10% of publications. There was a high risk of attrition bias in 3%. In 87%, the risk of attrition bias was unclear as a consequence of poor reporting of the number of experimental animals used in both methods and result sections of the papers. Sample sizes appeared small in most of the included studies, although only 2% of the included studies reported a a prior sample size calculation. The median number of animals in the treatment or control group was between 5 and 5.5 (Table 1).\nBecause poor reporting in preclinical studies is a known problem and therefore many items of the risk of bias tool are scored as unclear risk of bias, we additionally scored two reporting items. These items were also scored in a similar study in EAE21 and in focal cerebral ischemia (FCI)22: Five percent of studies reported randomization at any level (For comparison - EAE: 9%, FCI: 36%). Blinding of the experiment at any level was reported in 38% of studies (For comparison - EAE: 16%, FCI: 29%).\nFinally, 2 studies (1.8%) reported a prior sample size calculation (EAE: <1%, FCI: 3%) whereas 2 studies (1.8%) reported no prior sample size calculation. The remaining publications did not mention whether a sample size calculation has been performed. Compliance with animal welfare regulations or an approved animal license were reported in 58% of cases (For comparison - EAE: 32%, FCI: 57%). A statement whether a conflict of interest was present was reported in 38% of studies (For comparison - EAE: 6%, FCI: 23%).\nMeta-analysis. Remyelination as outcome. In the studies measuring remyelination, different methods were used in the 110 comparisons: most investigators used electron microscopy as outcome (32 experiments, 29%), followed by myelin basic protein (MBP) immunohistofluorescence/-chemistry (26 experiments, 24%), Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining (17 experiments, 15%), and Toluidine blue staining on semithin sections (11 experiments, 10%). In contrast, Black Gold staining (8 experiments, 7%), Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (5 experiments, 5%), PLP immunohistofluorescence (4 experiments, 4%), Eriochrome staining (3 experiments, 3%), MOG immuno- histochemistry (2 experiments, 2%), MRI lesion load (1 experiment, 1%), and MRI magnetization transfer (1 experiment, 1%) were less commonly used.\n Oligodendrocyte cell counts\n5/6.1 (±3.7) 2–21\n5/6.1 (±3.5) 3–18 5/6.4 (±3.7) 3–21\n5/6.5 (±3.7) OPC counts 5/6.5 (±3.8)\n            Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 4\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n Subgroup\n  Comparisons\n  Effect estimate [95% CI]\n  I2\n  Overall 110\nMS model\nCuprizone 66\nEthidium bromide 16\nLysolecithin 28\nMethod\nElectron microscopy 32\nMBP immuno-staining 26\nLuxol fast blue 17\nH&E lesion area 5\nMOG immune-staining 2\nTherapeutic regimen\ntherapeutically 102\n1.61 [1.26, 1.97] 85%\n  1.61 [1.16, 2.07] 83%\n1.67 [0.68, 2.65] 87%\n1.60 [0.90, 2.30] 86%\n1.73 [1.05, 2.40] 87%\n2.16 [1.44, 2.87] 82%\n1.85 [0.97, 2.73] 79%\n5.17 [2.83, 7.51] 92%\n3.29 [0.23, 6.35] 85%\n1.67 [1.30, 2.04] 84%\n                 Table 2. subgroup analysis of the included studies for outcome remyelination. The effect estimate was displayed by the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). No significant differences\nwere found in the subgroup analyses. Abbreviations: MBP, myelin basic protein; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein.\nPooling the individual effect sizes of all therapies in our meta analyses showed that the therapies described in literature enhance remyelination (Standardized mean difference (SMD): 1.61, 95% CI: [1.26, 1.97], Table 2). The overall heterogeneity23 between the studies, however, was high (I2 = 85%), reflecting the anticipated differences between interventions, models used and study design.\nIn order to obtain a more detailed overview of the efficacy of the various therapies included in this review, we also analysed the effect of the seventy-eight different therapeutic approaches in 110 different comparisons for their remyelination potential as measured by different morphometric approaches (i.e. the quantification of thinly myelinated axons in electron microscopy or by similar methods) separately. Nineteen therapeutic approaches significantly enhanced remyelination (Anti-Lingo-1-antibody, Ebselen, Electro acupuncture, Electromagnetic field stimulation, Epimedium flavonoids, Glatiramer acetate, Indazol chloride, N6-cyclohexyladenosine, Neurotrophin 3, Ninjińyoeito, Plateled-derived growth factor, Progesterone, Quetiapine, Sildenafil, SiRNA against Nogo-receptor, Testosterone, Tocopherol derivate TFA12, Triiodothyronine, and Vitamin E) and four therapies dampened the remyelination after experimental demyelination (Dizocilipine, Simvastatin, Trapidil, and Valproic acid) (Figs 5 and 6). For the remaining 55 therapeutic approaches, no statistically significant results were found. In many cases, only one or a few studies were available per therapeutic approach.\nFurther subgroup analyses for timing of the intervention (e.g. prophylactical or therapeutical administration) or type of model used revealed no differences. Due to the small number of comparisons in the subgroups, these results must be interpreted with caution.\nOligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) count as outcome. In the studies visualizing OPCs, different methods were used in the 34 different comparisons: NG2 was the most commonly used marker for OPCs (19 experiments, 56%), followed by PDGFRα (13 experiments, 38%). In contrast, Nkx2.2 (2 experiments, 6%) was less commonly used.\nPooling the individual effect sizes (SMDs) of all 34 experiments investigating the effect of various therapies on OPC counts did not show a significant effect (SMD: 0.87, 95% CI: [−0.08, 1.83], Table 3). The overall heteroge- neity was very high (I2 = 92%).\nThirty-one different therapeutic approaches in 34 different comparisons were tested for their impact on OPC counts as measured by cell counts of different immune-staining methods (i.e. NG2, PDGFRα, or Nkx2.2). The effectsizes (SMDs) and 95% CIs indicated that 7 therapeutic approaches significantly increased the OPC count (Electro acupuncture, Iloprost, Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Testosterone, Triiodothyronine, and Valproic acid) and 3 therapies significantly decreased the OPC count after experimental demyelination (Apotransferrin, Epimedium flavonoids, and Lactacystin) (Fig. 7). For the remaining 21 therapeutic approaches, no statistically significant effects were found. In many cases, only one or a few studies were available per therapeutic approach. No statistically significant differences between subgroups could be identified for type of model used or timing of the intervention (the subgroup of prophylactic adminis- tration was too small).\nOligodendrocytes as outcome. In the studies visualizing oligodendrocytes, different methods were used in the 55 comparisons: APC (CC1) was the most commonly used marker for oligodendrocytes (20 experiments, 36%), followed by GST-pi (11 experiments, 20%), and Nogo-A (9 experiments, 16%). In contrast, CA2 (5 experiments, 9%), CNP (4 experiments, 7%), O4 (3 experiments, 5%), and Olig2/APC (CC1) double staining (3 experiments, 5%), were used less commonly.\n    Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 5\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n Figure 5.

References are given in the Supplementary Information. *The growth factor cocktail contained Platelet derived growth factor-AA, neurotrophin-3, basic fibroblast growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1.\nMeta analyses showed that the assessed therapies can increase oligodendrocyte cell counts (SMD: 2.09, 95% CI: [1. 52, 2.66], Table 4). The overall heterogeneity, however, was high (I2 = 87%), reflecting the anticipated dif- ferences between interventions, models used and study design.\nSubsequently, we investigated the effect of each therapy separately on oligodendrocytes cell counts. Forty-three different therapies in 55 different comparisons were tested for their impact on oligodendrocyte cell counts as measured by cell counts of different immune-staining methods (e.g. APC, CA2, Nogo-A, or others). The SMDs and 95% CIs indicated that 12 therapies significantly increased the oligodendrocyte cell counts (Apotransferrin, Benztropine, Electro acupuncture, Estrogen receptor agonist G1, Olesoxime, Pigment epithelium derived factor, Progesterone, Quetiapine, Sonic hedgehog, Testosterone, Tocopherol derivate TFA-12, and Triiodothyronine) and one therapy significantly decreased the oligodendrocyte cell counts after experimental demyelination (val- proic acid, SMD −11.77, 95%-CI [−18.04, −5.49], 1 comparison) (Fig. 8). For the remaining 30 therapeutic approaches, no statistically significant results were found.\nThe number of independent comparisons per therapeutic approach were very low and varied between 1 and 4. No differences between subgroups were found for timing of the intervention. However, subgroup analyses for type of model used revealed that the type of model used to measure oligodendrocytes cell counts partly explains the observed heterogeneity between the studies. use of the LPC model significantly yielded more oligodendrocyte cell counts compared to the cuprizone model (p < 0.001).\npublication bias. Both visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger regression did not suggest the presence of publication bias for remyelination, OPCs, and oligodendrocyte data. The funnel plots show no significant asymmetry, and no trimming could be performed (Fig. 9). Egger regression also showed no evidence for small study effects (remyelination p = 0.153, OPCs p = 0.063, oligodendrocytes p = 0.99).\nsynopsis of the results.

Table 6 summarizes the therapies that were tested in toxic demyelination models that have entered clinical trials (phase 1 to 4). Out of 88 interventions identified by our systematic review, 25 (28%) have already entered clinical trials. Five of these reached FDA-approval (Fingolimod, Fumaric acid ester, Glatiramer acetate, Methotrexate, Methylprednisolone).\nDiscussion\nFinding remyelinating therapies for MS is an urgent and unmet medical need because no such therapies are cur- rently available. Regeneration of myelin sheaths would re-enable efficient electrical conduction along axons and furthermore protect axons from neurodegeneration4. Many such potential approaches have been pre-clinically tested so far. In order to obtain an overview of possible promising remyelinating therapies, we systematically reviewed pre-clinical studies assessing therapies aiming at improving myelin repair. Our review provides evidence that pre-clinically tested therapies significantly increase remyelination and oligodendrocyte cell counts overall. In addition, we show that there are numerous other therapies that seem promising based on our meta-analysis that are not yet tested in clinical trials.\nOverall meta-analysis of the outcome remyelination showed that 19 out of 78 therapies (24%) enhanced remy- elination. Four therapies dampened the remyelination, among them valproic acid and Simvastatin (1 and 2 com- parisons included, respectively). Nevertheless, Simvastatin was, based on experimental studies conducted in EAE, already tested in several clinical trials due to its presumptive immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects24. It appeared to be successful in a recent phase 2 trial in secondary progressive MS patients25,26. It failed, however, in a phase 4 trial in relapsing remitting MS27. This demonstrates that neuroprotective properties rather than immu- nomodulation might be its primary mode of action24. Besides that, Simvastatin, a blood-brain barrier permeable statin, is an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. It has been shown in vitro and in vivo to dampen the maturation/ differentiation of OPCs to myelinating oligodendrocytes via inhibition of the Rho kinase (ROCK) downstream pathway28,29. Another statin, Lovastatin has also been shown to affect OPC maturation in vitro, namely by inhi- bition of the cholesterol synthesis thereby affecting the proteolipid protein (PLP) transport towards the myelin sheaths30. It seems therefore plausible that one should carefully monitor the effect of statins in the therapy of MS and other demyelinating diseases29,30.\n    Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 9\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n Figure 9. Evaluation of publication bias. Panel A, B and C represent the funnel plots for the outcomes remyelination, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) and oligodendrocyte count. The line represents the SMD of the summary effect, the grey bands represent global 95% confidence intervals.\nMeta-analysis of the outcome oligodendrocyte cell counts demonstrated that 12 out of 43 (28%) therapies increased oligodendrocyte cell counts. Valproic acid was the only intervention significantly decreasing the oli- godendrocyte cell count. Together with its increase in the OPC count, oligodendrocyte differentiation blocking properties have been revealed (via inhibition of histone deacetylases)31. Intriguingly, this antiepileptic drug has repeatedly shown beneficial effects in EAE and optic neuritis animal models32,33. Data from a retrospective cohort study in MS patients were negative, however34. This emphasizes that a good pre-clinical scientific fundament for a presumptive remyelinating therapy using also toxic demyelination models can help to decide whether a therapy should be tested in a clinical trial.\nMeta-analysis of the outcome OPC count revealed that 7 out of 31 therapies (23%) increased the OPC count whereas 3 decreased it (Apotransferrin, Epimedium flavonoids, Lactacystin). Overall analysis of the outcome OPC count revealed no statistically significant effect. Assessing OPC count as the single outcome for a presump- tive remyelinating therapy is not ideal because increased OPC counts can be at the cost of decreased oligoden- drocyte counts (cell differentiation block), as shown by the absence of correlation between OPC counts and remyelination in our analysis. This fits also to the extensive evidence showing that OPCs can be present at the border or even inside experimental demyelinated lesions35,36 and chronic demyelinated MS lesions37–42 without differentiating to oligodendrocytes. Proof of this OPC differentiation block with resulting remyelination failure has led to a paradigm shift in the remyelination field, focusing more on ways to foster OPC differentiation than OPC proliferation43,44 (reviewed in45).\nInterestingly, the meta-analysis outcomes remyelination and oligodendrocyte cell counts showed a significant positive correlation when plotted against each other. This possibly shows that remyelination alone might be a sufficient outcome measure for future pre-clinical trials.\nClinical relevance and recommendations. Out of 88 included therapies, at least 25 (28%) entered one or more clinical trials and/or reached clinical approval. Our meta-analysis resulted in another 16 therapeutic strategies that have not yet been tested in clinical trials but seem promising (i.e. Apotransferrin, Benztropine, Epimedium flavonoids (extract of epimedium sagittatum), Estrogen receptor agonist G1, Iloprost (prostaglandin I2), Indazol chloride (an Estrogen receptor agonist), N6-cyclohexyladenosine (Adenosine A1 receptor agonist), Neurotrophin 3, Ninjin’yoeito (extract from different medicinal herbs), Olesoxime (cholesterol-like compound), Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), Plateled derived growth factor (PDGF), Sildenafil (phosphodiester- ase inhibitor), siRNA against Nogo-receptor, Sonic hedgehog, and Tocopherol derivate TFA-12 (Vitamin E deri- vate)). Our results suggest that treatment with PDGF, PEDF, or Tocopherol derivate TFA-12 are particularly interesting for further investigations because treatment with these drugs showed favourable outcomes in two out of three of our remyelinating outcomes.\n    Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 10\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n Therapy\n  remyelination\n  OPCs\n  Oligodendrocytes\n  Tested in clinical trial\n  Anti-Lingo-1-antibodies\nApotransferrin\nBenztropine\nDizocilipine (MK801, MNDA receptor antagonist)\nEbselen (glutaminase inhibitor)\nElectro acupuncture\nElectromagnetic field stimulation\nEpimedium flavonoids (extract of epimedium sagittatum)\nEstrogen receptor agonist G1\nGlatiramer Acetate (mixture of synthetic polypeptides)\nIloprost (prostaglandin I2)\nIndazol chloride (Estrogen receptor agonist)\nLactacystin (Proteasome inhibitor)\nN6-cyclohexyladenosine (Adenosine A1-receptor agonist)\nNeurotrophin 3\nNinjin’yoeito (extract from different medicinal herbs)\nOlesoxime (cholesterol-like compound)\nPigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF)\nPlateled derived growth factor (PDGF)\nProgesterone\nQuetiapine (atypical antipsychotic)\nSildenafil (phosphodiesterase inhibitor)\nSimvastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor)\nsiRNA against Nogo-receptor\nSonic hedgehog\nTestosterone\nTocopherol derivate TFA-12 (Vitamin E derivate)\nTrapidil (PDGF agonist)\nTriiodothyronine\nValproic acid (antiepileptic) Vitamin E\nIncrease (6)\nNot significant (1)\nNot significant (1)\nDecrease (1)\nIncrease (1)\nIncrease (1)\nIncrease (2)\nIncrease (1)\nNot significant (1)\nIncrease (2)\nNot significant (2)\nIncrease (1)\nNot significant (1)\nIncrease (1)\nIncrease (1)\nIncrease (1)\nNot significant (3)\nNot tested\nIncrease (1)\nIncrease (3)\nIncrease (3)\nIncrease (1)\nDecrease (2)\nIncrease (1)\nNot tested\nIncrease (1)\nIncrease (1)\nDecrease (1)\nIncrease (4)\nDecrease (1) Increase (3)\nNot tested\nDecrease (1)\nNot tested\nNot significant (1)\nNot tested\nIncrease (1)\nNot tested\nDecrease (1)\nNot tested\nNot significant (2)\nIncrease (1)\nNot tested\nDecrease (1)\nNot tested\nNot tested\nNot tested\nNot significant (1)\nIncrease (1)\nIncrease (1)\nNot significant (1)\nNot significant (1)\nNot tested\nNot significant (1)\nNot tested\nNot tested\nIncrease (1)\nNot significant (1)\nNot tested\nIncrease (1)\nIncrease (1) Not tested\nNot significant (1) Yes (II)\nIncrease (2) No\nIncrease (1) No\nNot significant (1) No\nNot tested Yes (II)\nIncrease (1) Yes (II)\nNot tested Yes (II)\nNot significant (1) No\nIncrease (1) No\nNot significant (1) Yes (IV)\nNot tested No\nNot significant (1) No\nNot tested No\nNot tested No\nNot significant (1) No\nNot tested No\nIncrease (2) Yes (I)\nIncrease (1) No\nNot tested No\nIncrease (2) Yes (III)\nIncrease (2) Yes (II)\nNot tested No\nNot significant (1) Yes (IV)\nNot tested No\nIncrease (1) No\nIncrease (1) Yes (II)\nIncrease (1) No\nNot tested No\nIncrease (4) Yes (I)\nDecrease (1) No Not tested Yes (II)\n                                       Table 5. Summary of meta-analysis results for beneficial/harmful therapies on the outcomes remyelination, oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) count, and oligodendrocyte count. The numers in brackets in the second to fourth columns indicate the number of comparisons for each outcome. The roman number in brackets in the last column indicates the latest phase of clinical trial the therapy has entered.\nFollowing this, it would also be very useful to investigate whether the results of the currently conducted clini- cal trials show comparable results with our review results.\nCorrelation with therapies which have entered clinical trials. For some of the clinical trials the results are already published. Whereas some pre-clinically assessed therapies therapies already reached mar- ket approval, the clinical translation is sometimes hampered. A good example are anti-Lingo-1 antibodies. These antibodies effectively and consistently enhanced remyelination in different MS animal models. However, the failure of anti-Lingo-1-antibodies in a phase 2 trial to meet the primary outcome in relapsing/progressive MS patients, a multicomponent analysis evaluating motor and cognitive function as well as disability, were sobering (http://media.biogen.com/press-release/investor-relations/biogen-reports-top-line-results-phase- 2-study-opicinumab-anti-lingo). In our meta-analysis, anti-Lingo-1-antibodies did only show a significant increase in remyelination but not in oligodendrocyte cell counts. Cyclosporin is another therapy that showed ben- eficial effects in the ethidium bromide model46 (although not in our meta-analysis) but failed in clinical trials47. Of course, some of these therapies made it into clinical trials not because of their results in toxic demyelination models assessed here, but because of their results in neuro-inflammatory animal models such as EAE48.\nLimitations. An important limitation of this review, as in many other systematic reviews of animal stud- ies49 is that many of the essential methodological details of animal studies included in our review were poorly reported. This seriously hampers reliable risk of bias assessment because in order to assess whether or not results can be influenced by systematic errors and deviates from the truth, all important details regarding a specific type of bias need to be reported. As a consequence, we can not reliably estimate how valid the results of the included studies are. We nevertheless included the poorly reported papers in this review because papers that do not report essential details are not necessarily methodologically impaired50. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize\n    Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 11\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n Figure 10. Scatter plot of standardized mean differences (SMD) from the present meta-analysis of therapies which were assessed in at least two outcomes (remyelination, oligodendrocyte cell count (OL), oligodendrocyte precursor cell count (OPC)). Remyelination versus OL (A) shows a significant positive correlation (Pearson’s\nr = 0.51, two-tailed p < 0.02). Neither remyelination versus OPC (B) nor OPC versus OL (C) show a significant correlation.\nthat consistent reporting of essential details regarding experimental design for future animal experiments, as described for example in the ARRIVE guidelines51, is urgently needed.\nSecondly, in this review we focused on models of toxic demyelination, namely anti-galactocerebroside anti- bodies, cuprizone, ethidium bromide, and lysolecithin. These models are believed to be more suited to assess potential remyelinating interventions due to a clear temporal separation of de- and remyelination and only min- imal overlying inflammatory processes11. This is in contrast to viral MS animal models or EAE, the most widely used MS animal model, being yet more suitable to study (neuro-)inflammatory processes of MS52. A recent meta-analysis revealed that Cyclosporin, Fingolimod, Glatiramer Acetate, Minocycline, and Vitamin D among others improved neuro-behavioral outcome in EAE21. Glatiramer Acetate also had a beneficial effect on remyeli- nation in our meta-analysis. Fingolimod, on the other hand, did not significantly enhance remyelination in our\n    Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 12\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n Phase\n  Count\n  Trial information\n  NCT (if available)\n  4\nOlesoxime\n1 Serum-derived human monoclonal IgM22\nThymosin beta4\nTriiodothyronine\n10\nAnti-Lingo-1 antibody\nCyclosporin61\nElectro-acupuncture62\nElectromagnetic field stimulation63\n2\n3\nLaquinimod\nMinocycline\nProgesterone\n8\nFingolimod\nFumaric acid ester\nGlatiramer acetate\nMethotrexat\nMethylprednisolone\nOmega-3 poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) diet\nSimvastatin\nVitamin D\n25 (30% of the 84 different therapies from our screening)\nAdd-on therapy for Interferon β1\n—\n—\nFor RRMS, SPMS, and PPMS\nAdd-on therapy for Interferon β1\nPPMS or SPMS\nRRMS\nFor RRMS and SPMS\nFor male patients\nCombined with Selenium\nCombined with Vitamin E\nFor RRMS\nFor clinically isolated syndrome\nTo prevent postpartum relapses\nFDA-approved for RRMS\nFDA-approved for RRMS\nFDA-approved for RRMS\nFDA-approved for RRMS\nFDA-approved for RRMS\nFor RRMS\nAdd-on therapy for Interferon β1 (and phase 3 for SPMS)\nAdd-on therapy for Interferon β1\nNCT01808885\nNCT01803867\nplanned according to RegeneRX\nNCT02506751, NCT02760056\nNCT01864148\nNCT01144117\nNCT01279876\nNCT02087631\nNCT00405353\nNCT00010842\nNCT00010842\nNCT01047319\nNCT00666887\nNCT00127075\nNCT01842191\nNCT00492765\nNCT01005095\n          Erythropoietin\nMelatonin\nQuetiapine\nTestosteron\nVitamin E\nEbselen\n       3\n       4\nTotal\n            Table 6.

Interestingly, Methylprednisolone showed neither a beneficial effect on neurobehavioral recovery nor on remyelination in the meta-analysis even though being com- monly used as treatment for acute MS relapses. This emphasizes that despite the usefulness of MS animal models in developing novel MS therapies, findings cannot be strictly translated to MS.\nThirdly, for many analyses the number of studies was low and the variation between the studies high. This influences the reliability of the conclusions drawn from this systematic review. For example, in this review we pooled the different toxic demyelination models as well as the different methods to assess the outcomes, neglect- ing strengths and weaknesses of various models and outcomes individually. For example, the gold standard of assessing remyelination is the evidence of thinly myelinated axons in electron microscopy. Thus, the most com- monly used readout in the included studies to assess remyelination was the evidence of thinly myelinated axons in electron microscopy (29%). Whereas methods demonstrating thinly myelinated axons are an acceptable com- promise to show remyelination (e.g. semithin sections, MBP53, or sudan black54), other methods are less sensitive and/or specific. LFB was used by 19% of the studies to investigate remyelination upon therapy even though it does not reliably demonstrate single axon/myelin sheath resolution. For now, we have accounted for anticipated heterogeneity by using a random rather than fixed effects meta-analysis.\nFurthermore, it is important to realize that no animal model is a perfect match to represent the full clinical situation. The results coming from animal studies are therefore always indirect55,56.\nWhen the results of this review will be used to inform the clinical field, the applicability and feasibility of the promising therapeutic strategies mentioned in this paper need to be carefully assessed as well. In addition, poten- tial adverse side effects of therapies in both animals and humans is another important determinant for clinical translation. Safety profile is completely neglected by our analysis (as it is in most pre-clinical studies, however) but needs to be included for clinical translation.\n    Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 13\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nLastly, we did not perform post-hoc power-calculations due to their limited validity. The sample sizes, how- ever, were small in most of the included studies. Whereas we cannot draw direct conclusions on the power of the here included studies, it has been shown that the average statistical power of studies in neurosciences is very low57. With lower power, the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect decreases58. This has important implications for successful clinical translation of pre-clinical evidence in animals because effects of a potential intervention might be overestimated in underpowered animal studies57.\nConclusions\nWe identified in this meta-analysis 16 potential therapies to improve remyelination in MS patients that have not yet been tested in clinical trials: Apotransferrin, Benztropine, Epimedium flavonoids, Estrogen receptor agonist G1, Iloprost, Indazol chloride, N6-cyclohexyladenosine, Neurotrophin 3, Ninjin’yoeito, Olesoxime, PEDF, PDGF, Sildenafil, siRNA against Nogo-receptor, Sonic hedgehog, and Tocopherol derivate TFA-12. However, before these therapies should be tested in clinical trials, the safety, applicability, and feasibility of the promising therapies need to be carefully assessed as well. The cross-species translation to humans in clinical trials so far was, however, less successful in some cases. Improving the reporting and possibly the methodological quality of animal studies can help to smoothen this important translation of remyelinating therapies to clinical use. This can also help to reduce animal numbers by making animal research more reliable.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis systematic review investigates the effects of remyelination promoting therapies in multiple sclerosis animal models. The inclusion criteria and method of analysis were specified in advance and documented in a protocol (Ineichen et al. (2017) and put online on the SYRCLE website in the section protocols (www.syrcle.nl).\nsearch strategy and paper selection. A comprehensive search string to identify studies assessing poten- tially remyelinating interventions in an animal model of toxic demyelination (Anti-galactocerebroside antibodies, ethidium bromide, cuprizone, and/or lysolecithin) was generated. The following data bases were searched for matches: EMBASE, go3R, Medline, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences (last search 04th of July, 2016). See supplementary file for exact search strings (Supplementary Information). All animal species, publication dates, and languages were included to the data base search.\nStudies were included in this systematic review when they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) the study was an original peer reviewed full paper that published unique data, (2) the study included an appropriate control group (vehicle only treatment), (3) an animal model of toxic demyelination (Anti-galactocerebroside antibodies, ethidium bromide, cuprizone, and/or lysolecithin) was used, (4) An outcome measure related to remyelination or (pre-)myelinating cell count was used.\nPapers were screened for relevance by two independent reviewers (AG and BVI for anti-galactocerebroside antibodies, ethidium bromide, and cuprizone; GG and LB for lysolecithin). Reviews were excluded but retained as a source for potential studies and for discussion.\nData extraction. The following study characteristics were extracted from the full-texts: type of demyelina- tion model, tested intervention, application regimen, species, strain, sex, and number of animals per group. As study outcomes measures, we extracted the mean and variance (Standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM)) of the outcome most closely related to remyelination. Since certain remyelination outcomes more reliably measure remyelination than others (e.g electron microscopy is more reliable than quantifying remyeli- nation by measuring optical density of an LFB stained lesion), the following extraction priority was used for the remyelination outcomes: (1) Electron microscopy analysis of remyelination, (2) Toluidine blue/semithin section analysis of remyelination, (3) Analysis of other stainings that allow measurement of remyelination (i.e. dispro- portionally thinly myelinated myelin sheets surrounding axons, e.g. MBP staining53, sudan black staining54), (4) Analysis of lesion volume/area in other stainings (e.g. MBP or LFB), (5) Analysis of lesion volume/area in MRI, and (6) Analysis of optical intensity in other stainings (e.g. MBP or LFB). Additionally, mean counts and variance (SD or SEM) of OPCs and/or oligodendrocytes were extracted if available. AG and BVI extracted the data for anti-galactocerebroside-antibodies, ethidium bromide, and cuprizone models; GG and LB extracted the data for all lysolecithin models). BVI checked if all data were extracted correctly. Disagreement between two extractors was solved by checking the data in the publications together. The interrater agreement was 60% for remyelination and oligodendrocytes, and 84% for OPCs.\nIn first priority, data was extracted from text or tables, in second priority from graphs using universal desktop ruler software (AVP Software Development, USA). In case of missing data, corresponding authors were contacted with maximally one email.\nWhen the group size was reported as a range (e.g., 6–9), the mean number of animals was used in our analysis.\nQuality assessment. To estimate risk of bias (RoB) of each study, we judged the study using the SYRCLE RoB-assessment tool, which is an adapted version of the Cochrane RoB tool20. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias in each included paper (AG and BVI for anti-galactocerebroside antibodies, ethidium bromide, and cuprizone; GG and LB for lysolecithin). A ‘yes’ score indicates low risk of bias; a ‘no’ score indicates high risk of bias; and a ‘?’ score indicates unknown risk of bias.\nTo overcome the problem of judging too many items as “unclear risk of bias” because reporting of experimen- tal details on animals, methods and materials is very poor, we added two items on reporting: reporting of any measure of randomization, reporting of any measure of blinding.\n Scientific RepoRts |\n(2019) 9:822 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35734-4 14\n\n www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFurthermore, we looked at 3 more items to measure overall quality of the included papers according to the consensus statement good laboratory practice in the modelling of stroke59: sample size calculations provided, reporting of animal welfare, and statement of a potential conflict of interest. For these three items, a ‘yes’ score indicates ‘reported’, and a ‘no’ score indicates ‘unreported’.\nMeta-analysis. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA version2.0). Because in this Meta-analysis different studies used different scales to measure the same outcome, we calculated the hedges g standardized mean difference (SMD) instead of the raw mean difference (the mean of the experimental group minus the mean of the control group divided by the pooled SDs of the two groups).\nWhen a control group served more than one experimental group, the number of observations in that control group was, for the purpose of the meta-analysis, divided by the number of experimental groups served, to make sure that the experiment does not receive too much weight in the meta analyses.\nIndividual effect sizes (in this case SMDs) were subsequently pooled to obtain an overall SMD and 95% con- fidence interval. We used the random effects model [14], which takes into account the precision of individual studies and the variation between studies and weighs each study accordingly.\nSources for heterogeneity were explored with predefined subgroup analyses for intervention type, timing of the intervention (prophylactic or therapeutic) and type of MS model used (cuprizone, lysolecithin, ethidium bromide and anti-galactocerebroside antibodies).\nWe expected the variance to be comparable within the subgroups; therefore, we assumed a common among-study variance across subgroups. Statistical differences between subgroups were only assessed when sub- groups contained at least 5 independent experiments per subgroup.\nFor those subgroup analyses, we adjusted our significance level according to the conservative Bonferroni method to account for multiple analyses (p* number of comparisons). However, differences between subgroups should be interpreted with caution and should only be used for constructing new hypotheses rather than for drawing final conclusions. No sub-subgroup analyses were calculated due to low number of experiments per therapeutic approach.\nWe used funnel plots, Egger regression and Trim and Fill analysis to search for evidence of publication bias. Because SMDs may cause funnelplot distortion we plotted the SMD against a sample size-based precision esti- mate (1/√(n))60.\nReferences\n1. Organization, W. H.

      "content": " Based on the information provided in the literature review and my existing knowledge, there are several possible mechanisms of action for promoting remyelination and nerve regeneration in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\nStep 1: Identify key processes involved in remyelination and nerve regeneration\n- Proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes\n- Survival of existing oligodendrocytes \n- Migration of OPCs to sites of demyelination\n- Contact between oligodendrocytes and demyelinated axons\n- Formation of new myelin sheaths around axons by oligodendrocytes\n- Axonal regeneration and regrowth\n\nStep 2: Determine potential treatment mechanisms based on the key processes\n\nPromoting OPC proliferation and differentiation: \n- Stimulating growth factor signaling pathways that induce OPC proliferation and maturation (e.g. PDGF, FGF, IGF-1)\n- Inhibiting signaling pathways that block OPC differentiation (e.g. Notch, Wnt, BMP) \n- Epigenetic modulation to activate genes involved in OPC differentiation\n\nEnhancing oligodendrocyte survival:\n- Providing trophic support signals to prevent oligodendrocyte apoptosis\n- Reducing oxidative stress and inflammation that can damage oligodendrocytes\n- Inhibiting complement activation that mediates oligodendrocyte injury\n\nStimulating OPC migration:\n- Increasing expression of chemotactic factors that attract OPCs to lesion sites\n- Modulating extracellular matrix to be more permissive for OPC migration\n\nFacilitating axon-oligodendrocyte interactions:\n- Exposing adhesion molecules and receptors on axons and oligodendrocytes \n- Decreasing expression of inhibitory molecules that prevent myelination (e.g. PSA-NCAM, Lingo-1)\n\nPromoting myelin sheath formation:\n- Stimulating biosynthesis of myelin components in oligodendrocytes\n- Increasing cholesterol availability for myelin membrane production\n\nSupporting axonal regeneration:\n- Providing neurotrophic factors to stimulate axon regrowth\n- Inhibiting growth-limiting signals in lesion environment (e.g. Nogo, MAG)\n- Stabilizing axon cytoskeleton and transport\n\nStep 3: Categorize potential treatment mechanisms\n\nMechanism Category Potential Treatments\nOligodendrocyte protection and survival  Anti-inflammatory agents, Antioxidants, Anti-complement antibodies, Growth factors (IGF-1, NT-3)  \nOPC proliferation Mitogens and growth factors (PDGF, bFGF), Cell cycle regulators\nOPC differentiation and maturation Hormones (thyroid hormone, retinoic acid), Epigenetic modulators (histone deacetylase inhibitors), Neurotrophic factors, Wnt/BMP inhibitors\nOPC migration and recruitment Chemokines and migration factors (CXCL1, FGF), ECM modifiers (hyaluronidase)\nAxon-oligodendrocyte interactions Cell adhesion molecule activators, Myelination inhibitor blockers (anti-Lingo1)\nMyelin component synthesis Transcriptional activators of myelin genes, Cholesterol supplementation\nAxon regeneration  Neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF), Anti-Nogo antibodies, Rho/ROCK inhibitors\n\nIn summary, promoting remyelination and nerve regeneration likely requires a multi-pronged approach targeting oligodendrocyte protection, OPC recruitment and differentiation, myelin synthesis, and axonal regrowth. Therapies may include growth factors, cell signaling modulators, neurotrophins, and inhibitors of negative regulators of myelination and axon regeneration. Combinations of these mechanisms may be needed for optimal treatment of demyelinating disease.",

Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\nStep 1: Identify key processes involved in remyelination and nerve regeneration\n- Proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes\n- Survival of existing oligodendrocytes \n- Migration of OPCs to sites of demyelination\n- Contact between oligodendrocytes and demyelinated axons\n- Formation of new myelin sheaths around axons by oligodendrocytes\n- Axonal regeneration and regrowth\n\nStep 2: Determine potential treatment mechanisms based on the key processes\n\nPromoting OPC proliferation and differentiation: \n- Stimulating growth factor signaling pathways that induce OPC proliferation and maturation (e.g. PDGF, FGF, IGF-1)\n- Inhibiting signaling pathways that block OPC differentiation (e.g. Notch, Wnt, BMP) \n- Epigenetic modulation to activate genes involved in OPC differentiation\n\nEnhancing oligodendrocyte survival:\n- Providing trophic support signals to prevent oligodendrocyte apoptosis\n- Reducing oxidative stress and inflammation that can damage oligodendrocytes\n- Inhibiting complement activation that mediates oligodendrocyte injury\n\nStimulating OPC migration:\n- Increasing expression of chemotactic factors that attract OPCs to lesion sites\n- Modulating extracellular matrix to be more permissive for OPC migration\n\nFacilitating axon-oligodendrocyte interactions:\n- Exposing adhesion molecules and receptors on axons and oligodendrocytes \n- Decreasing expression of inhibitory molecules that prevent myelination (e.g. PSA-NCAM, Lingo-1)\n\nPromoting myelin sheath formation:\n- Stimulating biosynthesis of myelin components in oligodendrocytes\n- Increasing cholesterol availability for myelin membrane production\n\nSupporting axonal regeneration:\n- Providing neurotrophic factors to stimulate axon regrowth\n- Inhibiting growth-limiting signals in lesion environment (e.g. Nogo, MAG)\n- Stabilizing axon cytoskeleton and transport\n\nStep 3: Categorize potential treatment mechanisms\n\nMechanism Category Potential Treatments\nOligodendrocyte protection and survival  Anti-inflammatory agents, Antioxidants, Anti-complement antibodies, Growth factors (IGF-1, NT-3)  \nOPC proliferation Mitogens and growth factors (PDGF, bFGF), Cell cycle regulators\nOPC differentiation and maturation Hormones (thyroid hormone, retinoic acid), Epigenetic modulators (histone deacetylase inhibitors), Neurotrophic factors, Wnt/BMP inhibitors\nOPC migration and recruitment Chemokines and migration factors (CXCL1, FGF), ECM modifiers (hyaluronidase)\nAxon-oligodendrocyte interactions Cell adhesion molecule activators, Myelination inhibitor blockers (anti-Lingo1)\nMyelin component synthesis Transcriptional activators of myelin genes, Cholesterol supplementation\nAxon regeneration  Neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF), Anti-Nogo antibodies, Rho/ROCK inhibitors\n\nIn summary, promoting remyelination and nerve regeneration likely requires a multi-pronged approach targeting oligodendrocyte protection, OPC recruitment and differentiation, myelin synthesis, and axonal regrowth. Therapies may include growth factors, cell signaling modulators, neurotrophins, and inhibitors of negative regulators of myelination and axon regeneration. Combinations of these mechanisms may be needed for optimal treatment of demyelinating disease.",

Exercise and physical therapy:\n   - Aerobic exercise increases BDNF expression and stimulates neurogenesis and plasticity, potentially supporting remyelination and axon regeneration.\n   - Strength training and stretching exercises maintain muscle tone and prevent contractures, which can help preserve axon integrity and function.\n\n2. Nutritional support:\n   - Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., DHA, EPA) are essential for myelin membrane formation and have anti-inflammatory properties, potentially promoting remyelination.\n   - Antioxidant-rich diets (e.g., containing vitamin E, vitamin C, and flavonoids) may help protect oligodendrocytes and neurons from oxidative damage.\n\n3. Electrotherapeutic modalities:\n   - Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can help maintain muscle function and promote neuroplasticity, potentially supporting axon regeneration.\n   - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or direct current stimulation (tDCS) may modulate cortical excitability and plasticity, potentially enhancing remyelination and recovery.\n\n4. Manual therapies:\n   - Massage and soft tissue mobilization techniques may improve circulation and reduce muscle tension, potentially supporting nerve function and regeneration.\n   - Joint mobilization and manipulation techniques may help maintain range of motion and reduce abnormal stresses on nerves, potentially promoting axon survival and regeneration.\n\nThese non-allopathic interventions from sports medicine may complement pharmacological and molecular approaches to promoting remyelination and nerve regeneration in demyelinating diseases.

Providing neurotrophic factors:\n   - BDNF, GDNF, and other neurotrophic factors bind to receptors on neurons, activating signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK) that promote axon growth and survival.\n\n2. Inhibiting growth-limiting signals:\n   - Myelin-associated inhibitors (e.g., Nogo, MAG) bind to receptors on axons and limit regeneration; blocking these inhibitors (e.g., with anti-Nogo antibodies) promotes axon regrowth.\n   - Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the ECM inhibit axon growth; degrading CSPGs (e.g., with chondroitinase ABC) or blocking their receptors enhances axon regeneration.\n\n3. Stabilizing axon cytoskeleton and transport:\n   - Microtubule-stabilizing agents (e.g., epothilone B, taxol) promote axon growth and regeneration by enhancing microtubule stability and transport.\n   - Inhibiting Rho/ROCK signaling (e.g., with fasudil, Y-27632) reduces actin contractility and promotes axon elongation.\n\nNon-allopathic mechanisms from sports medicine interventions:\n\n1. Exercise and physical therapy:\n   - Aerobic exercise increases BDNF expression and stimulates neurogenesis and plasticity, potentially supporting remyelination and axon regeneration.\n   - Strength training and stretching exercises maintain muscle tone and prevent contractures, which can help preserve axon integrity and function.\n\n2. Nutritional support:\n   - Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., DHA, EPA) are essential for myelin membrane formation and have anti-inflammatory properties, potentially promoting remyelination.\n   - Antioxidant-rich diets (e.g., containing vitamin E, vitamin C, and flavonoids) may help protect oligodendrocytes and neurons from oxidative damage.\n\n3. Electrotherapeutic modalities:\n   - Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can help maintain muscle function and promote neuroplasticity, potentially supporting axon regeneration.\n   - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or direct current stimulation (tDCS) may modulate cortical excitability and plasticity, potentially enhancing remyelination and recovery.\n\n4. Manual therapies:\n   - Massage and soft tissue mobilization techniques may improve circulation and reduce muscle tension, potentially supporting nerve function and regeneration.\n   - Joint mobilization and manipulation techniques may help maintain range of motion and reduce abnormal stresses on nerves, potentially promoting axon survival and regeneration.\n\nThese non-allopathic interventions from sports medicine may complement pharmacological and molecular approaches to promoting remyelination and nerve regeneration in demyelinating diseases. However, further research is needed to establish their efficacy and optimal use in this context.",

      "content": " Exercise and physical therapy approaches can have a profound impact on neuroreparative processes, including increased BDNF expression, stimulation of neurogenesis and plasticity, maintenance of muscle tone, and preservation of axon integrity and function. Let's dive deeper into the mechanisms behind these effects and explore how specific techniques influence remyelination and nerve regeneration processes.\n\n1. Nerve flossing:\n   - Nerve flossing, also known as nerve gliding exercises, involves specific movements that encourage the sliding and gliding of nerves within their surrounding tissues.\n   - These exercises help to reduce adhesions and improve the mobility of the nerves, which can alleviate pain and improve function.\n   - Nerve flossing may also stimulate the production of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF, which support the growth and survival of neurons and promote remyelination.\n   - By improving nerve mobility and reducing compression, nerve flossing may help to maintain axon integrity and function.\n\n2. Muscle movement:\n   - When muscles contract and relax during exercise, they release myokines, which are signaling molecules that can have systemic effects on the body.\n   - Some myokines, such as irisin and cathepsin B, have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate the production of BDNF in the brain, promoting neurogenesis and plasticity.\n   - Muscle movement also increases blood flow and oxygenation to the brain and spinal cord, which can support the health and function of neurons and oligodendrocytes.\n   - Resistance training can help to maintain muscle tone and strength, reducing the risk of muscle atrophy and preserving the integrity of neuromuscular junctions, which are essential for proper nerve function.\n\n3. Brain activation and imagery:\n   - Mental imagery and visualization techniques can activate the same brain regions involved in physical movement, leading to neuroplastic changes and strengthening neural connections.\n   - This mental practice can help to reinforce proper movement patterns and improve motor control, even in the absence of physical movement.\n   - Brain activation through imagery may also stimulate the release of neurotrophic factors and promote the growth and survival of neurons and oligodendrocytes.\n\n4. Yoga and breathing:\n   - Yoga combines physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation to promote balance, flexibility, and relaxation.\n   - The deep, controlled breathing practiced in yoga can help to reduce stress and inflammation in the body, which may have neuroprotective effects and support remyelination.\n   - Yoga has been shown to increase BDNF levels in the brain, promoting neurogenesis and plasticity.\n   - The mindfulness and body awareness cultivated through yoga may also help to improve proprioception and motor control, supporting the function of the nervous system.\n\n5. Chemical and hormonal changes:\n   - Exercise can influence the levels of various hormones and neurotransmitters in the body, many of which have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects.\n   - For example, exercise increases the production of serotonin, which has been shown to promote the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), supporting remyelination.\n   - Exercise also stimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which can promote the survival and differentiation of neurons and oligodendrocytes.\n\n6. Dietary changes and fasting:\n   - Dietary modifications, such as calorie restriction or intermittent fasting, can have significant effects on neuroregeneration and remyelination.\n   - Fasting has been shown to increase the production of BDNF and other neurotrophic factors, stimulating neurogenesis and promoting the survival and differentiation of neurons and oligodendrocytes.\n   - Calorie restriction may also reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, creating a more favorable environment for remyelination and nerve regeneration.\n   - Certain dietary components, such as omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, can support the health of myelin and protect neurons and oligodendrocytes from damage.\n\n7. Growth hormone (GH) and other factors:\n   - Exercise, particularly high-intensity interval training (HIIT), can stimulate the release of growth hormone (GH) in the body.\n   - GH has been shown to promote the proliferation and differentiation of OPCs, supporting remyelination.\n   - GH also stimulates the production of IGF-1, which can promote the survival and growth of neurons and oligodendrocytes.\n   - Other factors, such as testosterone and estrogen, may also have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects, and their levels can be influenced by exercise and physical activity.\n\nBy incorporating a variety of exercise and physical therapy techniques, along with dietary and lifestyle modifications, patients with MS may be able to harness the power of these neuroreparative mechanisms to promote remyelination, support nerve regeneration, and improve their overall quality of life. It is essential to work closely with healthcare professionals and physical therapists to develop personalized treatment plans that address individual needs and goals.",
