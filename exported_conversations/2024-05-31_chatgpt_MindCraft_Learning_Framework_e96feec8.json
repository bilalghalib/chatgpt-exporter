Representatives of selected projects will be invited to speak at the 2024 edition of Digital Learning Week to be organized by UNESCO from 2 to 5 September at UNESCO HQ in Paris.\n\nThe UNESCO Guidance for generative AI in education and research was launched during the first edition of Digital Learning Week in September 2023. This Guidance was developed to foster well-designed practices of using generative AI in teaching and learning guided by a human-centred approach. The Guidance can be downloaded at the following link: Guidance for generative AI in education and research\n\nUNESCO is currently organizing the second edition of Digital Learning Week in 2024. One of the event's sub-themes will be centred around the sharing of experiences and lessons learned about the use of GenAI in teaching and learning. In this context, UNESCO is calling for speaker proposals from teachers, experts, and institutions on good practices of using GenAI in teaching and learning. Proposals may involve the use of GenAI at any grade level and any type of education institution (early education institutions, basic education schools, TVET schools or institutions, universities or higher education institutions).\n\nProposals on good practices of using generative AI in teaching and learning should fall under one or more of the following categories:\nto facilitate teaching of specific subjects or inter-disciplinary subject areas;\nas a 1:1 coach for students’ self-paced acquisition of foundational skills;\nto facilitate students’ inquiry or project-based learning;\nto support students' social and emotional learning; and\nto support learners with special needs.\nEvaluation criteria:\n\nProposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\nThe practices on the uses of generative AI in teaching and learning should already be implemented for a minimum of six months. The duration of the implementation can be flexible but ideas/proposals that have NOT yet been implemented will NOT be accepted;\nThe proposal must provide evidence to demonstrate the use of generative AI tools;\nInstitutional validation or strategies for ensuring trustable AI for teaching and learning, and the core values on inclusion, equity, gender equality, linguistic and cultural diversity, and pluralism of opinions;\nThe rigorousness of the design and the methodology to measure the effectiveness;\nEvidence to support the effectiveness against the pre-set objectives and the impact of the emergent projects or practices in schools or classrooms, including on students’ social and emotional development; and\nAlignment with the needs and interests of target learnings and with the recommendations from the Guidance.\n\nTraining programmes implemented and/or guidelines tested to support teaching and research staff to develop AI competencies and make ethical use of AI\n",

      "content": "## Proposal for UNESCO Digital Learning Week 2024\n\n**Title: MindCraft: A Comprehensive Framework for Enhancing Knowledge and Learning through Generative AI**\n\n**Introduction:**\nWe propose \"MindCraft: A Comprehensive Framework for Enhancing Knowledge and Learning,\" an innovative initiative leveraging generative AI (GenAI) aligned with cognitive science and modern pedagogies. Our project has been implemented for over six months, demonstrating effective use of GenAI in various educational contexts, enhancing teaching practices, and facilitating student learning.\n\n**Framework Overview:**\nMindCraft combines large language models (LLMs) and cognitive science principles to create actionable learning prompts. These prompts are designed to improve students' understanding, foster critical thinking, and encourage continuous improvement. The framework consists of 17 elements, each targeting specific learning outcomes through structured prompts and detailed guidance. \n\n**Categories and Implementation:**\nMindCraft's applications span across multiple educational categories, aligning with UNESCO's criteria:\n\n1. **Facilitate Teaching of Specific Subjects or Inter-disciplinary Areas:**\n   - **Example:** Using the \"Map\" element, students identify and map key concepts in a subject like biology, enhancing their comprehensive understanding through visual mapping tools and embedding spaces.\n\n2. **1:1 Coach for Students’ Self-paced Acquisition of Foundational Skills:**\n   - **Example:** The \"Iterate\" element helps students develop a plan for continuous improvement in math, providing step-by-step guidance and regular feedback to refine their skills iteratively.\n\n3. **Facilitate Students’ Inquiry or Project-based Learning:**\n   - **Example:** The \"Explore\" element encourages students to analyze emerging trends in environmental science, fostering curiosity-driven exploration and innovative thinking.\n\n4. **Support Students' Social and Emotional Learning:**\n   - **Example:** The \"Humanize\" element integrates feedback from peers and instructors to refine students' projects, enhancing their social learning and emotional intelligence.\n\n5. **Support Learners with Special Needs:**\n   - **Example:** The \"Adapt\" element tailors learning strategies to fit individual students' needs, creating personalized learning plans that cater to diverse learning styles and contexts.\n\n**Evidence of Effectiveness:**\nOur framework has been rigorously tested and evaluated in classroom settings. We have collected qualitative and quantitative data demonstrating significant improvements in student engagement, comprehension, and retention. Feedback from educators highlights the framework's effectiveness in facilitating differentiated instruction and supporting diverse learners.\n\n**Institutional Validation and Ethical Use:**\nMindCraft adheres to core values of inclusion, equity, gender equality, and cultural diversity. We employ strategies to ensure trustable AI, including transparent methodologies and ethical guidelines. Our framework aligns with UNESCO’s recommendations for ethical AI use, promoting a human-centred approach in education.\n\n**Impact on Students' Social and Emotional Development:**\nMindCraft emphasizes the importance of feedback and social interaction in learning. By integrating elements like \"Reflect\" and \"Humanize,\" the framework supports students' social and emotional development, fostering a collaborative and supportive learning environment.\n\n**Evaluation and Continuous Improvement:**\nWe utilize a comprehensive evaluation system, assessing the effectiveness of our framework through predefined criteria such as clarity, usability, and impact. Iterative feedback and refinement processes ensure the continuous improvement and relevance of our learning prompts.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- **Testing with Example Personas:** Apply enhanced prompts with example personas (e.g., Alex) to gather detailed feedback.\n- **Collect Feedback:** Gather insights on the clarity, usability, and effectiveness of the prompts from educators and students.\n- **Iterate and Refine:** Continuously refine the prompts based on feedback to meet the intended educational goals.\n- **Develop Detailed Examples:** Create detailed examples and usage scenarios for each prompt.\n- **Create Visual Aids:** Develop visual aids and infographics to support the framework's implementation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMindCraft offers a robust and innovative approach to leveraging generative AI in education, enhancing teaching and learning through a comprehensive and structured framework. We are confident that our project aligns with UNESCO’s goals and demonstrates a well-designed practice of using GenAI in teaching and learning.\n\n**Contact Information:**\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n[Your Institution]\n[Contact Details]\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to present our framework at UNESCO Digital Learning Week 2024 and contribute to the advancement of generative AI in education.",
