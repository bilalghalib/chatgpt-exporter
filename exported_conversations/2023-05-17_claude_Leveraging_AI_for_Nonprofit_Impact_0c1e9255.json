      "content": " Here are 5 ways I would improve this proposal:\n\n1. Provide more details on the AI tools and models, especially GPT-4 that will be covered in the workshop. The proposal is light on technical details which some participants may want to know upfront.\n\n2. Highlight some specific case studies and examples of how nonprofits have used AI effectively. This helps to ground the benefits and possibilities in practical real-world examples. \n\n3. Consider modifying the title to be more compelling. The current title \"AI for Good: Leveraging Large Language Models for Impact\" is rather generic. A title that emphasizes enabling nonprofits to \"Supercharge Productivity with AI\" or \"Unlock Your Mission with AI\" may be more appealing.\n\n4. Re-evaluate the price points. The range of $100 to $250 seems reasonable but it may be better to drop the lower end to make it more accessible, e.g. \"$50 to $150\". For nonprofits, lower prices are more attractive and cost-effective. \n\n5. Provide more details on the post-workshop support and follow-up. While a one-month follow-up is good, nonprofits will likely need more handholding and support to successfully apply the tools beyond a month. Consider offering monthly office hours or additional follow-up workshops.\n\nThose are my suggestions for strengthening the proposal and making it more compelling for the target nonprofit participants. Please let me know if you have any other questions!",
