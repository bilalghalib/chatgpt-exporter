      "content": " Based on your background and current situation, I'll suggest focused resolutions that address your core challenges while building on your strengths. Let me break this down:\n\nPrimary Resolutions:\n\n1. Financial Stability & Professional Focus\n- Set a clear 90-day plan to secure stable income, prioritizing either consulting work based on your extensive entrepreneurship training experience or a steady position in social impact\n- Commit to pursuing no more than 2-3 main projects at a time (e.g., the BEIT project, your book on Islamic economics, and one entrepreneurship training program)\n- Dedicate specific time blocks for high-value activities that align with your immediate financial needs\n\n2. Health & Physical Wellbeing\n- Establish a consistent strength training routine to address your desire to look less skeletal and improve overall health\n- Create a structured mobility program focusing on your specific issues (tight calves, hamstrings, knee health)\n- Set up an ergonomic workspace to improve posture and prevent neck strain\n\n3. Mental Health & ADHD Management\n- Convert your tendency to record audio into a structured content creation system - perhaps 30 minutes of daily recording followed by 30 minutes of focused editing\n- Implement a \"done list\" rather than just a to-do list to combat your tendency to feel like you're not accomplishing enough\n- Schedule regular check-ins with your spiritual master to maintain alignment between your actions and values\n\n4. Focus & Project Completion\n- Choose ONE major writing project (either your book on Islamic economics or your paper on post-traumatic growth) and commit to completing it before starting new ones\n- Set up accountability partnerships for your writing commitments\n- Create clear completion criteria for each project before starting it\n\n5. Family & Personal Growth\n- Schedule regular quality time with your young child and wife\n- Set up a system to maintain connections with your international friend network\n- Plan specific actions to prepare for turning 40, focusing on what you want the next decade to look like\n\nThe key theme here is focus and completion over initiation. You have incredible ideas and insights, but your tendency to start new projects before completing existing ones, combined with ADHD, can lead to feeling scattered and unaccomplished. The most important resolution might be to resist starting new projects until you've completed your current ones.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or discuss specific implementation strategies?",
