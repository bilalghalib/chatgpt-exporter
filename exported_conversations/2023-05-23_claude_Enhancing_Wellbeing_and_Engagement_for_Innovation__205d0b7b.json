The program's main objective is to support innovation, employment, and economic growth in the region, specifically by strengthening the local start-up ecosystem in Lebanon through capacity building for existing and emerging ISOs.\n\nBloom will select five ISOs for the EON TOT Program in the Summer of 2023.\n\nObjective of the Training of Trainers Program\n\nThis project aims to enhance ISOs' capacity by providing tailored capacity development programs that help them deepen their wellbeing and engagement in their organizations and for the organizations that they serve.\n\nUsing Bloom’s methodology and tools, the program can successfully enhance the capacity of ISOs and ultimately contribute to the growth of entrepreneurship in Lebanon.\n\nWith this program, you can expect the following:\n\nIncreased Team Engagement: The tailored activities and personalized wellbeing and engagement plans will help ignite each employee's passion and motivation to contribute meaningfully to the ISO.\n\nHealthier Work Culture: Our program focuses on creating a supportive work environment, addressing employees' challenges, and promoting wellbeing at work.\n\nEnhanced Organizational Performance: With improved engagement levels, the employees will be better equipped to collaborate, innovate, and drive growth, leading to positive impacts on the ISOs’ performance.\n\nTarget audience\n\nThe target audience for this project is ISOs that provide services to entrepreneurs and startups, such as business incubators, accelerators, co-working spaces, and other similar organizations.\n\nWe are additionally coordinating with other partners in the “From Innovation to Creation” project (PPI/AOU, cewas, Berytech) to find complementary ways to build the ecosystem's capacity and ensure collaboration in designing and delivering activities that meet the needs of selected organizations.\n\nA comprehensive list of potential organizations shared with the Spark partners is maintained here: Lebanon Ecosystem Mapping - SPARK - 2023\n\nOutreach and Open House\n\nOnce the applications are open, Bloom will launch an outreach campaign to attract and target a broad range of relevant applicants. The campaign will include\n\nLanding Page: on Bloom.pm developed to use in all communication material, including basic program information, link to the interest form, and other relevant information as deemed necessary.\n\nEmail newsletters and outreach\n\nNewsletter, including a call to action inviting potential partners to apply to the program to a database of 10,000 subscribers accumulated over the years.\n\nTargeted emails to the database of ISOs and their employees using Apollo\n\nA social media campaign on the BloomEMEA social pages to reach out to potential partners consisting of social media posts including information for partners, details about the program, an invitation to join the events, and other information.\n\nDirect outreach to ISOs through emails, LinkedIn messages, and events\n\nCollaborations with relevant organizations and stakeholders to reach a wider audience (including other Spark Partners)\n\nEcoSwitch\n\nLivelihoods Working Group\n\nLiveLove - Private Sector Working Group\n\n3RF / RDCL group\n\nWe aim to launch outreach publicly in Week 1 of June 2023.\n\nWe will already be in touch with most of the ISOs in Lebanon as we send out the mapping survey in the last week of April to learn more about Lebanon's innovation ecosystem and create a clear overview of the existing innovation and entrepreneurship support programs.\n\nWe will create a simple form for ISOs to express interest in joining the Open House Period and learn more about the TOT program. The details of the application process are explained in the following section.\n\nWe can organize two Open House events that tease some topics we might tackle during the program. Here are some ideas:\n\nHappiness at work (Randa Lebtivity)\n\nPurpose (Nihal Ahmed or Pascal Kolbe)\n\nMindfulness at work (Vipul Shaha)\n\nOthers?\n\nSelection Process\n\nSelection Philosophy\n\nBloom’s selection process is based on the following principles:\n\nIdentify partners with the most significant potential to work on their capacity building\n\nBe fair & transparent\n\nInspire generosity and collaboration between partners.\n\nProvide value to the community, foster ecosystem engagement\n\nGenerate publicity for the program as a by-product\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nThe first step of the selection process is clearly defining the selection criteria for the ISOs. The EON program will support 5 ISOs in a tailored capacity development program.\n\nSelection Considerations:\n\nPartners will be assessed along with the following criteria, though not all are required for the program.\n\nImpact & Inclusion\n\nWhat difference will the ISO make, and for whom? What is their ability to create durable employment opportunities, and what sort of marginalized communities will be impacted?\n\nCapacity\n\nDo they have demonstrated experience in startup and innovation development and support and the capacity to participate and complete the capacity building program?\n\nFeasibility\n\nCan the capacity development plan be realistically delivered by the end of the program?\n\nInnovation &\n\nGrowth Potential\n\nIs the organization willing to engage in a collaborative learning approach with this project and to share program details with AltCity Impact / Bloom and relevant information with other project participants?\n\nApplications are open to all sectors. However, we prefer some impact areas due to their more significant impact on the economy or their potential to succeed in the Lebanese context.\n\nAreas of Interest:\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship: Including supporting enterprises, organizations, and other entities that are engaged in economic, social, and environmental activities to serve the collective and general interest, which are based on the principles of voluntary cooperation and mutual aid, democratic and participatory governance, autonomy and independence, and the importance of people and social purpose over the capital in the distribution and use of surpluses and profits as well as assets. (definition source)\n\nDigitalization includes digitizing business processes, business support to growing MSMEs with a growth-oriented digital/tech product, and digital jobs. (definition source)\n\nGreen Entrepreneurship: Including greening of business processes, business support to growing (M) SMEs with a growth-oriented green product, and green jobs. (definition source)\n\nApplication Process\n\nBloom is excited to offer an exciting learning opportunity for people working in entrepreneurship and innovation in Lebanon to deepen wellbeing and engagement within their organizations and with the organizations in their programs, learn from others, and gain skills in areas that are important to them.\n\nSince most ISOs are invited to complete the mapping survey, we will only request that they submit a short form with standard questions, including\n\nA basic short application on the Bloom platform to give us more details about themselves and the organization\n\n3-4 demographic questions about the individual\n\n3-4 organizational questions about the ISOs\n\nShort answers to these three questions\n\nWhat are the main challenges you face in your organization in supporting entrepreneurs and startups?\n\nWhat are your current priorities for wellbeing and engagement, both personally and in your work?\n\nWhat kind of wellbeing activities would be most exciting for you?\n\nThese questions will help us shape the program's structure to serve the participants best. The program will include elements to help people in their organizational roles while also supporting their individual growth.\n\nSelection of Partners\n\nBased on the applications received, Bloom will select a subset of organizations after reviewing the mapping survey data, the application responses, and their alignment with the selection philosophy and impact priority areas.\n\nTraining of Trainers\n\nDeepening Wellbeing and Engagement in ISOs and their Beneficiaries\n\nOur methodology helps people and teams identify their purpose and build towards enhanced shared success. We use reflective practices, personal and professional development assessments, and a library of activities designed to help the employees thrive at work holistically.\n\nWe focus on fostering self-awareness and identification of purpose at work, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid word environments. These tools, including recent integrations with AI, will allow participants to facilitate and support their organization’s ongoing growth and development.\n\nThree fundamental principles of a successful Bloom program are:\n\nOur values and strengths power our performance: We help participants identify their sources of meaning at work that unlocks energy and capacity for committed learning and development in their “missions.”\n\nAction-based learning loops: Participants are guided to design a “mission” every two weeks. A mission is a performance objective they want to achieve each cycle, including reflecting on past learnings and planning the next best steps.\n\nLearning by doing together: Promote collaboration and mutual support, primarily online, since usually two heads are better than one.\n\nProgram Structure\n\nParticipants receive introductory information by email.\n\nPre-workshop assessments\n\nWe will invite the five organizations to take the Wellbeing & Engagement and ACAT assessments in July and develop their Wellbeing & Engagement plans.\n\nHost a 2-hour participatory online workshop reviewing challenges, priorities, and goals, and setting action plans … and direct focused adaptive learning during the workshop.\n\nParticipants will set their priorities based on their assessment results and develop an action plan for the program.\n\nTwo weeks of self-guided implementation\n\nParticipants will apply the tools and techniques that they learned in the online workshop while working on achieving the milestones in their action plans\n\nFollow-on 2-hour participatory online workshop, reviewing progress and setting next-stage action plans\n\nParticipants will review their progress in their action plans and we will address any blockers they are facing in implementation\n\nTwo weeks of self-guided implementation\n\nParticipants will apply the tools and techniques that they learned in the online workshop while working on achieving the milestones in their action plans\n\nOne additional group session to wrap up\n\nA 40-minute 1-on-1 coaching session for up to 5 people in each ISO\n\nPost-assessments: Wellbeing & Engagement and ACAT\n\nConference: Does wellbeing improve welldoing?\n\nIn the last week of September, we will organize a learning conference to present the post-assessment results and preliminary findings.\n\nIncentives\n\nTo encourage participation in the program, we could offer the following incentives:\n\nCertification of completion\n\nSocial Media Visibility on Bloom’s media channels\n\nSpeaker opportunity at the September conference\n\nTimeline\n\nThe program will be implemented over five months, with the following milestones:\n\nPre-Program Planning & Preparations\n\nDesign TOT approach, including selection criteria: By the end of May\n\nPrepare for outreach: By the end of May\n\nOutreach / Open House\n\nOutreach for local innovation support orgs: Early June\n\nOpen House activities: Mid-June to End of June\n\nSelection of organizations: End of June\n\nTraining of Trainers\n\nAssessments: Weeks 1 and 2 in July\n\nOrganizational Development Workplans: Week 3 in July\n\nImplementation: Week 4 in July and Week 1 in August\n\nFollow-on workshop: Week 2 in August\n\nImplementation: Weeks 3 and 4 in August\n\nFollow-on workshop: Week 1 in September\n\n1-on-1 coaching: Week 2 in September\n\nPost-assessment: Week 3 in September\n\nLearning Conference: Week 4 in September\n\nWrap up and M&E\n\nPre and post assessments analysis: October\n\nMain roles\n\nThe following roles would be involved in the implementation of the project:\n\nPrograms Lead: responsible for overall program management and implementation\n\nDara\n\nTraining Lead: responsible for supporting the capacity-building program\n\nBilal\n\nTraining Manager: responsible for developing the curriculum in collaboration with training experts\n\nClaude\n\nMentor Manager: responsible for finding mentors\n\nSalem\n\nComms: responsible for developing communication messaging and channels to promote the program and engage with ISOs\n\nJad\n\nEvents: responsible for planning and executing the learning retreat\n\nSteph\n\nCommunity Manager: responsible for building partnerships and relationships with the organizations\n\nRecruiting\n\nM&E: program evaluation and reporting\n\nGhina\n\nPost-Program Evaluation\n\nEvaluation is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the program.
