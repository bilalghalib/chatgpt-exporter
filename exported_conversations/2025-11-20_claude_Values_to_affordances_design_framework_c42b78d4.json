  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user worked with Claude to develop a comprehensive Values Experience (VX) design framework for Aaron's wellbeing registry project, specifically mapping organizational values to system affordances to user experience design. The conversation focused on translating practitioner values cards (from previous interviews with practitioners like Rukudzo, Justin, Barry, Yazmany, and Deepa) into design decisions that would serve organizational users - campus wellbeing coordinators who need to find and evaluate practitioners.\n\nClaude created a detailed VX mapping document that identified five key organizational values: discernment over speed (coordinators need to evaluate practitioner depth from profiles alone), trust through network vouching (institutional recommendations matter more than anonymous reviews), protection from surveillance (safe exploration without exposing institutional vulnerabilities), respect for time and boundaries (use-once-and-leave functionality), and enabling practitioner depth visibility (seeing how practitioners actually work, not just credentials). For each value, Claude mapped specific constitutive affordances (what the system must and must not do), architectural decisions (database schema, information architecture), and detailed UX patterns including search flows, profile designs, and interaction models.\n\nThe user emphasized working within Aaron's core vision of creating a \"springboard not a platform\" - a tool for accessing resources without ongoing engagement requirements, social features, or attention-capture mechanisms. Claude developed this into a library metaphor versus social club distinction, where users come when they need something, find it through a trusted catalog system, and leave without platform dependency. The design included specific features like rich 2000-character practitioner descriptions, institutional vouching systems, zero notifications, external-only contact methods, and privacy-protected search functionality.\n\nA key insight emerged that while they had practitioner values cards, they were designing for organizational users - like having interviewed chefs about cooking but needing to design a restaurant booking system for diners. Claude identified this as informed speculation requiring validation through actual coordinator interviews before building. The document included detailed next steps for VX validation, specific questions for Aaron, interview planning, and design validation criteria to test whether the proposed UX actually enables the identified values.",

Aaron Hurst suggested I reach out to you.\n\nWe're designing a \"springboard\" (not a platform!) where campus coordinators can quickly find vetted coaches, access research, and share validated tools. But before building anything, I want to understand what would actually be useful for people like you.\n\n**This isn't a typical user interview** - I'm less interested in feature requests and more interested in understanding:\n- How you currently find and vet practitioners\n- What makes you trust a recommendation\n- What values should guide how we design this\n\n**The conversation will take about 60 minutes** and I'll ask you to tell me some stories about your work. I'll record it (with your permission) so I can focus on listening rather than note-taking.\n\nWould you be available for a video call in the next two weeks? Here are some times that work for me:\n- [Option 1]\n- [Option 2]\n- [Option 3]\n\nThanks for considering this,\nBilal\n\n---\n\n## INTERVIEW SCRIPT\n\n### OPENING (5 minutes)\n\n**[After hellos and settling in]**\n\nThanks so much for making time to talk with me. Let me give you some context for what I'm doing and why.\n\n**The Project:**\nThe Wellbeing Project is exploring a resource registry specifically for networks like WHEN. The goal is to create something more like a springboard than a platform - you come in when you need something, get it, and leave. No social media dynamics, no ongoing engagement demands.\n\nThink of it like: You need a trauma-informed coach for your campus, you search, you find rich information about how practitioners actually practice (not just their credentials), you contact them directly, and you're done.\n\nWe're also thinking about it for sharing research across institutions and providing validated wellbeing surveys.\n\n**Why I'm Talking to You:**\nBefore we build anything, I want to understand what would actually be useful. More importantly, I want to understand what values should guide how we design this. So I'm less interested in \"I wish it had feature X\" and more interested in \"Here's how I actually make decisions and what matters to me.\"\n\n**Format:**\nI'll ask you to tell me some stories from your work, and then I'll ask follow-up questions. There are no right or wrong answers - I'm genuinely curious about your experience.\n\n**Recording:**\nIs it okay if I record this conversation? It's just for my analysis - I won't share it without your explicit permission, and I'll send you a summary of what I learned once I talk to a few more people.\n\n[Wait for permission]\n\nGreat. Any questions before we start?\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 1: STORY - SUCCESS (15 minutes)\n\nLet's start with a story. **Tell me about a time you were looking for a practitioner or resource for your campus and found someone who was absolutely perfect.** What made them right?\n\n**[Let them tell the story - don't interrupt]**\n\n**Follow-up questions (adapt based on what they said):**\n\n- How did you first find them? \n  - [If referral: What did the person who referred them tell you?]\n  - [If search: Where did you search? What terms?]\n\n- What information helped you decide they were the right fit?\n  - [Probe: Was it credentials, or something else?]\n\n- What did you notice about them - in their profile, their communication, your conversation - that really mattered?\n  - [Probe for specific signals, exact words, moments]\n\n- How did you KNOW they'd be good, not just hope?\n  - [Probe: What gave you confidence? What removed doubt?]\n\n- When you think about that person now, what made them special compared to others you've worked with?\n\n**[If they haven't mentioned it, ask:]**\n- How did they describe their practice? Not just what they do, but HOW they do it?\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 2: STORY - FAILURE (10 minutes)\n\n**Now I want to hear about the opposite.** Tell me about a time you brought in a practitioner or used a resource and it didn't work out. What happened?\n\n**[Let them tell the story - don't interrupt]**\n\n**Follow-up questions:**\n\n- Looking back, what were the warning signs?\n  - [Probe: Were they there from the start? Or emerged later?]\n\n- What information did you wish you'd had beforehand?\n\n- If you were designing a profile or listing for practitioners, what would have helped you avoid that situation?\n\n- Did you get any red flags from colleagues or your own gut? What stopped you from trusting them?\n\n**[Key question:]**\n- When someone SOUNDS right but isn't actually right, what's the gap between the language they use and the reality of how they practice?\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 3: CURRENT PRACTICE (10 minutes)\n\n**Let's talk about your actual process now.** Walk me through what you do when you need to find a coach, facilitator, or resource for your campus.\n\n**[Let them walk through it step by step]**\n\n**Follow-up questions:**\n\n- What sources do you go to first? Why those?\n\n- What makes you trust one source over another?\n  - [Probe: Is it the institution? The person recommending? Something else?]\n\n- What takes the most time in your process?\n  - [Probe: Searching? Vetting? Internal approval? Something else?]\n\n- What feels risky about bringing someone new to campus?\n  - [Probe: Reputational risk? Student safety? Budget? Something else?]\n\n- Have you ever NOT acted on a recommendation even though the person came highly recommended? Why?\n\n**[Transition question:]**\n- If there was a registry tomorrow with profiles of practitioners, what would you search for first? Not just \"trauma-informed\" but what specific information would help you decide?\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 4: VALUES QUESTIONS (15 minutes)\n\n**Now I want to dig deeper into how you actually make decisions.** These might seem like strange questions, but bear with me.\n\n#### **On Discernment:**\n\n**Question 1:** When you're reading about a practitioner - whether it's their website, a referral note, or a conversation - what are you actually PAYING ATTENTION TO that helps you decide?\n\n**[Probe if vague:]**\n- Is it the words they use?\n- Is it their tone or presence?\n- Is it specific examples they share?\n- Is it how they talk about past work?\n- Is it how they describe challenges or failures?\n\n**Question 2:** How do you tell the difference between someone who's really deep in their practice versus someone who's just learned to use the right language?\n\n**[Probe for specifics:]**\n- What exact signals tip you off?\n- Can you give me an example of each?\n- How long does it take you to sense this difference?\n\n#### **On Trust:**\n\n**Question 3:** What makes a recommendation from a colleague trustworthy?\n\n**[Probe:]**\n- Does it matter what position they're in?\n- Does it matter if they have a similar context to yours?\n- Do you need to know HOW they found the person?\n- What would make you discount even a good recommendation?\n\n**Question 4:** When would you be willing to share your campus's wellbeing data or research with other institutions in the network?\n\n**[Probe:]**\n- What would make that feel safe?\n- What would make it feel risky?\n- What privacy protections would you need?\n- Who would need to NOT have access?\n\n#### **On Practice & Boundaries:**\n\n**Question 5:** What boundaries do you have around your own time and availability when it comes to professional platforms or tools?\n\n**[Probe:]**\n- What makes something feel like it's demanding too much attention?\n- Have you ever stopped using a tool because it wouldn't leave you alone?\n- What notifications or updates feel helpful vs. intrusive?\n\n**Question 6:** When you think about HOW a practitioner engages with their work - not just WHAT they do - what matters to you?\n\n**[Probe:]**\n- Does it matter if they co-create vs. deliver services?\n- Does it matter if they name power dynamics?\n- Does it matter if they're vulnerable about their own struggles?\n- Does it matter how they describe boundaries or what they don't do?\n\n#### **On Sustainability:**\n\n**Question 7:** How do you tell if a practitioner will be sustainable in their work versus burn out?\n\n**[Probe:]**\n- Are there specific things they say or do that signal sustainability?\n- Does it matter how they describe their own wellbeing practices?\n- Does it matter if they talk about when they say no?\n\n**Question 8:** If someone is inspiring and charismatic but emotion-dependent (only works when they're feeling hopeful), would that concern you? Why or why not?\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 5: DESIGN SCENARIOS (10 minutes)\n\n**I want to show you some ideas and get your reaction.** These aren't final - they're just sketches to test assumptions.\n\n#### **Scenario 1: Profile Information**\n\n**Imagine a practitioner profile with these fields:**\n- Name + Contact (email/website - no in-platform messaging)\n- \"How I Practice\" (2000 characters - their own words, not a dropdown)\n- \"Specific Methods I Teach\" (list)\n- \"My Boundaries\" (what I don't do, what I need)\n- \"Traditions/Frameworks Beyond My Main Discipline\"\n- \"How I Attend to Power Dynamics\" (optional)\n\n**Questions:**\n- Would this help you discern fit?\n- What's missing that you'd need?\n- What's too much - what would you skip?\n\n#### **Scenario 2: Entry Experience**\n\n**Imagine when you log in, before showing you anything, there's a prompt:**\n\"Before browsing: What support are you seeking for your campus?\"\n\n**Questions:**\n- Would that be helpful or annoying?\n- Would it slow you down in a good way or bad way?\n- What would make you skip it vs. actually answer?\n\n#### **Scenario 3: Search Results**\n\n**When you search, you see:**\n- 5 practitioner profiles (no rankings, no ratings)\n- Snippets from their \"How I Practice\" statements\n- Tags for methods/frameworks\n- Clear contact info to reach out externally\n\n**You DON'T see:**\n- How many people have contacted them\n- Reviews or ratings\n- \"Last active\" timestamps\n- How popular they are\n\n**Questions:**\n- Would the absence of ratings/reviews concern you?\n- How would you decide between the 5 profiles?\n- Would you want fewer results? More?\n\n#### **Scenario 4: Institutional Privacy**\n\n**The system works like this:**\n- You log in with your institutional credentials (not personal)\n- Other institutions can't see who from your campus is using it\n- Practitioners can see which institutions have contacted them\n- No cross-institution directory of coordinators\n\n**Questions:**\n- Does this protect what needs protecting?\n- What would make you nervous about institutional data?\n- Who should definitely NOT have access?\n\n---\n\n### CLOSING (5 minutes)\n\nThis has been incredibly helpful. Just a few final questions:\n\n1. **If this registry existed tomorrow, and you logged in for the first time, what's the very first thing you'd look for?**\n\n2. **What would make you NOT use it?** What would make you go back to your old methods?\n\n3. **What would make it feel extractive versus supportive?** What's the difference between a tool that serves you and a tool that uses you?\n\n4. **Is there anything we haven't talked about that feels important?** Anything I should have asked but didn't?\n\n**Thank you so much for your time.** This is exactly the kind of conversation I needed to have. \n\n**Next steps:**\n- I'll send you a summary of themes I'm hearing across interviews\n- Once we have a prototype, I'd love to show you and get your feedback\n- If you think of anything else, please email me anytime\n\n**One last ask:** Is there someone else in the WHEN network you think I should talk to? Someone with a different perspective or context than yours?\n\n[Get referral if possible]\n\nThanks again. This was great.\n\n---\n\n## POST-INTERVIEW CHECKLIST\n\n**Within 24 Hours:**\n- [ ] Transcribe recording\n- [ ] Extract key quotes\n- [ ] Draft preliminary values card\n- [ ] Note tensions/surprises\n- [ ] Send thank you email with timeline\n\n**Within 1 Week:**\n- [ ] Code transcript for themes\n- [ ] Update Must Do / Mustn't Do lists\n- [ ] Revise interview questions if needed\n- [ ] Share learning with Aaron\n\n**After All Interviews:**\n- [ ] Synthesize patterns across interviewees\n- [ ] Create consolidated values documentation\n- [ ] Present findings to Aaron\n- [ ] Proceed to affordance design phase\n\n---\n\n## TIPS FOR CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW\n\n### Do:\n- âœ… Let silence happen - people need time to think\n- âœ… Follow their energy - dig deeper when they light up\n- âœ… Ask \"What else?\" when you think they're done\n- âœ… Probe for specifics - \"Can you give me an example?\"\n- âœ… Mirror their language back to them\n- âœ… Notice what they DON'T say\n\n### Don't:\n- âŒ Rush to fill silence\n- âŒ Lead the witness (\"So you'd want feature X, right?\")\n- âŒ Defend design ideas if they push back\n- âŒ Skip stories to get to \"the real questions\"\n- âŒ Assume you know what they mean\n- âŒ Take only what confirms your assumptions\n\n### The Most Important Thing:\n**You're not trying to validate your ideas. You're trying to understand their values.**\n\nIf what they tell you contradicts your assumptions, that's the most valuable data.\n\n---\n\n## QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF AFTER EACH INTERVIEW\n\n- What surprised me?\n- What values did I hear that I wasn't expecting?\n- What tensions emerged?\n- What would I ask differently next time?\n- What don't I understand yet?\n- Whose voice am I not hearing?\n\n---\n\n**This script is a guide, not a script.** Follow the conversation where it naturally goes. The goal is understanding, not completion.\n"

Timeline\n- **Q:** Do we have 8 weeks or do we need to compress?\n- **A:** Minimum viable = 4 weeks (skip validation phase, do afterwards)\n\n### 2. Scope\n- **Q:** Is WHEN the right pilot community?\n- **A:** Or should we start with a smaller/different network?\n\n### 3. Budget\n- **Q:** Budget for transcription, contractor hours?\n- **A:** This helps determine: manual vs. automated, how many interviews\n\n### 4. Who Interviews\n- **Q:** Should Bilal do all interviews or split with Aaron/Ale?\n- **A:** Consistency vs. bandwidth tradeoff\n\n### 5. Access\n- **Q:** Can Aaron make intros to WHEN coordinators?\n- **A:** Or does Bilal need to cold outreach?\n\n### 6. Deliverable\n- **Q:** What format does Aaron need for decision-making?\n- **A:** Deck? Doc? Workshop? Demo?\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n**You'll know VX worked if:**\n\n1. **Design decisions have clear rationale**\n   - \"We did X because it enables Y value\"\n   - Not \"We did X because it seems good\"\n\n2. **You can defend choices to Aaron**\n   - \"Here's the value card that led to this\"\n   - \"Here's the interview quote that supports it\"\n\n3. **Tensions are named, not hidden**\n   - \"Users want X but that conflicts with Y\"\n   - \"Here are 3 options with tradeoffs\"\n\n4. **Scope is values-driven**\n   - \"This is in pilot because it's essential to core value\"\n   - \"This is never because it violates core value\"\n\n5. **Validation confirms values enabled**\n   - \"Users report being able to discern depth\"\n   - \"Users say it feels supportive not extractive\"\n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid\n\n### Pitfall 1: Jumping to Solutions\n**Symptom:** Interviewee says \"I wish it had feature X\"\n**Fix:** \"What problem would that solve for you? Tell me about a time when...\"\n\n### Pitfall 2: Confirming Your Bias\n**Symptom:** You only hear what matches your assumptions\n**Fix:** Actively look for contradictions. If everyone agrees, you're not probing deep enough.\n\n### Pitfall 3: Vague Values\n**Symptom:** Values card says \"trust\" or \"authenticity\" with no specificity\n**Fix:** Ask \"What are you noticing that tells you this is trustworthy/authentic?\"\n\n### Pitfall 4: Feature Creep\n**Symptom:** Must Do list keeps growing\n**Fix:** Ruthlessly ask \"Is this essential to core value or nice-to-have?\"\n\n### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Tensions\n**Symptom:** Design that makes everyone happy but excels at nothing\n**Fix:** Name the tension, make a choice, document why\n\n---\n\n## Tools You'll Need\n\n### For Interviews\n- [ ] Video conferencing (Zoom, Google Meet)\n- [ ] Recording permission template\n- [ ] Transcription (Otter.ai, Rev.com, or manual)\n- [ ] Note-taking (Notion, Obsidian, Google Docs)\n\n### For Analysis\n- [ ] Spreadsheet for tracking interviewees\n- [ ] Template for values cards\n- [ ] Miro/Mural for mapping (optional)\n- [ ] Decision log document\n\n### For Design\n- [ ] Wireframing tool (Figma, Excalidraw, pen & paper)\n- [ ] Database schema tool (dbdiagram.io, draw.io)\n- [ ] Flow mapping tool (Whimsical, Miro)\n\n### For Validation\n- [ ] Prototype tool (Figma, clickable wireframes, or just PDF)\n- [ ] Testing script\n- [ ] Feedback capture system\n\n---\n\n## When You Get Stuck\n\n### If Values Are Unclear\n- Go back to stories\n- Ask for specific examples\n- Probe for feelings\n- Get them to walk through their actual process\n\n### If Design Conflicts with Values\n- Don't force it\n- Name the tension\n- Present options with tradeoffs\n- Let Aaron/team decide\n\n### If You're Overwhelmed\n- Start with just 3 interviews (Aaron + 2 coordinators)\n- Focus on HIGH priority questions only\n- Use existing values cards from practitioner transcripts\n- Compress timeline (4 weeks not 8)\n\n### If Aaron Pushes Back\n- Show him the interview quotes\n- Walk through the values â†’ affordances logic\n- Be willing to revise\n- This is iterative, not final\n\n---\n\n## What Success Looks Like\n\n**After 8 weeks, you have:**\n\n1. âœ… Values cards for 3 personas (coordinators, users, practitioners)\n2. âœ… Must Do / Mustn't Do design constraints\n3. âœ… Database schema aligned with values\n4. âœ… User flows that embody values\n5. âœ… Validation that design enables values\n6. âœ… Clear pilot scope with rationale\n7. âœ… Documentation Aaron can use to make decisions\n\n**And most importantly:**\n\nâœ… **Confidence that you're building the RIGHT thing, not just building a thing**\n\n---\n\n## Remember\n\nYou're not building a directory.\n\nYou're building an architecture that enables certain ways of being in relation to resources and each other.\n\nThat's what Values Experience design is about.\n\nAnd that's why it matters.\n\n---\n\n## Questions?

Learning Circles (Primary Community Structure)\n- Small groups (6-8 members) meeting regularly\n- Led by trained facilitators\n- Focus on peer learning and mutual support\n- **REGISTRY RELEVANCE:** These circles might need coach/facilitator resources\n\n### 2. Wellbeing Champions/Coordinators\n- On-campus leaders driving wellbeing initiatives\n- Often faculty or staff who champion wellbeing\n- **REGISTRY RELEVANCE:** These are the org representatives who would USE the registry\n\n### 3. Member Institutions\nUniversities including:\n- Georgetown University\n- High Point University\n- TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey\n- Plus many other higher ed institutions\n- **REGISTRY RELEVANCE:** These are the \"organizations\" in Aaron's model\n\n## Pain Points That Registry Could Address\n\n### Current Challenges (Extracted from Document)\n1. **Finding qualified wellbeing practitioners** for campus programs\n2. **Sharing best practices** across institutions\n3. **Assessing impact** of wellbeing initiatives\n4. **Burnout among wellbeing champions** themselves\n5. **Lack of validated surveys** for campus wellbeing assessment\n6. **Siloed knowledge** - each campus reinventing the wheel\n\n### What They're Currently Doing\n- Regular convenings and summits\n- Learning circles with peer support\n- Resource sharing via various platforms\n- Individual campus initiatives\n- Research on wellbeing in higher ed\n\n## Who to Interview for VX Process\n\n### TIER 1: Key Network Coordinators (Start Here)\nThese people understand the whole system and can identify specific pain points:\n\n**Network Leadership:**\n- **Aaron Hurst** (already in your transcripts - Wellbeing Project)\n- **Georgetown University representative** (co-host institution)\n- **High Point University representative** (co-host institution)\n- **Tec de Monterrey representative** (co-host institution)\n\n**Why:** They understand strategic needs across multiple institutions\n\n### TIER 2: Wellbeing Champions/Coordinators (Priority for VX)\nThese are the actual USERS of the registry - the org representatives:\n\n**Roles to Interview:**\n- Campus Wellbeing Coordinators\n- Student Affairs Directors with wellbeing portfolios\n- Faculty leading wellbeing initiatives\n- Directors of Centers for Contemplative Studies/Wellbeing\n\n**Why:** They're the ones who would actually search for coaches, deploy surveys, access research\n\n### TIER 3: Learning Circle Facilitators\nThese people directly support community members:\n\n**Why:** They understand what kinds of support resources are needed on the ground\n\n### TIER 4: Student Leaders/Graduate Students\nThese are often the beneficiaries but also advocates:\n\n**Why:** They can articulate what support they wish existed\n\n## Specific People to Contact (If Listed in Full Document)\n\n*[Note: Would need to extract specific names/contact info from full document - the document likely has a member directory or coordinator list]*\n\n## Information Useful from WHEN for Registry Design\n\n### 1. Existing Resource Gaps\n- What practitioners/resources do campuses currently struggle to find?\n- What types of support are most requested?\n- What makes a referral trusted in this community?\n\n### 2. Privacy/Security Concerns Specific to Higher Ed\n- FERPA considerations (student privacy)\n- Institutional reputation concerns\n- Competitive dynamics between universities\n- Power dynamics (admin vs. faculty vs. students)\n\n### 3. Survey/Assessment Needs\n- What wellbeing metrics do institutions want to track?\n- What baseline data would be useful across network?\n- What makes surveys actually get used vs. ignored?\n\n### 4. Research Sharing\n- What research would institutions want access to?\n- How do they currently share or not share their own findings?\n- What prevents open sharing of institutional data?\n\n### 5. Community Values\n- How does WHEN define wellbeing (vs. other networks)?\n- What approaches do they explicitly reject?\n- What power dynamics are they trying to shift?\n\n## How This Maps to Aaron's Springboard Goals\n\n### Use Case 1: Find Vetted Coaches/Therapists\n**WHEN Context:** \n- Campuses need practitioners who understand higher ed culture\n- Need coaches for faculty, staff, AND students\n- Need facilitators for learning circles\n- Want people who \"get\" social change orientation\n\n**VX Question:** What makes a practitioner \"right\" for higher ed vs. corporate?\n\n### Use Case 2: Access Shared Research\n**WHEN Context:**\n- Institutions doing wellbeing research but not sharing\n- Need evidence to make case to administration\n- Want to learn from others' successes/failures\n\n**VX Question:** What makes research trustworthy enough to act on?\n\n### Use Case 3: Deploy Validated Surveys\n**WHEN Context:**\n- Need to measure wellbeing across campus\n- Want comparative data (our campus vs. network average)\n- Assessment fatigue is real - surveys need to be SHORT and USEFUL\n\n**VX Question:** What would make a survey actually get completed?\n\n## Recommended Interview Approach for WHEN Members\n\n### Phase 1: Network Coordinators (2-3 interviews)\n**Goal:** Understand strategic landscape and identify specific user personas\n\n**Questions:**\n- What are the top 3 resource gaps WHEN members face?\n- When a campus asks for a coach referral, what do you wish you could tell them?\n- What makes some institutions share resources and others hoard?\n- What security/privacy concerns come up around data sharing?\n\n### Phase 2: Wellbeing Coordinators (5-7 interviews)\n**Goal:** Deep dive into actual user needs and current workarounds\n\n**Use our 15 CAP questions PLUS higher-ed specific:**\n- How do you currently find practitioners for your campus?\n- What's your process for vetting someone before bringing them to campus?\n- What information do you wish you had before making a referral?\n- What makes you trust a recommendation from another institution?\n- What prevents you from sharing your campus data/research?\n\n### Phase 3: Validation (3-5 interviews with different persona)\n**Goal:** Test assumptions from Phase 1 & 2\n\n**Show them:** Mock-ups of registry profiles, share our findings\n**Ask:** Does this match your needs? What's missing?\n\n## Key Tensions to Explore in VX Process\n\n### 1. Individual vs. Institution\n- Do people want personal accounts or institutional accounts?\n- How do transitions work when coordinators leave?\n- Who \"owns\" the institutional knowledge?\n\n### 2. Sharing vs. Competition\n- Universities compete for students/funding\n- But WHEN is about collaboration\n- What data feels safe to share? What doesn't?\n\n### 3. Evidence vs. Speed\n- Need for validated approaches\n- But also need to act quickly with limited resources\n- How to balance rigor with practicality?\n\n### 4. Central vs. Distributed\n- Some institutions have central wellbeing offices\n- Others have distributed efforts across departments\n- Registry needs to work for both models\n\n### 5. Student-Facing vs. Employee-Facing\n- Different needs for student wellbeing vs. staff/faculty\n- Different privacy considerations\n- Different assessment approaches\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Request member directory** from WHEN coordinators\n2. **Identify 2-3 coordinator contacts** for Phase 1 interviews\n3. **Draft interview protocol** using CAP framework + higher-ed specifics\n4. **Get Aaron's input** on which institutions to prioritize\n5. **Plan timeline** - when can we interview? How many before pilot?\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line: Why WHEN Matters for Registry\n\n**WHEN is the perfect pilot community because:**\n- âœ… They're already organized (don't need to recruit cold)\n- âœ… They have identified needs (coaches, research, surveys - Aaron's 3 use cases)\n- âœ… They have trust infrastructure (existing network, vetted members)\n- âœ… They understand security (higher ed data privacy is serious)\n- âœ… They're in Aaron's ecosystem (Wellbeing Project is co-host)\n\n**Starting with WHEN means:**\n- Real users with real needs\n- Built-in feedback loop through existing convenings\n- Ability to pilot at 10 institutions, scale to 30+ in network\n- Aligned values (social change, inner wellbeing, collaboration)\n\n**The VX research with WHEN will tell us:**\n- What \"how I practice\" information actually helps coordinators decide\n- What makes an institutional login work vs. break\n- What privacy controls are non-negotiable\n- What makes research/survey resources useful vs. ignored\n- How to design for both central offices and distributed models\n"

            "extracted_content": "# Wellbeing Registry Questions - Revised for Springboard Model\n\n## What Changed\n\n### Before (Initial Analysis)\n- Focused on HOW PRACTITIONERS experience their work internally\n- Designed for ongoing community engagement and collaboration\n- Included features like entry prompts, reflection rituals, collaborative annotation\n- Assumed practitioners would be active users of the platform\n\n### After (Aligned with Aaron's Vision)\n- Focused on WHAT ORGANIZATIONS need to discern about practitioners\n- Designed for one-time use (\"springboard\" - use once and leave)\n- Removed all social/engagement features per Aaron's explicit boundaries\n- Practitioners are listed resources, not active platform users\n\n## Aaron's Actual Goals\n\n**Primary Use Cases:**\n1. Organizations finding vetted coaches/therapists quickly\n2. Organizations accessing shared research from trusted network\n3. Organizations deploying validated wellbeing surveys\n\n**Key Quotes from Aaron:**\n- \"It's not a platform. It's a springboard. You come there so you can spring off and do something else better.\"\n- \"We want to avoid this being a platform, avoid this being an iPhone.\"\n- \"The community creating value for itself that the community can tap into whenever they need.\"\n- \"NOT a social network. NO direct messaging between organizations.\"\n\n## What the Questions Now Extract\n\n### HIGH Priority (Core Pilot)\n1. **How practitioners practice presence** - helps orgs tell deep from surface engagement\n2. **How they sustain practice beyond emotions** - avoids inspiration-dependent practitioners  \n3. **Specific methods/techniques** - concrete, evaluable approaches\n4. **Boundaries and limitations** - sets realistic expectations\n5. **Surface vs deep engagement** - assesses depth of practice\n\n### MEDIUM Priority (Valuable Context)\n6. **Power/structural awareness** - shows systems thinking\n7. **Service delivery vs co-creation model** - clarifies expectations\n8. **What distinguishes their approach** - unique value proposition\n9. **Cross-disciplinary frameworks** - reveals integrative approaches\n10. **Transformation vs information focus** - change-oriented vs knowledge-delivery\n11. **Empathy vs compassion distinctions** - sustainability of approach\n12. **Collective vs individual orientation** - group/systems capacity\n\n### LOW Priority (Nice to Have)\n13. **Their own trust criteria** - meta-level practitioner discernment\n14. **Field-wide challenges they identify** - contextual awareness\n15. **Their own wellbeing practices** - modeling/sustainability signal\n\n## Database Schema Implications\n\n### Practitioner Profile Structure\n```\npractitioner\nâ”œâ”€â”€ name\nâ”œâ”€â”€ contact_info (external - no platform messaging)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ how_i_practice (rich text, 2000 chars)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ specific_methods (array of strings)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ boundaries_statement (text, 500 chars)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ power_awareness_statement (text, 500 chars, optional)\nâ”œâ”€â”€ disciplines_and_frameworks (array of strings)\nâ””â”€â”€ recommended_by (org IDs who vouched for them)\n```\n\n### What's NOT in the Schema\n- No user account for practitioners\n- No ratings/reviews\n- No messaging system\n- No activity feeds\n- No \"followers\" or social graph\n- No profile photos or personal details beyond professional practice\n\n## How Organizations Use This\n\n1. **Org logs in** (organizational credentials, not individual)\n2. **Searches practitioners** by:\n   - Methods/techniques\n   - Practice approach keywords\n   - Boundaries/availability\n   - Power awareness (if relevant)\n3. **Reads rich profiles** with \"how they practice\" descriptions\n4. **Contacts externally** via email/website listed\n5. **Logs out** - doesn't return until next need\n\n## Alignment with Values Cards\n\nThe values cards revealed what organizations SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISCERN:\n\n- **Rukudzo's card** â†’ Can org tell if practitioner \"stops fully to listen\" vs \"quick check-ins\"?\n- **Justin's card** â†’ Can org tell if practitioner works beyond emotional ups/downs?\n- **Barry's card** â†’ Can org see specific techniques like \"half-step back from empathy\"?\n- **Yazmany's card** â†’ Can org tell if practitioner co-creates vs delivers services?\n- **Deepa's card** â†’ Can org see if practitioner attends to power/structural factors?\n\n## What We Removed (Misaligned with Springboard)\n\n### âŒ Removed: Engagement Features\n- Entry prompts (\"What are you feeling right now?\")\n- Reflection rituals before searching\n- Required pauses/friction\n- Profile completeness gamification\n\n**Why:** Aaron doesn't want ongoing engagement. Use once and leave.\n\n### âŒ Removed: Social Features  \n- Collaborative annotation of resources\n- Community-defined tagging\n- Commenting/discussion\n- Profile \"likes\" or endorsements\n- Activity feeds\n\n**Why:** Aaron explicitly said \"NOT a social network\"\n\n### âŒ Removed: Platform-as-Process\n- Tools for questioning professional norms\n- Collective pattern discovery interfaces\n- Category evolution systems\n- \"Challenges I'm working with\" vulnerability sharing\n\n**Why:** This is a resource directory, not a community transformation tool\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Run extraction** on the 5 wellbeing practitioner interviews using these 15 questions\n2. **Populate test database** with extracted profile information\n3. **Show Aaron** what a \"rich practitioner profile\" looks like vs. traditional directory listing\n4. **Get feedback** on whether this level of detail is useful or overwhelming\n5. **Refine questions** based on what organizations actually need to discern\n\n## Files Generated\n\n- `wellbeing_registry_questions.csv` - For review/editing in spreadsheet\n- `wellbeing_registry_questions.json` - For programmatic processing\n- `revised_approach_summary.md` - This document\n\n---\n\n**Key Insight:** The values cards are still valuable - they reveal what organizations NEED TO KNOW about practitioners. But the platform itself stays simple: a searchable directory with rich profiles, not a social community.\n"

Let me work through this systematically, focusing on what we actually know and where we need to fill gaps.\n\n## The Current Gap\n\nHere's the thing: **we have practitioner values cards, but we're designing for organizational users**. That's like having detailed interviews with chefs when you're designing a restaurant booking system for diners. Useful, but not sufficient.\n\nThink of it this way:\n- **Practitioner values cards** = \"Here's how I want to show up in my work\"\n- **Organization values cards** = \"Here's what I need to discern about practitioners\"\n- **Affordances** = Architectural decisions that enable organizational discernment\n- **UX** = How those affordances manifest in actual interaction\n\n## What We Actually Know (Without New Interviews)\n\n### From Aaron's Transcript + Documents:\n\n**Aaron's Organizational Values:**\n1. **Protection from platform capture** - \"It's a springboard, not a platform\"\n2. **Efficiency of access** - \"Get in, get what you need, leave\"\n3. **Trust through network vouching** - \"Vetted by trusted sources\"\n4. **Privacy from surveillance** - \"No public visibility\"\n\n### From WHEN Document:\n\n**Campus Coordinator Values** (implied pain points):\n1. **Discernment over credentials** - Need to tell depth from surface\n2. **Institutional safety** - Can't risk bad referrals\n3. **Time scarcity** - Can't research every option\n4. **Peer trust** - \"If Georgetown vouches, I trust\"\n\n## Let Me Map This Out\n\nLet me create a comprehensive values → affordances → UX document:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood, I've created a comprehensive values-to-UX mapping. Now let me provide a summary response that highlights the key insights and next steps.\n\nI should be direct about what we have (informed speculation) vs. what we need (actual coordinator interviews), and use a metaphor to make this clear.[View the complete VX mapping](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/values_to_ux_mapping.md)\n\n## What I've Created\n\nA comprehensive values → affordances → UX document that maps:\n\n1. **5 Organizational Values** (what coordinators care about)\n2. **Constitutive Affordances** (what the system must/mustn't do)\n3. **Architectural Decisions** (how the database and rules enable those affordances)\n4. **UX Patterns** (what coordinators actually experience)\n\n## The Core Insight\n\nHere's the thing: **we have practitioner values cards, but we're designing for organizational users**. \n\nThink of it like this: You interviewed chefs about how they cook (presence, boundaries, methods). That's valuable. But now you're designing a restaurant booking system for diners. The chefs' values inform *what information should be visible*, but you still need to understand *how diners make decisions*.\n\n## What's Solid (Based on Aaron + WHEN)\n\n**Aaron's Values:**\n- Springboard not platform ✓\n- Use once and leave ✓\n- No engagement hooks ✓\n- Privacy from surveillance ✓\n\n**Architectural Decisions:**\n- Institutional login (not individual) ✓\n- Rich practitioner profiles ✓\n- No ratings/reviews ✓\n- External contact only ✓\n\nThese translate directly into UX like:\n- NO notifications, ever\n- NO activity feeds\n- NO \"you might also like\"\n- Just search → read → contact → leave\n\n## What's Uncertain (Need Interviews)\n\nWe don't actually know:\n- How coordinators currently search for practitioners\n- What language signals \"depth\" vs. \"surface\" to them\n- Whether institutional vouching matters as much as we think\n- If 2000 characters is too much or too little\n- What their actual risk/decision criteria are\n\n**This means:** The UX I mapped is *informed speculation*, not validated design.\n\n## The Library Metaphor\n\nVX is designing a **library, not a social club**:\n\n- **Library:** Come when you need a book, find it via catalog, librarian vouches for quality, take book and leave, library doesn't email you about new arrivals\n- **Social Club:** Hang out, activity feeds, see and be seen, value from participation\n\nAaron wants a library. The practitioner profiles are books. The institutional vouching is the librarian's recommendation. The \"no notifications\" policy is the library's silence.\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\n1. **Review this with Aaron** - Does it match his vision?\n2. **Interview coordinators** - Extract their actual values (not practitioners')\n3. **Revise the affordances** - Based on what coordinators actually care about\n4. **Prototype & test** - Clickable wireframes to validate assumptions\n5. **Build** - But only after values are validated\n\nThe document I created has:\n- Detailed UX flows\n- Database schema\n- Design validation criteria\n- Questions to ask Aaron\n- Interview plan\n\nBut honestly? The most valuable section is titled **\"What's Still Missing\"** because it names exactly what we don't know yet.\n\n**Don't build this. Interview first.** That's the VX discipline.\n\nWant to walk through any specific section, or ready to plan those coordinator interviews?",

ORGANIZATIONAL VALUE: Protection from Surveillance\n\n### What Coordinators Value\n**\"I need to search for support without everyone knowing my campus is struggling\"**\n\n**Moments of this value:**\n- Not wanting to publicly admit gaps\n- Protecting student/staff privacy\n- Avoiding reputation risk\n- Safe to explore without judgment\n\n**Current blocks:**\n- LinkedIn-style \"who viewed your profile\"\n- Activity feeds showing what you're searching\n- Public data on institutional needs\n- Competitive visibility\n\n### Affordances That Enable This Value\n\n#### MUST DO: Institutional Account Model\n**Architectural decision:**\n- One institutional login (not individual accounts)\n- Credentials shared within org as they choose\n- No personal profiles for coordinators\n- No \"last login\" timestamps\n\n**What this enables:**\n- Privacy for individuals within institution\n- Seamless handoff when coordinators change\n- No personal data attached to institutional needs\n\n#### MUST DO: Search Privacy\n**Architectural decision:**\n- NO search history tracking\n- NO \"recently viewed\" feeds\n- NO \"coordinators who searched X also searched Y\"\n- NO visibility of what other institutions are searching\n\n**What this enables:**\n- Safe exploration of sensitive topics\n- No shame about needs/gaps\n- Protection from competitive intelligence gathering\n\n#### MUSTN'T DO: Activity Visibility\n**Architectural decision:**\n- NO \"Georgetown just added a practitioner\"\n- NO \"5 institutions searched for trauma support this week\"\n- NO institutional comparison metrics\n- NO leaderboards or participation metrics\n\n**What this prevents:**\n- Surveillance capitalism dynamics\n- Competitive comparison between institutions\n- Pressure to perform activity\n- Exposure of institutional vulnerabilities\n\n### UX Patterns\n\n**Login Page:**\n```\nWHEN Network Resource Registry\n\nInstitution Login\nEmail: [institutional email]\nPassword: [shared credential]\n\n[Login]\n\nPrivacy: Your searches and views are not tracked\nor shared with other institutions.

ORGANIZATIONAL VALUE: Respect for Time/Boundaries\n\n### What Coordinators Value\n**\"I need this tool when I need it, then I need it to leave me alone\"**\n\n**Moments of this value:**\n- Searching only when specific need arises\n- Not wanting to \"keep up\" with platform\n- Resenting notification fatigue\n- Valuing tools that don't demand attention\n\n**Current blocks:**\n- Platforms that email constantly\n- \"Your profile is incomplete\" nagging\n- \"You haven't logged in in 30 days!\"\n- Gamification of participation\n\n### Affordances That Enable This Value\n\n#### MUST DO: Zero Engagement Requirements\n**Architectural decision:**\n- NO notifications (ever)\n- NO emails (except explicit requests)\n- NO profile completion pressure\n- NO \"community participation\" expectations\n\n**What this enables:**\n- Use when needed, ignore otherwise\n- No guilt about \"not being active\"\n- Tool serves user, not vice versa\n\n#### MUST DO: External Contact Model\n**Architectural decision:**\n- All practitioner contact happens via email/website\n- NO in-platform messaging\n- NO \"reply within 24 hours\" expectations\n- Relationship moves off platform immediately\n\n**What this enables:**\n- Platform as directory, not mediator\n- Real relationship happens elsewhere\n- No ongoing platform dependency\n\n#### MUSTN'T DO: Engagement Hooks\n**Architectural decision:**\n- NO \"Georgetown, you might like...\"\n- NO \"Complete your profile\"\n- NO \"Share your experience\"\n- NO \"New practitioners added - check them out!\"\n\n**What this prevents:**\n- Attention economy dynamics\n- Addictive design patterns\n- Making work of using the tool\n- Platform as attention sink\n\n### UX Patterns\n\n**Email Strategy:**\n```\nONLY emails allowed:\n1. Password reset (if requested)\n2. Practitioner contact confirmation (optional setting)\n3.

PRACTITIONER VALUE: Enabling Depth Through Profile Design\n\n### Translating Practitioner Values → Org Discernment\n\nThis is where the VALUES CARDS from practitioners become DESIGN DECISIONS:\n\n#### Rukudzo: \"True Presence Beyond Medical Distance\"\n\n**Organizational need:** Tell if practitioner does quick check-ins vs. stops fully to listen\n\n**Affordance:** \n- Profile question: \"How do you practice presence with clients/communities?\"\n- Rich text field for description\n- NO time-per-session metrics (depth ≠ duration)\n\n**UX:**\n```\nHOW I PRACTICE PRESENCE\n\n\"I stop fully to hear what lies beneath someone's\nusual answer. This is different from the 'hi how \nare you' people say while walking away. Stopping \nfully means I don't have my hand on the doorknob,\nI'm not checking my watch, I'm not thinking about\nthe next person. I'm here with this person right now.\"\n```\n\n#### Justin: \"Commitment Beyond Emotional Weather\"\n\n**Organizational need:** Avoid practitioners who only work when feeling hopeful\n\n**Affordance:**\n- Profile question: \"How do you sustain your practice when emotions shift?\"\n- Space for describing consistency practices\n- NO \"currently available\" status updates\n\n**UX:**\n```\nSUSTAINING MY PRACTICE\n\n\"I don't ground my work in hope or despair - those\nchange daily. Instead, I ground in what's possible\nwhen we commit to inner transformation. On hard days,\nI return to the practice itself, not the outcomes.\"\n```\n\n#### Barry: \"Transforming Rather Than Suppressing\"\n\n**Organizational need:** See specific techniques, not just philosophy\n\n**Affordance:**\n- Required field: \"Specific methods you teach\"\n- Concrete techniques, not abstract values\n- Examples encouraged\n\n**UX:**\n```\nSPECIFIC METHODS I TEACH\n\n• The half-step back from empathy\n  Learning to maintain perspective while keeping\n  the heart open, preventing emotional overwhelm\n\n• Compassion vs. empathy distinction\n  How to care without taking on others' pain\n\n• Somatic awareness practices\n  Noticing body signals before burnout happens\n```\n\n#### Yazmany: \"Opening to Be Changed by Others\"\n\n**Organizational need:** Understand if practitioner delivers vs. co-creates\n\n**Affordance:**\n- Profile describes engagement model\n- Clear about who does what\n- Expectations around collaboration\n\n**UX:**\n```\nMY APPROACH TO COLLABORATION\n\nI don't deliver a pre-packaged workshop and leave.\nI come in, meet your community where they are, and\nwe co-create what's needed.

DESIGN VALIDATION CRITERIA\n\n### How to Know If This UX Enables Values\n\nFor each value, we have a test:\n\n#### Test 1: Discernment Over Speed\n**Question:** Can coordinator tell depth from profile alone?\n**Success:** They can decide WITHOUT scheduling a call\n**Failure:** They say \"I'd still need to talk to them first\"\n\n#### Test 2: Trust Through Network\n**Question:** Does institutional vouching increase confidence?\n**Success:** \"If Georgetown vouches, that means something to me\"\n**Failure:** \"I don't care who else used them\"\n\n#### Test 3: Protection from Surveillance\n**Question:** Do coordinators feel safe exploring?\n**Success:** They search sensitive topics without hesitation\n**Failure:** They worry about \"who can see this\"\n\n#### Test 4: Respect for Time\n**Question:** Can they use once and leave?\n**Success:** They close browser and forget about it until next need\n**Failure:** They check email for platform updates\n\n#### Test 5: Practitioner Values Visible\n**Question:** Can they see HOW practitioner practices?\n**Success:** \"I can tell she really stops to listen\"\n**Failure:** \"It's still just credentials and buzzwords\"\n\n---\n\n## 9. WHAT'S STILL MISSING (Need VX Interviews)\n\n### We Don't Actually Know:\n\n1. **How coordinators currently search**\n   - What terms do they use?\n   - What order do they evaluate information?\n   - What's the decision tree in their head?\n\n2. **What \"depth\" looks like to them**\n   - What specific language signals depth?\n   - What makes them trust vs. doubt?\n   - How much text is too much?\n\n3. **Their institutional context**\n   - Public vs. private university differences?\n   - Size matters (large research vs. small liberal arts)?\n   - Geographic/cultural factors?\n\n4. **Their risk tolerance**\n   - What's a \"safe\" choice vs. \"bold\" choice?\n   - When do they need admin approval?\n   - What happens if it goes wrong?\n\n5. **Their trust criteria**\n   - Why would Georgetown's vouching matter?\n   - What if they don't know the vouching institution?\n   - Do they trust peer recommendations?\n\n### This Means:\n\nThe UX above is **informed speculation** based on:\n- Aaron's vision (springboard not platform)\n- WHEN document (institutional dynamics)\n- Practitioner values (what they want orgs to know)\n\nBut it's NOT:\n- Validated by actual coordinator interviews\n- Tested with real search behaviors\n- Confirmed to match their mental models\n\n---\n\n## 10. NEXT STEPS: VX Validation\n\n### Immediate: Show This to Aaron\n\n**Questions for Aaron:**\n\n1. **Does this match your springboard vision?**\n   - Is this still \"not a platform\"?\n   - Is anything here engaging people too much?\n\n2. **Is the institutional privacy model right?**\n   - One institutional login vs. individual accounts?\n   - What visibility between institutions?\n\n3. **Is practitioner profile depth right?**\n   - 2000 characters too much? Too little?\n   - Are we asking the right questions?\n\n4. **Who should we interview first?**\n   - Network coordinators or campus users?\n   - How many before we can validate?\n\n### Then: VX Interviews (As Designed)\n\nUse the interview script and cheat sheet to talk to:\n- 2-3 network coordinators\n- 5-7 campus wellbeing coordinators\n\nExtract actual values cards for ORG USERS, not practitioners\n\n### Then: Revise This Document\n\nBased on what we learn:\n- Adjust affordances if values don't match\n- Redesign UX if flows don't work\n- Add/remove features based on Must/Mustn't\n\n### Then: Prototype & Test\n\nBuild clickable wireframes and validate:\n- Can they discern from profiles?\n- Do they trust institutional vouching?\n- Do they feel safe searching?\n- Can they use once and leave?\n\n---\n\n## METAPHOR FOR THIS WHOLE PROCESS\n\n**VX is like designing a library vs. a social club:**\n\n**Social Club (What we're NOT building):**\n- Members hang out\n- Activity feeds and events\n- You go to see and be seen\n- Value comes from participation\n\n**Library (What we ARE building):**\n- Come in when you need a book\n- Catalog helps you find what you need\n- Librarian (network) vouches for quality\n- Take book and leave\n- Library doesn't email you about new arrivals\n- Library doesn't track what you read\n\n**The practitioner profiles are books on the shelf.**\n**The institutional vouching is the librarian's recommendation.**\n**The search function is the card catalog.**\n**The \"no notifications\" policy is the library's silence.**\n\nAaron wants a library, not a social club.\n\nThis VX document tries to architect that.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL REALITY CHECK\n\n### What's Good About This Design:\n\nâœ… Aligns with Aaron's springboard vision\nâœ… Protects institutional privacy\nâœ… Enables practitioner depth to be visible\nâœ… No engagement hooks or platform capture\nâœ… Trusts coordinator discernment\n\n### What's Uncertain:\n\n❓ Is 2000 characters the right length?\n❓ Will coordinators actually read that much?\n❓ Does institutional vouching matter as much as we think?\n❓ Are we protecting the right things?\n❓ What are we missing that only interviews will reveal?\n\n### What to Do About Uncertainty:\n\n**Don't build yet.**\n\n**Interview first.**\n\n**Validate values.**\n\n**Then architect.**\n\n**Then UX.**\n\n**Then build.**\n\nThat's the VX process.\n",

DESIGN VALIDATION CRITERIA\\n\\n### How to Know If This UX Enables Values\\n\\nFor each value, we have a test:\\n\\n#### Test 1: Discernment Over Speed\\n**Question:** Can coordinator tell depth from profile alone?\\n**Success:** They can decide WITHOUT scheduling a call\\n**Failure:** They say \\\"I'd still need to talk to them first\\\"\\n\\n#### Test 2: Trust Through Network\\n**Question:** Does institutional vouching increase confidence?\\n**Success:** \\\"If Georgetown vouches, that means something to me\\\"\\n**Failure:** \\\"I don't care who else used them\\\"\\n\\n#### Test 3: Protection from Surveillance\\n**Question:** Do coordinators feel safe exploring?\\n**Success:** They search sensitive topics without hesitation\\n**Failure:** They worry about \\\"who can see this\\\"\\n\\n#### Test 4: Respect for Time\\n**Question:** Can they use once and leave?\\n**Success:** They close browser and forget about it until next need\\n**Failure:** They check email for platform updates\\n\\n#### Test 5: Practitioner Values Visible\\n**Question:** Can they see HOW practitioner practices?\\n**Success:** \\\"I can tell she really stops to listen\\\"\\n**Failure:** \\\"It's still just credentials and buzzwords\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 9. WHAT'S STILL MISSING (Need VX Interviews)\\n\\n### We Don't Actually Know:\\n\\n1. **How coordinators currently search**\\n   - What terms do they use?\\n   - What order do they evaluate information?\\n   - What's the decision tree in their head?\\n\\n2. **What \\\"depth\\\" looks like to them**\\n   - What specific language signals depth?\\n   - What makes them trust vs. doubt?\\n   - How much text is too much?\\n\\n3. **Their institutional context**\\n   - Public vs. private university differences?\\n   - Size matters (large research vs. small liberal arts)?\\n   - Geographic/cultural factors?\\n\\n4. **Their risk tolerance**\\n   - What's a \\\"safe\\\" choice vs. \\\"bold\\\" choice?\\n   - When do they need admin approval?\\n   - What happens if it goes wrong?\\n\\n5. **Their trust criteria**\\n   - Why would Georgetown's vouching matter?\\n   - What if they don't know the vouching institution?\\n   - Do they trust peer recommendations?\\n\\n### This Means:\\n\\nThe UX above is **informed speculation** based on:\\n- Aaron's vision (springboard not platform)\\n- WHEN document (institutional dynamics)\\n- Practitioner values (what they want orgs to know)\\n\\nBut it's NOT:\\n- Validated by actual coordinator interviews\\n- Tested with real search behaviors\\n- Confirmed to match their mental models\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 10. NEXT STEPS: VX Validation\\n\\n### Immediate: Show This to Aaron\\n\\n**Questions for Aaron:**\\n\\n1. **Does this match your springboard vision?**\\n   - Is this still \\\"not a platform\\\"?\\n   - Is anything here engaging people too much?\\n\\n2. **Is the institutional privacy model right?**\\n   - One institutional login vs. individual accounts?\\n   - What visibility between institutions?\\n\\n3. **Is practitioner profile depth right?**\\n   - 2000 characters too much? Too little?\\n   - Are we asking the right questions?\\n\\n4. **Who should we interview first?**\\n   - Network coordinators or campus users?\\n   - How many before we can validate?\\n\\n### Then: VX Interviews (As Designed)\\n\\nUse the interview script and cheat sheet to talk to:\\n- 2-3 network coordinators\\n- 5-7 campus wellbeing coordinators\\n\\nExtract actual values cards for ORG USERS, not practitioners\\n\\n### Then: Revise This Document\\n\\nBased on what we learn:\\n- Adjust affordances if values don't match\\n- Redesign UX if flows don't work\\n- Add/remove features based on Must/Mustn't\\n\\n### Then: Prototype & Test\\n\\nBuild clickable wireframes and validate:\\n- Can they discern from profiles?\\n- Do they trust institutional vouching?\\n- Do they feel safe searching?\\n- Can they use once and leave?\\n\\n---\\n\\n## METAPHOR FOR THIS WHOLE PROCESS\\n\\n**VX is like designing a library vs. a social club:**\\n\\n**Social Club (What we're NOT building):**\\n- Members hang out\\n- Activity feeds and events\\n- You go to see and be seen\\n- Value comes from participation\\n\\n**Library (What we ARE building):**\\n- Come in when you need a book\\n- Catalog helps you find what you need\\n- Librarian (network) vouches for quality\\n- Take book and leave\\n- Library doesn't email you about new arrivals\\n- Library doesn't track what you read\\n\\n**The practitioner profiles are books on the shelf.**\\n**The institutional vouching is the librarian's recommendation.**\\n**The search function is the card catalog.**\\n**The \\\"no notifications\\\" policy is the library's silence.**\\n\\nAaron wants a library, not a social club.\\n\\nThis VX document tries to architect that.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FINAL REALITY CHECK\\n\\n### What's Good About This Design:\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0153\\u2026 Aligns with Aaron's springboard vision\\n\\u00e2\\u0153\\u2026 Protects institutional privacy\\n\\u00e2\\u0153\\u2026 Enables practitioner depth to be visible\\n\\u00e2\\u0153\\u2026 No engagement hooks or platform capture\\n\\u00e2\\u0153\\u2026 Trusts coordinator discernment\\n\\n### What's Uncertain:\\n\\n\\u2753 Is 2000 characters the right length?\\n\\u2753 Will coordinators actually read that much?\\n\\u2753 Does institutional vouching matter as much as we think?\\n\\u2753 Are we protecting the right things?\\n\\u2753 What are we missing that only interviews will reveal?\\n\\n### What to Do About Uncertainty:\\n\\n**Don't build yet.**\\n\\n**Interview first.**\\n\\n**Validate values.**\\n\\n**Then architect.**\\n\\n**Then UX.**\\n\\n**Then build.**\\n\\nThat's the VX process.\\n\", \"filename\": \"/mnt/user-data/outputs/values_to_ux_mapping.md\"}"

That's valuable. But now you're designing a restaurant booking system for diners. The chefs' values inform *what information should be visible*, but you still need to understand *how diners make decisions*.\n\n## What's Solid (Based on Aaron + WHEN)\n\n**Aaron's Values:**\n- Springboard not platform ✓\n- Use once and leave ✓\n- No engagement hooks ✓\n- Privacy from surveillance ✓\n\n**Architectural Decisions:**\n- Institutional login (not individual) ✓\n- Rich practitioner profiles ✓\n- No ratings/reviews ✓\n- External contact only ✓\n\nThese translate directly into UX like:\n- NO notifications, ever\n- NO activity feeds\n- NO \"you might also like\"\n- Just search → read → contact → leave\n\n## What's Uncertain (Need Interviews)\n\nWe don't actually know:\n- How coordinators currently search for practitioners\n- What language signals \"depth\" vs. \"surface\" to them\n- Whether institutional vouching matters as much as we think\n- If 2000 characters is too much or too little\n- What their actual risk/decision criteria are\n\n**This means:** The UX I mapped is *informed speculation*, not validated design.\n\n## The Library Metaphor\n\nVX is designing a **library, not a social club**:\n\n- **Library:** Come when you need a book, find it via catalog, librarian vouches for quality, take book and leave, library doesn't email you about new arrivals\n- **Social Club:** Hang out, activity feeds, see and be seen, value from participation\n\nAaron wants a library. The practitioner profiles are books. The institutional vouching is the librarian's recommendation. The \"no notifications\" policy is the library's silence.\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\n1. **Review this with Aaron** - Does it match his vision?\n2. **Interview coordinators** - Extract their actual values (not practitioners')\n3. **Revise the affordances** - Based on what coordinators actually care about\n4. **Prototype & test** - Clickable wireframes to validate assumptions\n5. **Build** - But only after values are validated\n\nThe document I created has:\n- Detailed UX flows\n- Database schema\n- Design validation criteria\n- Questions to ask Aaron\n- Interview plan\n\nBut honestly? The most valuable section is titled **\"What's Still Missing\"** because it names exactly what we don't know yet.\n\n**Don't build this. Interview first.** That's the VX discipline.\n\nWant to walk through any specific section, or ready to plan those coordinator interviews?",
