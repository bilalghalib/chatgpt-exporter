      "content": "Yes, there is an Islamic concept related to deeds being shown to deceased ancestors. A specific hadith mentions that the deeds of descendants may be presented to their deceased relatives. If the deeds are good, the ancestors feel joy and praise Allah, while if they are bad, they may feel grief and pray to Allah for the descendants.\n\nThe hadith is narrated in various collections, and one version is found in **Musnad Ahmad**:\n\n> **“Your deeds are shown to your relatives and ancestors. If they are good, they are pleased with them, and if they are bad, they say: ‘O Allah, do not let them die until You guide them as You guided us.’”**\n\nThis hadith highlights the interconnectedness of family bonds in Islam, even after death, and serves as a reminder to maintain good deeds and righteous behavior to honor and bring joy to one's ancestors. It also reflects the importance of dua and the care of ancestors for their living descendants.",
