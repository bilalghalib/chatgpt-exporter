Market Growth & Expansion (Green)\nThis cluster includes founders focused on bringing their products to market or expanding their reach:\n- Mohamad (GreeNX): Focusing on business growth and finalizing their prototype/MVP\n- Ghinwa (Urban Leaf): Looking to expand market access\n- Siwar: Seeking investment and entering new markets\n- Ehab (Ecobath): Wanting to enter the market strongly\n\nThese founders are at the stage where they're thinking about how to scale their products or services and reach more customers.\n\n### 2. Financial & Business Planning (Blue)\nThis cluster represents founders focused on operational aspects:\n- Rozette (InBalance): Working on financial projections\n- Ezalden (Hello World): Concerned with HR management and pricing\n- Jana (Beaver Ed): Looking to track and report social impact\n\nThese founders are focused on the backbone of their businesses - the financial planning, operational structure, and impact measurement.\n\n### 3. Founder Mindset & Development (Red)\nThis cluster includes founders focused on personal growth and mindset:\n- Louai (Courssaty): Concerned with founder mindset and facing struggles\n- You: Focused on consistent bravery\n- Clara (Little Stars): Working toward achieving objectives\n- Farah: Driven by making a change\n\nThese founders are working on their personal approach to entrepreneurship and maintaining motivation.\n\nI've also highlighted two special groups:\n- The Parents Hub Team (Orange): Garene and Rania working on the same venture\n- Agriculture Focus (Brown): Ziad's specialized interest in plant cultivation\n\nThe visualization shows potential connections between clusters - for instance, founders in the mindset cluster may need to connect with those in the market expansion cluster as they face the challenges of growth.",

Market Growth & Expansion (Green)\nThis cluster includes founders focused on bringing their products to market or expanding their reach:\n- Mohamad (GreeNX): Focusing on business growth and finalizing their prototype/MVP\n- Ghinwa (Urban Leaf): Looking to expand market access\n- Siwar: Seeking investment and entering new markets\n- Ehab (Ecobath): Wanting to enter the market strongly\n\nThese founders are at the stage where they're thinking about how to scale their products or services and reach more customers.\n\n### 2. Financial & Business Planning (Blue)\nThis cluster represents founders focused on operational aspects:\n- Rozette (InBalance): Working on financial projections\n- Ezalden (Hello World): Concerned with HR management and pricing\n- Jana (Beaver Ed): Looking to track and report social impact\n\nThese founders are focused on the backbone of their businesses - the financial planning, operational structure, and impact measurement.\n\n### 3. Founder Mindset & Development (Red)\nThis cluster includes founders focused on personal growth and mindset:\n- Louai (Courssaty): Concerned with founder mindset and facing struggles\n- You: Focused on consistent bravery\n- Clara (Little Stars): Working toward achieving objectives\n- Farah: Driven by making a change\n\nThese founders are working on their personal approach to entrepreneurship and maintaining motivation.\n\nI've also highlighted two special groups:\n- The Parents Hub Team (Orange): Garene and Rania working on the same venture\n- Agriculture Focus (Brown): Ziad's specialized interest in plant cultivation\n\nThe visualization shows potential connections between clusters - for instance, founders in the mindset cluster may need to connect with those in the market expansion cluster as they face the challenges of growth.",

This format organizes the information in a structured grid layout that should be much easier to read.\n\nThe visualization includes:\n\n1. **Market Growth & Expansion Cluster** (Green)\n   - Mohamad (GreeNX): Business growth & MVP development\n   - Ehab (Ecobath): Enter market strong\n   - Ghinwa (Urban Leaf): Expanding market access\n   - Siwar: Investment & new market entry\n\n2. **Financial & Business Planning Cluster** (Blue)\n   - Rozette (InBalance): Financial projections\n   - Ezalden (Hello World): HR & pricing\n   - Jana (Beaver Ed): Social impact tracking\n\n3. **Founder Mindset & Development Cluster** (Red)\n   - Louai (Courssaty): Founder mindset\n   - You: Consistent bravery & personal resilience\n   - Clara (Little Stars): Achieving objectives\n   - Farah: Making change & social impact\n\n4. **Special Groups**:\n   - Parents Hub Team (Yellow): Garene (confident about offering) and Rania (marketing strategy)\n   - Agriculture Focus (Light Green): Ziad (Breeze Spring) focusing on olive tree planting\n\nThe visualization also includes some potential connection opportunities between different clusters, highlighting how founders with complementary focuses might benefit from collaborating.\n\nIs this format working better for you? Would you like me to adjust anything about the organization or information presented?",
